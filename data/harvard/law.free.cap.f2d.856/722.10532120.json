On defendant\u2019s petition, the action was removed on the basis of diversity of citizenship to the Federal District Court for the Western District of Louisiana. Defendant then filed a motion for summary judgment, asserting that it was immune from tort liability under Louisiana\u2019s \u201cstatutory employer\u201d doctrine. Plaintiff filed a cross-motion for partial summary judgment on the same issue. The district court granted defendant\u2019s motion. We conclude that the district court was correct in holding that the contract work that plaintiff was performing at the time of his injury was part of defendant\u2019s \u201ctrade, business or occupation\u201d so that plaintiffs exclusive remedy is Worker\u2019s Compensation. Specifically, we agree with the district court that it was appropriate in this case to determine the scope of defendant\u2019s trade, business or occupation with reference to its operations as a whole, rather than looking only at the Mansfield plant. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-14\">The underlying facts in this case are essentially undisputed. Mr. Mozeke, an employee of Brown &amp; Root (\u201cB &amp; R\u201d), was injured in October of 1985 while working as a helper first class at the International Paper Company (\u201cIPCO\u201d) mill at Mansfield, Louisiana.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-15\">The accident occurred while Mr. Mozeke was assisting two other B &amp; R employees in setting up a scaffold inside of a digester \u2014a large container used to \u201ccook\u201d wood chips to create pulp for the paper manufacturing process. The scaffold is constructed so that workers can move up and down inside of the digester to clean and make repairs. A piece of \u201cscale\u201d fell from the digester, striking Mr. Mozeke on the head and shoulder.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-16\">IPCO retained B &amp; R to perform maintenance work on equipment at its Mansfield plant. While IPCO employees performed similar tasks, including the cleaning and inspection of digesters, at IPCO\u2019s other plants, they did not perform maintenance work at the Mansfield plant. IPCO did, however, provide B &amp; R with the tools and equipment necessary to carry out the maintenance work at the Mansfield mill.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-17\">The parties filed cross motions for summary judgment on the issue whether IPCO was Mozeke\u2019s statutory employer under Louisiana Revised Statutes, section 23:1061. La.Rev.Stat.Ann. sec. 23:1061 (West 1985 &amp; Supp.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b817-18\">Section 1061 provides that any person (the principal) who contracts with another (the contractor) to perform work that is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>part of the principal's trade, business or occupation will be liable under the Worker\u2019s Compensation statute to the contractor\u2019s employees as if the principal were the direct employer of the injured employee. <em>Id. </em>A principal may assert as a defense to a tort action that it is a \u201cstatutory employer\u201d under section 1061. If the principal is found to be the plaintiff\u2019s statutory employer, the plaintiff\u2019s exclusive remedy is Worker\u2019s Compensation, and the principal is therefore immune from tort liability. La.Rev.Stat.Ann. sec. 23:1032 (West 1985 &amp; Supp.1988) (exclusivity of Worker\u2019s Compensation); <em>Seeney v. Citgo Petroleum Corp., </em>848 F.2d 664, 666 (5th Cir.1988); <em>Forno v. Gulf Oil Corp., </em>699 F.2d 795, 796 (5th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">The district court granted summary judgment for IPCO, holding that IPCO was, as a matter of law, Mozeke\u2019s statutory employer. Applying the three-part analysis set forth in <em>Berry v. Holston Well Service, Inc., </em>488 So.2d 934 (La.1986), the trial court concluded (1) that the contract work performed by B &amp; R was not specialized per se, (2) that the work at issue was part of IPCO\u2019s trade, business or occupation because the work was routine and customary, IPCO had the personnel and equipment to perform the work itself, and it was common within the industry for manufacturers to perform such work in-house, rather than contracting with an outside business, and (3) that IPCO itself was engaged in the contract work at the time of the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">Mozeke filed timely notice of appeal from the district court\u2019s entry of summary judgment for IPCO. Mozeke argues that the trial court erred in its application of the <em>Berry </em>standard, and that under proper application of the standard, he is entitled to summary judgment in his favor. Alternatively, Mozeke argues that summary judgment is inappropriate because there are genuine issues of material fact that must be resolved by the trial court. We will begin our consideration of these arguments by setting forth the standards under which we will review the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-7\">On appeal from a summary judgment, we must review the district court\u2019s decision by examining the record under the same standard that governs a district court\u2019s initial determination under Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). <em>Walker v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>853 F.2d 355, 358 (5th Cir. 1988); <em>Brooks, Tarlton, Gilbert, Douglas &amp; Kressler v. United States Fire Ins. Co., </em>832 F.2d 1358, 1364 (5th Cir.1987); <em>Reid v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>784 F.2d 577, 578 (5th Cir. 1986). We may therefore affirm a summary judgment only if \u201cwe are convinced, after an independent review of the record, that \u2018there is no genuine issue as to any material fact\u2019 and that the movant is \u2018entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Walker, </em>853 F.2d at 358; <em>Reid, </em>784 F.2d at 1364.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-8\">Deciding whether summary judgment is appropriate is a \u201cthreshold inquiry\u201d to determine whether a trial is necessary: \u201c[Wjhether, in other words, there are any genuine factual issues that properly can be resolved only by a finder of fact because they may reasonably be resolved in favor of either party.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, </em>477 U.S. 242, 250, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 2511, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). In reviewing the facts, we must draw all inferences in the manner most favorable to the nonmoving party. <em>Reid, </em>784 F.2d at 578. If we then conclude that \u201cthere is sufficient evidence favoring the nonmoving party for a jury to return a verdict for that party,\u201d summary judgment will not lie. <em>Anderson, </em>477 U.S. at 248, 106 S.Ct. at 2510.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-9\">While it is not our function at the summary judgment stage to resolve disputed issues of fact, <em>id. </em>at 249, 106 S.Ct. at 2510-11, we will subject the legal questions raised by the parties to full appellate review if the disposition on summary judgment turns solely on questions of law. <em>Brooks, </em>832 F.2d at 1364. Since this case was removed to a federal forum on the basis of diversity of citizenship, we sit as an <em>Erie </em>court, and must apply Louisiana law, attempting to rule as a Louisiana court would if presented with the same issues. <em>Walker, </em>853 F.2d at 358-59.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>In this case, the district court held that as a matter of Louisiana law, IPCO was Mozeke\u2019s statutory employer. Applying the standard of review outlined above, we conclude that the district court was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-4\">The primary purpose of the statutory employment doctrine, codified in section 1061, is to determine whether the contractor is \u201can independent business enterprise, rather than a mere intermediary interposed\u201d to limit the principal\u2019s responsibility for Worker\u2019s Compensation. <em>Berry, </em>488 So.2d at 938 (citing <em>Williams v. Shell Oil, </em>677 F.2d 506, 508 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 1087, 103 S.Ct. 570, 74 L.Ed.2d 933 (1982)). <em>Berry </em>is the controlling Louisiana case for determining when the statutory employer defense will apply in a tort action. <em>Seeney, </em>848 F.2d at 666.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\"><em>Berry </em>sets forth a three-level analysis to determine whether a principal is the statutory employer of a contractor\u2019s employees: First, the court must determine whether the contract work is specialized or nonspe-cialized. This is a factual inquiry to determine whether the level of skill, training and experience required to perform the work at issue is not ordinarily possessed by workers outside the contract field. If the contract work is determined to be specialized per se, then, as a matter of law, it is not part of the principal\u2019s trade, business or occupation.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">If the contract work is not specialized per se, the court must engage in a second inquiry: a comparison of the contract work with the principal\u2019s trade, business or occupation to determine whether the contract work could be considered a part of the principal\u2019s own trade or business. Finally, the court must determine whether the principal was itself engaged in the contract work at the time of the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-8\">Applying the <em>Berry </em>test to the instant case, we hold that the district court correctly found that the contract work performed by B &amp; R was not specialized per se. As the district court noted, <em>Berry </em>states that a \u201csub-species of the specialty inquiry\u201d is whether the principal\u2019s own employees are capable of performing the contract work. 488 So.2d at 938. Since the skill, education and experience necessary to perform the contract work is possessed by personnel in the paper manufacturing business in general, and by IPCO\u2019s employees at other plants, we cannot reasonably conclude that the contract work was specialized per se.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-9\">Plaintiff urges a contrary conclusion, arguing first, that two of the classes of craftsmen employed by B &amp; R \u2014 pipefitters and welders \u2014 are in fields that Louisiana appellate courts have previously held to be specialized per se.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As this court has noted, however, the specialty inquiry must be made on a factual, case by case basis. <em>Seeney, </em>848 F.2d at 666. Moreover, in describing specialty cases, the Louisiana Supreme Court focused on the fact that the principal\u2019s own employees were not capable of performing the contract work. <em>Berry, </em>488 So.2d at 939 (discussing <em>Rowe v. Northwestern Nat\u2019l Ins. Co., </em>471 So.2d 226, 228 (La.1985) and <em>Benson v. Seagraves, </em>436 So.2d 525 (La.1983)); <em>see also Recatto v. Bayou Steel Corp., </em>508 So.2d 877, 880-81 (La.App. 5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b819-10\">In <em>Recatto, supra, </em>the court emphasized that the plaintiff admitted that he possessed no \u201cspecial trade skills\u201d beyond those of the principal\u2019s own electricians. <em>Id. </em>at 880. Similarly, Dell Young, B &amp; R\u2019s \u201cArea Manager\u201d for pulp and paper maintenance work, acknowledged in his deposition that the work B &amp; R employees performed at the Mansfield plant was no dif<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>ferent from that performed by IPCO\u2019s own employees at other plants.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">Plaintiff argues finally, that B &amp; R\u2019s work is specialized because the \u201cmaintenance field\u201d involves the specialized task of assembling a large work force with the skills necessary to meet employers\u2019 needs. Louisiana courts have never recognized the \u201cmaintenance field,\u201d as it is characterized by plaintiff, as a specialty field. Indeed, the <em>Berry </em>court repeated the established rule in Louisiana law that general maintenance and repair work, such as B &amp; R performed for IPCO, is <em>not </em>specialty work. 488 So.2d at 938.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">Since the contract work is not specialized per se, the next inquiry under <em>Berry </em>is whether the contract work is nevertheless part of IPCO\u2019s trade, business or occupation. The overriding question is \u201cwhether the contract work is, <em>in that business, </em>normally carried on through employees rather than independent contractors.\u201d <em>Berry, </em>488 So.2d at 938 (emphasis in original). The <em>Berry </em>court outlined three elements to assist in this determination: (1) is the contract work routine and customary? (2) does the principal have the equipment and/or manpower so that it is capable of performing the work itself? and (3) what is the practice in the industry relative to the contract work? <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">As noted above, the <em>Berry </em>court reiterated the rule that \u201cgeneral maintenance and repair work, which by [its] very nature allow[s] the smooth and continued operation of the principal\u201d is considered to be routine and customary. <em>Id. </em>The district court correctly found that the maintenance and repair work being performed by B &amp; R at the time of the accident was regular and predictable and necessary for the smooth and continued operation of the plant. Mr. Young testified in his deposition that the cleaning and inspection of digesters was part of a routine maintenance program and occurred on a regularly scheduled basis. This assertion is further supported by the affidavits of IPCO personnel employed at the Mansfield plant and at three other IPCO mills. Even reading the evidence in the light most favorable to plaintiff, we can find no evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude that the work performed by B &amp; R was not routine and customary.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-8\">The record similarly contains undisputed evidence that IPCO provided the equipment necessary for B &amp; R to perform its maintenance and repair work at the Mansfield plant, and that IPCO personnel at the other Louisiana plants were capable of performing the same work that B &amp; R employees performed at the Mansfield plant. IPCO employees did not, however, perform maintenance work at the Mansfield plant. Plaintiff\u2019s contention that the court should look only at the practice of the Mansfield plant, and not at IPCO\u2019s other operations, is addressed in detail below.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-9\">The evidence of industry practice is also clear. Mr. Young testified that only a very few paper manufacturers nationwide engage contractors to perform all of their routine maintenance and repair work. A few more manufacturers engage contractors to supplement their own work force for especially large or urgent maintenance tasks. The depositions and affidavits evidence, however, that in the paper manufacturing industry, maintenance work of the type performed by B &amp; R is customarily performed in-house.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-10\">Plaintiff maintains nevertheless that there is a \u201ctrend\u201d in the industry to engage contractors for this work. As the district court noted, the evidence of industry practice presented in the depositions (Mr. Young testified that B &amp; R\u2019s contracts to perform \u201ctotal maintenance\u201d had increased from three to seven between 1983 and 1987) is hardly sufficient to constitute a \u201ctrend.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b820-11\">We hold that the district court was correct in its application of this prong of the <em>Berry </em>test: a reasonable jury could only conclude that the contract work is, in the paper manufacturing business, \u201cnormally carried on through employees rather than independent contractors.\u201d <em>Berry, </em>488 So.2d at 938.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-12\">The final inquiry under <em>Berry </em>is whether IPCO was itself engaged in the contract work at the time the accident occurred. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>This last inquiry presents the only serious obstacle to finding that IPCO was Mo-zeke\u2019s statutory employer. The issue is not, however, one of material fact. Rather, it is a question of the proper interpretation of the legal standard which must be applied to a set of undisputed facts.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b821-4\">Neither party disputes the evidence presented in depositions and affidavits that at IPCO plants other than the Mansfield plant, IPCO employees performed the same work that B &amp; R employees performed at the Mansfield plant. The dispute arises because plaintiff argues that the court should look only to the situation at the Mansfield plant, and not to the activities of other IPCO plants.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">In a case involving nearly identical facts, this court held that \u201c[w]here work is customarily performed by the principal\u2019s, own employees as an integral operation of its business, the circumstances that a particular one of its several plants chooses instead independent contractors to perform such maintenance work, without more, does not change the work\u2019s characterization as part of the principal\u2019s trade, business, or occupation.\u201d For<em>no, </em>699 F.2d at 797; <em>see also Hodges v. Exxon Corp., </em>727 F.2d 450, 454 (5th Cir.1984) (even if principal\u2019s employees had never performed turnaround work on the reactor where the accident occurred, summary judgment was appropriate because evidence was undisputed that principal\u2019s own employees did perform similar maintenance work on other reactors).</p>\n<p id=\"b821-7\">We are not free to reach a decision contrary to our holding in <em>Fomo, </em>unless <em>Berry </em>demands a different result.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Plaintiff reads the last prong of the <em>Berry </em>test as requiring that the principal be engaged in the contract work at the particular plant in question. While the <em>Berry </em>court did abandon the \u201cintegral operation\u201d test referred to in <em>Forno, </em>488 So.2d at 937, we find no indication that the Louisiana court intended to require the parsing of a principal\u2019s enterprise in the fashion proposed by plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-8\"><em>Berry </em>requires that a <em>particular principal </em>must itself be engaged in the contract work at the time of injury in order for the work to be considered part of the principal\u2019s trade, business or occupation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The effect of the rule is to make the practice of an individual principal controlling over custom: \u201cAlthough the contract work may customarily be considered part of a principal\u2019s trade, business or occupation, if at the time of the alleged injury the principal had no employees doing work similar to the contract work, then the contract work will not be considered part of the principal\u2019s trade, business or occupation as of the time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>of injury.\u201d <em>Palmer v. Loyola Univ., </em>496 So.2d 421, 423 (La.App. 4th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">Thus, after <em>Berry, </em>a particular principal who elects to engage a contractor, cannot rely solely on the practices of others in the industry to support a statutory employer defense. It does not follow, however, from the reduced emphasis on industry practice, that a court should splinter the principal\u2019s business enterprise into discrete geographic units for purposes of this inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">Ultimately, plaintiffs argument goes not to the <em>Berry </em>test, but to the definition of \u201cprincipal\u201d as it is used in section 1061. Since the Louisiana court has identified the activities of the \u201cprincipal\u201d as the focus of the inquiry, we must determine who the principal is in order to determine which activities are appropriately within the scope of the court\u2019s inquiry.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">In section 23:1032, \u201cprincipal\u201d is defined as \u201cany person who undertakes to execute any work which is part of his trade, business or occupation in which he was engaged at the time of the injury, or which he had contracted to perform and contracts with any person for the execution thereof.\u201d La.Rev.Stat.Ann. sec. 23:1032 (West 1985 &amp; Supp.1988). Thus, the \u201cprincipal\u201d is in the first instance the \u201cperson\u201d who executes a contract for the performance of the work at issue. It is only after defining the relevant entity that a court can determine whether the contract work is a part of that entity\u2019s trade, business or occupation.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-7\">The principal in this case is IPCO, not IPCO\u2019s Mansfield plant. IPCO, the New York corporation, contracted with B &amp; R for the performance of \u201cplanned and emergency equipment maintenance, routine facilities maintenance, turnaround, miscellaneous construction and other related services at COMPANY\u2019S Mansfield Mill located near Mansfield, Louisiana.\u201d Since IPCO, the corporation, is the \u201cperson\u201d who executed the contract, it is the \u201cprincipal\u201d as that term is defined by the statute. The plain language of <em>Berry </em>therefore requires that we look to the activities of IPCO as a whole to determine whether the contract work was part of its trade, business or occupation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b822-10\">Given the undisputed evidence that IPCO employees at other plants performed maintenance work identical to that performed by B &amp; R\u2019s employees at the Mansfield plant, before, during, and after the time of Mr. Mozeke\u2019s injury, the district court properly held that IPCO met the last prong of the <em>Berry </em>test. The district court was therefore correct in its holding that as a matter of law, IPCO was Mr. Mozeke\u2019s statutory employer. Plaintiff\u2019s exclusive remedy is Worker\u2019s Compensation, and IPCO is therefore immune from tort liability-</p>\n<p id=\"b822-11\">ill.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-12\">For the foregoing reasons, we find that the district court was correct in granting summary judgment for IPCO. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b819-7\">. To the extent that plaintiff relies on <em>Roberts v. Amstar Corp., </em>496 So.2d 1146 (La.App. 4th Cir.1986) (pipefitting specialized per se), we note that the district court was correct in questioning <em>Roberts\u2019 </em>interpretation of the <em>Berry </em>test. We noted in <em>Seeney, </em>848 F.2d at 666-67, that <em>Roberts </em>was inconsistent with decisions of the Louisiana Supreme Court emphasizing the importance of case by case evaluation of the specialty inquiry, and concluded that the Louisiana Supreme Court would not rule that pipefitting was specialized per se.</p>\n<p id=\"AIY\">The district court properly distinguished another case on which plaintiff relies, <em>Miller v. Atlantic Richfield Co., </em>499 So.2d 1095 (La.App. 3d Cir.) (welding specialized per se), <em>writ denied, </em>501 So.2d 198 (La.1986), on the grounds that the <em>Miller </em>court emphasized that ARCO employed no welders of its own.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b821-9\">. Plaintiff claims that there is a genuine issue of material fact on this point because it is not clear from the evidence whether IPCO retains any maintenance crew of its own at the Mansfield plant. Defendant, however, does not rest its argument on this point. Moreover, since we conclude that as a matter of law, it is appropriate to look at all of IPCO\u2019s operations, that issue is not material to this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b821-10\">. In the only Fifth Circuit case to apply the <em>Berry </em>test, the court touched only briefly on this issue. <em>Seeney, </em>848 F.2d at 668. The court held that the final prong of the <em>Berry </em>test did not require that the principal\u2019s employees must have been working side by side with the contractor\u2019s employees, but only that the principal\u2019s employees \"must have been performing the contract work somewhere on the premises at the time of the accident.\" <em>Id. </em>We believe that the panel in <em>Seeney </em>intended only to respond to the factual context of that case \u2014 the principal\u2019s employees had temporarily been diverted from work on the unit where the accident occurred \u2014 and did not mean to impose a new requirement that the principal's employees must in all cases be performing the contract work on the same premises as the contractor\u2019s employees. Such a holding would be inconsistent with <em>Fomo </em>and, as illustrated above, is not required by <em>Berry.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b821-12\"><em>. Berry </em>cites <em>Lewis v. Exxon Corp., </em>441 So.2d 192, 198 (La.1983) for this requirement. In <em>Lewis, </em>the court found that Exxon had made a deliberate decision to cease doing the type of construction work that was the subject of the contract. The court held that even though Exxon personnel were still capable of performing the contract work, the company could not rely on its past practices to assert that the contract work was part of its trade, business or occupation. 441 So.2d at 199.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-13\">If the Mansfield facility is treated as an independent entity for purposes of the <em>Berry </em>analysis, then the decision to engage a contractor at the Mansfield plant would be analogous to Exxon\u2019s decision to abandon the performance in-house of certain tasks. Thus, for purposes of section 1061, IPCO would not have been engaged in the enterprise at the time the injury occurred.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b822-8\">. Certainly the Louisiana court <em>could </em>hold that the inquiry should focus on the principal\u2019s activities at a particular facility. Absent any clear indication that this result was intended, however, we must accept at face value the Louisiana Supreme Court's statement that a court should look to the activities of the \"principal.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b822-22\">. We do not express any opinion about the analysis that would be required if a large business enterprise separately incorporated its individual plants so that the contracting entity was a subsidiary of a larger parent corporation. That issue is not before this court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
