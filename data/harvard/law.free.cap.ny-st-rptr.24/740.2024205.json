Crocker on Sheriffs, section 452. The Code prescribes the mode of levying on contract debts, or choses in action, under process of attachment (section 648, <em>et seq), </em>but contains no such provision for a levy on such interests upon execution, probably for the reason that the judgment creditor has a more summary and effectual remedy by supplementary proceedings to examine the party owing the debt to the debtor (Code, section 2441), and by obtaining an order permitting the third person to pay over such debt to the sheriff, to be applied on account of the execution, (Code, section 2449.) The plaintiff failed to pursue this statutory remedy on his judgment, and the attaching creditors pursued theirs under sections 648, 649 <em>(supra), </em>and by force of their proceedings the $339.59 reached the sheriff for their benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-11\">The execution created no lien on this sum while in the hands of R. J. Dean &amp; Co., and none could be created thereon, except under section 2441, which was not put into use by the judgment-creditor. The service of the attachments created a lien thereon, by force of sections 648, 649, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>which cannot be divested by the judgment-creditor. The money now in the hands of the sheriff is applicable to the attachment under which it was received. The attachments put the fund in his hands, and it cannot be diverted from the purpose for which it was paid in.</p>\n<p id=\"AZqr\">If the fund in the sheriff\u2019s hands had arisen from a sale of real or personal property of a character that was liable to seizure upon execution, as well as upon attachment, a different conclusion might have been arrived at, but as the equitable interest levied upon could not have been taken by the sheriff under <em>the </em>plaintiff\u2019s execution without an order, under section 2449 <em>(supra; </em>Crocker on Sheriffs, <em>supra), </em>it is clear that the money in the hands of the sheriff derived through an entirely different course of procedure, instituted by others for their benefit, cannot be made to enure to the advantage of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-3\">For these reasons, the order appealed from, must be affirmed, with costs. _</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
