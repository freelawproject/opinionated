Briggs, and subsequently obtained judgment on that action for \u00a7218.13, and an execution issued thereon was returned wholly unsatisfied.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b923-8\">On May 24, 1888, plaintiff obtained an order from Hon.

Briggs, appeared before the referee, and were both examined as witnesses. They both testified that $1,000 had been paid by the defendant to Amos S. Briggs, under the agreement dated March 1, 1888, as above stated. Whereupon the county court made an order appointing George C. Andrews, receiver of the defendant, and directed Amos 8. Briggs to pay the sum of $267, the amount of the debt, disbursements and costs in this action, to the receiver. From this order, Amos 8. Briggs appealed, and at a special term of the supreme court, held at White Plains, in Westchester county, December 15, 1888, it was ordered that the said order of the said county judge be vacated. From this order the plaintiff appealed to the general term of the supreme court'.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b923-10\"><em>Henry C.

Briggs for his future support, is absolutely void as against appellant\u2019s claim. 2 R. 8., 135, \u00a7 1 (7th ed.), p. 2327; <em>McLean </em>v. <em>Button. </em>19 Barb., 450; <em>Goodrich </em>v. <em>Downs, </em>6 Hill, 438; <em>Curtis </em>v. <em>Leavitt, </em>15 N.

The county judge had authority to make the order. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>Amos S. Briggs held $1,000 of defendant\u2019s money under a void agreement.

Briggs.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b924-5\">Pratt, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aomv\">It is clear that the agreement between the defendant, and A. S. Briggs, except, so far as the same paid an existing debt, was void. There was no question of intent involved, and no dispute about the facts. There was more than sufficient money to pay the judgment in the hands of A. S. Briggs, belonging to the judgment debtor, and the order of the county judge was, therefore, right. Had A. S. Briggs made any claim to the money, other than under an agreement, void upon its face, a suit would have been necessary to determine the rights of the parties, but under the facts proved, it must be deemed that the judgment debtor had so much money on deposit in the hands of A. S. Briggs, subject to the claims of his creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-6\">It is well settled that where an instrument is absolutely void as to creditors, it is no protection as against them in a proceeding to acquire a lien on the property conveyed. <em>Keller </em>v. <em>Paine, </em>107 N. Y., 83; 11 N. Y. State Rep., 33; <em>Chautauqua Bank </em>v. <em>Risley, </em>19 <em>N. </em>Y, 369.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-7\">By the same reasoning, if the agreement between the debtor and A. S. Briggs was void, and furnished no protection, then the money paid under it was subject to the order of the county judge in the supplementary proceedings. _</p>\n<p id=\"b924-8\">_ That such an agreement is void, as against creditors, scarcely requires the mention of any authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-9\">If these views are correct, they dispose of all questions in this proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-10\">Order reversed, but without costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-11\">All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
