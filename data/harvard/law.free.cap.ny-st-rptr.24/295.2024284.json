It seems to have been denied upon the ground that the defendant pleaded a counter-claim, but there is nothing in thi's circumstance which precluded the plaintiff from having his application granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-16\">There are reported cases holding that a discontinuance should not be allowed where a counter-claim was interposed, but these were owing to peculiar circumstances. Some held that the discontinuance should not be allowed where the counter-claim was admitted by the plaintiff, or where the application for leave to discontinue was made after the time to reply had expired, or in cases where the statute of limitations would run against the counter-claim, in case the discontinuance was allowed, and in order to prevent this result, it was deemed inequitable to allow a discontinuance, but the objection, last suggested, has been obviated by an amendment to section 412 of the Code of Civil Procedure, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>which saves such counter-claim, from the operation of the statute. So that it may now be laid down as a rule applicable to all cases, that the plaintiff may, at any time, discontinue his action, on paying the defendant\u2019s taxable costs to the date of discontinuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-3\">See cases cited in 2 Rumsey\u2019s Pr., 155; <em>Matter of Butler, 101 </em>N. Y., <em>307. </em>It follows that the order appealed from should be reversed, with costs, and the motion for leave to discontinue, on payment of costs, granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
