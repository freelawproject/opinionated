It is a plain and concise statement of the fact of the injury and the way it was caused, with an allegation of the negligence of the defendant. It is difficult to see how the facts could be more clearly and concisely stated, unless the particular circumstances showing the conduct of the defendant\u2019s servants are required to be given, and such circumstances, merely tending to prove the facts, need not be alleged, and have no place in a pleading. <em>Hyatt </em>v. <em>McMahon, 25 </em>Barb., 457; 59 N. Y., 176; 13 Civ. Pro. Rep., 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-15\">On the other proposition, while it may not have been necessary to allege the matter complained of, we agree with Judge Beckwith that the words sought to be stricken out \u201care allegations of the circumstances tending to show the degree of care required on the part of the defendant, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"925\">*925</page-number>and the difficul ties on the part of the plaintiff as affecting the question of negligence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b951-3\">The order appealed from should be affirmed, with ten dollars costs, and disbursements.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-4\">Hatch, J., concurs; Beckwith, Ch. J., not sitting.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
