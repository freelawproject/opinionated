On the trial the jury allowed the counterclaim, and gave the plaintiff a verdict for the difference between it and the claim. The clerk taxed a full bill of costs in favor of the plaintiff, under defendant\u2019s objection, and refused to tax the defendant\u2019s bill, which claimed costs from the time the answer was served. The clerk was right. Tlie counterclaim was used substantially as a payment <em>pro tanto, </em>and if the defendant intended to stop the running of costs, he should have served an offer to allow judgment under section 738 of the Code. The plaintiff did not apply for a severance of the admitted part of the claim (Code, \u00a7 511), and what might have resulted if he had, need not be considered now. Both parties went to trial on the pleadings as originally framed, and it is nothing inore nor- less than a case where the plaintiff sued on contract, and recovered more than fifty dollars, and became entitled as of course to a full bill of costs. Code, \u00a7 3238. It does not fall under any of the exceptions to this rule. Taxation affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
