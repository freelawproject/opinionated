Ro<em>unds </em>v. <em>Del., Lack, and W.R. Co., </em>64 N. Y., 129.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-12\">The defendant also claims that the verdict in favor of plaintiff was against the weight of evidence. Technically speaking, perhaps, this question is not before us, for no motion for new trial on that ground was made. Assuming that it is regularly before us, we see no reason, on the evidence, to disturb the verdict on that ground. This covers the only questions \u00abraised by the appellant\u2019s points.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-13\">In our opinion, the judgment and order appealed from should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-14\">Clement, Ch. J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
