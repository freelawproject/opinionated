Upon the 26th day of December, 1888, said Rawak paid twenty-five dollars of the said claim, and on the twenty-seventh following, fifty dollars more, both payments being made to the plaintiff and without the knowledge of plaintiff\u2019s attorney. Defendant has never appeared, demurred or answered in the action. Plaintiff\u2019s attorneys claim that costs and disbursements had accrued to the amount of sixteen dollars before said payments were made, which said defendant refuses to pay. The plaintiff is abundantly able to pay these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>costs. The plaintiff\u2019s attorneys claim the right to enter judgment upon defendant\u2019s failure to appear or answer, and have execution thereon for the collection of the said costs, which right the defendant Bawak denies, and agrees upon the statement of facts, for submission to the court for its direction in the premises.

Pr., 210, note; <em>Owen v. Mason, </em>18 How. Pr., 156.) If the defendants had appeared and pleaded the payment, and the plaintiffs had proceeded to trial on the issue, the plea would have defeated the action. <em>Rice </em>v. <em>Childs, </em>28 Hun, 303; <em>Reimer </em>v. <em>Doerge, </em>61 How. Pr., 142. Upon receiving such a plea, the plaintiff\u2019s attorneys could have obviated its effect and protected their lien, by obtaining an order permitting them to prosecute the action for the enforcement of said lien (24 Hun, 182; 1 Bliss\u2019s Code, 50, note c), which is in no way affected by the settlement made by the parties. Code, \u00a7 66.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">All the plaintiff\u2019s attorneys would have to prove would be a, cause of action in their client at the time the suit was commenced. Their lien attached to that, and was not impaired by what the parties themselves did afterward. The defendants being in default, it will not be opened except on payment of \u2022 all costs to date <em>(Dietz </em>v. <em>McCallum, </em>44 How. Pr., 493), on payment of which the plaintiff .will be permitted to discontinue, without costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-9\">These various provisions of the practice work harmoniously together in aid of the general policy of the law to protect an attorney in his lawful costs whenever he invokes its protection against acts of his client operating or tending to operate to his prejudice. The plaintiff\u2019s attorneys are, therefore, clearly entitled to their costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
