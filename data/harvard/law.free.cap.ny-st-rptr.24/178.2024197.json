I think the use of this property by the plaintiff is that of an alms-house, as defined by the court of appeals in the case of <em>Association </em>v. <em>Mayor, </em>104 N. Y., 587; 12 N. E. Rep., 279, and that it was exempt, on that ground, from taxation. I think, therefore, plaintiff is entitled to judgment declaring the property described exempt from taxation, and that said taxes are illegal and void, and directing the cancellation thereof upon the books and records of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
