Subsequently, in January. 1885, the defendant obtained from plaintiff a lease for a further term of one year, from May 1, 1885, which instrument contained a covenant by the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>ant, that he would make all repairs, and keep the premises in the condition required by the health department of New York city. Each lease contained a provision that, at the expiration of the term, the tenant would surrender the premises is as good a condition as they were in at the commencement of the term. According to the findings of fact, in the case, the tenant, while in possession under the first, lease, removed certain partitions on the second floor, but did not restore them at the end of the second lease, and the plaintiff replaced them at an expense of $140.74. The referee also finds that the defendant did not surrender the premises at the end of the second lease, in as good a condition as the same were on May 1, 1880, and that plaintiff was. thereby damaged in the sum of $124.28. It is also found that during the second term, the plaintiff was compelled to make repairs to meet the requirements of the board of health, and paid out for that purpose $142.90. For the three items above set forth, and the sum of twenty dollars additional, as to which no point is made by the appellant, the referee rendered judgment in favor ef the plaintiff, and from such judgment the defendant took this appeal.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b330-4\"><em>John Maguire, </em>for app\u2019lt; <em>George M.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ago\">It is claimed by the counsel for the appellant, that the items sued for on the first lease should have been disallowed, for the reason that the acceptance of the second lease should be deemed a surrender of the prior one, and operated as a waiver of the breach of covenant. This claim is adversely decided in the case of <em>McGregor </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>107 N. Y., 511; Judge Finch says (page 517) 12 N. Y. State Rep., 292: <em>\u201cWe </em>are of opinion that the-question of breach in the condition of the premises, should relate to the final and actual surrender, and not be controlled by the legal and technical surrenders occurring along the line.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">The question as to the repairs made by the landlord during-the second lease to meet the requirements of the board of health, was one of fact, and was decided, on conflicting-testimony, in favor of plaintiff. Whether the work called for by the board of health was in the nature of repairs, and to be paid for by the tenant, or whether the work was in the nature of alterations, and to be paid for by the landlord, were also questions of fact, and the decision of the referee thereon is conclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">We do not think that the phrase in the lease \u201c requirements of the health department,\u201d is ambiguous on the facts of this case. The tenant was 4o make repairs, and to keep the premises in such condition as would fully conform to the requirements of the health department. He was duly notified, and failed to make the necessary repairs, and the landlord was compelled to do the same in order to avoid prosecution for the penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>The counsel for the appellant has filed no exceptions to th report of the referee, but we have considered the case as if the proper exceptions had been taken, and find no er 'or.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">Van Wyck, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
