In this case, novel in this jurisdiction, we resolve the issue in favor of the worker. We reverse and reinstate the entitlement to benefits denied by the Division of Employment and Disability Insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-12\">The claimant, Lorraine Goodman, was a shirt-presser at Turi Cleaner\u2019s in Merchantville, Camden County from June 1988 through March 1989. She earned $321 a week. She was fired from her job on March 31 after she failed to report for work because of a plumbing problem, \u201ca major disaster,\u201d at her home. She then filed for unemployment benefits which she started receiving on April 9. While receiving unemployment benefits, claimant took a part-time telemarketing job with JFD <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>of Pennsauken where she started on April 12 with full knowledge by the Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">Claimant was initially eligible for and started receiving the maximum benefit of $193 per week as of April 9. She worked at JFD part-time at $4 per hour for only three weeks. During the weeks ending April 15, 22 and 29, she earned $28, $52 and $16, respectively, at JFD. For the week ending April 22, when she earned $52, her unemployment compensation benefits were reduced from $193 to $179 because she had earned above the permitted maximum that week. Her earnings for the other two weeks during which she worked part-time did not reduce her maximum unemployment benefits of $193.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">Claimant received total benefits of $2,109 over the 11 week period during which she collected benefits, <em>i.e., </em>the week ending April 15 to the week ending June 24. As noted, only during the week ending April 22 when she made $52 was her unemployment compensation benefit reduced, and then by only $14.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">Claimant left her part-time job at JFD late in April because she had to schedule appointments for interviews for full-time work during the morning hours. She had worked at JFD from 9 a.m. to noon. JFD could not schedule her for part-time work at later hours. As claimant put it at her hearing in August 1989:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-8\">Q. What was the reason for that [leaving JFD]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-9\">A. Well, I had set up a few appointments. After calling her two days in one week to tell her that I wouldn\u2019t be in because I had an appointment set up, I felt bad about not you know, not living up to my expectations about coming in, and asked her if she could give me the hours from four on, and she couldn\u2019t. From four o\u2019clock in the evening. That way I wouldn\u2019t lose any appointments that I had set up for looking for a full time job.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-10\">Q. Couldn\u2019t you set up the appointments for the afternoon instead of the morning?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-11\">A. If I had been home in the morning to accept it and arrange for it and by being a telephone service there I couldn\u2019t ask them to call there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-12\">Q. Now my question is couldn\u2019t you have made appointments for jobs in the afternoon instead of the morning?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>A. Well it would be unlikely if I was anxious about a job to tell them what time I could come in you know in the evening, they would think I didn\u2019t want to work. I would suppose.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">The Director of the Division of Employment Disability and Insurance informed claimant on July 24, 1989 that she was not entitled to benefits as of April 9 and was liable for an overpayment in the full amount of all benefits received for the 11 week period, $2,109. The Director had concluded at that time that claimant had voluntarily quit her job at Turi Cleaners without good cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">Claimant appealed the Director\u2019s determination. At the Appeals Tribunal hearing on August 17, 1989, the Appeals Examiner made two determinations. He reversed the Director\u2019s conclusion that claimant was disqualified from receiving any benefits from April 9 under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:21-5(a) because she voluntarily quit her job with Turi Cleaners. However, he affirmed, in large part, the Director\u2019s overall ruling of disqualification by concluding that she had voluntarily quit her part-time job at JFD without good cause attributable to her work. The Appeals Examiner ruled that claimant was therefore ineligible for benefits from April 16 forward. She appealed to the Board of Review which affirmed the Appeals Tribunal. She now appeals to us and we reverse. The Division does not challenge the finding that claimant was qualified for benefits upon getting fired by Turi\u2019s Cleaners.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">The Unemployment Compensation Law (Act), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:21-1 to -24.19, enacted in 1936, \u201crepresents the policy of the State to further the welfare of the people by affording protection against the shocks and rigors of [involuntary] unemployment.\u201d <em>Provident Inst, for Sav. in Jersey City v. Div. of Employ-Sec., </em>32 <em>N.J. </em>585, 590, 161 A.2d 497 (1960). The applicable principles of construction of the Act were summarized recently by the Supreme Court in <em>Yardville Supply Co. v. Board of Review, Dept. of Labor., </em>114 <em>N.J. </em>371, 374, 554 A.2d 1337 (1989). The law is to be construed liberally in favor of allowance of benefits, \u201cin order to further its remedial and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>beneficial purposes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>But because the fund must be protected \u201cagainst claims by those not intended to share in its benefits,\u201d the policy of the law is advanced as well when benefits are denied in improper cases. <em>Id. </em>From these disparate canons, we derive not any essential tension in applicable principles of construction but an overriding purpose that common sense prevail in application of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">Claimant contends that the primary purpose of the Act was frustrated when she was disqualified from unemployment compensation benefits for leaving a part-time job which only marginally affected the amount of her benefits (from $193 to $179) during only one of the three weeks in which she had worked part-time during the 11 total weeks in which she collected benefits. Appellant asserts that the absolute disqualification for a voluntary quit under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:21-5(a)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was meant to apply where a claimant has quit primary employment voluntarily, not where she leaves a subsequently-acquired part-time job.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">Claimant relies on a seemingly uncontradicted line of seven cases from other jurisdictions resolving like disputes under cognate provisions of the statutes of these sister states enacted pursuant to the federal unemployment compensation scheme, a legacy of the social legislation spurred by the Great Depression of the 1930\u2019s. The precise question has never been considered in this State. The purpose of this federally-sponsored program was explained by Chief Justice Burger in <em>California Department of Human Resources v. Java, </em>402 <em>U.S. </em>121, 131-132, 91 <em>S.Ct. </em>1347, 1353-54, 28 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>666, 674 (1971):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>The purpose of the Act [Social Security Act] was to give prompt if only partial replacement of wages to the unemployed, to enable workers \"to tide themselves over, until they get back to their old work or find other employment, without having to resort to relief.\u201d Unemployment benefits provide cash to a newly unemployed worker \u201cat a time when otherwise he would have nothing to spend,\u201d serving to maintain the recipient at subsistence levels without the necessity of his turning to welfare or private charity. Further, providing for \u201csecurity during the period following unemployment\u201d was thought to be a means of assisting a worker to find substantially equivalent employment. The Federal Relief Administrator testified that the Act \u201ccovers a great many thousands of people who are thrown out of work suddenly. It is essential that they be permitted to look for a job. They should not be doing anything else but looking for a job.\u201d Finally, Congress viewed unemployment insurance payments as a means of exerting an influence upon the stabilization of industry.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">These federal-state cooperative unemployment programs are financed in part by grants from the federal government pursuant to the Social Security Act, 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 501-503. <em>Id. </em>at 402 <em>U.S. </em>at 125, 91 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1350, 28 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 670; <em>Pioneer Potato Co. v. Div. of Employment Security, </em>17 <em>N.J. </em>543, 546-547, 111 A.2d 888 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">Our Act does not define \u201cwork\u201d specifically in the context of the total disqualification provisions of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:21\u2014 5(a) (\u201cleft work voluntarily without good cause attributable to such work\u201d). The Board categorically contends that the provision is unqualified and is meant to discourage workers from quitting full-time or part-time jobs under all circumstances. We respect but are not bound by an agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute or its determination on a strictly legal issue, which this is. <em>Mayflower Securities v. Bureau of Securities, </em>64 <em>N.J. </em>85, 93, 312 A.2d 497 (1973); <em>Petition of Adamar of New Jersey, </em>222 <em>N.J.Super. </em>464, 469, 537 A.2d 704 (App.Div.1988); <em>Jaeger v. State, </em>176 <em>N.J.Super. </em>222, 227, 422 A.2d 794 (App.Div:1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">The Act does permit a claimant to work part-time and still collect partial benefits. In this case, for the week ending April 22 when appellant made $52 her benefits were reduced from $193 to $179. The Act provides that an individual \u201cif eligible and unemployed shall be paid an amount equal to his weekly benefit rate less any remuneration paid or payable to him for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>such week in excess of 20% of his weekly rate____\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:21-3(b). The Act mandates that benefits are payable only if a claimant is both eligible and unemployed. The Act statutorily defines \u201cunemployed\u201d and includes therein individuals working in part-time jobs whose remuneration is less than the weekly unemployment benefit rate. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:21-19(m). An individual is \u201celigible\u201d by compliance with the conditions of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:21-4 if not disqualified under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>48:21-5. A claimant acquiring a part-time job, like appellant here, does not destroy her status automatically as unemployed and does not defeat her eligibility for benefits. Only the amount of her benefits are affected.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">We appreciate the need to preserve the fund for qualified and deserving claimants. Indeed, we so stated and ruled to this effect in <em>Zielenski v. Board of Review, </em>85 <em>N.J.Super. </em>46, 203 A.2d 635 (App.Div.1964). There claimant quit his regular welder\u2019s job because it was unsteady; he only had worked one or two days a week in 1963 in the Todd Shipyard in Hoboken. We concluded that \u201cthis did not constitute good cause for giving up this partial employment for no employment at all.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 52, 208 A.2d 635. We said that an \u201cemployee\u2019s reason for leaving his employment must meet the test of ordinary common sense and prudence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In <em>Zielenski, </em>we said that \u201cthis reasoning does not apply where the claimant is gainfully employed and could have continued working until he found a better job.\u201d But in <em>Zielenski, </em>we distinguished the situation in the case now before us where an unemployed claimant, already receiving benefits, may be justified in refusing a job at \u201cmaterially lower wages\u201d because she should have a reasonable opportunity to seek work in line with her demonstrated earning capacity. <em>Id. </em>at 53, 203 A.2d 635. Moreover, in <em>Zielenski </em>there was no proof that claimant could not have looked for suitable work on the three or four days a week when he did not work on his regular, albeit \u201cunsteady,\u201d job. In the case before us, claimant\u2019s testimony clearly established that her low-paying new-found job with JFD was interfering with her search for suitable employ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>ment, and there was no finding to the contrary. There was no such proof in <em>Zielenski.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">We adopt the view of our seven sister states as expressed in the opinions relied upon by claimant. These jurisdictions have determined that the purpose of their unemployment compensation acts are really frustrated when benefits are denied to a claimant who quits a part-time job which had not previously affected the claimant\u2019s statutorily-defined status of unemployed. In each of these cases, a claimant who had met the statutory requirements for receiving benefits because of involuntary discharge from a full-time job was denied unemployment benefits by the agency because of subsequently and voluntarily leaving \u201cwork\u201d or \u201cemployment\u201d at a part-time job. In reversing and reaching a result which allowed these claimants at least partial unemployment benefits despite leaving their part-time job, these courts found that the terms \u201cwork\u201d or \u201cemployment\u201d as used in the absolute disqualification provisions of their state\u2019s unemployment compensation acts were contextually ambiguous and should be judicially interpreted to apply only to the last full-time or steady employment voluntarily left by a claimant.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">For example, in <em>Rodgers v. Department of Employment Security, </em>186 <em>Ill.App.3d </em>194, 134 <em>Ill.Dec. </em>168, 542 N.E.2d 168 (1989), claimant was laid off from her full-time job. Shortly after that she quit her part-time job because she had to relocate. The Illinois appellate court held that she was not totally disqualified from benefits because she voluntarily left her part-time job, saying \u201cthe circumstances surrounding her separation from her part-time position should in no way affect her entitlement to benefits due her as a result of her involuntary layoff.\u201d 134 <em>Ill.Dec. </em>at 168, 542 N.E.2d at 172. The court found the state agency\u2019s interpretation of the act: \u201cliteral and rigid ... impractical, [it] does not serve the Act\u2019s purpose and is unnecessarily harsh.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>In <em>Tomlin v. California Unemployment Ins. Appeals, </em>82 <em>Cal.App.3d </em>642, 147 <em>Cal.Rptr. </em>403 (Ct.App.1978), the court concluded that the disqualifying quit should not relate to the \u201clast employment of <em>any </em>kind prior to the filing of benefits.\u201d <em>Id., </em>147 <em>CalRptr. </em>at 408. It must refer \u201cto significant or regular employment to effectuate the purposes of the act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Benefits could be reduced appropriately but not lost entirely. In <em>Sticka v. Holiday Village South, </em>348 <em>N.W.2A </em>761 (Minn. 1984), the Supreme Court of Minnesota said that \u201csince [appellant] qualified for at least partial benefits when she had part-time work, it makes no sense that on cessation of the part-time work for any reason, she should become disqualified from any and all benefits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 763. <em>See also Stiles v. Coit, </em>285 <em>Ark. </em>212, 686 <em>S.W.2d </em>405 (1985); <em>Gilbert v. Hanlon, </em>214 <em>Neb. </em>676, 335 <em>N. W. </em>2d 548 (1983); <em>Neese v. Sizzler Family Steak House, </em>404 So.2d 371 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1981); <em>Unemployment Compensation Board of Review v. Fabric, </em>24 <em>Pa.Commw. </em>238, 354 A.2d 905 (Commw.Ct.1976). We agree, as these cases suggest, that partial disqualification may occur in an appropriate case.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">In the case before us, the record is clear that claimant was justified in leaving JFD because the part-time job interfered with her search for suitable employment. Moreover, the part-time $4 an hour telemarketing job was not really suitable employment in the circumstances. <em>See Wojcik v. Bd. of Rev., </em>58 <em>N.J. </em>341, 277 A.2d 529 (1971). There a chemical engineer, unable to find engineering work after termination from his engineering job, accepted a full-time position doing general factory work at a substantial reduction in wages. He was forced to voluntarily leave the factory job a month later when the heavy lifting required by the position aggravated a pre-existing back injury. The Supreme Court ruled that the claimant had voluntarily left work without good cause attributable to the work but should not be penalized by loss of unemployment benefits for having left, after a brief period, work he was not required to take in the first place because it was not \u201csuitable\u201d within the meaning of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:21-5(c). <em>Id. </em>at 345, 277 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>529. The Court found that the general factory work was not suitable because of the substantial reduction from prior earnings, inconsistency with prior training and experience, and the risk to his health and safety. <em>Id. </em>at 345, 277 A.2d 529.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">Our Act states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-5\">In determining whether or not any work is suitable for an individual, consideration shall be given to the degree of risk involved to health, safety, and morals, the individuals\u2019s physical fitness and prior training, experience and prior earnings, the individual\u2019s length of unemployment and prospects for securing local work in the individual\u2019s customary occupation, and the distance of the available work from the individual\u2019s residence. <em>[N.J.S.A. </em>43:21\u20145(c)(1).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">Claimant was a full-time shirt-presser with Turi Cleaners at $321 a week. At JFD she worked three hours a day at $4 per hour making telemarketing calls. During the three weeks at JFD, she worked a total of 24 hours. A substantial reduction in salary in itself has been ruled determinative that work is not \u201csuitable\u201d within the meaning of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:21-5(c) and a refusal to accept such a position does not disqualify the individual from unemployment benefits. <em>Johns-Manville v. Bd. of Rev., </em>122 <em>N.J.Super. </em>366, 300 A.2d 572 (App.Div.1973), cited with approval in <em>Goodman v. London Metals Exchange, Inc., </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>19, 37, 429 A.2d 341 (1981). Further, claimant testified that the part-time position interfered with her search for suitable full-time employment. As we conclude that the job at JFD was not \u201csuitable employment\u201d, claimant would not have been required to accept it in the first place.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">The Board\u2019s order is reversed; appellant need not repay the benefits of $2,109.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b587-8\">This section of the statute in pertinent part states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-9\">An individual shall be disqualified for benefits:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-10\">(a) For the week in which the individual has left work voluntarily without good cause attributable to such work, and for each week thereafter until the individual becomes reemployed and works four weeks in employment, which may include employment for the federal government, and has earned in employment at least six times the individual\u2019s weekly benefit rate, as determined in each case.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
