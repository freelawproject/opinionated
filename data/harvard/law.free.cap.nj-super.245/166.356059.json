The trial court merged defendants\u2019 convictions for possession of cocaine with their convictions for possession of cocaine with intent to distribute and committed each of them to the custody of the Commissioner of the Department of Corrections for 20 years with a 10 year period of parole ineligibility. In addition, the trial court assessed against each defendant a $30 Violent Crimes Compensation Board penalty, a $3,000 Drug Enforcement and Demand Reduction penalty, a $50 laboratory fee and suspended their driver\u2019s licenses for six months. Defendants appealed and we consolidated the appeals for purpose of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-11\">Defendant Foreshaw seeks a reversal of his convictions or alternatively, a modification of his sentence on the following grounds set forth in his brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-12\">I.

THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN RULING THAT ARTHUR BROWN\u2019S FOURTH AMENDMENT RIGHTS WERE NOT VIOLATED BY THE SEARCH AND SEIZURE OF THE VEHICLE.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-9\">II. THE SENTENCE IMPOSED WAS MANIFESTLY EXCESSIVE.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-10\">We have carefully considered these contentions and all of the arguments advanced by both defendants in support of them and find that they are clearly without merit. <em>R. </em>2:11-3(e)(2). Further comment is appropriate with respect to some of these contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-12\">\n<em>The Trial Court Properly Denied Defendants\u2019 Motion to Suppress The Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b202-13\">Defendants contend that the trial court erred in denying their motions to suppress the cocaine seized from their motor vehicle without a search warrant. Specifically, Brown argues that the police had sufficient time to obtain a search warrant before stopping the vehicle and, thus, the warrantless search was illegal. Foreshaw claims that the information provided by the confidential informant was deficient for constitutional purposes and was not a proper foundation for a warrantless search.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-14\">According to the State\u2019s proofs, at approximately 3:30 p.m. on the afternoon of August 27, 1987, Sergeant Gregory Buttari of the Camden County Prosecutor\u2019s Office received a tip from a confidential informant that a vehicle had departed the Camden area around 10:00 a.m. that morning for New York City to pick up cocaine and would be returning to Camden at approximately 4:30 p.m. The informant told the officer that the vehicle was a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>silver or gray Eldorado Cadillac with New Jersey license plates and a spare tire mounted on the back. The informant also stated that three people would be inside the car\u2014two Jamaican males and a Spanish female.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">As a result of this information, Sergeant Buttari and Detective Cruz from the Camden City Police Department traveled north on the New Jersey Turnpike as far as Exits 5-6. At that point, they spotted a vehicle traveling southbound on the Turnpike matching the description of the vehicle received from the informant. Sergeant Buttari immediately made a U-turn and pursued the suspect car. As described by the informant, the vehicle was a silver-gray Eldorado Cadillac with a rear mounted spare tire carrying two black males and one Hispanic female. Sergeant Buttari followed the Eldorado to Exit 4 of the Turnpike. The vehicle left the Turnpike at Exit 4 and headed towards the City of Camden. At Exit 4, Sergeant Buttari and Detective Cruz were joined in the pursuit by Investigators Acevedo and Villegas. Sergeant Buttari and the other officers stopped the Eldorado at the Route 130\u2014Airport Circle.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">Sergeant Buttari identified defendant Brown as the driver, Sandra Jackson as the front seat passenger and codefendant Foreshaw as the rear seat passenger. After stopping the Eldorado, the officers removed the three occupants from the car and conducted a search of the vehicle. As a result of the search, the officers found a Garden State Racetrack bag under the driver\u2019s seat that contained 502 grams of cocaine. All three occupants of the car were then placed under arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-9\">\n<em>The Search of the Automobile was Proper.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b203-10\">The fourth amendment protects the \u201cright of people to be secure in their person, houses, papers and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures.\u201d <em>U.S. Const, </em>amend. IV. <em>See N.J. Const, of 19^7 </em>art. 1, \u00b6 7.

Bruzzese, supra, </em>94 <em>N.J. </em>at 217, 463 A.2d 320. Fourth amendment issues are complex and are \u201cpeculiarly dependent upon the facts involved.\u201d <em>State v. Anderson, supra, </em>198 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 348, 486 A.2d 1311. \u201cCommonly, such constitutional issues involve no more than a seasoned \u2018value judgment upon a factual complex rather than an evident application of a precise rule of law.' \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>State v. Funicello, </em>60 <em>N.J. </em>60, 72, 286 A.2d 55, <em>cert. denied sub nom. New Jersey v.

Malik, </em>221 <em>N.J.Super. </em>114, 118, 534 A.2d 27 (App.Div.1987). <em>See State v. Bell, </em>195 <em>N.J.Super. </em>49, 55, 477 A.2d 1272 (App.Div.1984). \u201cThe warrant re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>quirement is predicated upon the premise that the necessity and reasonableness of a search can best be determined \u2018by a neutral and detached magistrate instead of ... [a police] officer engaged in the often competitive enterprise of ferreting out crime.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Malik, supra, </em>221 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 118, 534 A.2d 27 (quoting <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>333 <em>U.S. </em>10, 13-14, 68 <em>S.Ct. </em>367, 369, 92 <em>L.Ed. </em>436, 440 (1948)).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">It is well settled, however, that there are several narrowly tailored exceptions to the warrant requirement. <em>Id. See Horton v. California, </em>495 <em>U.S. </em>\u2014\u2014, \u2014\u2014- n. 4, 110 <em>S.Ct. </em>2301, 2306 n. 4, <em>110 L.Ed.2d </em>112,120 n. 4 (1990); <em>State v.

[t]he touchstone for determining the constitutionality of warrantless searches is one of reasonableness under the circumstances.\u201d). As our Supreme Court expressed in <em>State v. Bruzzese, supra, </em>94 <em>N.J. </em>at 218, 463 A.2d 320:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-7\">Over the years, the United States Supreme Court has developed a number of circumscribed exceptions to the warrant requirement. <em>E.g., New York v. Belton, </em>453 <em>U.S. </em>454, 101 <em>S.Ct. </em>2860, 69 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>768 (1981) (automobile search incident to arrest of occupant); <em>Chimel v. California, </em>[395 <em>U.S. </em>752, 89 <em>S.Ct. </em>2034, 23 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>685 (1969) ] (limited area search incident to custodial arrest); <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 <em>U.S. </em>1, 88 <em>S.Ct. </em>1868, 20 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>889 (1968) (investigatory \u201cstop and frisk\u201d); <em>Warden v. Hayden, </em>387 <em>U.S. </em>294, 87 <em>S.Ct. </em>1642, 1647, 18 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>782 (1967) (search of premises in \u201chot pursuit\u201d of fugitive); <em>Carroll v. United States, </em>267 <em>U.S. </em>132, 45 <em>S.Ct. </em>280, 69 <em>L.Ed. </em>543 (1925) (vehicle search in circumstances where impracticable to secure a warrant). These recognized exceptions are justified on the grounds of reasonableness.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">In contrast to a search based upon a warrant which is presumed to be valid, a warrantless search is presumed to be invalid. <em>State v. Valencia, </em>93 <em>N.J. </em>126, 133, 459 A.2d 1149 (1983). In order to establish the validity of a warrantless search</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-9\">the State must prove the overall reasonableness and validity of the search. The State must demonstrate that failure to secure a written warrant was justified, namely, that the search falls within a judicially cognizable exception to the warrant requirement. It must also show the existence of probable cause to search. <em>State v. Young, </em>87 <em>N.J. </em>132, 141-42 [432 A.2d 874] (1982); <em>State v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number><em>Patino, </em>83 <em>N.J. </em>1, 7 [414 A.2d 1327] (1980); <em>State v. Ercolano, </em>79 <em>N.J. </em>25, 42 [397 A.2d 1062] (1979); <em>State v. Sims, </em>75 <em>N.J. </em>337, 352 [382 A.2d 638] (1978). <em>[State v. Valencia, supra, </em>93 <em>N.J. </em>at 133, 459 A.2d 1149].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">In sum, \u201c[a] police officer may make a warrantless search where there is probable cause to believe evidence will be discovered and he has a reasonable belief that failure to act will result in destruction or removal of evidence.\u201d <em>State v. Sims, </em>75 <em>N.J. 337, </em>355, 382 A.2d 638 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">Under the automobile exception established in <em>Carroll v. United States, </em>267 <em>U.S. </em>132, 45 <em>S.Ct. </em>280, 69 <em>L.Ed. </em>543 (1925), \u201cthe police can stop and search a moving or readily movable vehicle when there is probable cause to believe that the vehicle contains evidence of criminality.\u201d <em>State v. Welsh, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>346, 352, 419 A.2d 1123 (1980). <em>See California v. Carney, </em>471 <em>U.S. </em>386, 390,105 <em>S.Ct. </em>2066, 2068, 85 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>406, 412 (1985); <em>State v. Martin, </em>87 <em>N.J. </em>561, 567, 436 A.2d 96 (1981). \u201cThis exception applies to situations involving parked and unoccupied vehicles encountered by police in public parking lots or on city streets as well as to moving vehicles stopped on the open highway.\u201d <em>State v. Martin, supra, </em>87 <em>N.J. </em>at 567, 436 A.2d 96. There are two reasons for the automobile exception. \u201c \u2018Besides the element of mobility, less rigorous warrant requirements govern because the exception of privacy with respect to one\u2019s automobile is significantly less than that relating to one\u2019s home or office.\u2019 \u201d <em>California v. Carney, supra, </em>471 <em>U.S. </em>at 391, 105 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2069, 85 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 413. \u201cEven in cases where an automobile [is] not immediately mobile, the lesser expectation of privacy resulting from its use as a readily mobile vehicle justifie[s] application of the vehicular exception.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Despite the breadth of the exception, \u201c \u2018[o]nly the prior approval of the magistrate is waived; the search otherwise [must be such] as the magistrate could authorize.\u2019 \u201d <em>California v. Carney, supra, </em>471 <em>U.S. </em>at 394, 105 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2070, 85 L.Ed.2d at 415 (quoting <em>United States v. Ross, </em>456 <em>U.S. </em>798, 823, 102 <em>S.Ct. </em>2157, 2172, 72 L.Ed.2d 572 (1982)). In short, \u201ca warrantless search of a motor vehicle is justifiable ... where police have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>probable cause to believe that the vehicle contains contraband or evidence of criminal activity.\u201d <em>State v. Martin, supra, </em>87 <em>N.J. </em>at 567, 436 A.2d 96.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">In the present case, it is clear that the police officers properly stopped and searched defendants\u2019 vehicle and that none of defendants\u2019 constitutional rights were compromised in the process. Contrary to Brown\u2019s argument, this case fits squarely within the automobile exception. After receiving the informer\u2019s tip, the officers properly corroborated the data provided. Just as the informer had predicted, the officers observed a silver-gray Eldorado bearing New Jersey license plates traveling southbound on the Turnpike. Inside the vehicle were two males and a female. As was also foretold, the vehicle exited the highway at Exit 4 and headed towards Camden. Once the officers established that the informant had been correct, they had probable cause to believe that defendants\u2019 car contained contraband and as such properly stopped and searched the vehicle. <em>State v. Martin, supra, </em>87 <em>N.J. </em>at 567, 436 <em>A.2d </em>96.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">Furthermore, Brown is incorrect in his assertion that the officers had time to secure a warrant before stopping the vehicle. <em>See State v. Bell, supra, </em>195 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 54-55, 477 A.2d 1272. The police could not have obtained a warrant on the strength of the informer\u2019s tip for such did not establish the necessary probable cause. Probable cause only arose when the police conducted their own investigation and verified the informant\u2019s data. <em>State v. Probasco, </em>220 <em>N.J.Super. </em>355, 358, 532 <em>A.2d </em>262 (App.Div.1987). (\u201c[T]he events that the police witnessed after defendant arrived on the scene corroborated much of the informant\u2019s information and thereby bolstered the veracity of all his information. The police could then properly use that information as a basis for probable cause to search defendant\u2019s automobile for drugs.\u201d). Judge Fluharty in the Law Division correctly dismissed Brown\u2019s argument to the contrary, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-8\">And, of course, there would be those who would argue that they should get a warrant, but they\u2019ll clearly indicate that there\u2019s no requirement to get an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>anticipatory warrant and that makes a lot of sense because without the test of the reliability of the factors there really isn\u2019t any basis to get a warrant. You can\u2019t go to a judge and say, Judge, I spoke to somebody that was reliable and this is what they told me but I can\u2019t support anything of what they told me. You don\u2019t get a warrant that way. What you do is you go out and you support by the reliable\u2014by the totality of the circumstances the information that\u2019s supplied and then that gives credibility, credence, reliability if you will to the information supplied. Well, by that time you\u2019re out on the Turnpike you can\u2019t get a warrant at the point and that\u2019s why, very logically, you don\u2019t need anticipatory warrants in a situation like this.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">Brown\u2019s reliance on <em>State v. Williams, </em>168 <em>N.J.Super. </em>352, 403 A.2d 28 (App.Div.1979), is misplaced. In that case, we struck down a warrantless search of a parked automobile because the police had over two hours to obtain a warrant before the search. By contrast, in the instant case, probable cause did not arise until the officers were on the Turnpike and had an opportunity to assess the veracity of the informant\u2019s data. By that time it was no longer possible nor practical to obtain a search warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">\n<em>The Information Received from the Informant was Sufficient to Establish Probable Cause.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">Foreshaw argues that the information supplied to the police by the confidential informant was insufficient to establish probable cause to stop and search the vehicle. We disagree. In <em>Illinois v. Gates, </em>462 <em>U.S. </em>213, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>2317, 76 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>527 (1983), the United States Supreme Court disapproved a technical, non-flexible approach to probable cause in favor of a totality of the circumstances analysis. Under the test laid down by the Supreme Court in that case, a magistrate must \u201cmake a practical, common sense decision whether, given all the circumstances ... including the \u2018veracity\u2019 and \u2018basis of knowledge\u2019 of persons supplying hearsay information, there is a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place.\u201d <em>Illinois v. Gates, supra, </em>462 <em>U.S. </em>at 238, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2332, 76 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 548. <em>See State v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number><em>Novembrino, </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>95, 122 n. 11, 519 A.2d 820 (1987); <em>State v. Probasco, supra, </em>220 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 358, 532 A.2d 262.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">Under the totality of the circumstances approach, \u201cinformation given by an informant whose inherent reliability has not been shown may nevertheless be used to establish probable cause to obtain a search warrant if the informant\u2019s veracity is bolstered by the totality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>State v. Probasco, supra, </em>220 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 358, 532 A.2d 262. Just as the police can use an informant\u2019s data to secure a search warrant, such can be used to support a determination of probable cause in a warrantless search. <em>United States v. Reyes, </em>792 <em>F.</em>2d 536, 539-540 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied </em>479 <em>U.S. </em>855, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>191, 93 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>124 (1986). As was well stated in <em>State v. Probasco, supra, </em>220 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 358, 532 A.2d 262:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-7\">If the observations of police during an investigation may be used to bolster the veracity of an informant\u2019s information offered to establish probable cause to obtain a search warrant, such observations, where the circumstances are exigent, may similarly be used to bolster the veracity of an informant\u2019s information to establish probable cause to conduct a warrantless search.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">It is clear that the police properly relied on the informant\u2019s data in establishing probable cause to conduct the search. As was noted above, the informant gave the police officers detailed information regarding the suspects and their vehicle. Subsequent investigation by the officers revealed that the informant was correct down to the smallest detail. Just as the informant predicted, defendants were riding in a silver-gray Eldorado with a rear spare tire mount and New Jersey license plates. Additionally, the suspect left the Turnpike at the exit indicated by the informant and headed toward Camden. These facts, when taken together with the officers\u2019 years of experience and their investigation of the matter, were sufficient to establish probable cause to search the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-9\">The decision in <em>State v. Probasco, supra, </em>and <em>United States v. Reyes, supra, </em>support the result reached here. In <em>Probasco, </em>we upheld a warrantless search of a motor vehicle based on an informant\u2019s tip. In that case, the police were told by an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>informant of a certain person\u2019s suspected drug activity. The officers investigated the tip, found the individual as indicated by the informant, and stopped and searched the individual\u2019s car. <em>Id. </em>at 356-357, 532 <em>A.</em>2d 262. In support of the search, we explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-5\">The following information supplied by the informant was proved true by events that occurred in Bissey\u2019s presence before he undertook the search in question: defendant\u2019s car arrived at the address provided by the informant at the time he predicted, the vehicle was a maroon Ford, defendant was alone, he is a white male, he stayed only a short time in the building, he appeared to secrete something under the dashboard, he was armed and his driver\u2019s license confirmed that his name is David. Corroboration of all that information provided by the informant gave the police reason to believe that the informant knew defendant would be carrying drugs. The totality of these circumstances provided the police with probable cause to search defendant\u2019s automobile for drugs. <em>[State v. Probasco, supra, </em>220 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 359, 532 A.2d 262],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">Similarly, in <em>United States v. Reyes, supra, </em>the Fifth Circuit upheld a warrantless search of a vehicle based upon an informant\u2019s data and subsequent police inquiry. In <em>Reyes, </em>an informant told police officers that a certain person was in possession of a large quantity of drugs and described the person and the situation in detail. Further police investigation revealed the informant\u2019s data to be correct. As a result the police stopped and searched the suspect\u2019s truck. <em>United States v. Reyes, supra, </em>792 <em>F.2d </em>at 537-538. The court affirmed the denial of defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, noting:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-7\">Since Dixon was able to corroborate the informant\u2019s tip, the government was justified in believing the statement that cocaine was in the Blazer. Moreover, since Dixon personally observed Reyes check out of the motel and pack his belongings into the Blazer, the government could reasonably infer that the cocaine supposedly located in the motel room was transferred into the Blazer. Therefore, when all the information gathered from the informant and Dixon\u2019s personal observations is considered in the light of Dixon\u2019s extensive narcotic investigation experience, we conclude that the authorities had probable cause to believe contraband was inside the Blazer when Reyes exited the Holiday Inn parking lot. <em>[United States v. Reyes, supra, </em>792 F.2d at 540].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">In short, it is clear that on the strength of the informant\u2019s data and their own follow-up investigation, the police officers had probable cause to believe that contraband was present in defendants\u2019 vehicle. In light of the exigent circumstances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>involved here, especially the inherent mobility of the vehicle, the police were justified in stopping and searching the car. Consequently, Judge Fluharty properly denied defendants' motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">\n<em>The Trial Court Properly Denied Defendant Foreshaw\u2019s Motion To Disclose the Identity of the Informant</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AqH\">Foreshaw argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion to compel the disclosure of the confidential informant. Specifically, he contends that because the informant mentioned only Brown\u2019s name to the police, it can be inferred that the informant had relevant information as to the guilt or innocence of the parties and therefore, his identity should have been disclosed. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">The privilege to withhold the identity of an informer is deeply rooted in the common law. State <em>v. Milligan, </em>71 <em>N.J. </em>373, 380, 365 A.2d 914 (1976); <em>State v. Oliver, </em>50 <em>N.J. </em>39, 41, 231 A.2d 805 (1967). Today, the common law rule is codified in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:84A-28 and <em>Evid.R. </em>36 which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-8\">RULE 36. IDENTITY OF INFORMER</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AiE\">A witness has a privilege to refuse to disclose the identity of a person who has furnished information purporting to disclose a violation of a provision of the laws of this State or of the United States to a representative of the State or the United States or a governmental division thereof, charged with the duty of enforcing that provision, and evidence thereof is inadmissible, unless the judge finds that (a) the identity of the person furnishing the information has already been otherwise disclosed or (b) disclosure of his identity is essential to assure a fair determination of the issues. <em>L. </em>1960, c. 52, p. 459, \u00a7 28 <em>[N.J.S.A. </em>2A:84A-28].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-9\">\u201cThe purpose of the privilege is to encourage and secure a flow of vital information which can be had only upon a confidential basis.\u201d <em>State v. Roundtree, </em>118 <em>N.J.Super. </em>22, 30, 285 A.2d 564 (App.Div.1971). <em>See Grodjesk v. Faghani, </em>104 <em>N.J. </em>89, 97, 514 A.2d 1328 (1986). In other words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-10\">The purpose of the privilege is the furtherance and protection of the public interest in effective law enforcement. The privilege recognizes the obligation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>of citizens to communicate their knowledge of the commission of crimes to law-enforcement officials and, by preserving their anonymity, encourages them to perform that obligation. <em>[Roviaro v. United States, </em>353 <em>U.S. </em>53, 59, 77 <em>S. Ct. </em>623, 627, 1 <em>L.Ed.24 </em>639, 644 (1957)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">\u201cAlthough designated the informer\u2019s privilege, the privilege is not that of the informer, but of government \u2018to withhold from disclosure the identity of persons who furnish information of violations of law to officers charged with enforcement of that law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Grodjesk v. Faghani, supra, </em>104 <em>N.J. </em>at 97, 514 A.2d 1328 (quoting <em>Roviaro v. United States, supra, </em>353 <em>U.S. </em>at 58, 77 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 626,1 L.Ed.2d at 644). \u201cThus, it is generally agreed that the informer\u2019s privilege is well established, and its soundness cannot be questioned.\u201d <em>State v. Milligan, supra, </em>71 <em>N.J. </em>at 383, 365 A.2d 914.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">Despite the general acceptance of the privilege, it \u201cis not absolute. Although at common law, disclosure of an informant\u2019s identity may have been within the absolute discretion of the government, it is now well settled that the privilege is subject to important limitations.\u201d <em>Id. See Roviaro v. United States, supra, </em>353 <em>U.S. </em>at 60, 77 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 626, 1 L.Ed.2d at 644-645; <em>State v.

Roundtree, supra, </em>118 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 31, 285 A.2d 564. \u201cThe privilege, which precludes disclosure of the identity of the informer, like all privileges, suppresses the truth. Hence, it must be construed to achieve, not thwart, a just result.\u201d <em>Grodjesk v. Faghani, supra, </em>104 <em>N.J. </em>at 96, 514 A.2d 1328 (citations omitted). As Justice Pashman wrote in <em>State v. Milligan, supra, </em>the leading case on the issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-7\">For example, where the disclosure of the contents of a communication does not reveal the identity of the informer, the contents are not privileged. \"Likewise, once the identity of the informer has been disclosed to those who would have cause to resent the communication, the privilege is no longer applicable.\u201d Nor will it apply where disclosure \u201cis relevant and helpful to the defense of an accused, or is essential to a fair determination of a cause.\u201d <em>Roviaro v. United States, supra, </em>353 <em>U.S. </em>at 60-61, 77 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 627-628, 1 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 645; <em>Scher v.

Furthermore, the privilege is inapplicable where the informer is an essential witness on a basic issue in the case, <em>State v. Infante, supra, </em>116 <em>N.J.Super. </em>[252] at 257 [282 A.2d 44 (1971) ], where the informer is an active <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>participant in the crime for which defendant is prosecuted, <em>State v. Oliver, supra, </em>50 <em>N.J. </em>[39] at 42, 45 [231 A.2d 805 (1967) ]; <em>State v. Roundtree, supra, </em>118 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 31-32 [285 A.2d 564], where a defense of entrapment seems reasonably plausible, <em>Roviaro v. United States, supra, </em>353 <em>U.S. </em>at 64, 77 <em>S. Ct. </em>at 629, 1 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 647; <em>State v. Dolce, supra, </em>41 <em>N.J. </em>422 [197 A.2d 185 (1964) ], or where disclosure is mandated by fundamental principles of fairness to the accused. <em>Roviaro v. United States, supra, </em>353 <em>U.S. </em>at 60, 77 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 626, 1 L.Ed.2d at 644-645; <em>Cashen v.

Milligan, supra, </em>71 <em>N.J. </em>at 383-384, 365 A.2d 914],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">Under most circumstances, however, an informer\u2019s identity will be kept secret and will not be revealed for insignificant or transient reasons. <em>State v. Milligan, supra, </em>71 <em>N.J. </em>at 383-392, 365 A.2d 914; <em>Cashen v. Spann, </em>77 <em>N.J. </em>138, 389 A.2d 969 (1978); <em>State v.

Booker, </em>86 <em>N.J.Super. </em>175, 206 A.2d 365 (App.Div.1965). In <em>State v. Dolce, </em>41 <em>N.J. </em>422, 435-436, 197 A.2d 185 (1964), it was stated thus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-7\">The public interest to be served by preserving the free flow of information of criminal activities, and by employing investigative agents who have, or acquire by deception or otherwise, access to persons engaged in such activities, should not be thwarted unless a showing is made that a defense such as entrapment is presented in good faith, with some reasonable factual support, and that the informer is a material witness necessary to the fair determination of the defense. If the rule were otherwise, a defendant by the mere naked allegation that he intended to rely on the defense could force the State to reveal the name and whereabouts of the informer and, on its refusal to do so, gain dismissal of the prosecution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-8\"><em>\u201cA </em>frivolous demand for the information, or one based only on an unsworn assertion that defendant was seduced into perpetrating the crime by the creative activity of police officers need not be recognized.\u201d <em>State v. Dolce, supra, </em>41 <em>N.J. </em>at 435, 197 A.2d 185. Likewise, the identity of an informant need not \u201cbe revealed [where the informant is] no more than a witness to the criminal event.\u201d <em>State v. Oliver, supra, </em>50 <em>N.J. </em>at 46, 231 A.2d 805. As was aptly summarized in <em>State v. Milligan:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-9\">On the other hand, absent a strong showing of need, courts generally deny disclosure where the informer plays only a marginal role, such as providing information or \u201ctips\u201d to the police or participating in the preliminary stage of a criminal investigation. <em>See, e.g., State v. Infante, supra, </em>116 <em>N.J.Super. </em>252 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>[282 A.2d 44 (App.Div.1971)]; <em>State v.

United States, </em>326 F.2d 124 (9th Cir.1963), <em>cert. denied, </em>377 <em>U.S. </em>956, 84 <em>S.Ct. </em>1635, 12 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>499 (1964); <em>Gulick v. State, </em>252 <em>Md. </em>348, 249 A.2d 702 (Ct.App.1969); <em>Lopez v. State, </em>397 S.W.2d 76 (Tex.Cr.App.1966) <em>and generally </em>Annot., <em>supra, </em>76 A.L.R.2d (Supp.1975) at 434-435; <em>cf. People v. Goggins, supra, </em>34 N.Y.2d [163] at 170, 356 N.Y.S.2d [571] at 576, 313 <em>N.E.2d </em>[41] at 45 [ (1974) ]. Proof that the informer witnessed the criminal transaction, without more, is usually considered insufficient to justify disclosure. <em>State v. Oliver, supra, </em>50 <em>N.J. </em>39 [231 A.2d 805 (1967) ]; <em>State v. Booker, </em>86 <em>N.J.Super. </em>175 [206 A.2d 365] (App.Div.1965). In fact, where, as here, the role of the informer is confined to introducing the undercover agent to defendant, the majority of decisions have refused to compel disclosure of the informer\u2019s identity. <em>[State v. Milligan, supra, </em>71 <em>N.J. </em>at 387-389, 365 A.2d 914 (footnote omitted) ].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">Both <em>State v. Milligan, supra </em>and <em>State v. Booker, supra, </em>are instructive here. In <em>Milligan, </em>the informant introduced a trooper to the defendant Milligan. Although the informant was present throughout the meeting and did participate in the discussions, he did not negotiate the sale. Following the initial meeting, the trooper, Milligan and the informer proceeded to Milligan\u2019s home. Once inside, the informer left the trooper and Milligan alone and the sale was completed outside of his presence. No other person was in the living room during the sale. The informer neither witnessed nor participated in the transaction, though he did enter the room shortly after the sale took place. <em>Id. </em>at 378-379, 365 <em>A.</em>2d 914. In holding that disclosure was not required, the Supreme Court wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-6\">In this case, the defendant has made no special showing of how disclosure of the informer\u2019s identity would be helpful to his defense. Nor has he asserted a defense of entrapment which might also justify disclosure. <em>Cf. Roviaro v. United States, supra, </em>353 <em>U.S. </em>at 64, 77 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 629,1 L.Ed.2d at 647; <em>State v. Dolce, supra, </em>41 <em>N.J. </em>422 [197 A.2d 185]; <em>State v. Roundtree, supra, </em>118 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 32-34 [285 A.2d 564]. Instead, defendant merely denies selling drugs to the undercover agent. Essentially, he relies on a defense of mistaken identity. Most courts have found that the possibility that an informer\u2019s testimony might establish a defense of mistaken identity is too speculative to warrant disclosure. <em>See, e.g., State v. Booker, supra, </em>86 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 179 [206 A.2d 365], On the other hand, some courts have considered this possibility an important factor in support of defendant\u2019s request. The instant case, however, is distinguishable from these latter cases in that here the illegal transaction allegedly took place in defendant\u2019s home and not \u201con the street.\u201d This fact severely weakens defendant\u2019s claim of mistaken identity. <em>[State v. Milligan, supra, </em>71 <em>N.J. </em>at 390-391, 365 A.2d 914 (some citations omitted)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>Likewise, in <em>State v. Booker, </em>we held that \u201cthe mere fact that the informer was present does not take him out of the protection of the statute. Such presence is only one fact to be taken into consideration with all of the facts in determining whether \u2018disclosure of his identity is essential to assure a fair determination of the issues.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Booker, supra, </em>86 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 179, 206 A.2d 365. In that case, the officer and the informant drove to a high drug area. Defendant met them and the officer completed a sale with defendant. On two separate occasions after the initial sale, the officer and the informant purchased drugs from defendant. Apparently, the informant did nothing more than introduce the officer to defendant and witness the transaction which took place. <em>Id. </em>at 178-179, 206 A.2d 365.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">In determining whether the trial court has properly evaluated the issue, the appellate tribunal must decide whether the trial court abused its discretion in weighing the competing interests. <em>State v. Milligan, supra, </em>71 <em>N.J. </em>at 384, 365 A.2d 914. In the final analysis, however, \u201c[a] policy decision must be made and it must rest upon probabilities. In those terms the risk of loss to defendants is pure conjecture, while the loss to society in its effort to cope with crime would be real and substantial. The balance contemplated by <em>Rovario </em>must be struck in favor of law and order.\u201d <em>State v. Oliver, supra, </em>50 <em>N.J. </em>at 48, 231 A.2d 805.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">Turning to this case, it is obvious that there is no need for Foreshaw to learn the identity of the confidential informant and, as such, the trial court properly denied his motion to disclose. A review of the record reveals that the informant here was not at all involved in the events which took place. The informant did not contact defendants, accompany the police or participate in any meetings, sales or arrests. The informer only gave a detailed description of defendants and their vehicle to the police. Surely such action does not rise to the level of participation necessary for disclosure. This case bears no rela<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>tionship to <em>Roviaro v. United States, supra, </em>and <em>State v. Roundtree, supra. </em>In those cases, the informants played integral roles in the subject transactions and were actually present during the criminal activity. Here, by contrast, the informant only relayed incriminating information to the police and took no further part in the case. The matter <em>sub judice </em>is more akin to <em>State v. Milligan, supra, </em>and <em>State v. Booker, supra, </em>where the informants did nothing more than introduce the defendants to the police. In those cases, the courts clearly held that disclosure is not required where the informant plays a minor and limited role.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">Foreshaw\u2019s contention that it can be inferred from the informant\u2019s mentioning of Brown\u2019s name to the police that he was in possession of exculpatory evidence is clearly without merit. Although it is true that the informant only identified Brown, such does not establish or even suggest Foreshaw\u2019s innocence. Foreshaw overlooks the fact that the informant gave a detailed description of him, his companions and their vehicle to the police. Moreover, and more importantly, because he did not accompany defendants or the police, the informant had no knowledge of the incriminating events. The informant could neither testify as to Foreshaw\u2019s knowledge or intent nor could he offer evidence on Foreshaw\u2019s behalf. Because Foreshaw\u2019s criminal activity took place outside of the informer\u2019s presence, the identity of the informer was irrelevant. In sum, \u201c[Foreshaw] has made no special showing of how disclosure of the informer\u2019s identity would be helpful to his defense.\u201d <em>State v. Milligan, supra, </em>71 <em>N.J. </em>at 390, 365 <em>A.</em>2d 914. As such, Judge Fluharty properly exercised his discretion by denying Foreshaw\u2019s motion to disclose the identity of the informant.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">\n<em>The Trial Court Properly Denied Defendant Foreshaw\u2019s Motion for a Judgment of Acquittal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">Foreshaw also argues that the trial court erroneously denied his motion for a judgment of acquittal. Specifically, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>claims that the State failed to present a <em>prima facie </em>case against him regarding the cocaine possession charge. We disagree. In <em>State v. Reyes, </em>50 <em>N.J. </em>454, 236 A.2d 385 (1967), our Supreme Court set forth the test to be applied when determining a motion to acquit. In the Court\u2019s words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-6\">Treating first of the motion at the conclusion of the prosecution\u2019s evidence, the broad test for determination of such an application is whether the evidence at that point is sufficient to warrant a conviction of the charge involved. <em>R.R. </em>3:7-6. More specifically, the question the trial judge must determine is whether, viewing the State\u2019s evidence in its entirety, be that evidence direct or circumstantial, and giving the State the benefit of all its favorable testimony as well as all of the favorable inferences which reasonably could be drawn therefrom, a reasonable jury could find guilt of the charge beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v.

Gora, supra, </em>148 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 596, 372 A.2d 1335.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-8\">We are thoroughly convinced that there was sufficient credible evidence in this record from which the jury could find defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of cocaine possession in violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-10a(l) and possession of cocaine with intent to distribute in violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-5a(l) and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-5b(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>\u201cCriminal \u2018possession signifies intentional control and dominion, the ability to affect physically and care for the item during a span of time, accompanied by knowledge of its character.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Brown, </em>80 <em>N.J. </em>587, 597, 404 A.2d 1111 (1979) (citations omitted). \u201cPossession can be either actual or constructive.\u201d <em>State v. Shipp, </em>216 <em>N.J.Super. </em>662, 664, 524 A.2d 864 (App.Div. 1987). <em>See State v. Brown, supra, </em>80 <em>N.J. </em>at 597, 404 A.2d 1111; <em>State v. Rajnai, </em>182 <em>N.J.Super. </em>580, 536, 334 A.2d 364 (App.Div.1975). \u201cFor constructive possession, which can be jointly shared by several persons, \u2018physical or manual control of the proscribed item is not required as long as there is an intention to exercise control over it manifested in circumstances where it is reasonable to infer that the capacity to do so exists.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Shipp, supra, </em>216 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 664, 524 A.2d 864 (quoting <em>State v. Brown, supra, </em>80 <em>N.J. </em>at 597, 404 A.2d 1111). <em>See State v. Rajnai, supra, </em>132 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 536, 334 A.2d 364. \u201cProof of possession may be by circumstantial as well as direct evidence.\u201d <em>State v. Rajnai, supra, </em>132 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 536, 334 A.2d 364. \u201cPossession need not be exclusive but may be jointly exercised by two or more persons.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Generally, \u201ccriminal possession may not be inferred from defendant\u2019s mere presence at the location where the contraband was found.\u201d <em>State v. Shipp, supra, </em>216 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 665, 524 A.2d 864. \u201cTo justify such an inference there must be \u2018other circumstances or statements of the defendant tending to permit such an inference to be drawn.\u2019 \u201d Id. (quoting State <em>v. Brown, supra, </em>80 <em>N.J. </em>at 593, 404 A.2d 1111).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">Here, the State presented ample evidence' from which both physical and constructive possession could be inferred. According to the State\u2019s proofs, the officers discovered the cocaine, worth at least $50,000, under the driver\u2019s seat. The bag could only be reached from the rear seat because the electric motor under the driver\u2019s seat made front access impossible. Additionally, at the time of arrest, Foreshaw was sitting alone in the rear seat behind Brown who was driving the vehicle. On this evidence, a jury could confer that Foreshaw had physical possession of the bag due to his proximity to it. Additionally, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>jury could also infer that Foreshaw had constructive possession. Foreshaw was alone in the rear seat and had ready access to the bag. Moreover, the fact that a large, extremely valuable amount of cocaine was discovered in the passenger compartment leads to the inescapable inference that all of the passengers had knowledge of the drugs and were well aware of their existence. <em>See State v. Palacio, </em>111 <em>N.J. </em>543, 545 A.2d 764 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">Finally, in our view, the jury verdict was not a manifest denial of justice under the law. <em>R. </em>2:10-1. <em>See State v. Carter, </em>91 <em>N.J. </em>86, 96, 449 A.2d 1280 (1982); <em>State v. Sims, </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>359, 373-374, 322 A.2d 809 (1974). Thus, Judge Fluharty properly denied Foreshaw\u2019s motion for acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">\n<em>Defendants\u2019 Sentences Were Proper</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b219-9\">Finally, we are satisfied that the sentences imposed upon defendants were neither illegal nor excessive. The sentences imposed upon each defendant complied with the provisions of the New Jersey Code of Criminal Justice and resulted from the trial court\u2019s thorough analysis and careful weighing of the relevant aggravating and mitigating factors. The need for punishment, deterrence and protection of society outweighs any reason advanced by defendants for the modification of their sentences. Furthermore, in our view, these sentences were neither manifestly excessive nor unduly punitive. They do not represent a miscarriage of justice or shock the judicial conscience. <em>See State v. O\u2019Donnell, </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>210, 215-216, 564 A.2d 1202 (1989); <em>State v. Jarbath, </em>114 <em>N.J. </em>394, 401, 555 A.2d 559 (1989); <em>State v. Ghertler, </em>114 <em>N.J. </em>383, 387-388, 393-394, 555 A.2d 553 (1989); <em>State v. Roth, </em>95 <em>N.J </em>334, 364-365, 471 A.2d 370 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-10\">Accordingly, the judgments of conviction and the orders of commitment under review are affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
