Partnership v. Kean, </em>119 <em>N.J. </em>425, 575 A.2d 427 (1990) (hereinafter <em>Last </em>Chance). In <em>Last Chance </em>the Supreme Court invalidated rules of the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:7-2.3(a)2, adopted pursuant to the Waterfront Development Act (the Act), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12:5-1 to -11, which provided for extensive regulation of development within 1,000 feet of navigable waterways. The Court found that the Act was intended solely \u201cto regulate development affecting commerce in New Jersey\u2019s waterways.\u201d 119 <em>N.J. </em>at 435, 575 A.2d 427. Consequently, the Act does not confer authority upon DEP to regulate \u201cfor environmental purposes independent of regulating commercial development immediately adjacent to, if not on, the waterfront itself.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>And because DEP\u2019s rules contained \u201cno standards\u201d requiring regulated development \u201cto have a direct effect on the waterfront and waterways,\u201d the Court concluded that they were invalid. <em>Id. </em>at 436, 575 A.2d 427. However, the Court further observed that \u201c[i]t is conceivable ... that a well-crafted regulation tying the development of adjacent wetlands to potential damage to the waterfront and water resources of the State could withstand scrutiny.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 435-436, 575 A.2d 427.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-9\">Less than a month after the Court\u2019s decision in <em>Last Chance, </em>DEP adopted emergency amendments to its waterfront development rules, which redefined their territorial scope. On August <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>16, 1990, appellant Long Beach Township Oceanfront Property Owners Association filed a notice of appeal from the emergency amendments. Subsequently, we granted appellant\u2019s motion for acceleration of the appeal. On September 14, 1990, DEP readopted the amendments in the same form in accordance with the normal rule-making procedures of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:14B-4(a). Appellant also filed a notice of appeal from the adoption of the permanent rule amendments. On appellant\u2019s motion, we consolidated the two appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">Although the emergency amendments to the waterfront development rules expired on September 14, 1990 <em>(see N.J.S.A. </em>52:14B-4(c), which limits the effective period of an emergency rule to a maximum of 60 days), appellant urges us to review DEP\u2019s invocation of the emergency rule-making procedures of the APA because this practice is capable of repetition yet evading review. We consider such review unnecessary. Any issue regarding the appropriateness of DEP adopting the amendments under the emergency procedures of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:14B-4(c) is moot, because the same amendments have now been readopted in accordance with the normal rule-making procedures of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:14B-4(a). Furthermore, any future use of the emergency rule-making procedure would have to be reviewed on the basis of the particular facts then presented. We also note that an appeal from the emergency adoption of the prior version of the rules was dismissed by this court as moot, <em>Last Chance Dev. Partnership v. Kean, </em>232 <em>N.J.Super. </em>115, 117, 556 A.2d 796 (App.Div.1989), and that the Supreme Court did not address the issue. Accordingly, we deal solely with the validity of the permanent amendments to the waterfront development rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">Initially, we note that the territorial scope of the present version of the waterfront development rules is broader in some respects than its predecessor. Although the present version of the rule reduces the area subject to regulation from 1,000 to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>500 feet inland of the mean high water line, the most inland oceanfront beach or most inland oceanfront dune, it deletes the part of the prior rule which excluded from regulation any property inland of the first developed property.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Consequently, the new rule extends the waterfront permit requirement to inland properties which were exempt from the rule invalidated in <em>Last Chance. </em>DEP has not even undertaken to show how the development of such a property could have the \u201cdirect effect on the waterfront and waterways\u201d required by <em>Last Chance. </em>119 <em>N.J. </em>at 436, 575 A.2d 427.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">In addition, although the Act only applies to development along the waterfront of \u201cany navigable water or stream of this State,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12:5-3, the rule provides for regulation of all tidal waterways and their adjoining upland areas. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:7-2.3(a)1, 2 and 3. Since it is clear that water may be tidal even though it is not navigable, <em>see Schultz v. Wilson, </em>44 <em>N.J.Super. </em>591, 600-604, 131 A.2d 415 (App.Div.1957), certif. den. 24 <em>N.J. </em>546, 133 A.2d 395 (1957), DEP\u2019s waterfront development rules are <em>ultra vires </em>insofar as they purport to regulate development along non-navigable tidal waters.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">The most fundamental defect of the rules is the total absence of any showing that all development within 500 feet of navigable waters has the \u201cdirect effect on New Jersey\u2019s navigable waterways\u201d required to establish jurisdiction under the Act as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>interpreted in <em>Last Chance. </em>119 <em>N.J. </em>at 436, 575 <em>A.</em>2d 427. DEP relies upon the Court\u2019s observation in <em>Last Chance </em>that: \u201cWe are not called on to consider whether any development within 500 feet of the boundary described by the 1980 rule presumptively has such a direct effect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 436, 575 A.2d 427. However, DEP has simply presumed the existence of that direct effect, without pointing to any evidence in the administrative record to support the presumption. Furthermore, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:7-2.3(a)2 makes that presumption irrebuttable, because it contains no procedure by which a property owner may obtain an exemption from the permit requirement by showing that a proposed development within 500 feet of the mean high water line will have no direct effect on a navigable waterway.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">In addition, although \u201cthe boundary described by the 1980 rule\u201d to which the Court referred in <em>Last Chance </em>was the mean high water line, the boundary from which the 500 foot regulated area is measured under the present version of <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:7-2.3(a)2 is \u201cthe mean high water line, the most inland oceanfront beach, or most inland oceanfront dune, ... [whichever] results in the greatest regulated waterfront area.\u201d This definition obviously would result in DEP regulation over many areas which are significantly further inland than 500 feet from the mean high water line.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">Finally, the rules set forth no standards related to navigability and commerce to guide DEP\u2019s review of proposed developments. Rather, DEP\u2019s \u201cPolicy Compliance Statement For Upland Waterfront Development Permits Guide Sheet\u201d sets forth 23 environmental policies an applicant must satisfy to obtain a development permit, which apparently incorporates by reference the general environmental regulations governing the issuance of waterfront development, wetlands and CAFRA permits, including regulations relating to beaches <em>(N.J.A.C. 7</em>:7E-3.22), dunes <em>(N.J.A.C. </em>7:7E-3.16), wetlands <em>(N.J.A.C. </em>7:7E-3.27), wetlands buffers <em>(N.J.A.C. </em>7:7E-3.28), endangered or threatened wildlife or vegetation species habitats <em>(N.J.A.C. </em>7:7E-3.38), critical wildlife habitats <em>(N.J.A.C. </em>7:7E-3.39), housing use <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>policies <em>(N.J.A.C. </em>7:7E-7.2), resort/recreational use <em>(N.J.A.C. </em>7:7E-7.3), water quality <em>(N.J.A.C. </em>7:7E-8.4), vegetation <em>(N.J.A.C. </em>7:7E-8.8), important wildlife habitat <em>(N.J.A.C. </em>7:7E-8.9), and fertile soils <em>(N.J.A.C. </em>7:7E-8.15). The breadth of environmental concerns which an applicant for a waterfront development permit must address provides added support for our conclusion that the present version of the waterfront development rules, like its predecessor invalidated in <em>Last Chance, </em>\u201c[exceeds] the Acts\u2019 underlying purpose of regulating commerce along the waterfront itself.\u201d 119 <em>N.J. </em>at 436, 575 A.2d 427.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">Accordingly, we declare <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:7-2.3(a)2, as amended on September 14, 1990, to be invalid.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b179-8\">Under the prior rules the regulated waterfront in coastal areas consisted of any tidal waterway ... and all lands lying thereunder, up to the mean high water line and adjacent upland area measured from the most inland beach, dune, wetland or other water area ... to the lesser of: (i) one thousand feet; or (ii) the inland limit of the first property associated with residential, commercial or industrial use that involves a permanent building based on property lines existing on October 3, 1988....</p>\n<p id=\"b179-9\">Under the new rules, the regulated waterfront in coastal areas consists of any tidal waterway and all lands lying thereunder up to the mean high water line and ... an adjacent upland area to a boundary 500 feet inland of the mean high water line, the most inland oceanfront beach, or most inland oceanfront dune ... measuring from that feature which results in the greatest regulated waterfront area.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
