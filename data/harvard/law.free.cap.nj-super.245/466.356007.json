The instructions were delivered partly orally and partly in writing. We conclude that the instructions in their totality were both inadequate and inartful. We hold that failure to read all of the proper instructions to the jury was reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-11\">The defendant was indicted on August 13,1987 on charges of second-degree aggravated assault, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:12-l(b)(l); second-degree burglary, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:18-2; and fourth-degree theft, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:20-3. The case was tried in December 1989 and verdicts of guilty on all counts were returned on December 22. A motion for new trial based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel was denied. Defendant was sentenced to concurrent seven-year terms on the assault and burglary counts and a consecutive nine-month term on the theft count. Defendant contends on appeal that: (1) the jury instructions were so inadequate as to constitute plain error, (2) counsel was ineffective, and (3) the supplemental jury instruction on deadlocked deliberations was in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-12\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b499-13\">The prosecution arose out of an assault on a young woman in Clayton in the early morning hours of July 4, 1987 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>while she was alone in her home. The defendant and the victim had been social friends for some time before the event. Defendant had been accustomed to coming and going from her home rather freely. After the attack she went to the hospital, got 13 stitches in her scalp, and was observed for a concussion for four days as an inpatient.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">Defendant denied that he was the attacker. The jury had to resolve issues concerning the identity of the assailant, the intent upon entry, the degree of the assault, and the occurrence of a theft. Defendant in the past had possessed property of the victim under circumstances from which the jury could have concluded that his possession of her property in this situation arose from a permissive rather than a criminal taking. Thus the burglary and theft aspects were more complex than in a routine case where the victim and the alleged perpetrator were each unknown to the other before the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">The jury retired to deliberate on Thursday, December 21, 1989 at 11 a.m. The jury asked for and received reinstruction on reasonable doubt at 2 p.m. on that date. At 2:45 p.m. on that date the jury reported that they were deadlocked. The judge consulted with and gave counsel a copy of \u201cthe ABA charge that was approved in <em>State v. Czachor, </em>82 <em>N.J. </em>392, 413 A.2d 593 (1980).\u201d The judge then brought the jury into the courtroom and told them:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-7\">Okay. Now, with that discussion of procedurally how we operate and what the possibilities are for your continuing, I have something to read to you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-8\">The verdict must represent the considered judgment of each juror. In order to return a verdict, it is necessary that each juror agree thereto and your verdict must be unanimous. I already told you that. It is your duty as jurors to consult with one another and to deliberate with a view to reaching an agreement if you can do so without violence to individual judgment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-9\">Another judge who was older and wiser, more experienced than I one time says or told me that when he told jurors in situations like this was why don't you people consider changing position and adopting the other person\u2019s viewpoints. And if you are voting in direction A say, all right, \"I'm going to assume the arguments for direction B and vice versa, see if you can convince one another of something.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-10\">I\u2019m not telling you to do it. I\u2019m not even suggesting that you should do it. I\u2019m telling you that that is one way that others have resolved the issue if, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>fact, it\u2019s resolvable. It may not be. You\u2019re not under any direction to come to grips with it. Each of you must decide the case for yourself but do so only after an impartial consideration of the evidence with your fellow jurors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-6\">In the course of your deliberations, do not hesitate to reexamine your own views and change your opinion if convinced it is erroneous, but not\u2014do not surrender your honest convictions as to the weight or effect of evidence solely because of the opinion of your fellow jurors or for the mere purpose of returning a verdict. You are not partisans. Meaning you\u2019re not assigned to a particular side. You are judges, judges of the facts. Your sole interest is to ascertain the truth from the evidence in the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-7\">And with that I would ask you please go back and try again.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">Defendant objected to the underlined portion of the charge as encouraging the jurors who believed that he was not guilty to adopt the prosecutor\u2019s position. While we do not find the underlined portion of the charge reversible error in itself, we think this folksy invitation to exchange viewpoints would have been better left out.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-9\">The jury later that afternoon wanted certain testimony of the victim read back. After a discussion with counsel and a search of the record, the judge called the jury back into the courtroom. He told them that he had not been able to find the answer to their question. Since it was after 4:30 p.m. he said that unless they were on the brink of a decision, he would excuse them until the next morning, Friday, December 22nd. A discussion ensued with one juror concerning starting at 10 a.m. the next morning rather than 9 a.m. because she wanted to be with her students for their Christmas exchange. A second juror then questioned the judge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-10\">JUROR ELEVEN: Can this thing go any longer besides tomorrow?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-11\">THE COURT: Probably not. I really don\u2019t know how.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-12\">JUROR ELEVEN: Can it, though?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-13\">THE COURT: Anything\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-14\">JUROR ELEVEN: I\u2019m just saying\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-15\">THE COURT:\u2014sarcastic or funny. Can it? Unfortunately, it\u2019s subject to whatever I say. And I have to get a sense of what\u2019s going on and depends on where we are tomorrow. That\u2019s all. I\u2019m not trying to be coy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-16\">You say can it\u2014let me just give you a hypothetical situation. Let\u2019s say something happened that we had to adjourn at 2:00 for some reason, but you folks gave me some indication you thought you were making progress. No rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>says we can\u2019t come in Saturday morning and finish. I mean, I\u2019m not telling you\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-5\">JUROR ELEVEN: I\u2019m not worried about Saturday.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-6\">THE COURT: But you wanted to know, you know, can it. That\u2019s a very broad answer, yes. Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-7\">JUROR ELEVEN: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Am\">THE COURT: Depends on how it goes, what happens, what the atmosphere is like, where you folks stand, what you told me, what you ask me, all of those things.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-9\">But to answer your specific question, yes, it is legally possible for me to say come back Saturday and finish up.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-10\">Since this discussion took place on Thursday, December 21, 1989 and Christmas was on the following Monday, defendant claims that the judge planted in the jurors\u2019 minds \u201cthe unwelcome prospect of having their weekend plans disrupted by the continuation of the deliberations\u201d and subjected the jurors to a coercive influence which damaged their ability to attend to their duties without distraction. At 12:05 p.m. on Friday, December 22nd, the jury returned with its verdict of guilty of second-degree aggravated assault, second-degree burglary and fourth-degree theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b502-12\">We first consider the jury instructions. At the close of the trial, the judge instructed the jury orally. He also gave the jury a \u201ccut and paste\u201d sheet containing the definitions of the offenses and types or degrees of culpability. (Reproduced APPENDIX A) There was no objection to the charge as given. <em>R. </em>1:7-2. Defendant claims that the charge was so confusing and inadequate that \u201cplain error\u201d existed, requiring reversal despite the lack of an objection. <em>R. </em>2:10-2. We agree. We also hold that the failure to read the entire charge to the jury requires reversal. The fundamental importance of a proper charge, read in full to the jurors, naturally is highlighted in a close case where basic disagreement emerges and is articulated during the course of jury deliberation.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>After the customary introductory amenities, the judge told the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-6\">I am going to give you a cut and paste sheet, all right. That\u2019s why it looks like it looks. I have taken\u2014because in the statute there are many parts of it that don\u2019t pertain to this case. You know, maybe something involving a weapon or something. I have cut all that out. I have taken the time to Scotch tape it together and photocopy it. I think it will be very helpful to you in determination of the technical definitions of the offenses that are involved here. And I'm going to briefly read them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">He then started to define the crimes. This is the way he instructed the jury on aggravated and simple assault:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-8\">Now, the first charge is aggravated assault. And a person is guilty of aggravated assault if he attempts to cause serious bodily injury to another or causes such injury purposely or knowingly or under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life, he recklessly causes such injury, and that is one grade of offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-9\">And then I have here for you a definition of serious bodily injury which means any bodily injury which creates a substantial risk of death or which causes serious permanent disfigurement or protracted loss or impairment of the function of any bodily member or organ. And then bodily injury means physical pain, illness or any impairment of physical function.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-10\">And then I have a definition here of simple assault, because if you do not find\u2014first of all, you\u2019re going to have to figure out the identification problem. In this ease I\u2019ll say it right up front to the satisfaction of all, if you find that the State has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Donald Lindsey assaulted, beat, hammered her head on the floor, Miss Pellicano, then he\u2019s guilty of something. You\u2019ll decide what.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-11\">If you find that the State has not proven that it was he that did it or if you decide factually that he went back a second time, just saw her there, he\u2019s not guilty of anything. In other words, the fact that he went back a second time and she had already been beaten by somebody else, even if he then took the jewelry or whatever, he\u2019s not guilty of anything. In order for you to find him guilty, has to be that he\u2019s the one that committed the assault. Then you\u2019ll find what he\u2019s guilty of.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-12\">You\u2019re satisfied of that, okay, satisfactory, men?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-13\">MR. CONA: [defense counsel] That\u2019s fine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-14\">MR. SALVATI: [prosecutor] Fine, Judge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-15\">THE COURT: So simple assault, person is guilty of assault if he attempts to cause or purposely, knowingly or recklessly causes bodily injury to another or attempts by physical menace to put another in fear of imminent serious bodily injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-16\">So if you find the defendant guilty of aggravated assault, naturally you don\u2019t have to consider simple assault. There is just one count in the indictment. If you find that the State has proven that he did commit an assault upon her, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>you\u2019re not satisfied it was an aggravated assault, you have to decide if.it was a simple assault.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">He then proceeded to the crime of burglary:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-6\">Now, similarly with burglary, a person is guilty of burglary if with the purpose to commit an offense he enters a structure. All right. So if Mr. Lindsey\u2014which is proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Lindsey went into that house with the purpose of stealing, burglary. If he went in to the house with the purpose of committing an assault, or both burglary and assault, burglary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-7\">But we have a second question. If you say we find him guilty of burglary, I\u2019m going to say well, you find him guilty of burglary in the second degree or in the third degree. You say what\u2019s the difference. The difference is if he went in only to commit a theft, it\u2019s third degree burglary. If he went in with the purpose to commit an aggravated assault of\u2014that's not really so\u2014if he went in to inflict or attempt to inflict bodily injury on anyone, then it\u2019s second degree burglary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-8\">I\u2019m going to give that to you in writing, all right. So when you say\u2014if you say, Judge, we are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Lindsey went in and Mr. Lindsey did it with the purpose to commit an offense, and he, therefore, committed a burglary, I\u2019m going to say to you, well, did he go in just to steal or did he go in and also inflict bodily injury on Miss Pellicano while he was there, and you\u2019ll tell me which was which and what the degree or third or second. It\u2019s all spelled out for you in writing. And you\u2019ll take it in with the exhibits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b504-9\">He never defined theft orally for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-10\">The judge then moved on to define the mental state or <em>mens rea </em>necessary for criminal liability. He said in respect of this point:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-11\">All through the criminal law the words purposely and knowingly and recklessly are used because in order for a person to be guilty of a crime, they have to have a certain mental state, a certain mental attitude. They have to have a purpose or have to be reckless in what they are doing. They have to know what they are doing, but not actually intend a specific result that finally comes about.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-12\">I\u2019m going to give you those definitions as well in writing because, frankly, I find them incomprehensible when they are just spoken to you. And so you\u2019ll have them before you. But essentially it\u2019s a\u2014the highest degree of mental purpose and then a little less, then a little less.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-13\">You know, purposely means it\u2019s absolutely intentional. If I take a pencil, I want to break it in three places and I break it in three places, that is what I intended to do, that would be purposely.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-14\">If it\u2019s knowingly, maybe I just intended to break it and it breaks in three places, Well, I knew it was going to break when I did it, but I didn\u2019t exactly intend the precise result.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>Recklessly just means I do something, I don\u2019t care what the result is, but it\u2019s pretty\u2014like looks like there is going to be a disastrous result, I just don\u2019t care about it. That's sort of it. You read it. And the law will tell you precisely what it means. Perhaps you\u2019ll explain it to me.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">Again, he did not read these \u201cmental state\u201d instructions to the jury but gave them in written form only. (See APPENDIX A). And his comments, \u201cI find them incomprehensible when they are just spoken to you,\u201d and \u201c[Pjerhaps you\u2019ll explain it to me,\u201d demeaned his role and duty in the trial as the authoritative source of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">He concluded his remarks on the substantive law by saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-8\">They are the definitions for the offenses themselves. That\u2019s what he\u2019s charged with. But as counsel said, the really hotly contested or central issue in this is identification. The State\u2019s required to prove the elements of the offense, but in this particular case they\u2019re kind of secondary to the prime issue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b505-9\">Doubtless, the identity of the perpetrator was the core of the dispute but the State still had the burden of proving the degree of the assault, the criminal intent upon entry, if any, and the intent to commit a theft, if any. These matters were hardly \u201csecondary\u201d because defendant, even if guilty, could have been reasonably found guilty of \u201csimple assault\u201d alone, a disorderly persons offense, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:12-l(a)(l), punishable up to a maximum of six months, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-8. He also could have been found innocent of theft, or of any criminal intent upon entry into the victim\u2019s home in the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-10\">Defense counsel had no objections to the jury charge except to ask the judge to make it clear that the burden of proof was on the State beyond a reasonable doubt as to each element of the offenses and as to the identity of the defendant. As requested, the judge gave this admonition to the jury orally. No written verdict sheet was submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-11\">The defendant properly contends that \u201ca review of the charge makes clear that [the judge] omitted [reading] substantial portions of the instructions pertinent to the charges of aggravated assault and burglary and failed to define the charge of theft at all\u201d in his oral instructions. Defendant also correctly stresses that \u201ccompared with the model jury charges, the definitions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>given the jury of purposeful, knowing and reckless conduct [were] wholly inadequate to constitute a legally sufficient definition of those mental states.\u201d He urges that any defect in the oral instructions may not be cured by the \u201ccut and paste sheet\u201d given to the jurors. Notably, the jurors were not specifically told that each must read the \u201ccut and paste\u201d sheet. Nor was the foreperson told to read it to the others.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">A good illustration in context of the poverty of the oral charge is shown by the absence of any oral definition of theft. During the trial, both the victim and the defendant testified that in the past they had played \u201ca sort of game\u201d where each would borrow belongings of the other. The victim said that it had been \u201ca big joke to try and get it back. That\u2019s all it was about. That\u2019s how we got into this taking.\u201d The jurors, or some of them, may never have been aware that in order to find defendant guilty of theft, the law requires that the State show beyond a reasonable doubt an intent to deprive the owner of the property permanently. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:20-3a. <em>See State v. Green, </em>170 <em>N.J.Super. </em>292, 295-296, 406 A.2d 310 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied </em>82 <em>N.J. </em>271, 412 A.2d 778 (1979); <em>State v. Leicht, </em>124 <em>N.J.Super. </em>127, 131, 305 A.2d 78 (App.Div.1973). Some of the victim\u2019s jewelry was found in defendant\u2019s room after the episode. He denied any criminal theft of the jewelry from her, claiming he took it as part of the \u201cgame ploy\u201d described by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">We find the oral instructions to the jury totally inadequate in the circumstances and \u201cplain error\u201d requiring a new trial. At the minimum, the <em>entire </em>instructions should be read to the jury. We cannot assume that each juror will independently read a written instruction or that a foreperson will read it to the entire jury in an objective fashion, as a judge would do. In this case, the jurors were not even specifically instructed to each read the instruction or to listen carefully while the foreperson read it. Nor will we even assume that each juror was sufficiently literate to read and comprehend the \u201ccut and paste\u201d instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>In this jurisdiction, the \u201ctraditional function of the judge is to instruct the jury as to the law governing the issues to be decided by them under the facts of the particular case.\u201d <em>State v. Butler, </em>27 <em>N.J. </em>560, 594, 143 A.2d 530 (1958). The \u201cclassical practice\u201d is for the judge to outline the applicable criminal law, \u201cexplaining and defining the offense charged\u201d; a \u201cmandatory duty\u201d to do so exists on the part of the trial judge. <em>Id. </em>at 594-595, 143 A.2d 530. Our Supreme Court has observed that \u201cfmjost laypersons are uneducated in the law and do not understand lawyers\u2019 jargon or the nuances involved in many of the concepts with which they are called upon to deal in the jury room.\u201d <em>State v. Green, </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>281, 288, 430 A.2d 914 (1981). Since \u201ca jury may not even have the luxury of the availability of a dictionary during its deliberations,\u201d a \u201cfaithful performance of the court\u2019s duty of expounding law for the jury\u2019s guidance and instruction requires a plain and clear exposition of the issues.\u201d <em>Id. </em>These responsibilities of the trial judge in orally instructing the jury have been most recently revisited by our Supreme Court in <em>State v. Martin, </em>119 <em>N.J. </em>2, 18, 573 A.2d 1359 (1990), and <em>State v. Concepcion, </em>111 <em>N.J. </em>373, 379, 545 A.2d 119 (1988). In sum, the duty of the judge is to help the jury understand the substantive criminal law concepts, not to augment confusion and misapprehension. \u201cOrdinarily, the better practice is to mold the instruction in a manner that explains the law to the jury in the context of the material facts of the case.\u201d <em>State v. Concepcion, </em>111 <em>N.J. </em>at 379, 545 A.2d 119.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">Traditionally, jury instructions in this State had been oral only. <em>R. </em>1:8-8 was amended in 1982 by adding this sentence: \u201cThe court, in its discretion, may submit a copy of all or part of its instructions to the jury for its consideration in the jury room.\u201d See <em>Pressler, </em>Current <em>N.J. Court Rules, Comment R. </em>1:8-8 at 95 (1991). Nothing in the rules empowers a judge to issue an instruction in written form only. In her treatise, Judge Pressler comments: \u201cCaution should be exercised when a part of the charge only is submitted in order to avoid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>prejudice possibly resultant from lack of context or overemphasis.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">Our review of the extant authorities discloses a strong view that the judge should read all instructions to the jurors, not rely on jurors to read them, or the foreperson to recite them to the jury. In <em>United States v. Noble, </em>155 F.2d 315 (3d Cir.1946), the judge did not instruct the jury on the charges but gave the jury the criminal information \u201cfor the purpose of considering and knowing what the charges are.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 317. Judge Maris said that this was not good enough. \u201cIt was essential that they be instructed upon the rules of law which they were to apply, the most fundamental and important of which were the essential elements of the crime charged.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 318. No less was required for an informed general verdict. He concluded, and we agree, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-6\">Moreover, we think that even if the information had contained a full recital of all the applicable legal principles the trial judge would not have fulfilled his duty <em>in </em>this regard merely by sending the information out with the jury to read if they chose to do so, during their deliberations. For not only are counsel and the defendant entitled to hear the instructions in order that they may, if they are incorrect, object to them and secure their prompt correction by the trial judge, but it is equally important to make as certain as may be that each member of the jury has actually received the instructions. It is therefore essential that all instructions to the jury be given by the trial judge orally in the presence of counsel and the defendant. We conclude that the failure in the present case to instruct the jury upon the elements of the crime was error, [Id. at 318.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">See also <em>Morris v.

Norris, </em>10 <em>Kan. App. 2d </em>397, 699 <em>P.</em>2d 585 (1985), the jury simply was given written instructions in a criminal case. There was \u201cno indication in the record that the jury was instructed to read the written instructions prior to beginning deliberations.\u201d The Kansas intermediate appellate court re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>versed the conviction, relying on <em>United States v. Noble, supra, </em>concluding \u201cthat an adequate written statement of the law is insufficient if it is not delivered orally as well.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 587. The Kansas court gave good reasons for oral instructions which we think bear repeating here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-5\">K.S.A. 22-3414, like the Indiana statute, does not mandate that the court \u201cshall instruct\u201d the jury orally. However, we too conclude that oral instruction is vital to the fulfillment of the court\u2019s duty to instruct the jury. Instruction of the jury is one of the most fundamental duties of the court and it is only through their oral delivery that the court can be assured that each member of the jury has actually received all of the instructions. If, for example, written copies of the instructions are given to each juror, a divergence in literacy and reading comprehension may well leave some jurors uninstructed. On the other hand, if the foreman is directed to read the instructions to the other jurors, defendant is deprived of the opportunity to witness the manner in which the foreman intones the instructions. A judge is obligated to act in an impartial and unbiased manner in delivering instructions. He may not sneeringly describe the defendant\u2019s defense or make editorial comments while reading the instructions. A jury foreman is under no such constraint once the case has been submitted. Moreover, if, as in this case, the court does not even instruct the jury to read the instructions before deliberating, there is no assurance that the instructions were in fact read or that the verdict is based upon an application of the law to the evidence.

They were not read in their entirety to the jury. Each juror was not told to read them. The foreperson was not told to read them aloud at the start of deliberations. We will not indulge any general assumption of literacy of jurors as an excuse for overlooking a defendant\u2019s fundamental procedural entitlement. The judge\u2019s editorial comments tended to demean his role as the legal authority at the trial. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>combination of the oral and written instructions was in the overall confusing and disorganized.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">We reverse on this ground alone. We do not reach defendant\u2019s contentions that he was inadequately represented and that the judge\u2019s supplementary instructions were unduly coercive and forced a verdict as the holiday season approached.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">Reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
