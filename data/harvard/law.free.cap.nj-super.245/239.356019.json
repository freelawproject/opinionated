We find it therefore unnecessary to address the evidentiary issues raised by defendant and leave their resolution to the proofs and contentions as they develop at the retrial. We affirm the conviction for the possessory offense under count three as we find no error affecting it.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">We commence by reciting the critical proofs relating to the death of Thomas Martin and the issues raised on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">On December 17, 1987 at approximately 5:30 p.m., James Owens was dropped off outside of his apartment at 7 Monticello Avenue in Jersey City. At that time he saw defendant (also known as \u201cOmar\u201d) \u201cstanding in front of the apartment.\u201d Owens invited him inside, but did not have his key. They ultimately entered when LaTrenda Thomas, who also lived there, \u201ccame down the street\u201d with a key.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">Martin (also known as \u201cAbdul\u201d), Barry Vonce (also known as \u201cKareem\u201d), his girlfriend and a woman named Ann were in the apartment when Owens and defendant entered. LaTrenda\u2019s boyfriend, Darnell Johnson (also known as \u201cBlood\u201d), was sleeping in the back room. According to Vonce, both he and Martin had come over earlier to \u201cget high.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b274-9\">Owens testified that defendant and Martin \u201cstarted having words\u201d immediately upon his entering the apartment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The argument subsided after \u201ctwo to three minutes.\u201d However, shortly thereafter, Martin came out from \u201cbehind the bar\u201d and the exchange elevated to an \u201cunmanageable\u201d level with Martin making \u201cthreatening remarks\u201d towards defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>Owens further testified that he was between the two when he heard defendant state, \u201cYou better step forward before you get it too.\u201d Owens stepped forward and saw defendant\u2019s \u201ccoat go back\u201d to reveal \u201csomething dark from behind his coat-something long,\u201d before defendant shot Martin.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">Vonce testified that the decedent and defendant had been arguing prior to the latter\u2019s entry into the apartment. Vonce and Martin tried to keep defendant outside the apartment, but defendant ultimately gained access with Owens. The two argued immediately upon defendant\u2019s entry and Martin \u201ctried to push him out.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">According to Vonce, Martin \u201cwas the more loud one\u201d and defendant \u201cdidn\u2019t say too much,\u201d Martin \u201centered the center of the room [and] still continued on to say what he would do to\u201d defendant by making \u201cthreats\u201d. In response, defendant was heard to say, \u201c[y]ou won\u2019t do nothing to me\u201d and \u201cI don\u2019t want to argue with you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">According to Vonce, the voices were getting \u201clouder and kind of hotter,\u201d and as Martin was \u201cstepping towards\u201d defendant, Vonce saw the decedent \u201creaching into his coat.\u201d Vonce then saw a \u201cbutt of a gun ... a tip, like a handle.\u201d At that moment Martin told Vonce, \u201c[g]et out of the way\u201d, whereupon Vonce \u201cgot out of the way\u201d and heard a shot fired.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-9\">Vonce also testified that at some point after the shooting and prior to the arrival of the police and ambulance, Martin\u2019s girl friend came to the apartment and \u201csnatched [decedent\u2019s] coat and ran out,\u201d inferentially with his gun. The defendant left \u201cright after the incident took place\u201d and no one else was present at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-10\">Defendant was subsequently linked to the .22 caliber magnum which caused the death by Bennie Miller who was arrested while in possession of it. Miller made a \u201cdeal\u201d with the State and testified that defendant \u201cgave\u201d him the gun. Miller also testified that defendant told him he shot Martin because \u201che was going for his coat ... [b]ecause he was going for his gun.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>Miller testified that Martin \u201cwas known to carry a weapon\u201d, that defendant knew that, and that decedent was always \u201cpacking a pistol.\u201d Miller further stated that Martin was a violent person and was violent \u201c[w]ith a weapon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">Investigator Robert Calcagno testified that decedent\u2019s sister gave him a statement to the effect that Martin \u201chad a gun on the day of the killing.\u201d Vonce testified that he saw Martin use a gun that day to rob \u201ca kid on Monticello for the coke\u201d while they were en route to Owens\u2019 apartment at <em>7 </em>Monticello Avenue. Martin remained in Vonce\u2019s presence from the time of the robbery until they reached th\u00e9 apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">Defendant submitted a written \u201crequest to charge\u201d for instructions on \u201cjustification\u2014self defense;\u201d \u201cmurder\u2014manslaughter,\u201d including imperfect self-defense, citing <em>State v. Bowens, </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>622, 633, 532 A.2d 215 (1987); \u201creckless manslaughter,\u201d including both the self defense and imperfect self-defense concepts, again citing <em>State v. Bowens; </em>\u201caggravated manslaughter,\u201d \u201cmanslaughter\u201d and by virtue of a \u201ckilling ... committed in the heat of passion resulting from a reasonable provocation\u201d and \u201cintoxication negating an element of the offense.\u201d He sought that the following instructions be included:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-8\">If you find that the State has failed to convince you beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant did <em>not </em>act in self-defense, you must find him not guilty. If, however, you find that the State has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant did not act in self-defense, as I have defined it for you, but you find that the defendant acted in the honest, but unreasonable belief in the necessity to use force, you may consider that evidence in determining whether he acted purposely or knowingly or whether his conscious design was to protect himself against the threat of deadly force. In other words, if you find that the defendant honestly but mistakenly resorted to self-defense, you may conclude that he acted recklessly rather than purposely and knowingly. If you should so find, then you must consider the lesser offenses of manslaughter and aggravated manslaughter____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>Before summations defendant orally developed his written request for a charge on \u201cpassion/provocation manslaughter\u201d, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-6\">... I think the Court has to charge heat of passion manslaughter. I think it\u2019s in the case by virtue of the testimony both of Owens and of Barry Vonce that there was provocation. The jury has to decide whether or not it was just words or whether it was words and some sort of conduct that threatened Mr. Pridgen beyond mere words, and then heat, as in heat of passion, has actually been a word that\u2019s been used in conjunction with the incident itself by the witnesses, that there was action taken by Abdul [decedent], and as a result of that, things heated up and got very emotional and I think that that gets us in the area of what I referred to as common-law manslaughter and then I\u2019ve\u2014I think I\u2019ve made my position clear on self-defense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">The trial judge charged the jury on murder and the lesser included offenses of aggravated manslaughter and manslaughter. However, the judge never charged the jury, as requested by defendant, on the theory of imperfect self-defense or passion/provocation manslaughter. At the conclusion of the court\u2019s instructions to the jury, defendant objected to the judge\u2019s \u201cnot instructing that the jury can consider the evidence connected to self-defense as bearing on the elements of aggravated manslaughter and manslaughter.\u201d According to counsel, \u201c[t]hat\u2019s <em>State v. Bowens, </em>and I have a proposed charge that I submitted to the Court____\u201d The prosecutor agreed that the court didn\u2019t charge that \u201cif [defendant] held an honest but unreasonable belief, then that could go to whether it was purposeful or knowing, as to the murder\u201d and stated \u201c... I think the [Supreme] Court in <em>State v. Bowens </em>said they could use that honest but unreasonable belief to determine whether in fact the defendant acted knowingly and purposefully.\u201d Defendant insisted that the concept also applied to aggravated manslaughter and reckless manslaughter with respect to \u201cmotive.\u201d In response, the judge said that he would so \u201ctell\u201d the jury, even though he thought it had already been so advised. In his supplementary instructions, however, the court merely reiterated that the concept of self-defense applied with respect to all three of the charges. Nothing was ever mentioned regarding the principle of imperfect self-defense as developed in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number><em>Bowens. </em>Defendant asserts that the failure to charge the jury in accordance with <em>Bowens </em>requires reversal of his aggravated manslaughter conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">In <em>Bowens, </em>the Supreme Court held that the Code of Criminal Justice does not recognize imperfect self-defense as an independent category of excuse, justification or mitigation. 108 <em>N.J. </em>at 626, 532 <em>A.</em>2d 215. The Legislature expressly requires defendant\u2019s conduct to be reasonable in order to provide the self-defense justification. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2C:3-4(a), 2C:3-9 as amended by L.1981, c. 290; <em>State v. Bowens, supra, </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>at 629-30, 532 A.2d 215. However, as the Supreme Court noted, evidence supporting the common-law defense is \u201cfrequently relevant to the presence or absence of the essential elements of Code offenses.\u201d 108 <em>N.J. </em>at 626, 532 <em>A.2d </em>215. Thus, in a murder prosecution,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-6\">[i]f a defendant subjectively thinks that self-defense is necessary but does not intend a fatal injury, in either the sense of knowledge or purpose, such evidence is relevant to the State\u2019s case on that issue. <em>If a defendant is aware that his or her acts create a risk of serious harm, but unreasonably disregards that risk, </em>then, if the essential elements of the crime are present, the defendant can be found guilty of manslaughter as defined by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:11-4a or b, instead of murder. [108 <em>N.J. </em>at 641, 532 <em>A.2d </em>215. (emphasis added)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">Hence, the Court recognized that an honest belief in the need for force, although not reasonable, might affect defendant\u2019s culpability, thereby warranting only an aggravated manslaughter or manslaughter conviction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The elements of aggravated manslaughter and the lesser included offense of reckless manslaughter are identical, except for the difference in the degree of risk of death; an aggravated manslaughter results if the risk is a probability as opposed to a possibility. <em>State v. Curtis, </em>195 <em>N.J.Super. </em>354, 364, 479 A.2d 425 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied </em>99 <em>N.J. </em>212, 491 <em>A.2d </em>708 (1984). Accordingly, the trial court improperly failed to charge the impact of imperfect self-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>defense, to the extent authorized in <em>Bowens, </em>on the murder charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">We recognize that \u201creckless\u201d conduct requires that the actor \u201cconsciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:2-2b(3). We also acknowledge that \u201c[t]he State always has the burden of proving the essential element of the offense, and its failure to prove that defendant acted recklessly, as defined by the Code, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:2-2b(3), prohibits a conviction for aggravated manslaughter or manslaughter, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:11-4, just as the failure to prove the requisite culpability would prevent conviction for a purposeful or knowing homicide, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:11-3.\u201d <em>State v. Juinta, </em>224 <em>N.J.Super. </em>711, 723-724, 541 A.2d 284 (App.Div.1988) certif. den. 113 <em>N.J. </em>339, 550 A.2d 453 (1988). However, as noted, the 1980 amendments to the Code deleted the statutory justification of imperfect self-defense, and we do not read <em>Bowens </em>as holding that an honest, but unreasonable, belief in the need for force has any relation to a crime with a reckless culpability requirement. As stated in <em>Bowens,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-7\">[w]hen we speak of mitigation in this context, we mean a generalized mitigation that would reduce murder to manslaughter, not specific evidence that bears on the substantive elements of an offense____ We are left with this indefiniteness. The Legislature has not specifically stated that an honest but unreasonable belief, although not a justification for an unlawful homicide, might nonetheless constitute a mitigation of unlawful homicide. We believe that it does not. [108 <em>NJ </em>at 630-631, 532 A.2d 215].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-9\">In <em>Bowens, </em>the Supreme Court affirmed our reversal of defendant\u2019s conviction for murder where the trial judge failed to charge either aggravated manslaughter or manslaughter as lesser offenses. However, in the companion case of <em>State v. Rivers, </em>the Court affirmed the conviction for aggravated manslaughter where the jury, as here, had been charged on murder, aggravated manslaughter and reckless manslaughter. <em>Bowens, </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>at 637, 532 A.2d 215. The Court found that the trial court had given the jury the opportunity to assess the evidence relating to \u201chis honest, if not reasonable, belief in the necessity to use force\u201d as it bore on the issue of whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>defendant acted purposely or knowingly. <em>Id. </em>at 636, 532 <em>A.</em>2d 215.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, while the jury should have been instructed on the impact of an unreasonable but honest belief in the need to use force in self-defense, to the extent permitted in <em>Bowens </em>with respect to the murder charge, we nevertheless conclude that given defendant\u2019s conviction for aggravated manslaughter, an offense requiring only a reckless culpability, defendant suffered no harm or prejudice in this respect. <em>See also State v. Coyle, </em>119 <em>N.J. </em>194, 228, 574 A.2d 951 (1990) (\u201cThe trial court need not charge separately that \u2018imperfect self-defense would serve to reduce murder to an unspecified degree of manslaughter.\u2019 ... The trial court\u2019s instructions ... properly encompassed only purposeful murder and the lesser-included offenses of aggravated manslaughter, reckless manslaughter and passion/provocation manslaughter\u201d); <em>State v. Pitts, </em>116 <em>N.J. </em>580, 604-607, 562 <em>A.2d </em>1320 (1989). Further, because we reverse the conviction in the absence of a requested charge on passion/provocation manslaughter, and because the issue of a charge on imperfect self-defense might well again arise, we add that instructions on imperfect self-defense, to the extent authorized in <em>State v. Bowens, </em>should not be given with respect to the crimes of aggravated manslaughter or reckless manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">As noted, the trial judge charged the jury on murder, aggravated manslaughter, reckless manslaughter, and self-defense. He did not charge the jury on passion/provocation manslaugh<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>ter, although such a charge was requested. Passion/provocation manslaughter is \u201c[a] homicide which would otherwise be murder ... [that] is committed in the heat of passion resulting from a reasonable provocation.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:11-4b(2). \u201cPassion/provocation manslaughter has four elements: the provocation must be adequate; the defendant must not have had time to cool off between the provocation and the slaying; the provocation must have actually impassioned the defendant; and the defendant must not have actually cooled off before the slaying.\u201d <em>State v. Mauricio, </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>402, 411, 568 <em>A.</em>2d 879 (1990). \u201cIf a slaying does not include all of those elements, the offense of passion/provocation manslaughter cannot be demonstrated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As pointed out in <em>State v. Crisantos (Arriagas), </em>102 <em>N.J. </em>265, 508 <em>A.</em>2d 167 (1986):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-6\">Another common-law rule was that mutual combat under certain circumstances could constitute adequate provocation to reduce murder to manslaughter ... However, \u2018to reduce the offense from murder to manslaughter the contest must have been waged on equal terms and no unfair advantage taken of the deceased. * * The offense is not manslaughter but murder where the defendant alone was armed; and took an unfair advantage of the deceased.\u2019 1 <em>Warren on Homicide, supra, </em>\u00a7 110 at 525-526. Another authority expresses the same rule in these terms: \u2018But if a person, under color of fighting on equal terms, kills the other with a deadly weapon which he used from the beginning or concealed on his person from the beginning, the homicide constitutes murder\u2019. 2 <em>Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law, supra, </em>\u00a7 110 at 254 [102 <em>N.J. </em>at 274-275, 508 A.2d 167 (footnote omitted)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">However, as the Court in <em>Crisantos (Arriagas) </em>also noted, \u201c[b]ecause the issue of passion/provocation can arise in an infinite number of factual settings, mitigation of homicide because of passion/provocation is ordinarily a question for the jury, unless the evidence is so weak as to preclude jury consideration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 275, 508 <em>A.</em>2d 167. In this regard, the Court further explained that \u201cthe rational-basis test of the Code [under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:1-8e] imposes a low threshold\u201d such that \u201c[w]hen the lesser-included offense charge is requested by a defendant ... the trial court is obligated, in view of defendant\u2019s interest, to examine the record thoroughly to determine if the rational-basis standard has been satisfied\u201d 102 <em>N.J. </em>at 278, 508 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number><em>A.</em>2d 167. <em>See also State v. Choice, </em>98 <em>N.J. </em>295, 298-299, 486 A.2d 833 (1985); <em>State v. Powell, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>305, 318-319, 419 A.2d 406 (1980). Further, as stated in <em>State v. Mauricio, </em>\u201c[t]he point to be made is that when a defendant requests a charge on passion/provocation manslaughter as a lesser-included offense of murder, the trial court should instruct the jury on that form of manslaughter if an examination of the record discloses that the evidence satisfies the rational-basis standard ... \u201d, <em>Mauricio, supra, 117 N.J. </em>at 417-418, 568 A.2d 879. Stated differently:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-5\">\u201cWhen the record contains evidence of passion/provocation, the State can obtain a murder conviction only if it proves beyond a reasonable doubt that the purposeful killing was <em>not </em>the product of passion/provocation. <em>State v. Powell, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>305, 314, 419 A.2d 406 (1980). If there is sufficient evidence of passion/provocation, a trial court <em>must </em>instruct the jury that \u2018to find murder it must be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused did not kill in the heat of passion * * <em>State v. Grunow, </em>... 102 <em>N.J. </em>[133] at 145, 506 A.2d 708 [(1986)].\u201d <em>[State v. Coyle, supra, </em>119 <em>N.J. </em>at 221-222, 574 A.2d 951. (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">In light of defendant\u2019s passion/provocation request, as in <em>Mauricio, </em>\u201cthe trial court\u2019s failure to have delivered the <em>requested </em>charge amounted to reversible error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>at 418, 568 A.2d 879 (emphasis added). Considering the record most favorably towards defendant, including the possibility that he observed Martin\u2019s gun, the decedent\u2019s aggression and defendant\u2019s perception of the victim\u2019s reputation for violence, a jury question as to passion/provocation was presented. Further, particularly given defendant\u2019s acquittal of possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose and the ongoing argument, we cannot conclude that his initially concealed possession of the handgun prior to the shooting prevents application of the doctrine in light of the ongoing argument. <em>See State v. Crisantos (Arriagas), supra, </em>102 <em>N.J. </em>at 280, 508 A.2d 167, where defense was inapplicable because it was inconsistent with the position of both parties and the record; <em>State v. Grunow, supra, </em>102 <em>N.J. </em>at 135, 506 A.2d 708, where the principle was applicable in light of a \u201cviolent emotional confrontation during which\u201d the decedent attacked defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>We recognize that defendant has been acquitted of murder and that passion/provocation manslaughter involves the same purposeful or knowing culpability requirement, as it involves what otherwise would be murder but for its being \u201ccommitted in the heat of passion resulting from a reasonable provocation\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:11-4b(2). We also recognize that defendant must be retried for aggravated manslaughter and lesser offenses but cannot be retried for murder. Nevertheless, the issue of passion/provocation manslaughter may be presented to the jury at defendant\u2019s retrial. In <em>State v. Grunow, supra, </em>the trial court, while charging passion/provocation manslaughter at defendant\u2019s capital murder trial, improperly placed the burden of proving reasonable provocation on defendant. In holding that passion/provocation manslaughter could be presented at a retrial, despite the initial conviction for aggravated manslaughter, the Supreme Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-6\">We recognize that our holding on the availability of passion/provocation to mitigate aggravated manslaughter will raise practical problems in presenting the issues to the jury on the retrial since the defendant cannot be retried for murder. We believe, however, that if the evidence presented at the retrial warrants, the court can clarify that passion/provocation manslaughter may be an available verdict if the jury finds from the evidence that the State has proven the elements of that offense beyond a reasonable doubt. [102 <em>N.J. </em>at 149, 506 A.2d 708],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">Reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b274-10\">Barry Vonce later explained that the subject of the argument related to drugs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b278-8\">The Court also suggested that the same may be true with respect to passion/provocation manslaughter \"[i]n some circumstances.\" <em>Id. </em>at 641, 532 A.2d 215.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b280-7\">Given <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:2-2b(3) defining \u201crecklessly\" and the elements of aggravated manslaughter and reckless manslaughter, both requiring that the defendant act \u201crecklessly,\" <em>see N.J.S.A. </em>2C:11-4a, b, we can understand why an honest, but unreasonable, belief in the need for the use of force could affect culpability and why the jury should be so advised.
