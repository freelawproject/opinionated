Under that provision, good cause exists when:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-6\">The owner of a building of three residential units or less seeks to personally occupy a unit, or has contracted to sell the residential unit to a buyer who wishes to personally occupy it and the contract for sale calls for the unit to be vacant at the time of closing____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">The tenant appealed, contending that a corporate owner intending to operate its business in its building is not \u201cseek[ing] to personally occupy a unit\u201d within the meaning of the statute. We agree and therefore reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">Plaintiff Aquino Colonial Funeral Home, a corporation, operates its funeral home business in a portion of a building that it owns. It rents the remainder of the building to two tenants for residential apartments. In order to expand its business premises into the space now occupied by one of its residential tenants, defendant Veronica Pittari<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>, plaintiff commenced this suit for eviction pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:18\u201461.1(l)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-9\">Mr. Vincent Lombardo testified on behalf of plaintiff. He stated that he and his wife are Aquino Funeral Home\u2019s sole stockholders and that he is its only employee. The funeral home may be in operation at any hour of the day or night, and Mr. Lombardo works 60 or 70 hours a week. He wants to move his office to the second floor, where Ms. Pittari\u2019s apartment is now located, so that his files, which are scattered throughout his premises, can be consolidated there, and so that he can meet in greater privacy with persons who come to arrange for funerals.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-10\">There is no reported appellate decision which has determined whether business or professional use of premises constitutes \u201cpersonally occupying]\u201d them within the meaning of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:18-61.1(Z )(3). The only reported trial court decision on point is <em>Gross v. Barriosi, </em>168 <em>N.J.Super. </em>149, 401 <em>A.</em>2d 1127 (Cty.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>1979). There a podiatrist wanted to put his professional office in part of a building that he owned. The court held that utilizing the building for that purpose would not be \u201cpersonally occupying]\u201d it. <em>Id. </em>at 151, 401 <em>A.</em>2d 1127. <em>Cf. Pappas v. Huezo, </em>237 <em>N.J.Super. </em>492, 494, 568 A.2d 145 (Law Div.1989) (holding that premises used for a dentist\u2019s office are not \u201cowner-occupied\u201d within the meaning of the introductory paragraph of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:18-61.1). <em>But cf. Lewis v. Traynham, </em>234 <em>N.J.Super. </em>121, 126-127, 560 A.2d 120 (Law Div.1989) (holding that premises used for a beauty parlor are \u201cowner-occupied\u201d within the meaning of the introductory paragraph of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:18-61.1).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">We therefore turn to the statute itself. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:18-61.-1 <em>{l </em>)(3) focuses on residential use. The section deals only with \u201ca building of three <em>residential </em>units or less\u201d and with an owner who either \u201cseeks to personally occupy a unit,\u201d i.e., one of those three <em>residential </em>units, or who has \u201ccontracted to sell the <em>residential unit </em>to a buyer who wishes to personally occupy it____\u201d (Emphasis added.) In view of the language of (/ )(3), an owner\u2019s prospective utilization of a portion of his building for a non-residential purpose could not even arguably constitute \u201cgood cause\u201d under that section except in the infrequent case where, as in the present instance, a landlord seeks to convert a residential unit to his own non-residential use. However, to permit a landlord to displace a residential tenant in order to make room for a non-residential use, even the landlord\u2019s own non-residential use, would be inconsistent with the legislative intent of the Anti-Eviction Act. The Anti-Eviction Act is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-8\">intended \u201cto protect residential tenants from the effects of what the Legislature has deemed to be a severe shortage of rental housing in this state.\u201d <em>Harden v. Pritzert, </em>178 <em>N.J.Super. </em>237, 240 [428 A.2d 927] (App.Div.1981). The statute is framed to afford \u201cresidential tenants the right, absent good cause for eviction, to continue to live in their homes without fear of eviction or lease non-renewal and thereby to protect them from involuntary displacement.\u201d <em>Morristown Mem. Hosp. v. Wokem Mtge. &amp; Realty, </em>192 <em>N.J.Super. </em>182, 186 [469 A.2d 515] (App.Div.1983).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b621-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number><em>Durruthy v. Brunert, </em>228 <em>N.J.Super. </em>199, 202, 549 <em>A.</em>2d 456 (App.Div.1988), <em>certif. denied </em>114 <em>N.J. </em>482, 555 A.2d 607 (1989); <em>see also </em>Statement to <em>Assembly Bill </em>1586, L.1974, <em>a </em>49, \u00a7 2, <em>quoted in Sabato v. Sabato, </em>135 <em>N.J.Super. </em>158, 164, 342 A.2d 886 (Law Div.1975), <em>overruled, Putirich v. Smith, </em>170 <em>N.J.Super. </em>572, 407 A.2d 842 (App.Div.1979) (The legislative purpose for enactment of the Anti-Etiction Act was to prevent \u201cresidential tenants ... [from being] unfairly and arbitrarily ousted from housing quarters in which they have been comfortable and where they have not caused any problems ... [at a time when] there is a critical shortage of rental housing space in New Jersey.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"Au0\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:18-61.1(Z) was enacted in response to <em>Sabato v. Sabato, supra, </em>135 <em>N.J.Super. </em>158, 342 A.2d 886. In <em>Sabato, </em>a new owner had acquired a three-family house five days before the effective date of the Anti-Eviction Act. The Act purported to prohibit him from evicting a tenant, even in order to live in the house himself. He challenged the constitutionality of the statute. <em>Id. </em>at 163-164, 342 A.2d 886. The court held that \u201cto the limited extent that [the statute] prohibits an owner from occupying any rental unit except for two-family dwellings the act breaches the constitutional safeguard of due process and must yield.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 176, 342 A.2d 886. The court called on the legislature to amend the Anti-Eviction Act in order to cure what the court viewed as a flaw that rendered the statute unconstitutional. <em>See </em>Note, <em>New Jersey\u2019s Anti-Eviction Act Prohibits Removal of Residential Tenants by Foreclosing Mortgagee Upon Default of Landlord-Mortgagor, Absent \u201cGood Causes, \u201d </em>11 <em>Seton Hall L.R. </em>311, 315-318 and especially nn. 31 and 37 (1980). Shortly thereafter, the Legislature enacted <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:18-61.1(Z)(3) of the Anti-Eviction Act in order \u201cto assure that the owner of a building with a small number of residential units can reside in his own building and have some control over the persons with whom he lives.\u201d <em>Durruthy v. Brunert, supra, </em>228 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 202, 549 <em>A.</em>2d 456. In view of this origin and purpose of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:18-61.1(Z )(3), it would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>be an unwarranted distortion of the meaning of the statute to interpret \u201cpersonally occupy\u201d as embracing a corporation\u2019s business use of a tenant\u2019s residential apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">Furthermore, the \u201cowner-occupied\u201d exemption from the scope of the Anti-Eviction Act, found in the introductory paragraph to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:18-61.1, and the \u201cgood cause\u201d for eviction defined in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:18-61.1(Z )(3) are \u201ccomplementary.\u201d <em>See Dempsey v. Mastropasqua, </em>242 <em>N.J.Super. </em>234, 239, 576 A.2d 335 (App.Div.1990); <em>Durruthy v. Brunert, supra, </em>228 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 202, 549 A.2d 456. The exemption permits a landlord who already occupies his own building with no more than two rental units to evict a tenant without demonstrating \u201cgood cause,\u201d and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:18-61.1(Z )(3) permits a landlord who does not yet occupy the building to displace a tenant in order to make an apartment available for his own use. The meaning of \u201cowner-occupied\u201d in the introductory paragraph of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2AA8-61.1 therefore sheds light on the meaning of \u201cpersonally occupy\u201d in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:18-61.1(Z )(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">As previously noted, the introductory paragraph of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2AA8-61.1 prohibits the removal of a tenant from \u201cany house, building, mobile home or land in a mobile home park or tenement leased for residential purposes, other than____\u201d With the exception of \u201cbuilding,\u201d each of the enumerated terms connotes use as a dwelling place. In context, \u201cbuilding,\u201d too, implies a structure used at least in part for residential purposes since a non-residential tenancy is not protected by the Anti-Eviction Act. Similarly, in that same paragraph\u2019s exemption for \u201cowner-occupied premises with not more than two rental units or a hotel, motel or other guest house or part thereof rented to a transient guest or seasonal tenant,\u201d all of the enumerated structures except \u201cowner-occupied premises with not more than two rental units\u201d denote dwelling places. It is a general rule of statutory construction that \u201cwhen general words follow specifically named things of a particular class, the general words must be understood as limited to things of the same general class, or at least of the same general character.\u201d <em>Transconti</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number><em>nental Gas Pipeline Corp. v. Dept. of Conservation, </em>43 <em>N.J. </em>135, 146, 202 A.2d 849 (1964). This rule supports the view that when the legislature used the term \u201cowner-occupied premises,\u201d it was referring to real estate that the owner was using for residential purposes. Since the scope of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A: 18-61.-1(/ )(3) is \u201ccomplementary\u201d to that of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2AA8-61.1, this interpretation of \u201cowner-occupied\u201d tends to confirm that \u201cpersonally occupy\u201d in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:18-61.1(Z )(3) also refers to occupancy of a residential unit as a dwelling.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">The judgment appealed from is therefore reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b619-11\">The caption of this case refers to Anthony Pittari and Veronica Pittari, but the record mentions only Veronica. We will therefore refer only to one defendant, Veronica Pittari.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
