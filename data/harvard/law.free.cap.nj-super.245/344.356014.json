On appeal, plaintiff contends that the trial judge erred in concluding that her claim for \u201cpermanent\u201d emotional distress was barred by the Tort Claims Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:9-2d. She-argues that \u201cpermanent\u201d emotional distress constitutes a \u201cpermanent loss of a bodily function\u201d and therefore is not subject to the statutory bar. She also asserts that the jury\u2019s verdicts on the issue of negligence were inconsistent, and therefore must be set aside. Defendants in their cross-appeal argue that the trial judge erred in failing to dismiss plaintiff\u2019s claim for emotional distress under <em>Portee v. Jaffee, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>88, 417 A.2d 521 (1980) and in admitting evidence of plaintiff\u2019s emotional distress.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-10\">While returning to their Westbury, New York home from Atlantic City at approximately 11:00 p.m., plaintiff and her late husband Harold Srebnik were involved in a one-car accident on the Garden State Parkway. The vehicle operated by Mr. Srebnik veered off the parkway near mile post 103, hit a guardrail, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>flipped over and came to a halt in a ditch below the surface level of the roadway. A witness who saw the accident reported it to a toll-booth operator at the Asbury Park toll plaza, and a radio dispatcher transmitted the report to the state police. A search of the area that evening by a state trooper in the vicinity of mile post 103 was unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">Plaintiff remained in the vehicle until daylight the next morning. While in the car she heard \u201cmoan[s] and groan[s]\u201d from her husband. At dawn, plaintiff crawled out of the vehicle despite pain in her chest and swelling in one leg. After exiting the vehicle she observed her husband lying face down approximately 30 feet away. Upon observing him, plaintiff knew he was dead.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">At 8:14 a.m. a state trooper, while on routine patrol, found plaintiff, her deceased husband and their disabled vehicle in the ditch. Plaintiff was taken to the Jersey Shore Medical Center where she remained for three weeks. She was treated for various injuries, including a collapsed lung.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">The gravamen of plaintiff\u2019s complaint is that defendants failed to respond reasonably and promptly to reports of the accident and to make a thorough search of the accident scene. She claims that as a result of defendants\u2019 failure to \u201cprovide immediate and/or timely assistance\u201d Mr. Srebnik\u2019s chance of survival was lost, and she was caused to suffer \u201cpermanent ... emotional and psychological\u201d pain.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b379-9\">Plaintiff testified that while hospitalized she consulted by phone with a psychotherapist on approximately 20 occasions. Upon her release she underwent psychotherapy twice a week because of recurrent fear of dying, frequent nightmares, loneliness and depression. She continued the therapy for over three <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>years. She described her emotional distress during this period as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-5\">Well, I had some old stuff that came back; fear of dying was probably my biggest problem. Fear of death, waking up during the night with as I was having like a heart attack feeling, anxiety during the night. A lot of guilt about my having survived, my husband having died, not being at the funeral. Wasn\u2019t sure about you know, I hope they have the right body in the casket____ I had a recurrent nightmares in one form or another of the accident. My whole life was upside down. I was worried about the future, worried about how I\u2019m going to manage.... I was apprehensive about running [the family coffee shop] by myself because I knew how strong my husband was in the business. I just really was helping him. A total disruption of my family life. I now became a lonely abandoned person although my children were wonderful.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">Plaintiff\u2019s expert, Dr. Steven Stein, a psychologist, testified that plaintiff was \u201cquite depressed,\u201d suffered flashbacks of the accident, night terrors and a sense of panic, all consistent with a post-traumatic stress disorder. According to Stein, plaintiff had developed a \u201cworkaholic pattern,\u201d focusing her life totally on her work without any socialization. It was Stem\u2019s view that plaintiff suffered from depression as well as a \u201cpattern of perceptual withdrawal,\u201d an inability to see the surrounding environment accurately. She also suffered from confusion, anxiety and a sense of hopelessness. He diagnosed plaintiff as suffering from chronic post-traumatic stress disorder, a condition he concluded was \u201cpermanent\u201d in nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-9\">At the close of plaintiff\u2019s case, the trial judge dismissed plaintiff\u2019s claim for emotional distress suffered as a direct consequence of defendants\u2019 conduct, reasoning that since it constituted \u201cpain and suffering,\u201d <em>see Ayers v. Township of Jackson, </em>106 <em>N.J. </em>557, 576, 525 A.2d 287 (1987), it was barred by the Tort Claims Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:9-2d. However, the trial judge declined to dismiss plaintiff's emotional distress claim under <em>Portee; </em>that is, distress resulting from the perception of her husband\u2019s death. <em>See </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>at 100-101, 417 A.2d 521. He reasoned that the Legislature did not intend to insulate the municipal entities from <em>Portee </em>claims in view of the policy considerations attending the \u201cmarital or intimate familia[l] relationship between plaintiff and the injured person.\u201d In response <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>to special interrogatories, the jury found that defendants were not negligent as to the wrongful death of Harold Srebnik, but were negligent as to plaintiffs <em>Portee </em>claim. However, the jury apportioned liability with respect to that claim as follows: the Estate of Harold Srebnik 61 percent; the State 13 percent, and the Highway Authority 26 percent. Since the comparative negligence of the estate exceeded 50 percent, the trial judge entered a verdict of no cause for action in defendants\u2019 favor on the <em>Portee </em>claim. <em>See id. </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>at 101-102, 417 A.2d 521.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">We agree with the trial judge that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:9-2d, as interpreted by <em>Ayers v. Township of Jackson, supra, </em>106 <em>N.J. </em>557, 525 A.2d 287, compels rejection of plaintiff\u2019s direct emotional distress claim. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:9-2d provides in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-7\">No damages shall be awarded against a public entity or public employee for pain and suffering resulting from any injury; provided, however, that this limitation on the recovery of damages for pain and suffering shall not apply in cases of permanent loss of a bodily function, permanent disfigurement or dismemberment where the medical treatment expenses are in excess of $1,000.00.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">In <em>Ayers, </em>the Supreme Court concluded that tortiously inflicted emotional distress is as much an \u201cinjury\u201d under the statute as \u201ca broken limb).]\u201d 106 <em>N.J. </em>at 577, 525 A.2d 287. However, the court concluded that the \u201csubjective symptoms of depression, stress, health concerns, and anxiety\u201d described by the plaintiffs, who had been exposed to carcinogens in their well water, constituted \u201cpain and suffering resulting from any injury\u201d and therefore was subject to the bar of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:9-2d. 106 <em>N.J. </em>at 576, 525 A.2d 287. In so holding, <em>Ayers </em>cited the legislative policy that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-9\">in view of the economic burdens presently facing public entities a claimant should not be reimbursed for <em>non-objective types of damages, </em>such as pain and suffering, except in aggravated circumstances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-10\">Comment, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:9-2 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-11\">In light of the <em>Ayers </em>holding that emotional distress constitutes \u201cpain and suffering,\u201d plaintiff\u2019s claim here is barred unless she suffered \u201cpermanent loss of a bodily function, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>permanent disfigurement or dismemberment where the medical treatment expenses are in excess of <em>$1,000.00.\"</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In this regard, it is not disputed that plaintiff\u2019s <em>physical </em>injuries resulted from the initial accident, the cause of which was not attributable to either defendant. Therefore, any <em>physical </em>injury caused by the accident, resulting in \u201cpermanent loss of a bodily function,\u201d is of no consequence in resolving whether plaintiff\u2019s emotional distress claim is barred. Plaintiff nevertheless argues that her depression and stress disorder, independent of physical injuries, constitute a \u201cpermanent loss of a bodily function\u201d because the condition has \u201cpermanently\u201d prevented her from carrying out her ordinary day-to-day functions.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">Neither the Act nor <em>Ayers </em>equates \u201cpermanent\u201d emotional injury with \u201cpermanent loss of a bodily function.\u201d As we read <em>Ayers, </em>it interprets the Act as barring claims involving intangible \u201csubjective symptoms\u201d associated with personal injuries, irrespective of the severity or duration of the symptoms, absent the aggravating circumstances enumerated in the Act. Indeed, some of the <em>Ayers </em>plaintiffs tested by their clinical psychologist manifested \u201cabnormally high levels\u201d of stress, depression, health concerns and psychological problems. 106 <em>N.J. </em>at 573, 525 A.2d 287. Therefore, under the <em>Ayers </em>rationale, symptoms of depression and stress are \u201csubjective\u201d and \u201cnon-objective types of damages,\u201d whether temporary or permanent in nature. <em>See also Marion v. Borough of Manasquan, </em>231 <em>N.J.Super. </em>320, 331-332, 555 A.2d 699 (App.Div.1989); <em>Mercado v. State, </em>212 <em>N.J.Super. </em>487, 493-494, 515 A.2d 804 (Law Div.1985); <em>Acevedo v. County of Essex, </em>207 <em>N.J.Super. </em>579, 587-588, 504 A.2d 813 (Law Div.1985); <em>LaBarrie v. Housing Auth. of City of Jersey City, </em>143 <em>N.J.Super. </em>61, 64, 362 A.2d 624 (Law Div.1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>Moreover, the term \u201cpermanent loss of a bodily function\u201d must be read in conjunction with its associated words \u201cpermanent disfigurement or dismemberment.\u201d <em>See Germany, v. Matriss, </em>55 <em>N.J. </em>193, 220-221, 260 A.2d 825 (1970). These later words unquestionably pertain to injury to the <em>physical </em>components of the body, not the injured party\u2019s psyche. We must therefore assume that the Legislature intended the same meaning when it used \u201cpermanent loss of a bodily function.\u201d Moreover, while \u201cinjury\u201d is defined by the Act, <em>see N.J.S.A. </em>59:1-3, the terms \u201cbodily,\u201d \u201cbodily injury,\u201d or \u201cbodily function\u201d are not. Consequently, we give the terms their ordinary and well understood meaning. <em>See Mortimer v. Board of Review, </em>99 <em>N.J. </em>393, 398, 493 A.2d 1 (1985); <em>State v. Walker, </em>216 <em>N.J.Super. </em>39, 42, 522 A.2d 1021 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>179, 528 A.2d 10 (1987). \u201cBodily\u201d is defined as \u201c[pjertaining to or concerning the body; of or belonging to the body or the physical constitution; not mental but corporeal.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>159 (5th ed. 1979). \u201cBodily condition\u201d is defined as the \u201c[sjtatus of human body at a given point in time as contrasted with state of mind.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">We are satisfied that damages for emotional distress are recoverable, not only if they result from a permanent debilitating or disfiguring physical injury, but also if they result in permanent physical sequelae such as disabling tremors, paralysis or loss of eyesight; that is, a \u201cpermanent loss of a bodily function.\u201d Damages resulting from subjective symptoms of depression and anxiety, without the requisite indicia of permanent physical infirmity, are not recoverable under the Act. In our view, this reading is consistent with the Act\u2019s underlying policy of precluding recovery for \u201cnon-objective types of damages\u201d except for aggravated circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">Here, although we by no means intend to minimize the emotional trauma suffered by plaintiff as a result of this tragic episode, we agree with the trial judge that plaintiff did not suffer a \u201cpermanent loss of a bodily function.\u201d Her depression <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>and stress did not result from a physical injury, the cause of which is attributable to defendant public entities. Her distress has not resulted in any physically disabling infirmity. Approximately four months after the accident she was able to resume full time her work at the family coffee shop, and after approximately one year she resumed an active social life. In short, the residua of the unfortunate emotional trauma constitute the intangible subjective symptoms of depression, stress and anxiety barred by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:9-2d.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">Plaintiff also argues that her new trial motion should have been granted because the jury verdicts as to the question of negligence were inconsistent. As stated, with respect to plaintiff\u2019s wrongful death claim, the jury found that defendants were not negligent. However, as to plaintiff\u2019s <em>Portee </em>claim, the jury found defendants collectively 39 percent negligent. Plaintiff urges that since the theory of negligence against defendants on both the wrongful death and emotional distress claims was identical, the negligence verdicts are inconsistent. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">Preliminarily, we are of the view that the <em>Portee </em>claim never should have been presented to the jury. In applying the Tort Claims Act, we perceive no difference between a direct claim for an emotional injury and a derivative claim for emotional distress under <em>Portee. </em>Indeed the underlying policy of barring \u201cnon-objective types of damages\u201d applies to both direct and derivative claims. We recognize the policy considerations implicated in <em>Portee </em>which allow recovery for the emotional trauma resulting from the \u201capprehension of the death or serious injury of one whose very existence is a precious treasure.\u201d <em>Portee v. Jaffee, supra, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>at 97, 417 <em>A.</em>2d 521. However, <em>Portee </em>was not decided in the context of the Act. As stated, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:9-2d bars <em>any </em>claim for emotional distress (pain and suffering) short of the aggravating circumstances set forth in the statute. It does not expressly or impliedly exempt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number><em>Portee </em>claims, notwithstanding the laudable policy underpinnings of the <em>Portee </em>decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">We must also be mindful that the intent of the Act was to reestablish the immunity of all public entities except in the circumstances enumerated in the Act. <em>See Birckwood Lakes Colony Club v. Borough of Medford Lakes, </em>90 <em>N.J. </em>582, 596, 449 A.2d 472 (1982). The comment to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:2-1 cautions us that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-7\">the approach should be <em>whether an immunity applies and if not, should liability attach. </em>It is hoped that in utilizing this approach the courts will exercise restraint in the acceptance of novel causes of action against public entities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">(Emphasis in original); <em>see also Ayers v. Township of Jackson, </em>supra, 106 <em>N.J. </em>at 574, 525 A.2d 287. Hence, without specific legislative authority, we are not empowered to carve an exception to the statutory bar to allow for emotional distress claims under <em>Portee. </em>The trial judge therefore erred in not dismissing the claim. However, since it was not dismissed, we must consider plaintiffs argument respecting the purported inconsistencies in the verdicts, to the extent that the \u201cinconsistencies\u201d may have tainted the wrongful death verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-9\">We find no inconsistency. The jury was faced with two independent claims; the wrongful death of Mr. Srebnik and plaintiffs <em>Portee </em>claim. On the evidence, the jury could have found that the accident was caused solely by Mr. Srebnik\u2019s own negligence. The jury also received testimony from defendants\u2019 medical expert, Dr. Hillel Ben-Asher, that Mr. Srebnik died four minutes after the accident. The jury therefore had a factual basis to conclude that Mr. Srebnik died before the state police could have reasonably responded to the report of the accident. Thus, any subsequent delay in reporting and investigating the accident may well have been deemed irrelevant by the jury in its determination as to whether defendants were negligent vis-a-vis the wrongful death claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-10\">On the other hand, plaintiff\u2019s <em>Portee </em>claim was predicated on the extended and unreasonable delay before the state police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>located her and rendered assistance, and the intervening and subsequent emotional distress she suffered caused by her perception of her dying husband. The jury had a basis to conclude that defendants were negligent in the manner by which they failed to report and investigate the accident, and that the consequential inordinate delay was a proximate cause of plaintiffs emotional distress. In the circumstances we find no inconsistency in the verdicts.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b378-11\">Defendants\u2019 contentions are advanced for consideration by us only if we reverse on plaintiffs appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b379-10\">We are advised that plaintiff, who lived in New York with her husband at the time of the accident, did not file a direct claim against her husband\u2019s estate because such claim is not covered under New York insurance law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b382-6\">Defendants concede that the cost of plaintiffs psychotherapy exceeded $1,000.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
