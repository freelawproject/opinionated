Industries, Inc., (G.F.I). While American has an in-house legal department, for more than 50 years Chadbourne and Parke also has represented American in all facets of its legal affairs. This includes general corporate matters, securities, acquisitions, divestitures, real estate matters, and in various litigation areas including regulatory matters, products liability and contract disputes.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">American\u2019s in-house legal department handled the vast majority of Sunshine\u2019s legal affairs, but was duty bound to bring all its legal matters to the attention of American\u2019s General Counsel. Further, no outside counsel was to be retained or consulted by Sunshine without American\u2019s prior approval. Settlement of all Sunshine claims was subject to review and approval by American. Additionally, all bills for legal services charged to Sunshine were to be sent directly to American for approval before payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">James D. Ferber, Director of Human Resources and Assistant Secretary for Sunshine, a large national corporation, has been employed by that company for 29 years in various capacities and for approximately eight years was a liaison between Sunshine and Chadbourne. Generally, when a legal problem developed at Sunshine, Ferber apparently in contravention of American\u2019s policy, contacted Chadbourne directly. A Chadbourne attorney then was assigned to the matter and kept in direct contact with Sunshine personnel concerning all the aspects thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">Robert L. Austin, Senior Vice-President and Chief Administrative Officer of American certified that Sunshine\u2019s counsel was essentially American\u2019s legal department. He based this conclusion on his understanding that when a legal matter arose Sunshine personnel would contact American\u2019s General Counsel to either handle the matter or retain Chadbourne. In such a case, Chadbourne would always report to American\u2019s General Counsel. Therefore, it was Austin\u2019s belief that there was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>\u201cnever any reasonable expectation on Sunshine\u2019s part that any information it transmitted to Chadbourne would be kept secret or confidential from American.\u201d This was reiterated by Peter N. Millman and Daniel J. O\u2019Neill, members of the Chadbourne firm.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">A close relationship of American\u2019s legal department and the Chadbourne firm has always existed. Currently, of the seven attorneys working in American\u2019s Connecticut legal department, one is a Chadbourne partner and three are Chadbourne associates. Additionally, two attorneys on American\u2019s payroll recently came from Chadbourne.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">The dispute that initiated the instant lawsuit involves G.F.I.\u2019s acquisition of Sunshine from American in April 1988. Chadbourne represented American in the sale, which was accomplished through the sale of Sunshine\u2019s stock to G.F.I. To prepare for the sale, Sunshine had compiled extensive information, the original documents of which were kept at Chadbourne\u2019s offices. Chadbourne also arranged conferences with Sunshine during the negotiations stage to discuss the specific terms of the sale and the condition of Sunshine\u2019s facilities. Chadbourne sent at least two letters directly to the President and C.E.O. of Sunshine to review a draft of the Stock Sale Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-8\">However, Chadbourne insists that it never represented Sunshine itself in the actual sale transaction. Instead, its position is that Sunshine was merely an asset of American\u2019s which was being sold. It claims that its services in reviewing the offering memorandum, preparation of the stock sale agreement, management of American\u2019s interest at the closing of the sale and the general rendering of legal advice and guidance to American were all done in its capacity as attorneys for American.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-9\">This litigation arose when one year after the sale, the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) made an inspection of Sunshine\u2019s Sayreville, New Jersey, bakery and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>issued formal citations as a result. OSHA ordered extensive renovation or replacement of some of Sunshine\u2019s ovens due to defects in the ignition and flame-monitoring devices and of the concrete floors. In this regard, Chadbourne denies ever having worked on a Sunshine matter which related to the floors or oven devices, but admits that in 1985 it did consult with Sunshine regarding an OSHA inspection at the same Sayreville bakery concerning the presence of asbestos in the ovens.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">In December 1989, G.F.I. and Sunshine both filed this suit against American claiming it had misrepresented the condition of Sunshine\u2019s baking facilities and equipment at the time of the sale. American then retained Chadbourne to represent its interest in this lawsuit. According to the plaintiffs, once Chadbourne personnel learned of this lawsuit a partner from that firm contacted two former Sunshine officers in an attempt to obtain information. Subsequently, Pitney, Hardin, Kipp and Szuch (Pitney Hardin) was retained to act as American\u2019s New Jersey counsel and to actually conduct the trial. Chadbourne\u2019s participation in this litigation is limited to the role \u201cof counsel\u201d having caused its name to appear as such on the answer to the complaint and on the brief filed on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">On March 24, 1990 plaintiffs moved to disqualify Chadbourne. After hearing oral arguments on April 12, 1990, Judge Herman L. Breitkopf, A.J.S.C. issued a letter opinion in which he \u201cdisqualified\u201d Chadbourne. He referred therein to Chadbourne and Sunshine\u2019s relationship of 22 years which he concluded, \u201ccasts serious doubt on the propriety of Chadbourne\u2019s continued involvement in this case.\u201d Furthermore, he said that Chadbourne\u2019s access to information regarding the condition of Sunshine\u2019s facilities and the results of prior OSHA inspections, \u201csubstantially related to the litigation at issue and may place Chadbourne in an advantageous position with respect to their representation of American Brands in this matter.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-8\">R.P.C. 1.9 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-9\">(a) A lawyer who has represented a client in a matter shall not thereafter:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>(1) represent another client in the same or a substantially related matter in which that client\u2019s interests are materially adverse to the interests of the former client unless the former client consents after a full disclosure of the circumstances and consultation with the former client; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-5\">(2) use information relating to the representation to the disadvantage of the former client except as RPC 1.6 would permit with respect to a client or when the information has become generally known.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-6\">(b) The provisions of RPC 1.7(c) are applicable as well to situations covered by this rule.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">American claims that the trial court misapplied the \u201csubstantial relationship\u201d test encompassed therein. R.P.C. 1.9(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">When applying the Rules of Professional Conduct, our Supreme Court has cautioned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-9\">When dealing with ethical problems and applying such prophylactic rules, it is apparent that we cannot paint with broad strokes. The conclusion in a particular case can be reached only after \u2018painstaking analysis of the facts and precise application of precedent.\u2019 <em>Reardon v. Marlayne, Inc., </em>83 <em>N.J. </em>460, 469 [416 A.2d 852] (1980).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b45-10\">However, New Jersey has chosen to strictly construe R.P.C. 1.9. <em>Dewey v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>201, 536 A.2d 243 (1988). Indeed, \u201c[i]f there be any doubt as to the propriety of an attorney\u2019s representation of a client, such doubt must be resolved in favor of disqualification.\u201d <em>Reardon, </em>83 <em>N.J. </em>at 471, 416 A.2d 852; <em>see Gray v. Commercial Union Ins. Co., </em>191 <em>N.J.Super. </em>590, 596, 468 A.2d 721 (App.Div.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-11\">In the instant case, American argues that since it always required full disclosure of all Sunshine information, the information obtained from Sunshine in the past should not now be considered confidential within the meaning of <em>Dewey, </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>at 217, 536 A.2d 243 (the Supreme Court \u201cemphasize[d] the fundamental importance of the attorney\u2019s obligation to preserve the client\u2019s confidences\u201d); <em>Reardon, </em>83 <em>N.J. </em>at 469, 416 A.2d 852 (ethical rules are applied \u201cto prevent any possibility, however slight, that confidential information received from a client during a previous relationship may subsequently be used to the client\u2019s disadvantage\u201d); and <em>Gray v. Commercial Union Insur. Co., </em>191 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 598, 468 A.2d 721 (disqualifying an attorney \u201c[w]hen access to secrets and confidential information <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>exists ... \u201d). American thus claims that Sunshine, as its subsidiary, had no expectation that the information Chadbourne acquired would be kept confidential from American. Therefore, it argues, based upon the rationale of <em>Allegaert v. Perot, </em>565 F.2d 246 (2nd Cir.1977) and its progeny, Chadbourne should not be disqualified. <em>Allegaert </em>held that \u201cbefore the substantial relationship test is even implicated, it must be shown that the attorney was in a position where he <em>could </em>have received information which his former client might reasonably have assumed the attorney would withhold from his present client.\u201d (Emphasis in original). <em>Id. </em>at 250.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">However, American\u2019s reliance on <em>Reardon </em>and <em>Gray </em>for such a proposition is questionable since each was decided prior to the enactment of the R.P.C. in question. Those opinions were based on DR4-101 which expressly prohibits an attorney from revealing \u201csecrets and confidences.\u201d Similarly, <em>Allegaert </em>is a 2nd Circuit opinion based on federal Canon 4, mandating that an attorney should preserve a client\u2019s \u201cconfidences and secrets.\u201d In contrast, R.P.C. 1.9(a)(2) does not limit its prohibition to confidential information. It proscribes conduct where a lawyer \u201cuse[s] information relating to the [former] representation to the disadvantage of the former client\u201d and goes well beyond the protection of confidential information.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">Furthermore, in <em>In re Cipriano, </em>68 <em>N.J. </em>398, 404, 346 A.2d 393 (1975) our Supreme Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-7\">To change sides during the struggle, where the subject matter was interrelated with that which the attorney initially handled on behalf of the tenants <em>generates a seeming conflict of interest even if no confidential information had been or would be utilized. </em>(Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b46-8\"><em>See also In re Advisory Opinion No. 544, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>399, 406, 511 A.2d 609 (1986) (concerning R.P.C. 1.6, the \u201cscope of protected information [includes] all information relating to the representation, regardless of the source or whether the client has requested it be kept confidential ...\u201d) Thus, R.P.C. 1.9 is more inclusive than the old Disciplinary Rules or Canons of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>Ethics and therefore, American\u2019s claim that an exception exists for non-confidential information is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">Further, Chadbourne\u2019s representation of American is very likely to create the appearance of impropriety. R.P.C. 1.7(c) and R.P.C. 1.9(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">R.P.C. 1.7(c) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-8\">This rule shall not alter the effect of case law or ethics opinions to the effect that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-9\">(1) in certain cases or categories of cases involving conflicts or apparent conflicts, consent to continued representation is immaterial, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-10\">(2) in certain cases or situations creating an appearance of impropriety rather than an actual conflict, multiple representation is not permissible, that is, in those situations in which an ordinary knowledgeable citizen acquainted with the facts would conclude that the multiple representation poses substantial risk of disservice to either the public interest or the interest of one of the clients.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b47-11\">The question to be resolved in such a case is whether \u201can ordinary knowledgeable citizen acquainted with the facts\u201d would conclude that Chadbourne\u2019s representation of American would pose a \u201csubstantial risk of disservice either to the public interest or the interest of one of the clients.\u201d <em>Dewey, </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>at 216, 536 A.2d 243; R.P.C. 1.7(c)(2). In such a case, a court must balance the \u201cneed to maintain the highest standards of the profession against a client\u2019s right freely to choose his counsel.\u201d (citations omitted) <em>Id. </em>at 218, 536 A.2d 243. Only in extraordinary cases should a client\u2019s right to counsel of his choice outweigh the need to maintain the profession\u2019s high standards. <em>Id. </em>at 220, 536 <em>A.</em>2d 243.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-12\">American argues that there is no such appearance of impropriety based upon Chadbourne\u2019s past representation of Sunshine. It further argues that too much significance is attached to the corporate form and form of the transaction. Instead the inquiry should focus on the realities of the relationship and the sale which took place. However, we think that it is that very relationship which would compel an ordinary knowledgeable citizen to conclude that a substantial \u201crisk of disservice\u201d is threatened.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>Chadbourne concededly had frequent direct contacts with Sunshine personnel for many years and represented Sunshine in a variety of matters. Additionally, Chadbourne was very familiar with Sunshine\u2019s files and facilities. <em>Gray v. Commercial Union Ins. Co., </em>191 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 597, 468 A.2d 721. More important than basic \u201cphilosophy,\u201d however, is the actual information Chadbourne acquired during the sale of Sunshine to G.F.I., and the knowledge Chadbourne has of the prior OSHA inspections of the same ovens in the Sayreville facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">Moreover, we have to consider that Chadbourne attorneys could be called as witnesses in this lawsuit. While we do not decide this precise issue because it was not determined below, R.P.C. 3.7 does prohibit a lawyer acting as advocate at a trial in which he is likely to be a necessary witness, notwithstanding that Chadbourne is merely acting \u201cof counsel\u201d in this litigation. In that role Chadbourne undoubtedly, will be giving advice to Pitney Hardin when the latter may examine at depositions or trial, Sunshine personnel with whom Chadbourne actively worked for twenty-two years. A member of the public thus would be inclined to think that Chadbourne is acting improperly in doing so. Therefore, the trial court properly held that Chadbourne must be disqualified in order to avoid such an \u201cappearance of impropriety.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">Finally, American contends it will suffer a hardship if Chadbourne is disqualified since such a determination will have the effect of also disqualifying most of American\u2019s present legal department. (Three former Chadbourne associates and one partner are currently part of American\u2019s legal department.) Moreover, it claims that every parent corporation in a similar situation will be affected if firms such as Chadbourne are disqualified. However, in <em>Dewey </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>at 221, 536 A.2d 243, our Supreme Court recognized that while \u201c(u)nder any circumstances the disqualification of an attorney in pending litigation does a great disservice to the affected client ... [and] the delay caused by such disqualification has an impact not only on the other parties to the affected litigation but on the efficiency of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>the judicial system,\u201d it nevertheless upheld a disqualification. (The Court did create an exception in that case only because of the unique circumstances which existed).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">Thus, even if American is adversely affected by Chadbourne\u2019s disqualification, as the trial judge stated here, anything short of disqualification would tend to undermine the \u201chigh ethical standards which the Supreme Court of this State has sought so diligently to uphold.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b41-15\">We do not address the jurisdictional problems engendered by the fact that an order of a New Jersey court purports to bind foreign attorneys because no party to this appeal has raised such an issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
