COLEMAN, P.J.A.D.</author>\n<p id=\"b244-17\">This appeal requires us to decide whether a defendant who refuses to submit to a breathalyzer test must be permitted to \u201ccure\u201d the refusal within a reasonable period. We hold that a \u201ccure\u201d need not be permitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>The controlling facts are not complicated. On January 21, 1989, at approximately 2:07 a.m., New Jersey State Trooper John Daly observed defendant drive his automobile on the shoulder of the roadway on four or more occasions. When defendant was stopped and asked for his driver\u2019s license, registration and insurance card, Trooper Daly detected a strong odor of alcohol on defendant\u2019s breath. He was unable to perform any field sobriety tests. Defendant was arrested for driving while under the influence, contrary to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50, and he was given the Miranda<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> warnings. Defendant was then transported to the State Police barracks in Bellmawr.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">While at the barracks, defendant was informed of his obligation to take a breathalyzer test and the consequences of a refusal. He was informed that he had no right to speak to an attorney before taking a breathalyzer test or to delay giving a breath sample. <em>See State v. Sherwin, </em>236 <em>N.J.Super. </em>510, 518-520, 566 A.2d 536 (App.Div.1989). Defendant, however, insisted that he should be permitted to call his attorney before deciding whether to take the test. After declining to take the test following ten or more requests, defendant was told that unless he agreed to take the test, he would be charged with a refusal. When finally asked if he would submit to the test, defendant responded \u201c[s]on, call my lawyer.\u201d At this point, defendant was informed that he was being charged with a refusal. He was then permitted to call his attorney. Immediately after speaking with his attorney, defendant agreed to take a breathalyzer test. Consistent with the prior warnings to defendant, the trooper declined to administer the test and issued defendant a summons charging him with a refusal. Trooper Daly\u2019s request to defendant to take a breathalyzer test was made within about 15 minutes after the arrest. Approximately four minutes elapsed between the trooper\u2019s request of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>defendant to take the test and the time defendant agreed to take the test.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">The Bellmawr Municipal Court found defendant not guilty of driving while under the influence of alcohol. The charge was amended at the close of the evidence to changing lanes' improperly, a violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-88(b). He was found guilty on the amended charge. Defendant was also found guilty of refusal to take the breathalyzer test. The judge found that defendant was obligated to give an unequivocal yes to the trooper\u2019s request to take the test. Upon his <em>de novo </em>appeal to the Law Division, defendant was again found guilty of a refusal, contrary to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50.4a.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">On this appeal, defendant argues that he should have been permitted to cure his refusal since he agreed to take the test, albeit after speaking to his attorney, within five minutes of his refusal and while all the officers were still in the room with him. Defendant contends that he should be permitted to cure the refusal within a reasonable time. He concedes, and correctly so, that \u201cone of the main concerns of the State in relation to these types of cases [taking of breath samples] is the preservation of evidence.\u201d Defendant places substantial reliance upon <em>State v. Ginnetti, </em>232 <em>N.J.Super. </em>378, 556 <em>A.2d </em>1339 (Law Div.1989), to support his claim that a cure ought to be permitted. He also relies upon <em>State v. Tischio, </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>504, 527 <em>A.2d </em>388 (1987), <em>appeal dismissed, </em>484 <em>U.S. </em>1038, 108 <em>S.Ct. </em>768, 98 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>855 (1988), to buttress his argument that as long as the breathalyzer test is administered within a reasonable time after arrest, the State\u2019s interest is protected by preserving the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">In <em>State v. Ginnetti, supra, </em>when defendant was asked to take a breathalyzer test, he refused. 232 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 380-81, 556 <em>A.2d </em>1339. At the time of refusal, the machine was not available for testing. <em>Ibid. </em>It was understood, however, that if defendant consented, a portable machine would be made available. <em>Id. </em>at 381, 556 A.2d 1339. A summons was issued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>for refusing, contrary to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50.4a. In finding defendant not guilty on his <em>de novo </em>appeal, the Law Division emphasized the importance of the fact that the breathalyzer was not present at the scene and the defendant had \u201cinitially and immediately agreed to a blood test.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 383, 556 A.2d 1339. The blood test was not performed because no medical personnel was available to take the blood sample <em>immediately </em>and that caused defendant to change his mind rather than wait. <em>Ibid. </em>Consequently, as both lower courts recognized in the present case, the acquittal in <em>Ginnetti </em>was based on much more than the fact that defendant agreed to take the breathalyzer within a few minutes after his refusal. To the extent that <em>Ginnetti </em>may be interpreted as permitting a cure, we disapprove.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">The Supreme Court in <em>State v. Tischio, supra, </em>held that to be admissible as evidence, a breathalyzer test must have been taken within a reasonable time after a defendant\u2019s arrest. 107 <em>N.J. </em>at 521, 527 A.2d 388. The requirement that the test be administered within a reasonable time is intended to prevent \u201cprolonged detention of a motorist by the police in the mistaken belief that the blood-alcohol level would then produce a result more favorable to the State.\u201d <em>State v. Dannemiller, </em>229 <em>N.J.Super. </em>187, 190, 550 A.2d 1303 (App.Div.1988). Both <em>Tischio </em>and <em>Dannemiller </em>make clear that the reasonable time requirement relates to the use of breathalyzer test results as evidence in a prosecution for driving while under the influence, a violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50a, rather than a prosecution for refusing to take the breathalyzer test, a violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50.4a.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">The elements of a violation for refusing to submit to a breathalyzer test are (1) that an arresting officer has probable cause to believe that the accused operated a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, (2) an arrest of the accused for driving while under the influence of alcohol, and (3) the accused\u2019s refusal to submit to a breathalyzer test. <em>State v. Wright, </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>488, 490, 527 A.2d 379 (1987). In this appeal, defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>contends only that the third element was not satisfied because of defendant\u2019s belated offer to take the test. The defendant in <em>State v. Wright, supra, </em>was found guilty of a refusal under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50.4a without proof of actual operation. Rather, his violation was based on probable cause to believe defendant had operated the vehicle while under the influence of alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">The issue of whether to permit a cure of a refusal has been raised previously in <em>State v. Corrado, </em>184 <em>N.J.Super. </em>561, 446 A.2d 1229 (App.Div.1982). In <em>Corrado, </em>we stated that \u201c[t]he majority rule in those cases which have an implied consent statute like ours, <em>see N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50.2, is that the initial refusal is final and hence that there is no right to \u2018cure\u2019 an initial refusal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 567, 446 A.2d 1229. (Citations omitted). Rather than <em>clearly </em>adopt a bright line rule in <em>Corrado, </em>we concluded that in the circumstances of that case, where the defendant had waited an hour before agreeing to take the breathalyzer test after speaking with his attorney, \u201cthe policy of our implied consent law would be violated here if a cure was allowed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 569, 446 A.2d 1229. Then we stated: \u201c[u]nder <em>State v. Pandoli, </em>109 <em>N.J.Super. </em>1 [262 A.2d 41] (App.Div. 1970), he clearly had no right to do so.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">Before and since our decision in <em>Corrado, </em>our Supreme Court adopted bright line rules in many areas related to drunk driving. For example, there is no right to an attorney before taking a breathalyzer test. <em>State v. Macuk, </em>57 <em>N.J. </em>1, 15, 268 A.2d 1 (1970), and, <em>State v. DeLorenzo, </em>210 <em>N.J.Super. </em>100, 104, 509 A.2d 238 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>507, 523 A.2d 154 (1986). <em>Miranda </em>warnings need not be given prior to administering a breathalyzer test. <em>State v. Leavitt, </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>534, 535, 527 A.2d 403 (1987). Similarly, a defendant has no legal right to refuse to take a breathalyzer test. <em>State v. Macuk, supra, </em>57 <em>N.J. </em>at 15, 268 A.2d 1; <em>State v. DeLorenzo, supra, </em>210 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 106, 509 A.2d 238. Further, the blood-alcohol level at the time a breathalyzer test is administered, conclusively establishes a violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50a, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>thereby rendering extrapolation evidence inadmissible. <em>State v. Tischio, supra, </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>at 522, 527 A.2d 388.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">Additionally, our Supreme Court held last term that involuntary intoxication cannot be used as an affirmative defense to a charge of drunk driving. <em>State v. Hammond, </em>118 <em>N.J. </em>306, 315, 571 A.2d 942 (1990). Courts must take judicial notice that breathalyzer tests are accurate and a reading of .10 establishes a <em>per se </em>violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50a. <em>State v. Downie, </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>450, 466-488, 569 A.2d 242, <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 <em>U.S. </em>-, 111 <em>S.Ct. </em>63, 112 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>38 (1990). Finally, a defendant accused of violating <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50a is not entitled to a jury trial. <em>State v. Hamm, </em>121 <em>N.J. </em>109, 577 A.2d 1259 (1990); <em>State v. Graff, </em>121 <em>N.J. </em>131, 577 A.2d 1270 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">Left unanswered by our appellate courts thus far is whether a refusal may be \u201ccured.\u201d <em>Corrado </em>strongly suggested that it should not be. We are persuaded that a bright line rule should be adopted, consistent with a growing majority of other jurisdictions with a similar implied consent law, which precludes a defendant from curing a refusal. <em>See, e.g., Conrad v. Schwendiman, </em>680 <em>P.</em>2d 736 (Utah 1984); <em>Schroeder v. State Dept. of Motor Vehicles and Public Safety, </em>772 P.2d 1278 (Nev.1989); <em>Dudenhoeffer v. Dir. of Rev., State of Mo., </em>780 <em>S. W. 2d </em>701 (Mo. App.1989); <em>Com., Dept. of Transp. v. Stay, </em>114 <em>Pa.Cmwlth. </em>532, 539 A.2d 57 (1988); <em>Mossak v. Comm. of Pub. Safety, </em>435 <em>N.W.2d </em>578 (Minn.App.1989); <em>Webb v. Miller, </em>187 <em>Cal.App.3d </em>619, 232 <em>Cal.Rptr. </em>50 (1986); <em>Wisch v. Jensen, </em>221 <em>Neb. </em>609, 379 <em>N. W. </em>2d 755 (Neb.1986). Such a rule clearly effectuates the Legislature\u2019s regulatory aims embodied in the implied consent law. We recognized as much when we adopted the bright line rule in <em>State v. Sherwin, supra, </em>236 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 515, 566 A.2d 536, holding that a defendant\u2019s silence when requested to take a breathalyzer test is legally equivalent to a refusal. To hold otherwise, would unduly burden police officers by requiring them to wait for an indefinite period in an attempt to be able to refute a defendant\u2019s assertion that although he or she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>changed his or her mind and consented within a reasonable time, the police improperly disallowed a cure.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">Further, permitting a cure hampers the State in the administration of its public policy of requiring the courts to work in tandem with the Legislature \u201cto streamline the implementation\u201d of laws designed to rid the highways of drunken drivers. <em>State v. Tischio, supra, </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>at 514, 527 A.2d 388; <em>State v. Stever, </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>543, 557, 527 A.2d 408 (1987), <em>cert. den. </em>484 <em>U.S. </em>954, 108 <em>S.Ct. </em>348, 98 <em>L.Ed. 2d </em>373 (1987). A bright line rule removes, rather than creates \u201cobstacles impeding the efficient and successful prosecution of those who drink and drive.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>quoting from <em>State v. Tischio, supra, </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>at 514, 527 A.2d 388.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">Beyond that, permitting a cure flies in the face of good sense and established legal notions. Ordinarily, a violation is complete when the proscribed act or omission has come to pass. <em>See, e.g., Olympic, Inc. v. Director, Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control, Dept. of Law and Public Safety, </em>49 <em>N.J.Super. </em>299, 308, 139 A.2d 768 <em>certif. den. </em>27 <em>N.J. </em>279, 142 A.2d 262 (1958). Once the violation has been committed, the accused cannot \u201cundo\u201d the violation except when permitted by the Legislature.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A compelling parallel to this case, if a cure were permitted, can be found in a case where a defendant is found in an intoxicated state while sitting in the driver\u2019s seat of the car, holding the ignition key in his or her hand. <em>See State v. Mulcahy, </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>467, 479, 527 A.2d 368 (1987); <em>State v. Daly, </em>64 <em>N.J. </em>122, 313 A.2d 194 (1973). <em>Cf. State v. Sweeney, </em>40 <em>N.J. </em>359, 360-361, 192 A.2d 573 (1963); <em>State v. Stiene, </em>203 <em>N.J.Super. </em>275, 496 A.2d 738 (App.Div.1985); <em>State v. Prociuk, </em>145 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number><em>N.J.Super. </em>570, 574, 368 A.2d 436 (Law Div.1976). A rule that permits one accused of driving while under the influence of alcohol to cure a violation within a reasonable time, would mean that a suspected drunk driver caught behind the steering wheel of a car can \u201ccure\u201d if he or she gets out of the car within a few minutes and turns over the ignition key to the police officer, thereby indicating the suspect no longer has any intent to drive the vehicle. <em>See State v. Tischio, supra, </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>at 513-514, 527 A.2d 388. This illustration highlights the unsoundness of permitting a cure because it would impede as well as frustrate our strong public policy of removing drunken drivers from our highways.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">Since one of the remedial purposes of the implied consent law is the removal of drunk drivers from our highways, \u201canything substantially short of an unqualified, unequivocal assent to an officer\u2019s request that the arrested motorist take the test constitutes a refusal to do so. <em>See Ent v. State, Department of Motor Vehicles </em>[265 Cal.App.2d 936, 71 Cal.Rptr. 726 (Cal.App.1968) ]. The occasion is not one for debate, maneuver or negotiation, but rather for a simple \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019 to the officer\u2019s request.\u201d <em>State v. Corrado, supra, </em>184 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 569, 446 A.2d 1229, quoting from <em>State v. Pandoli, supra, </em>109 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 4, 262 A.2d 41. Once the defendant says anything except an unequivocal \u201cyes\u201d to the officer\u2019s request after the officer has informed the defendant of the consequences of a refusal, the defendant cannot legally cure the refusal. Prosecutions for drunk driving and for failure to give a breath sample are quasi-criminal proceedings and therefore notions of curing defects, as frequently occur in the commercial world pursuant to the Uniform Commercial Code, have no application absent a clear expression to the contrary by the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">We have considered the other contentions raised by defendant related to the \u201cConfusion Doctrine\u201d and find they are clearly without merit. <em>R. </em>2:11\u20143(e)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">The judgment of conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b245-7\"><em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 <em>U.S. </em>436, 86 <em>S.Ct. </em>1602, 16 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>694 (1966).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b250-7\">The Legislature knows how and when to be flexible respecting a violation of Title 39. Where a driver fails to produce a driver's license, registration or insurance card for the vehicle being operated when requested by a police officer, that person violates <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:3-29. But if the driver presents the required documents to the judge that were valid on the day of the offense, a cure is permitted except for court costs. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
