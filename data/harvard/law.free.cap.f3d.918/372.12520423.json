According to Bayer, this is a federal case: Although the Burrells seek relief under state law, their claims necessarily implicate significant questions regarding Bayer's compliance with federal regulations and thus give rise to federal question jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201331\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We disagree. As the Supreme Court has emphasized, \u00a7 1331 confers federal jurisdiction over state-law causes of action only in a \"special and small\" class of cases.\n   <em>\n    Empire HealthChoice Assurance, Inc. v.

Because the Burrells' state-law action against Bayer does not fall within that special class, it should be decided by North Carolina's courts. We therefore vacate the district court's contrary judgment and direct that the case be remanded to state court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The crux of Bayer's argument for federal question jurisdiction is that because Essure is regulated by the federal government, the Burrells' suit regarding Essure will require the resolution of important federal-law questions. We begin by briefly describing the federal laws and regulations that govern Essure, to provide necessary context for Bayer's position and the proceedings in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Essure is a permanent female contraceptive consisting of metal coils, known as \"micro-inserts,\" inserted into a woman's\n   fallopian tubes. Once released through a disposable delivery system, the micro-inserts expand and anchor in the fallopian tubes, causing fibrous tissue growth that blocks the tubes and prevents pregnancy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Essure is regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") as a Class III medical device, under the 1976 Medical Device Amendments to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (\"FDCA\" or \"Act\"). Class III devices are subject to the most stringent oversight under the Act,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   21 U.S.C. \u00a7 360c(a)(1)(C), and a novel Class III device like Essure cannot be distributed until it receives premarket approval from the FDA,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3276298\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/677/#p699\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 360e. Following premarket approval, a manufacturer cannot amend the device design without FDA sign-off, can make only limited changes to the device's labeling, and must submit to the FDA information regarding adverse events related to the device,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   among other requirements.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3276298\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/677/#p699\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 360e(d)(5)(A)(i), 360i(a);\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20814.39\">\n    21 C.F.R. \u00a7 814.39\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), (d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Act does not establish a private right of action to enforce these requirements under federal law. With respect to state-law remedies, the Act includes an express preemption provision, prohibiting states from imposing requirements on premarket-approved Class III medical devices - like Essure - that are \"different from, or in addition to\" federal requirements. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 360k(a). That leaves room, as the Supreme Court has explained, for state-law remedies for violations of common-law duties that \"parallel\" federal regulatory requirements.\n   <em>\n    Medtronic, Inc. v.

Accordingly, the Burrells may proceed against Bayer under North Carolina law consistent with \u00a7 360k(a) to the extent (and only to the extent) that the state-law duties on which they rely \"parallel\" the federal requirements that apply to Essure. What relief is available under North Carolina law is of course a question of state and not federal law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Kristiana Tweed Burrell received an Essure implantation in December 2013. According to Burrell, tests performed in the ensuing months found that the device was causing only a partial blockage of her left fallopian tube, and thus failing to provide contraceptive protection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On June 5, 2015, Burrell discovered that she was pregnant when she felt fetal movement. Two days later, she experienced abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding, and went into premature labor at\n   home. Burrell was admitted to the hospital, where her baby was delivered stillborn at an estimated 24 to 27 weeks. Burrell was diagnosed with placental abruption, a serious pregnancy complication in which the placenta prematurely separates from the uterus. Subsequent doctor visits confirmed that Burrell's Essure implant had failed and was eroding through the left fallopian tube. To remove the device, Burrell then was required to undergo a total hysterectomy - that is, a surgical procedure to remove her uterus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In December 2016, Burrell and her husband filed separate lawsuits in North Carolina state court against the Bayer Corporation and related defendants (collectively, \"Bayer\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The lawsuits, later consolidated, seek damages for personal injuries, emotional distress, and wrongful death under various state-law causes of action, relying primarily on four core allegations. First and most prominently, the Burrells allege that Bayer failed to disclose to the medical community or the FDA numerous adverse events similar to those they experienced, depriving them of proper warning about Essure's risks. Second, they assert that Bayer failed to update its labeling and marketing materials to reflect these risks, further depriving them of adequate warning. Third, they claim that Bayer sold Essure implants with manufacturing defects, suggesting that one of these defects may have been present in Burrell's implant and caused her injuries. And fourth, they allege that Bayer did not adequately train doctors, including Burrell's obstetrician-gynecologist, on the implantation procedure, despite informing the public otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   That conduct, according to the complaints, violated state law in multiple respects. Specifically, the complaints assert the following causes of action against Bayer under North Carolina law: that Bayer was negligent and breached its duty to warn the Burrells of known dangers regarding Essure; that Essure was unreasonably dangerous in violation of state products liability law; that Bayer breached both express and implied warranties; and that Bayer engaged in fraud and unfair or deceptive trade practices. In anticipation of a federal preemption defense, as outlined above, the complaints also allege that Bayer violated numerous federal regulatory requirements that purportedly parallel Bayer's duties under state law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The jurisdictional question at issue in this appeal arose when Bayer removed the Burrells' actions to federal court, invoking\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201441\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Under that provision, Bayer was entitled to remove the case only if the Burrells' state-law claims could have been brought in federal court originally, based on some independent source of federal jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Merrell Dow Pharm.

But Bayer argued that the Burrells' case falls within an exception to that general rule because their state-law claims necessarily raise substantial federal-law questions. The Burrells' complaints, Bayer noted, contained multiple references to federal regulatory requirements allegedly violated by Bayer. And because the Burrells' state-law claims would be preempted unless Bayer had violated parallel federal duties, their right to relief necessarily required resolution of those federal-law questions. Moreover, given the FDA's extensive oversight of Essure, whether Bayer had lived up to its regulatory obligations was a matter of sufficient federal importance that it warranted adjudication in a federal forum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The district court agreed, denying the Burrells' motion to remand the case to state court and retaining jurisdiction under \u00a7 1331. The court began by laying out the \"four-part test\" that governs whether a lawsuit based on state-law claims gives rise to federal question jurisdiction: To come within \u00a7 1331, the case must feature a state-law claim that (1) \"necessarily raise[s]\" a federal issue, and that federal issue must be \"(2) actually disputed, (3) substantial, and (4) capable of resolution in federal court without disrupting the federal-state balance approved by Congress.\" J.A. 1130 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Gunn v.

The Burrells' complaints, the court reasoned, are \"replete with references to the FDA\" and allegations that Bayer failed to comply with its federal regulatory duties. J.A. 1131. As a result of the Act's express preemption provision, the court continued, the Burrells cannot succeed on their state-law claims unless they can show that Bayer in fact deviated from those federal requirements. \"Accordingly, [the federal regulations governing Essure] are implicated here and in dispute.\" J.A. 1133.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The court relied again on the Act's preemptive effect under the latter two prongs of the analysis. Because \"state law is generally pre-empted\" under \u00a7 360k(a), the court determined, \"[i]t does not upset the federal-state balance to allow [manufacturers of] federally-approved medical devices to be sued ... in federal court.\" J.A. 1136. And because what is at issue is \"federal oversight of Class III medical device products,\" the district court further reasoned, the dispute as to federal law is \"substantial.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407443\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/251/#p258\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Having retained jurisdiction, the court two months later granted Bayer's motion to dismiss the Burrells' case, largely on preemption grounds.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Burrell v.

And for most of their theories of liability, it is clear and undisputed that the Burrells can establish all the necessary elements entirely independently of federal law. One example will suffice: In North Carolina, a claim for inadequate warning is made out if \"the manufacturer or seller acted unreasonably in failing to provide such warning;\" the \"failure to provide adequate warning or instruction was a proximate cause of the harm for which damages are sought;\" and either \"the product, without an adequate warning or instruction, created an unreasonably dangerous condition\" or the manufacturer \"failed to take reasonable steps to give adequate warning\" after becoming aware \"that the product posed a substantial risk of harm to a reasonably foreseeable user.\" N.C.

Among the Burrells' many theories of recovery, Bayer argues, are a few in which violations of federal law are alleged not in anticipation of a preemption defense, but as actual predicates for state-law liability. For one, Bayer emphasizes, the complaints repeatedly assert Bayer's alleged failure to report adverse events to the FDA - a duty created solely by federal law, according to Bayer - in connection with multiple causes of action. And both parties focus on the complaints' assertion that Bayer was negligent per se - that is, that Bayer's alleged violations of federal law in and of\n   themselves establish negligence under North Carolina tort law. In instances like these, Bayer urges, a violation of federal law becomes a \"necessary element\" of the plaintiffs' own state-law claims, satisfying the well-pleaded complaint rule and giving rise to federal question jurisdiction under \u00a7 1331.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   We may assume for purposes of this appeal that the premise of Bayer's argument is correct, and that the assertions it has identified - including the \"fraud on the FDA\" allegation - in fact turn on questions of federal law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Even so, there is another hurdle for Bayer: A federal question is not \"necessarily\" raised under \u00a7 1331 unless it is essential to resolving a state-law claim, meaning that \"\n   <em>\n    every\n   </em>\n   legal theory supporting the claim requires the resolution of a federal issue.\"\n   <em>\n    Dixon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9247476\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/369/811/#p816\">\n    369 F.3d at 816\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . If, on the other hand, each of the Burrells' claims is supported by a state-law theory that does not require recourse to federal law, then that claim does not \"arise under\" federal law - even if the Burrells have alleged an alternative federal-law theory that also could prove liability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pressl\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12125767\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/842/299/#p302\">\n    842 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   304 ;\n   <em>\n    Flying Pigs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4125167,5901607\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/757/177/\">\n    757 F.3d at 182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In other words, so long as \"even one theory\" for each of the Burrells' claims does\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   require \"interpretation of federal law,\" resolution of the federal-law question is not necessary to the disposition of their case.\n   <em>\n    Pressl\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12125767\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/842/299/#p302\">\n    842 F.3d at 304\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   According to Bayer, the complaints' allegations of negligence per se and fraud on the FDA should be treated as distinct claims, each requiring resolution of federal-law questions and thus satisfying the \"necessarily raised\" prong.

And as the Burrells point out, each of the assertions identified by Bayer is subsumed in their complaints under a cause of action that also includes alternative state-law theories of liability. Faced with a similar complaint in another Essure case, the court in\n   <em>\n    Sangimino v. Bayer\n   </em>\n   agreed with the plaintiffs, holding that allegations in their complaint predicated on Bayer's alleged failure to follow FDA requirements were \"alternative federal-law-based theories\" for state-law claims that also were \"supported by ... independent\" state-law theories.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202500904\">\n    2017 WL 2500904\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (internal quotation marks omitted). We took a similar approach in\n   <em>\n    Mulcahey v.

And because that distinction may turn on the precise way in which a complaint is drafted, there is no bright-line rule in the precedent to guide our analysis - nor a prospect that we could provide one through a line-by-line parsing of these particular complaints. Ultimately, we need not decide in this appeal whether the Burrells' complaints assert any distinct claim that can be resolved only by reference to federal law.
