In 2002, the Corps hired Garcia to work as an assistant to the pastor, a position she held until July 2010, when Arlene and Dionisio Torres became the new pastors. No longer in need of an assistant, Arlene Torres reassigned Garcia to the position of social services coordinator in January 2011. In that role, Garcia aided clients under the supervision of Arlene Torres. In late 2011, Garcia and her husband \"left the Church\" and stopped attending the Salvation Army's religious services, but Garcia continued her work as social services coordinator. Afterward, her relationship with Torres began to deteriorate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Tensions reached new heights in July 2013, when a client filed a lengthy complaint letter against Garcia, claiming that she \"refused to provide help to [the client's] family.\" After Torres informed Garcia that a complaint had been lodged, Garcia demanded to see it. Torres refused, claiming that the complaint was confidential. Three days later, Garcia filed an internal grievance of her own against Torres, claiming that she \"fe[lt] discriminated against and excluded and isolated\" at work ever since leaving the church. The specter of the undisclosed client grievance continued to disturb Garcia. She would go on to submit complaints to the EEOC and Arizona state authorities for religious discrimination and retaliation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Following a lengthy period of medical leave due to fibromyalgia, the Salvation Army fired Garcia after she failed to report to work despite being cleared by her doctor. Garcia then filed a second complaint with the EEOC and state authorities alleging that, by declining to disclose the client complaint, the Salvation Army failed to accommodate her disability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Garcia's EEOC charges were dismissed, and right-to-sue letters issued. Garcia subsequently brought two lawsuits against the Salvation Army: one under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VII), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , and another under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012112\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , which were consolidated. In sum, Garcia alleged that the Salvation Army subjected her to a hostile work environment because she stopped attending religious services and retaliated against her for filing an internal grievance complaining of religion-based mistreatment. The resulting stress precipitated health problems that the Salvation Army failed to accommodate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The district judge (Campbell,\n   <em>\n    J.\n   </em>\n   ) granted summary judgment to the Salvation Army, holding that Title VII's religious organization exemption (ROE) protects the\n   Salvation Army from suit, even if it failed to timely assert the defense.\n   <em>\n    Garcia v.

And\n   <em>\n    second\n   </em>\n   , whether the ROE extends beyond hiring and firing decisions to hostile work environment and retaliation claims.

Ala.

World Vision, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4090237\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/633/723/#p724\">\n    633 F.3d 723\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 724 (9th Cir. 2011) (per curiam), which asks whether an entity \"engage[s] primarily or substantially in the exchange of goods or services for money beyond nominal amounts.\" Garcia contends this factor is not satisfied because the Salvation Army generates a large-dollar amount of sales revenue, even though that amount constitutes a small portion (fifteen percent) of its total income. Moreover, in 2012, 82 cents of every dollar spent by the Salvation Army went toward its program services. These considerations aside, the concurring opinions of Judges O'Scannlain and Kleinfeld, who wrote separately on how to evaluate the fourth\n   <em>\n    Spencer\n   </em>\n   factor, support the Salvation Army's entitlement to ROE protection. Under Judge O'Scannlain's approach, the ROE applies if the first three factors identified in the per curiam opinion are satisfied and the organization is a nonprofit.\n   <em>\n    Spencer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4090237\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/633/723/#p724\">\n    633 F.3d at 734\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (O'Scannlain, J., concurring). The Salvation Army easily satisfies that test. While Judge Kleinfeld would alternatively ask how the organization charges for its services, he cites the Salvation Army as a group that satisfies this criterion because it \"gives its homeless shelter and soup kitchen services away, or charges nominal fees.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4090237\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/633/723/#p724\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4090237\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/633/723/#p724\">\n    at 747\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Kleinfeld, J., concurring).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    B.

But as a former member of the Salvation Army's congregation, Garcia was intimately familiar with its religious focus and mission.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , ER 133-34 (deposition excerpts describing Garcia's participation in religious services); ER 633 (Garcia's opposition to motion for summary judgment indicating \"[s]he believed she would be working in an environment that was respectful, [c]haritable and encouraging and above all Christ[-]like\"). And the Salvation Army's status as a nonprofit corporation is public, along with its yearly financial reports. Absent prejudice, the Salvation Army permissibly invoked the ROE at summary judgment, and it applies to foreclose Garcia's Title VII claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    ADA Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The district court properly granted the Salvation Army summary judgment on Garcia's ADA claim. We begin by briefly recounting the underlying circumstances. Following a period of leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (\"FMLA\") from October to December 2013, Garcia sought additional personal leave, explaining that she \"ha[d] been advised not to return to a stressful working environment for health reasons.\" The Salvation Army responded by asking her to provide medical documentation \"outlining working restrictions and estimated date of return to full duty.\" Garcia complied, and her request was granted. The Salvation Army repeatedly extended Garcia's leave through May 5, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   On May 5, 2014, Garcia informed the Salvation Army that her doctor had cleared her to return to work on May 26, \"without restrictions.\" But Garcia said she would not return to work because she was \"not ready to go back into the exact same working environment which [her] doctors ha[d] advised against\" and \"[t]here seem[ed] to be a mental block/barrier\" regarding the customer complaint filed against her in July 2013. She therefore requested the \"accommodation\" that \"a copy or summary of [the client] complaint ... be made available to [her] before [she] return[ed] to work.\" The Salvation Army declined and demanded medical evidence supporting her disability and proposed accommodation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   This time, Garcia did not submit the requested medical information. As a result, the Salvation Army made clear that Garcia's continued absence was not excused, \"jeopardizing [her] continued employment.\" Even so, on June 17, 2014, the Salvation Army provided a summary of the client complaint but explained that Garcia would \"need a doctor's note to allow us to assess your accommodation request and your continued absence.\" Garcia disputed the summary of the complaint and reiterated her request for a copy. She did not report to work. On July 10, 2014, the Salvation Army terminated Garcia's employment due to unexcused absence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \"The ADA prohibits discrimination 'against a qualified individual on the basis of disability in regard to ... job training[ ] and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment.' \"\n   <em>\n    EEOC v.

Moreover, an employer \"do[es] not have a duty under the ADA ... to engage in further interactive processes ... in the absence of\" requested medical evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Allen v.

The record does not support this assertion. To the contrary, each step of the way, the Salvation Army extended Garcia's leave. This was the only accommodation requested by Garcia and documented by her physician. At no time before her doctor's unconditional release did Garcia indicate that she desired to return to work on a modified basis. Accordingly, no reasonable jury could find that the Salvation Army failed to engage in an interactive process with Garcia from the time of her leave up and until the time she was cleared for work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Garcia next alleges that the Salvation Army refused to negotiate in good faith after Garcia insisted on receiving a copy of the secret customer complaint rather than a summary. This request, however, only came after Garcia was cleared for work \"without restrictions.\" Garcia cannot show that she suffered from a disability at that time, and she failed to provide supporting medical documentation despite multiple requests. The Salvation Army was not required to continue an interactive process in the absence of medical evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9071534\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/348/1113/#p1115\">\n    348 F.3d at 1115\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Moreover, even after the Salvation Army provided a summary of the client complaint as requested, Garcia protested and demanded to see the original complaint. This only underscores that Garcia's requested \"accommodation\" is not cognizable under the ADA. A \"reasonable accommodation\" includes \"[m]odifications or adjustments to the work environment, or to the manner or circumstances under which the position held or desired is customarily performed, that enable an individual with a disability who is qualified to perform the essential functions of that position.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201630.2\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1630.2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (o)(1)(ii). Obtaining a copy of a year-old client complaint is unrelated to the \"essential functions\" of Garcia's former position.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gonzagowski v. Widnall\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11984028\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/115/744/#p747\">\n    115 F.3d 744\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 747-48 (10th Cir. 1997) (\"While specific stressors in a work environment may in some cases be legitimate targets of accommodation, it is unreasonable to require an employer to create a work environment free of stress and criticism.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Finally, Garcia argues that the Salvation Army failed to interact in good faith because it had decided to eliminate her position rather than negotiate with\n   her. This allegation, however, is derived from a draft letter to Garcia dated May 27, 2014, which was never used or sent. To the contrary, the Salvation Army continued Garcia's leave until July 10, 2014, when she was finally terminated. Regardless, as discussed, the Salvation Army was under no obligation to engage in an interactive process in the absence of a disability. For these reasons, Garcia fails to make out a claim under the ADA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   We hold that the ROE is nonjurisdictional and subject to procedural forfeiture. Absent prejudice resulting from the Salvation Army's failure to timely raise the defense, however, the ROE forecloses Garcia's Title VII claims for retaliation and hostile work environment. Garcia's ADA claim fails on the merits. The judgment of the district court is therefore\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    Unless otherwise indicated, the following historical context is gleaned from the record.
