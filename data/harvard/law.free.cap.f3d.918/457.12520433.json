HO, Circuit Judge:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Our court previously granted a certificate of appealability (COA) to Calvin Allen on two claims-first, that the government breached its obligations under his plea agreement when it failed to credit his cooperation in a murder conviction, and second, that Allen received ineffective assistance of counsel due to his attorney's failure to object to the government's breach of his plea agreement. We now conclude that the district court should have held an evidentiary hearing on Allen's ineffective counsel claim. Accordingly, we vacate the judgment and remand for a limited evidentiary inquiry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Allen pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute a controlled substance. In exchange for Allen's plea and waiver of the right to appeal, the government promised that it would:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   inform the United States Probation Office and the Court of [1] [the plea agreement], [2] the nature and extent of Defendant's activities with respect to this case and [3] all other activities of Defendant which the U.S. Attorney deems relevant to sentencing, including the nature and extent of Defendant's cooperation with the U.S. Attorney and law enforcement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Allen cooperated with prosecutors, providing them with information about his co-conspirators in his drug case. He also provided information leading to the prosecution of an unrelated murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The presentence report (PSR) included information about Allen's cooperation in\n   the drug case, but not the murder. On appeal, Allen claims that this omission constitutes a breach of the plea agreement by the government. But Allen failed to identify any such breach to the district court: He did not object to the PSR. Nor did he object during the sentencing hearing. The court subsequently sentenced him to 188 months in prison and 5 years of supervised release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Allen filed a timely\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   motion to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , alleging that he received ineffective assistance of counsel. He asserted that the plea agreement obligated the government to inform the sentencing court about his cooperation in the murder investigation, as well as the drug prosecution. And when the government failed to do so, Allen contends that his counsel should have either objected or moved for a downward departure in his sentence. In Allen's view, this error potentially deprived him of a lower sentence. He also requested an evidentiary hearing on his claim under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The district court ordered Allen's attorney to respond to the allegations of ineffective counsel. Allen's counsel averred that (1) he believed the government discharged its obligation under the plea because the PSR included information about Allen's cooperation; and (2) he and Allen decided not to move for a downward departure based on Allen's cooperation because raising mitigating circumstances would open the door to the court considering aggravating circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   For its part, the government argued that (1) Allen procedurally defaulted on any claim that the government violated its plea; and (2) Allen's counsel was not constitutionally ineffective.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The district court denied Allen's motion without an evidentiary hearing, after concluding that (1) the government did not breach its plea obligations; and (2) Allen's ineffective assistance claim fails because his counsel's failure to object was merely a tactical decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   We subsequently granted a COA on two questions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   (1) \"[W]hether the district court erred in denying without an evidentiary hearing Allen's claim that the Government breached the plea agreement by failing to disclose his cooperation regarding other criminal cases.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   (2) \"[W]hether the district court erred in denying without an evidentiary hearing Allen's claim that he received ineffective assistance because his counsel failed to inform the sentencing court of the Government's failure to disclose his cooperation regarding other criminal cases.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   After the parties submitted their briefs, we requested additional briefing on whether Allen procedurally defaulted on his claim that the government breached its obligations under the plea agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Allen moved for \u00a7 2255 relief on the ground that the sentence was imposed in violation of the Constitution.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Strickland v.

The PSR disclosed Allen's cooperation in the drug case.

If indeed Allen cooperated with law enforcement in the murder investigation, and if the government deemed his cooperation relevant to his sentencing, then the government was obligated to inform the sentencing court. Because there is some indication that the government did not discharge its burden, the district court should not have denied relief without inquiring further or holding an evidentiary hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The government argues that it did not \"deem relevant\" Allen's cooperation because \"it was the opinion of the case agent that his information was not credible.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In essence, the government contends that any decision not to inform the court about Allen's cooperation was necessarily an exercise of the discretion allowed by the plea agreement. But the government had to actually exercise that discretion and determine that Allen's cooperation was not relevant-rather than simply refuse to inform the court about relevant information. According\n   to Allen's sworn statement, he \"provided information in the unsolved murder case,\" and \"approximately two weeks after [his] cooperation, an arrest was made in the case.\" Moreover, Allen contends that his \"counsel stated that [his counsel] had spoken with the case agent and affirmed that [Allen's] information in regard to the murder was good and useful.\" So Allen has provided some evidence that the government considered his information credible. And without further explanation from the government why the evidence was somehow not relevant to Allen's sentence, the government has not offered anything that \"conclusively negate[s] the factual predicates asserted in support of the motion for post-conviction relief.\"\n   <em>\n    Friedman v.

In his affidavit, Allen's counsel said that the PSR reflected Allen's full cooperation with investigators, and that he did not raise Allen's cooperation separately in the sentencing hearing because raising any mitigating factors would open a \"Pandora's box\" of aggravating factors. But the affidavit, at least on its face, does not address Allen's contention about his cooperation in the murder investigation. Accordingly, we lack any \"sworn record testimony from counsel explaining the strategy behind his decision.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Because that standard is not met here, we vacate the judgment and remand for an evidentiary hearing. The district court should consider whether the government breached its obligation to inform the court about Allen's cooperation in the murder\n   case and, if it did, why Allen's counsel failed to raise the issue.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    Allen's \u00a7 2255 motion only raised one ground for relief: ineffective assistance of counsel. To be sure, Allen's ineffective assistance claim depends on the government breaching its plea obligations. But the district court considered Allen's breach of plea claim as a stand-alone ground for relief. We likewise granted a certificate of appealability on the breach of plea claim. We accordingly address it here.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    The cases Allen cites are inapposite. For example, in\n    <em>\n     United States v. Hunter\n    </em>\n    , the plea agreement expressly provided: \"The United States agrees that it will recommend\n    <em>\n     at sentencing\n    </em>\n    that the Court reduce by two levels the sentencing guideline level applicable to the defendant's offense.\"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4354102\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/835/1320/#p1323\">\n     835 F.3d 1320\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1323 (11th Cir. 2016) (emphasis added). And in\n    <em>\n     Correale v. United States\n    </em>\n    , the court considered the government's total failure to make the recommendation it promised to make.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1310659\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/479/944/#p946\">\n     479 F.2d 944\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 946, 949 (1st Cir. 1973).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    It is unclear whether the government was addressing Allen's cooperation in the drug case or the murder case. In its briefs before us, the government emphasizes that Allen has not been clear about when he offered the information about the murder or whether it was useful to investigators. True as far as it goes, the government's response only highlights the questions the district court should consider on remand. Thus, the government has failed to assert that Allen \"would not be entitled to relief as a matter of law, even if his factual assertions were true.\"\n    <em>\n     Harrison\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519479\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/910/824/#p826\">\n     910 F.3d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    826-27 (citing\n    <em>\n     Guerra\n    </em>\n    , 588 F.2d at 521 ).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
