Because he did not have a permanent address (he was homeless), Paul Regains followed the instructions of officers who directed him to a local homeless shelter (which they listed on his registration as his permanent address), and to return for re-registration in ninety days. When he appeared to report three months later, Chicago police officers arrested Regains on an \"investigative alert,\" because other officers had not been able to locate Regains at the address provided. Regains remained in custody seventeen months before the Illinois trial court found him not guilty of failing to report a change of address.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Regains sued the City of Chicago under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , claiming that it violated his rights under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 2012, SORA required sex offenders to register in person within three days of establishing a residence or a temporary domicile in any county. 730 ILCS \u00a7 150/3(b) (2012). Sex offenders in the City of Chicago registered \"at the Chicago Police Department Headquarters.\" 730 ILCS \u00a7 150/3(a)(1). The law required sex offenders without a fixed address or temporary domicile to report weekly to the chief of police in the municipality in which that person was located. 730 ILCS \u00a7 150/3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The plaintiff asserts that SORA required \"persons with a fixed abode\" to report every ninety days, citing 730 ILCS \u00a7 150/6. Appellant's Br. at 2. In fact, that section of the statute required a person who had been adjudicated to be sexually dangerous or was a sexually violent person to report every ninety days (and required such offenders to report weekly if they did not have a fixed residence). \"Any other person\" required to register under the\n   statute was required to report once a year. The record does not indicate whether Regains, had he had a fixed residence, would have been subject to the ninety-day reporting interval or the one-year reporting interval. Either way, the law required homeless sex offenders to report more frequently than sex offenders with fixed residences. Failure to comply with the provisions of the statute constituted a felony, for which there was strict liability. 730 ILCS \u00a7 150/10(a) ;\n   <em>\n    People v. Molnar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3602282\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ill-2d/222/495/\">\n    222 Ill.2d 495\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=306%20Ill.%20Dec.%20116\">\n    306 Ill.Dec. 116\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=857%20N.E.2d%20209\">\n    857 N.E.2d 209\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 224 (2006).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   By 2012, the Chicago police officers assigned to sex offender registration/reporting duty felt that the weekly reporting requirement for homeless sex offenders had become burdensome. Some of those police officers engaged in a widespread practice of steering homeless sex offenders to homeless shelters that would accept sex offenders, and directing the sex offenders to return with documentation showing the shelter as the sex offender's residence. This scheme had the effect of providing homeless sex offenders with a \"residence,\" which meant that they were not subject to the weekly reporting requirement. The officers who engaged in this steering practice, and their supervisors, were aware that the number of persons registered at the shelters far exceeded the shelter's capacity. In other words, they knew that the homeless sex offenders who listed the shelter as their \"address\" likely would not be able to remain there.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Other Chicago police officers assigned to registration duties disagreed with the steering practice. These other officers visited homeless shelters that accepted sex offender registrants and attempted to locate the registrant; if they could not locate the registrant at the shelter, the officers would prepare an investigative alert, informing any Chicago police officer who encountered the registrant that there was probable cause for arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Regains alleges that in April 2012, Chicago police officers employed the steering practice when he attempted to register as a homeless sex offender. He asserts that they directed him to a shelter, registered him as residing at that shelter, and instructed him to return for quarterly reporting and re-registration in July 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In early May 2012, two Chicago police officers went to the shelter to look for Regains. They did not find him, and they prepared a report for failure to register at that address. The next day, a Chicago police detective reviewed the report, visited the shelter without finding Regains, and issued an investigative alert informing other Chicago police officers that there was probable cause to arrest Regains.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On July 18, 2012, Regains reported as directed; Chicago police officers arrested him under the investigative alert. The prosecutor charged Regains with two violations of 730 ILCS \u00a7 150/6 -failure to register within three days after changing his address, and failure to report every ninety days. On September 4, 2012, Cook County Judge Thomas V. Gainer arraigned Regains and ordered him detained. Regains remained in custody until his December 3, 2013 trial-some seventeen months-at which time the judge found him not guilty.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Regains filed his original \u00a7 1983 complaint in federal court on December 3, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

His assertion that he should not have been arrested and charged sounded like a claim for false arrest, or false imprisonment. His assertion that he was detained for seventeen months while awaiting trial on a charge that was unfounded sounded like a malicious prosecution claim. The accrual rule for false arrest/false imprisonment claims is different from the accrual rule for malicious prosecution claims. A claim for false arrest or false imprisonment accrues once the plaintiff is detained (or released) as a result of a lawful process.\n   <em>\n    Wallace\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553763\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/384/#p387\">\n    549 U.S. at 390-391\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553763\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/384/#p387\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1091\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . A cause of action for malicious prosecution \"does not accrue until\n   the criminal proceedings have terminated in the plaintiff's favor.\"\n   <em>\n    Heck v.

He was arraigned and detained by lawful process on September 3, 2012, or earlier; under the false arrest/false imprisonment accrual rule, he would have had to file his \u00a7 1983 complaint by September 4, 2014. He did not file the complaint until December 3, 2014, three months later. In contrast, under the malicious prosecution accrual rule, Regains' claim would have accrued on December 3, 2013-the date he was acquitted. Regains filed his \u00a7 1983 complaint exactly two years after that date. If his claim properly fell into the false arrest/false imprisonment realm, his claim would have been time barred; if it fell into the malicious prosecution realm, it would have been timely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   After oral argument, this court resolved the timing question. In\n   <em>\n    Manuel v. City of Joliet,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518573\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/903/667/#p670\">\n    903 F.3d 667\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 670 (7th Cir. 2018) (\"\n   <em>\n    Manuel II\n   </em>\n   \"),\n   <em>\n    petition for cert. filed\n   </em>\n   , (U.S. Feb. 22, 2019) (No. 18-1093), we held that a claim that a plaintiff was detained without probable cause \"accrues when the detention ends.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Regains concedes that the officers who arrested him had probable cause to believe that he violated SORA, but he has consistently argued that he seeks damages because he was \"deprived of liberty without due process of law when he was held at the Cook County Jail until he was acquitted.\" Appellant's Br. at 13. Applying the principle of\n   <em>\n    Manuel II\n   </em>\n   to Regains' argument that his seventeen-month detention for a crime that he was misled into committing was unconstitutional, we conclude that his claim accrued when he was released on December 3, 2013, and that his claim was timely filed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   This conclusion does not necessarily mandate remand, however, because the district court stated other bases for dismissing the case. The court also found that Regains' amended complaint failed to identify specific conduct on the City's part that formed the basis for Regains' claim that it violated his rights under the Fourteenth Amendment. Regains named only the City as a defendant; he did not sue individual officers. The amended complaint was terse-six of its twenty paragraphs described how and why officers steered homeless sex offenders to shelters. The complaint then alleged that when Regains tried to register, officers steered him to a shelter, registered him at that shelter and required him to come back for re-registration in three months. It alleged the facts surrounding Regains' arrest and charging, and alleged that he stayed in custody until his trial and acquittal. The penultimate paragraph stated, \"As a result of the foregoing, plaintiff was deprived of rights secured by the Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States and incurred damages.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The amended complaint does not link specific conduct to Regains' assertion that his due process rights were violated. Other than identifying the City as an Illinois\n   municipal corporation, it does not describe any conduct by the City. It describes the actions of the\n   <em>\n    officers\n   </em>\n   who steered Regains to the shelter, the actions of the\n   <em>\n    officers\n   </em>\n   who issued the investigative alert and the actions of the\n   <em>\n    officers\n   </em>\n   who arrested him, but does not say which-if any-of these actions constitute conduct by the City that violated his due process rights. It says he \"was charged\" with a felony, and \"remained\" in custody until his acquittal, but does not attribute to the City or anyone else responsibility for the charges or his detention. It does not allege that police department officials with policy-making authority knew about these practices and allowed them to continue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   A plaintiff may remedy a deficient complaint by amending it, but the district court also questioned whether Regains could state a claim against the City at all. In brief comments at the end of its decision, the court noted that a municipality such as the City is subject to liability under \u00a7 1983 only if an official municipal policy caused the violation of the plaintiff's constitutional rights, citing\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1490618\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/436/658/#p692\">\n    436 U.S. at 692\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1490618\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/436/658/#p692\">\n    98 S.Ct. 2018\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

He asserts that \"[t]his practice was 'so widespread and well-settled that it constitutes a custom or usage with the force of law even though it is not authorized by written law or express policy.' \" Appellant's Reply Brief at 2, quoting\n   <em>\n    Rossi v.

Regains has presented no evidence to support these allegations; he never got the chance, because the district court dismissed the case at the pleading stage.

The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the City on the due process claim. The court stated that its ruling turned on \"one dispositive issue: whether Plaintiffs present sufficient evidence of a 'policy' or 'custom' on the part of Defendant to support municipal liability.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *6. Viewing the evidence the plaintiffs had presented in the light most favorable to them, the court found that they \"fail[ed] to raise a genuine issue of fact with respect to whether [Criminal Registration Section] personnel acted pursuant to an official policy or practice regarding the registration of homeless sex offenders.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *8. The court found that, at best, the plaintiffs had proven that on\n   ten occasions, individual officers may have engaged in unconstitutional behavior.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Although the plaintiffs appear to have presented a substantial amount of evidence in\n   <em>\n    Beley\n   </em>\n   , the court concluded that \"the evidence does not present a triable issue of fact regarding whether there was a policy or widespread practice of denying SORA registration to sex offenders who lacked a fixed address at the time of registration.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *10. \"At most, Plaintiffs have shown 'occasional lapses of judgment' or 'individual misconduct by police officers,' not 'systemic problems' or 'institutional behavior.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , quoting\n   <em>\n    Rossi,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4274046\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/790/729/#p737\">\n    790 F.3d at 737\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Ill., April 6, 2015). In granting summary judgment in favor of the City, the\n   <em>\n    Derfus\n   </em>\n   court concluded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   The fact that the City registered more offenders as not having a fixed residence or temporary domicile in two random time periods in 2014 than in two random time periods in prior years does not suggest that the City had a policy of refusing to register offenders with that status. Nor does the fact that it refused over a three-year period to register six offenders as \"homeless,\" a term that does not appear in SORA and that is commonly used to refer to a much broader segment of people than those deemed by SORA to be lacking a fixed residence or temporary domicile.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   These cases raise doubts about whether Regains could amend his complaint to allege a widespread policy or practice, or marshal proof at summary judgment that the\n   <em>\n    Beley\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Derfus\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs could not. Even if he can allege that a practice existed and that it was widespread enough to constitute a custom,\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   requires more. Regains' arguments and the very fact of his arrest and detention show that not all officers followed the practice. He describes a schism between registering officers who followed the steering practice and those who did not. To prove a\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claim, Regains will need to show that high-ranking members of the Chicago Police Department knew of the differing practices and allowed them to continue. This may be a tall order, but we cannot conclude that allowing Regains to try would be an exercise in futility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   A final point: on appeal, Regains consistently has characterized his claim as a violation of his Fourteenth Amendment due process rights. At the time he filed the appeal, that was his only option; our decision in\n   <em>\n    Newsome\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11088221\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/256/747/#p751\">\n    256 F.3d at 750\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , precluded the argument that pretrial detention that occurred after the start of the judicial process violated the Fourth Amendment.\n   <em>\n    Manuel I\n   </em>\n   since has abrogated\n   <em>\n    Newsome\n   </em>\n   , holding that \"the Fourth Amendment governs a claim for unlawful pretrial detention even beyond the start of legal process.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12609962\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/911/\">\n    137 S.Ct. at 920\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
