If the district court denies the initial \u00a7 2255 motion, the federal prisoner may directly appeal that ruling to this Court.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2255(d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In short, as important factual context, the dissents do not address, or complain about, direct appeals or initial \u00a7 2255 motions, whereby a federal prisoner already has had two post-conviction opportunities to challenge his sentence. Rather, the dissents ignore those two avenues of redress and are using this direct-appeal case as a vehicle to write about only a third type of post-conviction proceeding: a federal prisoner's application to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion pursuant to \u00a7 2255(h). I therefore turn to \u00a7 2255(h), which restricts prisoners' applications to file successive \u00a7 2255 motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    II. PRISONERS' APPLICATIONS TO FILE SUCCESSIVE \u00a7 2255 MOTIONS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   After a federal prisoner has used his two post-conviction opportunities to challenge his sentence (through a direct appeal and an initial \u00a7 2255 motion), Congress has narrowly and significantly limited the subsequent or successive times a federal prisoner can challenge his final sentence.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h). In the \u00a7 2255(h) statute, Congress has restricted such successive post-conviction challenges to only two types of highly circumscribed claims: (1) claims based on \"newly discovered evidence that, if proven and viewed in light of the evidence as a whole, would be sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that no reasonable factfinder would have found the movant guilty of the offense\"; or (2) claims based on \"a new rule of constitutional law, made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court, that was previously unavailable.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Congress imposed these restrictions on successive \u00a7 2255 motions in order to achieve finality of federal criminal judgments and to stop an endless flow of post-conviction petitions by federal prisoners in the federal courts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gonzalez v.

The Court carefully reviewed each and every individual application. The Court determined that some of those federal prisoners who filed were not even sentenced under the ACCA, and\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   did not apply to their cases at all.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re Griffin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5922473\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/823/1350/#p1354\">\n    823 F.3d 1350\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1354-56 (11th Cir. 2016) (holding that\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   's vagueness ruling does not apply to prisoners sentenced under the career offender sentencing guidelines).

In some cases, it was not hard to see the right answer.

This direct appeal in St. Hubert's case aptly illustrates this second available avenue of review of binding precedent established in a published panel order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Here, the\n   <em>\n    St. Hubert\n   </em>\n   panel relied on our binding precedent in\n   <em>\n    In re Saint Fleur\n   </em>\n   , a published panel order.\n   <em>\n    St. Hubert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519283\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/909/335/#p338\">\n    909 F.3d at 345-46\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (following\n   <em>\n    In re Saint Fleur\n   </em>\n   's holding that Hobbs Act robbery qualifies as a crime of violence under \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A) 's elements clause, and thus Saint Fleur's sentence was valid even if\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   rendered \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B) 's residual clause unconstitutional). Every time a panel applies this\n   <em>\n    In re Saint Fleur\n   </em>\n   precedent (as the\n   <em>\n    St. Hubert\n   </em>\n   panel did here), any active member of the Court can ask for en\n   banc review of that\n   <em>\n    In re Saint Fleur\n   </em>\n   precedent established in our Court's published panel order. Such an en banc poll was taken in this very case. Simply put, our Circuit law established in published panel orders, such as the\n   <em>\n    In re Saint Fleur\n   </em>\n   precedent, is subject to an en banc poll request each and every time it is applied in a subsequent case (like St. Hubert's).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Again, the problem for the dissenters is that the law established in the\n   <em>\n    In re Saint Fleur\n   </em>\n   published order is sound, and thus the dissenters have been unable to garner the majority votes needed to change that\n   <em>\n    In re Saint Fleur\n   </em>\n   precedent by taking\n   <em>\n    St. Hubert\n   </em>\n   en banc.

Perhaps he brings more than one collateral challenge; all of them fail. Eventually, in some other case, the Supreme Court announces a new rule of law that applies retroactively to cases on collateral review.

In these frameworks, \"prima facie showing\" has a purely formal meaning: it defines the set of elements proof of which suffices to raise a presumption of liability, subject to rebuttal if the defense meets some specified burden of its own.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   But this formal sense of the phrase \"prima facie showing\" does not fit section 2244(b)(3)(C). The statutory restrictions on second or successive collateral challenges plainly do not set up a burden-shifting framework. A prisoner's prima facie showing of compliance with section 2255(h) does not create any presumption that the government must rebut with an adequate showing of its own. Indeed, the prima facie showing does not even create a presumption of compliance with section 2255(h) ; the district court approaches that question\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Moss\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5870085\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/703/1301/#p1303\">\n    703 F.3d 1301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1303 (11th Cir. 2013). So how does our \"prima facie\" inspection of the prisoner's application differ from the district court's plenary assessment? The Act demands an answer to this question, but the dissent's analogies to burden-shifting frameworks do not help us find it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   When \"prima facie showing\" cannot bear a formal definition, it sometimes bears instead a functional meaning. For example, the Board of Immigration Appeals describes the standard for reopening of removal proceedings as requiring \"a prima facie showing of eligibility\" for the relief sought.\n   <em>\n    In re L-O-G-\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20413\">\n    21 I. &amp; N.

Judge Martin's dissent provides this example,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dissenting Op. of Martin, J., at 1205-06, but it undermines the argument that \"prima facie showing\" has a rigid meaning that categorically excludes consideration of the merits.

The dissent laments that the Act gives prisoners only \"one chance to collaterally attack their sentence as a matter of right\" and that the chance \"comes too soon\" for some convicts with lengthy sentences, Dissenting Op. of Martin, J., at 1202, but the statutory system of alternating limitations periods constitutes an integral part of Congress's orderly regulation of federal postconviction review,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"213\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202244\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d), 2255(f).

I voted against rehearing this case en banc because I cannot think of a workable common-law principle that denies precedential effect to such orders. If there is going to be some change in the effect given to these orders, I believe that will need to be done by way of a court rule (e.g., a rule providing [as we have done with unpublished opinions] that such orders do not have precedential effect, or a rule providing that such orders will only be binding in the second or successive application context, or a rule providing that such orders can be published only when there has been adversarial briefing).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Nevertheless, I have institutional concerns about our recent practice of publishing so many of these orders. I include myself as part of the problematic trend, as I have authored one of these orders,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Moss\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5870085\" index=\"217\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/703/1301/#p1303\">\n    703 F.3d 1301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (11th Cir. 2013), and have also been a member of panels which have issued others.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   * * * * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Applications under \u00a7\u00a7 2244(b)(2)-(3) and 2255(h) are different in significant respects from the matters usually handled by three-judge panels. Those differences strongly suggest that we should exercise more caution in deciding to publish an order disposing of an application, particularly on substantive issues of first impression.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   First, the applications must be decided within 30 days of filing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(D). Although this time limit is not mandatory in the jurisdictional sense,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Davis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3643121\" index=\"218\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/565/810/#p813\">\n    565 F.3d 810\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 813 (11th Cir. 2009) (order issued in April of 2009 for an application filed in October of 2008 asserting actual innocence), we try very hard to meet the compressed timeline imposed by Congress. But, practically speaking, we do not have 30 full days to do our work. The panel usually receives the staff attorney memorandum on the application (which is often pro se) a week or two from the date of filing, leaving only two to three weeks to rule on the application (while, of course, tending to numerous other matters, including other applications). This abbreviated schedule, which does not generally exist with respect to the other motions we handle on a daily or weekly basis, can lead to rulings without sufficient time for analysis and reflection. And that, in turn, can result in mistakes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Second, in this circuit the applications are almost always ruled upon without adversarial participation or briefing. Sometimes we decide only on the basis of a pro se litigant's submission, as supplemented by a staff attorney memorandum. In a system like ours, that means that we may miss something important (e.g., critical parts of the district court record, or an issue we did not think of ourselves) on the quick road to decision and publication.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Third, the applications result in decisions that are not generally reviewable. Pursuant to \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(E), orders on applications are not appealable and cannot be the subject of a petition for rehearing or for a writ of certiorari. Panels have on occasion revisited their orders sua sponte (for example, when the staff attorney's office has called a panel's attention to a mistake), but relying on a panel to identify and recognize its own error without assistance from the parties once the application is adjudicated is certainly not the norm in appellate procedure. I recognize that it is an open question whether an order disposing\n   of an application can be the subject of a sua sponte en banc proceeding. But even if that limited avenue exists, the absence of typical channels of review provides an additional institutional reason to publish fewer of these now-binding orders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   In sum, when we review and rule on applications pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 2244(b) and 2255(h), \"major aspects of the normal appellate process [are] absent.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

In that five-year period, ending April 1, 2018, we have published 45 such orders, while all of the other circuits combined have published 80 orders.

We make our decision based on the prisoner's application, which is written with a pen or typewriter on an extremely constraining form.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   11th Cir. R. 22-3(a). Few prisoners manage to squeeze more than 100 words into the permitted space. Some have attorneys, but they are subject to the same restrictive form as are pro se litigants. Nothing else is filed on our docket. The government never files a responsive pleading, and we never grant oral argument. Most troublingly, the orders that come out of this lackluster process are unappealable.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"375\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202244\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3)(E) (\"The grant or denial of an authorization by a court of appeals to file a second or successive application shall not be appealable and shall not be the subject of a petition for rehearing or for a writ of certiorari.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-243\">\n   This stands in stark contrast to the practices of the other circuits, which often hear oral argument and read particularized government briefs, and which consider the statutory thirty-day time limit to be optional. And, likely recognizing the unenviable process that generates these second or successive orders, all other circuits publish substantially fewer orders than we do.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   This process also differs greatly from that of our merits appeals, in which we have no time constraints, we have government briefing (and, when issuing a published opinion, we have typically heard oral argument), and we have a full record. Of course, parties may appeal merits decisions to the Supreme Court and may ask for panel or en banc rehearing in this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-244\">\n   Incredibly, despite this alarming contrast in process, by declining to take this case en banc, the full Court has ratified the rule that these hastily-written, uncontested orders bind\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   panels, including merits panels. These super-precedents are\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   appealable to the Supreme Court, and may\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   be the subject of a petition for rehearing. Thus, a panel deciding a substantive issue in a published order insulates itself from essentially\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   review.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-245\">\n   Despite the inability to seek rehearing en banc or appeal to the Supreme Court, these published panel orders are now afforded the same precedential weight as merits decisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-246\">\n   Such a decision should have weighed greatly on this Court, and it should have been sufficient for en banc consideration. It is inconceivable that this Court would want all motions panels, merits panels, and lower courts in the Circuit to be bound on substantive issues by an order decided on the basis of forty-three words of pro se argument, in under thirty-days, with no avenue of appeal or review. It is similarly inconceivable that this Court would establish this rule without rehearing en banc. Because I cannot support such a rule, I dissent from the denial of rehearing en banc.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-247\">\n   Judge Tjoflat takes offense to my dissent, which sheds light on what I believe is an unfair process.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thoughtful and respectful disagreement is essential to our constitutional directive-\"[t]he premise of our adversarial system is that appellate courts ...

Cir. 1983) (Scalia, J.). There is sometimes impassioned but collegial disagreement about the answers to those questions. But to turn substantive disagreement into a sweeping charge that contrary views are \"attacks on the integrity of the court as an institution\" is another thing entirely. It is the great respect for both this Court as an institution and the judicial role that leads members of this Court to dissent. And if anyone has the duty to raise concerns about the fairness of this Court's process for resolving a category of appeals, it is a member of this Court. Consistent with that duty, I will continue to express disagreement when important issues are at stake. In another case, when Judge Tjoflat is in the minority, he will be entitled to do the same.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-248\">\n   MARTIN, Circuit Judge, with whom JILL PRYOR, Circuit Judge, joins, dissenting from the denial of rehearing en banc:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-249\">\n   Federal judges who decide cases in groups are bound to have differences of opinions about how those cases are decided. I've always understood that it is the discussion of those differing views that furthers the development and evolution of the laws and precedent that govern us all. My understanding does not appear to be unique, because if there is any member of this court who has not written a dissenting opinion, they have not been on this court\n   for very long. As for this dissent, it is certainly not an attack on the institution of the federal courts, to which I have devoted the last eighteen years of my professional life. Rather, this dissent is intended to honor the role I have been given on this court. I understand my oath to require me to point out procedures or interpretations of the law that I view as hampering our ability to administer justice to the people who come before us.

Although this is Mr. St. Hubert's first opportunity to challenge his conviction and sentence in this court, his opportunity is limited by rulings this court has made in our habeas jurisprudence. So while Mr. St. Hubert is sitting in prison, his case has generated what I view as a healthy discussion of how it came to pass that he will be required to serve the entirety of a sentence that could not be legally imposed upon him if he were sentenced today. Six of the twelve of the active judges on this court have written opinions about Mr. Hubert's case, so it seems to have merited a valuable exchange of viewpoints.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-251\">\n   Michael St. Hubert was 37-years-old when he pled guilty to two firearms charges brought against him under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"377\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c).

Penalties for \u00a7 924(c) are notoriously harsh-requiring a 5-to-10-year sentence for a first conviction and a mandatory minimum and consecutive 25-year sentence for a second, and a third, etc.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"390\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1)(A), (1)(C), (1)(D)(ii). Under the statute at the time of his conviction, each of Mr. St. Hubert's two \u00a7 924(c) convictions had to carry separate, consecutive sentences.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"391\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A), (1)(D)(ii). In south Florida, where Mr. St. Hubert was charged and convicted, prosecutors have routinely charged more than one \u00a7 924(c) count, which is sometimes referred to as \"stacking\" those charges. This charging decision leaves the sentencing court no choice but to add decades to sentences of defendants who took part in a crime spree that involved firearms in more than one location. Specifically, for Mr. St. Hubert, the decision to charge him with the second \u00a7 924(c) violation added 25 years to his sentence. Notably, the recently enacted First Step Act of 2018 would not have permitted this type of \"stacking\" of \u00a7 924(c) charges in Mr. St. Hubert's case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   S. Res. 756, 115th Cong. \u00a7 403 (2018) (enacted). To say it plainly, this new law would today prohibit 25 years of the 32-year sentence imposed on Mr. St. Hubert in 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-258\">\n   Also notable, available data indicates that federal prosecutors in different parts of the country have different practices related to charging a defendant with a \u00a7 924(c) violation for one, or two, or every incident in which a gun was used or carried during a crime spree.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.S. Sentencing Comm'n,\n   <em>\n    Report to Congress: Mandatory Minimum Penalties for Firearms Offenses in the Federal Criminal Justice System\n   </em>\n   22 (2018) (explaining, in fiscal year 2016, Southern Florida was one of only 8 districts out of 78 reporting any cases in which more than one count of \u00a7 924(c) was charged). Thus, the random factors of time and geography mean that Mr. St. Hubert will serve a significantly longer sentence than a person who committed precisely the same crime but did so more recently or in another part of the country.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-259\">\n   The panel rejected Mr. St. Hubert's arguments about the nature of his prior convictions. It deemed both his Hobbs Act robbery and attempted Hobbs Act robbery to be crimes of violence under both \u00a7 924(c) 's residual clause and its use-of-force clause.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    St. Hubert II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519283\" index=\"392\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/909/335/#p338\">\n    909 F.3d at 344-53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . By my count, the\n   <em>\n    St. Hubert II\n   </em>\n   panel opinion ruled against Mr. St. Hubert in four different ways. Two of those rulings alone would have ended his appeal by affirming his convictions and 32-year sentence. I say the alternative holdings reach beyond what was necessary to decide Mr. St. Hubert's case. Even so, those gratuitous rulings bind future panels of this Court in cases for which they should have been allowed a fresh look. Here, I will address one especially harmful holding: that the\n   <em>\n    St. Hubert II\n   </em>\n   panel was bound to characterize Mr. St. Hubert's crimes as \"violent\" because panels of this Court had done so in earlier rulings denying applications for leave to file second or successive \u00a7 2255 motions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    St. Hubert II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519283\" index=\"393\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/909/335/#p338\">\n    909 F.3d at 345-46\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-260\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-261\">\n   The ruling that causes Mr. St. Hubert to lose his direct appeal is mandated by this court's habeas jurisprudence. For that reason, my discussion will include a brief overview of the remedies available to inmates who are years into serving a long sentence, which they believe should be shortened due to a recent development in the law. Generally, a prisoner suffering under a sentence he contends is illegal must seek relief by way of motion authorized under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"394\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 renders this quite a narrow path to relief. For example, prisoners are generally given one chance to collaterally attack their sentence as a matter of right, and this they must do within one year of when it became final.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"395\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f)(1). For inmates like Mr. St. Hubert, who have been sentenced to serve decades-long terms in prison, this one-time right to review comes too soon. Almost always, the law that defined and governed an inmate's sentence when it was imposed develops and evolves during his many years behind bars. Even so, those prisoners who already filed a \u00a7 2255 motion within the one-year permitted by statute are strictly limited in their ability to bring to the courts any legal issue that later developed regarding their sentence. For starters, these inmates cannot file another motion (a \"second or successive\" motion, by the terms of the statute) without getting permission from this Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"396\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-262\">\n   And the statute governing this \"get permission\" process is quite specific. It directs that \"[a] motion in the court of appeals for an order authorizing the district court to consider a second or successive application shall be determined by a three-judge panel\n   of the court of appeals.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"397\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202244\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3)(B). Also, \"[t]he court of appeals may authorize the filing of a second or successive application only if it determines that the application makes a prima facie showing that the application satisfies the requirements of this subsection.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"398\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202244\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3)(C). The statute sets a time-limit for this authorization: \"[t]he court of appeals shall grant or deny the authorization to file a second or successive application not later than 30 days after the filing of the motion.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"399\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202244\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3)(D). And although the statute does not expressly prohibit briefing in this context, the panel must rule within the 30-day time limit, so briefing is nearly impossible. Indeed, the statute makes no provision for the government having custody of the prisoner to even know that the inmate applied to file a second or successive petition. Returning to the statute, its remaining provision removes every possible avenue for the appeal of this \"prima facie\" determination: \"[t]he grant or denial of an authorization to file a second or successive application shall not be appealable and shall not be the subject of a petition for rehearing or for a writ of certiorari.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"400\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202244\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3)(E). From my point of view, it is this prohibition on review that most invites abuse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-263\">\n   The language of this statute simply does not authorize courts of appeal to make merits decisions about the correctness of an inmate's sentence when he is merely seeking permission to file a habeas petition in District Court. A panel presented with a second or successive application is not empowered by the statute to decide in the first instance whether an inmate is entitled to relief. I agree with Judge William Pryor that where Supreme Court or existing Eleventh Circuit precedent already obviously forecloses a prisoner's claim, we should deny his application. But where there is an open merits question, the statute calls for the case to go to the District Court for consideration of that question in the first instance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-264\">\n   I offer the example of a case brought by a man named Stony Lester, because it illustrates how our get-permission process should operate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stoney Lester\n   </em>\n   , No. 16-11730-A, slip op.

Even though the panel disagreed about whether Mr. Lester would ultimately succeed on his claim, it granted his application.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"401\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202244\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"401\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202244\">\n    at 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Kentucky\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12787\" index=\"411\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/476/79/\">\n    476 U.S. 79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 93-94,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12787\" index=\"412\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/476/79/\">\n    106 S.Ct. 1712\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1721,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12787\" index=\"413\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/476/79/\">\n    90 L.Ed.2d 69\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1986).

Thus, the merits question of whether a party engaged in racial discrimination when it selected a jury simply cannot be answered based on the prima facie showing alone. But of course in this context there is an opportunity for adversarial testing. And if a court were to overstep its authority by making a merits decision at the \"prima facie showing\" stage, the offended party can point out the error to that court or on appeal. Not so for an inmate erroneously forced to prove his merits case at the \"get permission\" stage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-269\">\n   Similarly, in employment cases, the prima facie showing is a tool for distributing the burden for producing evidence. A court considering claims of workplace discrimination first looks to the person alleging discrimination to show \"actions taken by the employer from which one can infer, if such actions remain unexplained, that it is more likely than not that such actions were based on a discriminatory criterion illegal under Title VII.\"\n   <em>\n    Young v.

Once this prima facie showing-not an onerous one-is made, the burden shifts to the employer to offer a nondiscriminatory reason for the employment action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12587429\" index=\"422\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/1338/#p1354\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quotation marks omitted). Again here, even though some adversarial testing can occur, courts are not allowed to cut off the search for truth once the prima facie showing has been made. And here too, courts that force a merits decision at the prima facie evaluation stage can be challenged on rehearing and on appeal. Not so for inmates seeking to file a second or successive petition, however, because \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(E) does not provide them such recourse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-270\">\n   Judge William Pryor argues that my reference to these examples is misplaced because\n   <extracted-citation index=\"423\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , unlike\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   or employment discrimination challenges, does not implicate a burden shifting framework.

He notes for example a series of orders in which \"this Court determined that\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   's residual clause holding did not apply to companion \u00a7 924(c) crimes and that, even assuming\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   did, the prisoners' crimes qualified under \u00a7 924(c) 's elements clause, which likewise was not affected by\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   .\" Tjoflat, J., concurring op. at 1178.

While he may find it comforting that we've exceeded Congress's mandate only sparingly, I do not. Neither do I believe our Court can justify our overreach because the merits decisions we make in this context might match those made by other Circuits after more thorough review. In the same way, I do not share Judge Tjoflat's apparent comfort that we have our Staff Attorney's Office give us advice on merits issues better left to U.S. District Judges to decide.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tjoflat, J., concurring op. at 1179-80, 1183. Finally in this regard, I take no comfort in the backstop of a sua sponte en banc call by an active member of this Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"486\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202244\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"486\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202244\">\n    at 1181-82\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This process would require a member of this Court to identify a wrongly decided merits order for which no petition for rehearing en banc has been filed; succeed in an en banc call; and persuade the full en banc court to reverse the panel decision. And this is a process the prisoner cannot himself initiate and generally is excluded from participating. I do not disagree with Judge Tjoflat when he says about us that \"[t]he real problem for the dissenters\" is that we \"have not garnered the majority votes needed to vacate the particular published panel orders with which [we] disagree.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"487\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202244\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"487\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202244\">\n    at 1181\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

To get to that conclusion, the opinion made two right turns before it took a wrong turn, but the wrong turn led to a logical and legal dead end. First, the opinion said, \"the definition of a crime of violence in [the elements clause] equates the use of force with attempted force, and thus the text of [the elements clause] makes clear that actual force need not be used for a crime to qualify\" as a crime of violence.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519283\" index=\"499\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/909/335/#p338\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   No disagreement here. Second, \"a completed Hobbs Act robbery itself qualifies as a crime of violence under [ \u00a7 924(c) 's elements clause] and, therefore, attempt to commit Hobbs Act robbery requires that St. Hubert intended to commit every element of Hobbs Act robbery, including the taking of property in a forcible manner.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519283\" index=\"500\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/909/335/#p338\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   That is because \"a defendant must intend to commit every element of the completed crime in order to be guilty of attempt.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519283\" index=\"501\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/909/335/#p338\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   So far so good.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-297\">\n   But then the opinion concluded: \" '[A]n attempt to commit a crime should be treated\n   as an attempt to commit every element of that crime' \"; thus, \"when a substantive offense qualifies as a violent felony under [ \u00a7 924(c) 's elements clause], an attempt to commit that offense also is a violent felony.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519283\" index=\"502\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/909/335/#p338\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Hill v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12265823\" index=\"503\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/877/717/#p719\">\n    877 F.3d 717\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 719 (7th Cir. 2017) ). This is where the panel opinion (and the\n   <em>\n    Hill\n   </em>\n   opinion upon which it relied) went wrong. Logic permits no inference from the fact of a conviction for an attempt crime that the person attempted to commit every element of the substantive offense. The panel was able to bridge this logical gap only by converting\n   <em>\n    intent\n   </em>\n   to commit each element of the substantive offense (proof of which is necessary to convict someone of an attempt crime) into\n   <em>\n    attempt\n   </em>\n   to commit each element of the substantive offense (which is not necessary to convict someone of an attempt crime).\n   <em>\n    Intending\n   </em>\n   to commit each element of a crime involving the use of force simply is not the same as\n   <em>\n    attempting\n   </em>\n   to commit each element of that crime. By the alchemy of transmuting intent to commit each element into attempt to commit each element, the panel conjured the conclusion that anyone convicted of an attempt to commit a crime involving force must have been found beyond a reasonable doubt to have attempted to use force. That's the logical flaw.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-298\">\n   Now the legal flaw: the panel's transformation of an attempted offense into an attempt to commit each element of the offense does not align with the actual elements of an attempt offense.\n   <em>\n    Rothenberg\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3694634\" index=\"504\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/610/621/#p626\">\n    610 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   626 ;\n   <em>\n    Murrell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9248615\" index=\"505\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/368/1283/#p1286\">\n    368 F.3d at 1286\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . So it is incorrect to say that a person necessarily attempts to use physical force within the meaning of \u00a7 924(c) 's elements clause just because he attempts a crime that, if completed, would be violent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-299\">\n   Conviction for an attempt crime also requires an overt act, but that element does not fill the panel opinion's logical gap. We can easily imagine that a person may engage in an overt act-in the case of robbery, for example, overt acts might include renting a getaway van, parking the van a block from the bank, and approaching the bank's door before being thwarted-without having used, attempted to use, or threatened to use force. Would this would-be robber have\n   <em>\n    intended\n   </em>\n   to use, attempt to use, or threaten to use force? Sure. Would he necessarily have attempted to use force? No. So an individual's conduct may satisfy all the elements of an attempt to commit an elements-clause offense without anything more than intent to use elements-clause force and some act (in furtherance of the intended offense) that does not involve the use, attempted use, or threatened use of such force. The panel opinion's conclusion that an attempt to commit a crime of violence necessarily is itself a crime of violence simply does not hold up.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-300\">\n   By declining to rehear this case en banc, our court not only ignores the serious institutional concerns my colleagues describe in their dissents, but it also misses the chance to reexamine the panel's flawed logic as to attempt crimes. This missed opportunity perpetuates unlawfully lengthy sentences for people convicted of attempt crimes. And the panel opinion's erroneous holding reaches beyond \u00a7 924(c) because this court already has applied that holding to the Armed Career Criminal Act, which increases the sentence for any person convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm who has three prior convictions for violent felonies or serious drug offenses.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hylor v.
