Harwell Jr. (the\n   <em>\n    Harwell\n   </em>\n   ), a towboat operated by Ingram\n   Barge Company, was pushing empty barges up the Mississippi River when the barges struck the Sabula Railroad Bridge, owned by Dakota, Minnesota &amp; Eastern Railroad Corporation (DM&amp;E). DM&amp;E sued Ingram for damages. Following a bench trial, the district court entered judgment in favor of DM&amp;E for the full amount sought.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ingram appeals. Because we conclude that the district court committed an error of law, we vacate the judgment and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Secretary of War authorized the construction of the Sabula Railroad Bridge in 1880. To allow river traffic to pass, a portion of the Bridge rotates 90 degrees on a central pivot, producing two 154-foot-wide channels on either side. Protection piers extend north and south from the center of the Bridge; when the Bridge is in its open position, the Bridge's tracks rest above the piers separating the two channels. Northbound traffic ordinarily uses the east channel, and southbound traffic ordinarily uses the west channel. The typical barge arrangement on this portion of the river is approximately 105 feet wide, leaving under 25 feet of clearance on either side. Unsurprisingly, barge operators are sometimes unsuccessful at avoiding contact between their modern-sized tows and the centenarian Bridge.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    I&amp;M Rail Link, LLC v.

The Order to Alter declared the Bridge to be an \"unreasonable obstruction to the free navigation of the Upper Mississippi River\" and directed the then-owner to reconstruct the Bridge to expand the horizontal clearance to at least 300 feet, approximately double its current width. Neither DM&amp;E nor any prior owner of the Bridge took any action to complete such reconstruction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On April 24, 2015, the\n   <em>\n    Harwell\n   </em>\n   was traveling north on the Mississippi River. Hershey Dampier was steering under the supervision of pilot Tommy Hinton. Dampier was on his first trip as a licensed steersman but had traveled under the Bridge many times during his twelve years as a deckhand. He discussed the procedure for passing through the Bridge with Hinton prior to their approach. Because the wind was blowing from east to west, Hinton advised Dampier to keep the barges pointed to the right side of the eastern channel. About 300 or 400 feet from the Bridge, Dampier realized that the barges were too close to the protection pier on the left side. Dampier attempted to correct by steering further to the east but the barges allided with the protection pier, causing damage to the wooden structure and a maintenance platform. Dampier was not disciplined for the incident, and he has since piloted through the Bridge more than a dozen times without incident. DM&amp;E's staff concluded that the damage to the protection pier required immediate repair to prevent the risk that another allision would damage the tracks and render the Bridge inoperable. Contractors completed the repairs at a cost of $ 276,860.85. DM&amp;E brought suit against Ingram to recover these repair costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Following a bench trial, the district court concluded that no comparative fault could attach to DM&amp; E absent evidence of a breach of a legal duty to expand the Bridge's horizontal clearance, and that the Order to Alter imposed no such duty. It apportioned all of the fault to Ingram and awarded DM&amp; E the full amount of the repair costs plus prejudgment interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   We review findings of a district court's bench trial in admiralty cases, including negligence determinations, under a clearly erroneous standard.\n   <em>\n    In re MO Barge Lines, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2164206\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/360/885/#p889\">\n    360 F.3d 885\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 889 (8th Cir. 2004).

If the owner of a bridge fails to adhere to the standard of \"a reasonable person under like circumstances,\" and this failure contributes to an allision, the court may reduce the owner's recovery accordingly.\n   <em>\n    S.

But the owner of a lawful bridge may be found comparatively negligent for an allision even absent an affirmative legal duty to alter the bridge's configuration, as illustrated by the Seventh Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    M/V Morgan\n   </em>\n   . In that case, the court examined an allision between a tugboat and a bridge that resulted in damage to the bridge's electrical cabling.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9374894\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/375/563/#p572\">\n    375 F.3d at 570\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court concluded that the tugboat operators had failed to rebut the\n   <em>\n    Oregon\n   </em>\n   presumption and were liable for negligence.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9374894\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/375/563/#p572\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9374894\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/375/563/#p572\">\n    at 573-78\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Nonetheless, and even though the bridge was in compliance with its permit, the court affirmed the district court's equal apportionment of damages between the parties based on the bridge owner's failure to replace a wooden fender that previously protected the cabling.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9374894\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/375/563/#p572\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9374894\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/375/563/#p572\">\n    at 578-79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It follows from\n   <em>\n    M/V Morgan\n   </em>\n   that a negligent bridge owner may face reduced damages from an allision under admiralty's comparative fault regime, as the Seventh Circuit has held in a previous case dealing with an allision with the Sabula Bridge.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    I&amp;M Rail Link\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"654286\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/198/1012/\">\n    198 F.3d at 1016\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (remanding to the district court to determine whether the Bridge's design \"bear[s] some responsibility\" for allision). It also follows that a finding of comparative negligence does not necessarily require the bridge owner to have violated a specific legal duty owed to others imposed by statute or regulation. All that is required is a finding that the bridge owner was negligent and that this \"negligence ... contribute[d] to the loss.\" 1\n   <em>\n    Admiralty &amp; Mar.

We disagree.\n   <em>\n    Sierra Club\n   </em>\n   simply concluded that Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Appropriation Act, which prohibits the creation of any obstruction to navigable waters not authorized by Congress, did not establish a private right of action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6184835\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/451/287/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6184835\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/451/287/\">\n    at 292-97\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6184835\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/451/287/\">\n    101 S.Ct. 1775\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This holding does not immunize a bridge from its own comparative fault when an allision occurs. Since\n   <em>\n    Sierra Club\n   </em>\n   , we have held that \"the trier of fact should determine whether\" a lawful bridge's obstruction to navigation is unreasonable and a contributing cause of an allision,\n   <em>\n    Kirby Inland Marine\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9404756\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/296/671/#p673\">\n    296 F.3d at 676\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , as has the Seventh Circuit specifically with regard to the Sabula Bridge,\n   <em>\n    I&amp;M Rail Link\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"654286\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/198/1012/\">\n    198 F.3d at 1016\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . If the district court so concludes, it may reduce the bridge owner's recovery based upon the bridge's comparative fault.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   DM&amp;E also argues that the district court independently found that the\n   <em>\n    Har\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    well\n   </em>\n   's crew's negligence was the only \"actual cause\" of the allision, and that this factual finding was not clearly erroneous. We are dubious that this truly was an independent factual finding. The district court's conclusion that Ingram was solely responsible for the accident came only after it concluded that it could not, as a matter of law, apportion any of the fault to DM&amp;E. And the court acknowledged that the evidence demonstrated that the Bridge \"poses a difficult obstacle to barge traffic\" due to the narrowness of its channels, which leave \"little clearance\" for modern barge configurations. It appears that the district court's factual finding apportioning all of the fault to Ingram may not have been divorced from its earlier legal error.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   A factual finding \"based on an erroneous view of the law\" will not be upheld, even on review for clear error.\n   <em>\n    Urban Hotel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5896303\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/535/874/#p879\">\n    535 F.3d at 879\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We express no opinion on whether DM&amp;E in fact was comparatively negligent; we leave that assessment to the district court in the first instance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In accordance with the above, we vacate the decision of the district court and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-29\">\n    The complaint named Soo Line Railroad Company, DM&amp;E's corporate parent, as an additional plaintiff and included a second claim relating to a September 7, 2015, allision involving a different bridge owned by Soo Line. That claim was dismissed pursuant to the parties' stipulation prior to trial and no allegations remain relevant to Soo Line.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    DM&amp;E places great weight on the district court's use of the word \"[m]oreover\" to separate its legal conclusion that it could not apportion fault to DM&amp;E from its factual finding that Ingram's negligence was the sole cause of the allision. We do not parse the language of the district court's opinion with such granularity.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Reiter v.
