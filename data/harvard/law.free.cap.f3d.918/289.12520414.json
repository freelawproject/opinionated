Komis, a former federal employee, brought Title VII retaliation and retaliatory hostile work environment claims against the Secretary of Labor. The trial court granted judgment as a matter of law for the Secretary on the discrete retaliation claim, and Komis did not appeal. The retaliatory hostile work environment claim went before a jury, which returned a verdict for the Secretary. Komis appeals that verdict, challenging the jury instructions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This appeal requires us to decide whether federal employees may bring retaliation claims under Title VII. We conclude they may. We are then asked to consider whether the same standard governs federal- and private- sector retaliation claims, and what standard in particular applies to a federal retaliatory hostile work environment claim in light of the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Burlington Northern &amp; Santa Fe Railway Co. v. White\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3500335\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/548/53/\">\n    548 U.S. 53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3500335\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/548/53/\">\n    126 S.Ct. 2405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3500335\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/548/53/\">\n    165 L.Ed.2d 345\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2006). We need not resolve these questions, however, because Komis cannot prevail under any potentially applicable standard. Accordingly, any error in the jury instructions was harmless. We will affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Between June 2003 and September 2008, Komis filed more than sixty Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) complaints while employed by the Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). Allegedly in retaliation for those and other EEO complaints filed a decade earlier,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Komis contends her employer created a hostile work environment. Specifically, she alleges (\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   ) her supervisors: (1) denied her the ability to work regularly from home; (2) shifted\n   her job duties to include more clerical work; (3) reassigned her to a different position; and (4) failed to promote her to Assistant Regional Administrator, instead selecting attorney Maureen Russo. Komis further alleges (5) once Russo became her immediate supervisor, Russo improperly disciplined her in retaliation for making additional discrimination claims. The disciplinary actions at issue include a written reprimand, suspension, denial of access to training opportunities, and removal from a particular assignment. We observe that all the hostile acts Komis alleges appear to be discrete personnel actions altering the terms and conditions of her employment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In August 2008, Komis was issued a notice of proposed removal, informing her of OSHA's decision to terminate her employment and providing her an opportunity to respond. Komis left OSHA in September 2008 and filed the last of her EEO complaints, alleging constructive discharge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In October 2008, Komis sued the Secretary of Labor, alleging OSHA violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-16(a). She brought two claims: (1) a retaliation claim based on her nonselection for promotion; and (2) a retaliatory hostile work environment claim. By consent, the matter was tried before a Magistrate Judge. As noted, at the close of Komis's case, the trial judge granted the Secretary judgment as a matter of law on Komis's discrete retaliation claim. Komis did not appeal that judgment. The retaliatory hostile work environment claim proceeded to the jury, which returned a verdict in the Secretary's favor. Komis now challenges the jury charge on appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The parties dispute whether the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Burlington Northern v.

While a discrimination claim under Title VII alleges discrimination on the basis of one's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, a retaliation claim alleges discrimination on the basis of protected conduct:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer to discriminate against any of his employees or applicants for employment ... because [the employee] has opposed any practice made an unlawful employment practice by this subchapter, or because he has made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this subchapter.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a). Unlike the antidiscrimination provision, the antiretaliation provision is not limited to employer action that affects the terms and conditions of a claimant's employment. As the Supreme Court explained in\n   <em>\n    Burlington Northern\n   </em>\n   , \"[a]n employer can effectively retaliate against an employee by taking actions not directly related to his employment or by causing him harm\n   <em>\n    outside\n   </em>\n   the workplace.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3500335\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/548/53/\">\n    548 U.S. at 63\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3500335\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/548/53/\">\n    126 S.Ct. 2405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Komis, for instance, contends one of the incidents creating a retaliatory hostile work environment was her supervisor Russo's decision to deny her request to work regularly at home-but Komis had last filed an EEO claim in 1993, and offered no reason to think Russo's decision to deny that request in 2003 was made in retaliation for her decade-old EEO claim. Given that no other employee in Komis's office was given permission to work regularly at home, the decision not to give Komis such unique dispensation does not appear materially adverse or even objectionable. In another example, Komis alleged Russo unfairly disciplined her, but several of those allegedly retaliatory incidents took place before Russo knew Komis had filed EEO complaints, again undermining the notion that the discipline was issued in retaliation for protected conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Moreover, Komis fails to rebut the government's legitimate, non-retaliatory explanations for the alleged retaliatory conduct as required under the framework established in\n   <em>\n    McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10002\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/411/792/\">\n    411 U.S. 792\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10002\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/411/792/\">\n    93 S.Ct. 1817\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10002\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/411/792/\">\n    36 L.Ed.2d 668\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1973). Komis claims that as a result of her filing discrimination complaints with the EEOC, her job duties were changed and she was given the work of a clerk. She also claims she was subjected to harsher punishment. The government offered overwhelming evidence that (1) there were fewer industrial hygiene assignments overall, (2) Komis's Voluntary Protection Program (VPP) duties made it difficult to schedule Komis for such assignments, (3) OSHA's focus shifted under a new presidential administration,\n   (4) her three suspensions were proper disciplinary actions appropriate for Komis's infractions of direct insubordination and forwarding of internal OSHA emails outside the agency, and (5) clerical duties were actually part of her job description from the time she took the position. Komis failed to offer any evidence rebutting these justifications. On appeal, she offers hardly any fact-based response at all to the government's claim of harmless error.
