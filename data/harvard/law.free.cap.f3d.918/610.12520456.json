The Community's Efforts to Engage in Class II Gaming\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Community submitted a class II gaming ordinance to the Gaming Commission for review and approval in December of 2014. In March of 2015, the Assistant Secretary-Indian Affairs, acting on behalf of Interior, issued a memorandum to the Chair of the Gaming Commission concluding that the Community did not qualify as an Indian tribe for purposes of IGRA because it is not federally recognized and does not appear on the annual list of recognized tribes the Secretary publishes pursuant to the List Act. The Assistant Secretary opined that the Gaming Commission could rely on this annual list to determine whether an entity is a federally recognized Indian tribe because the list is intended to be exhaustive, because it offers transparency surrounding which groups of Indians are eligible for gaming pursuant to IGRA, and because it provides a \"bright line\" rule that preserves government resources. The Solicitor of the Department of the Interior also concluded that the Community was not an Indian tribe for purposes of IGRA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Relying on Interior's determination, the Chair of the Gaming Commission concluded that the Commission was without authority to review the Community's gaming ordinance. The Community's requests for reconsideration were denied, and the Community filed suit in district court. The district court dismissed the claims against the Gaming Commission and its Chair for failure to state a claim. Thereafter, the court granted summary judgment in favor of the remaining defendants. The district court reasoned that IGRA and the Frank's Landing Act, read together, are ambiguous regarding whether Congress intended to authorize the Community to engage in class II gaming, but it concluded, pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v.

Accordingly, the dispositive questions in this case are narrow: (1) whether an Indian group must be recognized by the Secretary in order to qualify as an \"Indian tribe\" for purposes of IGRA; and, if so, (2) whether the Frank's Landing Act nevertheless authorizes the Community to engage in class II gaming pursuant to IGRA. To resolve these questions, we start with the definition of \"Indian tribe\" in IGRA, \u00a7 2703(5). Because the Frank's Landing Act granted the Community some form of special status before Congress adopted IGRA, we also consider the Frank's Landing Act, both as originally adopted and as amended in 1994.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \"We interpret [each] federal statute by ascertaining the intent of Congress and by giving effect to its legislative will.\"\n   <em>\n    Artichoke Joe's California Grand Casino v.

Interior does not challenge the Community's assertion that it is a self-governing community of Indians, but the parties part ways over how to interpret IGRA's requirement that an Indian tribe must be \"recognized as eligible by the Secretary for the special programs and services provided by the United States to Indians because of their status as Indians[.]\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202703\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2703(5)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Interior points to IGRA's requirement that a tribe be recognized as eligible\n   <em>\n    by the Secretary\n   </em>\n   , and argues that no such recognition has been made for the Community. The Community isolates IGRA's phrase\n   \"special programs and services provided by the United States to Indians because of their status as Indians,\" and contends that it unambiguously includes the Community, because the Frank's Landing Act provides that it is eligible to participate in \"special programs and services\" specifically targeted to Indians. The Community argues that the phrase \"recognized as eligible by the Secretary\" is irrelevant to the task of determining whether the Community may engage in class II gaming because Congress has plenary power to legislate concerning Indian tribes, and the Secretary must accede to what the Community argues is a congressional directive in the Frank's Landing Act-that the Community is eligible for \"special programs and services.\" The Community urges us to conclude that it is therefore eligible to participate in class II gaming.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   We agree with the Community that the phrase \"special programs and services provided by the United States to Indians because of their status as Indians\" refers to eligibility to participate in federal programs specifically targeted to Indians.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hoopa Valley Indian Tribe v.

However, IGRA's additional phrase \"recognized as eligible by the Secretary\" is a key qualifier. On its face, this phrase means that the\n   <em>\n    Secretary\n   </em>\n   must recognize an Indian tribe as eligible for special programs and services. And, as we explain\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   , the significance of Secretarial recognition in the context of federal Indian law means that a tribe is federally recognized and that it appears on the Secretary's annual list.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    F.A.A. v.

It is unsurprising that the particular interpretive question we address here has not been examined in our earlier caselaw; IGRA's plain language provides that an Indian tribe is one that is \"recognized as eligible by the Secretary\" for \"special programs and services,\" and this type of recognition is typically determined by simply confirming whether an Indian group appears on the Secretary's annual list.

Plainly, this language indicates that Congress intended the Community to be eligible for special programs and services by virtue of their status as Indians, and Congress made clear that it intended the Community would contract for, and receive grants pursuant to, the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%205321\">\n    25 U.S.C. \u00a7 5321\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(E) (providing that upon request, the Secretary shall enter into self-determination contracts that include programs \"for the benefit of Indians because of their status as Indians[.]\").

Further, Congress underscored that the 1994 amendments were not intended to federally recognize the Community by specifying that \"[n]othing in this section may be construed to constitute the recognition by the United States that the [Community] is a federally recognized Indian tribe.\" Pub.

To support this argument, the Community invokes the rule that a statute should be construed so that no clause, sentence, or word is rendered superfluous, and argues that there would have been no need to expressly prohibit it from engaging in class III gaming if lack of federal recognition rendered it ineligible to participate in all IGRA gaming. Interior responds that Congress would not choose such an indirect route to convey an easily expressed message, and that there is no indication that this class III provision means anything other than what it says-that notwithstanding any other provision of law, i.e., notwithstanding federal recognition at some future time, the Community is prohibited from engaging in class III gaming.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Like the district court, we read the amended Act's prohibition of class III gaming as an express limitation on the Community's class III gaming rights if it is ever federally recognized. The words Congress used make this clear. Subsections (b)(1) and (b)(2) provide that \"[n]othing in this section may be construed to\" alter or affect the criminal jurisdiction of\n   Washington under Public Law 280\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   or to constitute federal recognition of the Community. Congress employed language with a much broader sweep when it drafted subsection (b)(3). That subsection states \"\n   <em>\n    [n]otwithstanding any other provision of law\n   </em>\n   \" the Community shall not engage in class III gaming. The Supreme Court recently observed that \"[t]he ordinary meaning of 'notwithstanding' is 'in spite of,' or 'without prevention or obstruction from or by.' \"\n   <em>\n    N.L.R.B. v.

Assuming, as we must, that Congress was knowledgeable about Interior's longstanding Part 83 regulations, IGRA's requirement that tribes be recognized by the Secretary, and the List Act's codification of the Secretary's annual list, it is conspicuous that Congress did not take the opportunity when it amended the Frank's Landing Act to specifically authorize the Community to engage in class II gaming.
