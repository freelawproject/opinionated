Plaintiffs sued after the agency had removed certain records posted online, explaining its action in language consistent with an intention to restore them except for redactions required by privacy interests (but without a clear commitment to such restorations).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The district court dismissed all claims on varying grounds: (1) on the merits-as to certain issues not appealed; (2) on mootness with regard to material restored by USDA to the website, and (3) as to redactions from restored materials, on the ground that plaintiffs' complaint did not address them. We reverse on the last issue without reaching the merits, and we remand for further factual clarification bearing on plaintiffs' contention that USDA's voluntary cessation of unlawful activity renders mootness inapplicable. We affirm the district court's refusal to grant discovery against the agency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiffs seek documents from the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (\"APHIS\"), the entity within USDA that administers the Animal Welfare Act (\"AWA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202131\">\n    7 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2131\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq\n   </em>\n   ., and is responsible for licensing and inspecting animal research facilities, among other things. Plaintiffs filed this suit shortly after USDA took down from its website a large swath of documents relating to AWA compliance. On February 3, 2017, USDA announced that, \"during the past year,\" APHIS had been \"conduct[ing] a comprehensive review of the information it posts\" online. See USDA, Stakeholder Announcement: Updates to APHIS' Website Involving Animal Welfare Act and Horse Protection Act Compliance Information (Feb. 3, 2017) (updated Feb. 15, 2017), https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/newsroom/stakeholder-info/sa_by_date/sa-2017/sa-02/awa-hpa-compliance. The announcement stated that USDA was taking down a host of records with the aim of \"remov[ing] certain personal information.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . In doing so, the agency was \"striving to balance the need for transparency with rules protecting individual privacy.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Though the announcement did not expressly say that the takedown was temporary or provide a timeline to repost records, the agency in this litigation describes the removal as \"provisional[ ],\" suggesting that \"remov[ing] ... personal information\" is a task temporary in nature. See USDA Br. 6; see also J.A. 43 (USDA's motion to dismiss describing the takedown as \"a temporary precaution\"). The district court agreed, calling the removal \"temporary\" and \"one-time,\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    People for Ethical Treatment of Animals, Inc. v.

That provision requires agencies to \"make available for public inspection in an electronic format\" five categories of documents. The complaint focuses on four types of records (as grouped by the district court) that the agency had removed: (1) research facility annual reports; (2) inspection reports; (3) lists of entities licensed under the AWA; and (4) regulatory correspondence and enforcement records that had not yet received final adjudication. See Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 1, 30;\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12522923\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/285/307/#p313\">\n    285 F.Supp.3d at 310-11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that they depend on these documents for,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , scholarly endeavors, see Compl. \u00b6 5, and wide-ranging advocacy work, including unearthing and correcting AWA compliance violations, Compl. \u00b6 24. The records at issue, plaintiffs allege, were \"routine[ly]\" made available \"[f]or many years,\" Compl. \u00b6 31, though admittedly with redactions in line with relevant FOIA exemptions, including for \"personal privacy,\" Compl. \u00b6 21; see\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(6). PETA alleges that under \u00a7 552(a)(2) USDA must disclose all removed records, Compl. \u00b6 34, and avers that requiring plaintiffs to file FOIA requests for these records under \u00a7 552(a)(3) would be onerous, exacerbating USDA's existing \"substantial backlog\" in processing FOIA requests. Compl. \u00b6 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   PETA asked for an order requiring that USDA \"immediately\" \"make all ... records\" described in the complaint available by electronic means. It also sought a declaration that USDA had violated FOIA by removing the documents, along with an injunction ordering the agency to \"make all such records available\" to plaintiffs on an ongoing basis. Compl. 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   For simplicity's sake, we exclude two groups of documents from further discussion: the entirety of category (4) above, and the portion of category (2) consisting of animal inventories. As to these, the district court dismissed plaintiffs' complaint under Rule 12(b)(6) on the ground that it failed to say why they were covered by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2), but expressly made its ruling without prejudice. Plaintiffs do not appeal those rulings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In granting USDA's motion to dismiss, the district court reasoned in three steps. See Table 1. First, as to categories (1)-(3) above, it concluded that \"it appears\" the agency had reposted the requested materials, apart from animal inventories in category (2).\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12522923\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/285/307/#p313\">\n    285 F.Supp.3d at 312\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court therefore dismissed PETA's claims under headings (1)-(3) as moot. It likewise rejected the possibility that the \"voluntary cessation\" doctrine negated USDA's claim of mootness.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 313. The district court cited the temporary nature of the removals along with statements made by USDA in its December 4, 2017, letter, see J.A. 235-39, responding to the district court's Minute Order of November 27, 2017. The letter outlines the agency's progress in reposting materials and states its plans as to future postings of existing and newly created records in certain categories of documents. In light of its ruling on mootness, the district court denied plaintiffs' request for discovery against the agency to probe its rationales for the takedown.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12522923\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/285/307/#p313\">\n    285 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   315 n.7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Second, the district court addressed the agency's redactions from the records taken down and then reposted. See USDA Br. 8, 11, 19; see also J.A. 236. Though plaintiffs objected to these redactions, the district court did not address their demands because,\n   on its view, the complaint did not encompass those demands.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12522923\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/285/307/#p313\">\n    285 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   313 n.3. Still, the court left the door open for PETA to \"raise challenges to the redactions that now accompany these records,\"\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   ., perhaps by amending its complaint or bringing another suit. (Plaintiffs did not amend their complaint.)\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-20\"><strong>Table 1</strong> <strong>Documents Plaintiffs Seek from USDA on Appeal</strong> <strong>Category 1</strong> <strong>Category 2</strong> <strong>Category 3</strong> Research Inspection Lists of entities facility reports licensed under annual (with animal AWA reports inventories) <strong>Reposted</strong> <strong>Yes</strong> <strong>Yes</strong> <strong>Yes</strong> <strong>during</strong> (but not animal (monthly list of <strong>litigation</strong> inventories; new active licensees, redactions in registrants; no some documents) real-time list) <strong>Agency's</strong> \"reposted \"now posting all\" \"posting the <strong>intent in</strong> all\" records reports for recent monthly list of <strong>Dec. 4,</strong> &amp; \"intends to 3-year period, active (current) <strong>2017,</strong> continue J.A. 236 licensees,\" J.A. <strong>letter, J.A.</strong> posting,\" 237 <strong>235-39</strong> J.A. 236 <strong>District</strong> <strong>Moot</strong> <strong>Moot</strong> <strong>Moot</strong> <strong>court</strong> as to all but <strong>disposition</strong> redactions <strong>Failure to plead</strong> as to new redactions</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Third, the court dealt with the items that for simplicity's sake we are not addressing here, as we explained above. As to them, plaintiffs have now filed a new lawsuit, which is not before us, pressing these and other claims, including their objections to USDA's latest redactions. See\n   <em>\n    People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, Inc., et al. v. Sonny Perdue, et al.\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    PETA II\n   </em>\n   ), No. 18-cv-887-CRC (D.D.C. filed Apr. 16, 2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   This appeal, then, centers on reposted records-both with and without new redactions. We consider each in turn and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   We first address reposted records diminished by new redactions. The district court declined to consider PETA's objections on this score because those objections were not \"part of the complaint as\n   filed,\" which focused, in the district court's view, on the \"wholesale removal of the records.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12522923\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/285/307/#p313\">\n    285 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   313 n.3. PETA contends that the district court erred. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   To begin with, since the new redactions post-date the filing of the complaint, plaintiffs could have known of them at the outset of litigation only in the most general way, as a possibility of unknown scope. Cf. PETA Br. 39. More important, we think the complaint can't be reasonably read as demanding only that the agency be required to restore mutilated versions of documents previously published without redactions-at least without the redactions in question. It states that \"records that for many years were easily accessible ... are now no longer readily available to Plaintiffs,\" Compl. \u00b6 31, and requests relief \"immediately\" making \"\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   such records that have been removed available to Plaintiffs,\" Compl. 15 (emphasis added). The complaint, tellingly, is also not limited to talk of\n   <em>\n    records\n   </em>\n   . It repeatedly speaks of\n   <em>\n    information\n   </em>\n   . And, as we have long said, FOIA's \"focus ... is information, not documents.\"\n   <em>\n    Kimberlin v. Dep't of Justice\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11846785,3712837\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/139/944/\">\n    139 F.3d 944\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 950 (D.C.

Cir. 1977) ). PETA alleges that \"[d]efendants' decision to remove from APHIS's website the\n   <em>\n    information\n   </em>\n   that is required to be affirmatively disclosed ... violates FOIA,\" Compl. \u00b6 36 (emphasis added), and its \"actions in removing such\n   <em>\n    information\n   </em>\n   ... injure Plaintiffs by denying them immediate electronic access to such records,\" Compl. \u00b6 37 (emphasis added). We read the complaint as demanding an order requiring USDA to repost documents in their\n   <em>\n    original\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    pre-takedown form\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   We thus remand to the district court to take up plaintiffs' objections to new redactions from the reposted records on the merits (including examining whether plaintiffs have satisfied FOIA's exhaustion requirements,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(6), and substantive provisions).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   We now turn to PETA's argument that USDA's reposting of records did not moot the case even as to materials\n   <em>\n    without\n   </em>\n   new redactions. Why so? PETA argues that USDA's actions and statements, taken as a whole, do not meet the high bar set by the \"voluntary cessation\" doctrine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   We review the district court's dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction on mootness grounds de novo, see, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Del Monte Fresh Produce Co. v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3664274,3542437\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/570/316/\">\n    570 F.3d 316\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 321 (D.C. Cir. 2009) ; the parties agree on that standard of review, see PETA Br. 26-27, USDA Br. 12. Though a motion to dismiss is ordinarily handled on the pleadings, a defendant's claim of voluntary cessation requires an evaluation of probabilities as to future conduct that can, as here, involve detailed inquiry beyond the pleadings that is \"a matter for the trial judge.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Concentrated Phosphate Exp. Ass'n\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11312236\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/393/199/#p204\">\n    393 U.S. 199\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 204,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11312236\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/393/199/#p204\">\n    89 S.Ct. 361\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11312236\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/393/199/#p204\">\n    21 L.Ed.2d 344\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1968). A related inquiry takes place, of course, whenever a plaintiff supplements the pleadings with affidavits to establish a court's jurisdiction. See\n   <em>\n    Haase v.

Though the inquiry into voluntary cessation might be thought to invite a degree of deference to a district court's fact-finding role, our precedent appears not to recognize it.

In any event, even with a more deferential posture, we would remand for further proceedings in this case for the reasons we explain below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Typically, an end to offending behavior moots a case.

Not only is this objective unproblematic in itself, but new administrations are entitled to reevaluate and modify agency practices, even longstanding ones. Cf.\n   <em>\n    Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass'n of U.S., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins.

(\"[F]rom the beginning, the Department has indicated-and both parties have recognized-that the removal was a temporary measure\"). USDA has lived up to this view by beginning to repost numerous records quite promptly. See\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 311.\n   <em>\n    Third\n   </em>\n   , USDA did not shift its rationale after PETA filed suit or engage in \"transitory litigation postur[ing],\"\n   <em>\n    America Cargo Transp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3801752\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/625/1176/#p1180\">\n    625 F.3d at 1180\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , or in the equivalent of what the Court has called \"postcertiorari maneuvers,\"\n   <em>\n    Knox v.

USDA explains that it \"is now posting all inspection reports for the most recent three-year period,\"\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   ., and says that \"APHIS posts new inspection reports on a rolling basis,\" \"limited to the most recent three-year period,\" J.A. 236-37. USDA's treatment of entity lists is similarly confined to a description of currently ongoing practice. It explains that it \"is posting the monthly list of active (current) licensees and registrants that are regulated under the AWA on the agency's website,\" but doesn't broach future plans.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 237.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Given the forward-looking character of the inquiry into a defendant's intent, these fall short of the necessary precision. That is especially so given the agency's view\n   that its ongoing postings are discretionary. See USDA Br. 6, 12, 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Put differently, the December 4, 2017 letter's treatment of inspection reports and entity lists falls short of the kinds of statements that courts have credited in the very cases the agency cites. See USDA Br. 18. In one instance, government counsel committed an agency to a \"new\n   <em>\n    permanent\n   </em>\n   policy\" that \"agreed with\" plaintiff's position.\n   <em>\n    America Cargo Transp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3801752\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/625/1176/#p1180\">\n    625 F.3d at 1180\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added in first quotation). In another context, a court found governmental \"self-correction\" that \"appears genuine,\"\n   <em>\n    Ragsdale\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11306296\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/841/1358/#p1365\">\n    841 F.2d at 1365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , based on a \"public policy of non-enforcement\" of a requirement that was \"barred by clear Supreme Court precedent,\"\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 1365-66, and had \"no real prospect\" of repetition,\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 1366. In a third, a court laid stress on \"formally announced changes to official governmental policy.\"\n   <em>\n    Sossamon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3432890\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/560/316/#p325\">\n    560 F.3d at 325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And in a fourth, the government gave exactly the \"relief plaintiffs requested.\"\n   <em>\n    CISPES\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10544187,3490834,10544219,3491633\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/929/742/\">\n    929 F.2d at 742\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Neither USDA's letter, nor the representations in its briefing or at oral argument, exhibits this level of clarity about inspection reports and entity lists.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   We thus remand for clarification with respect to USDA's future plans to post inspection reports (apart from animal inventories) and lists of AWA regulated entities-and would have done so even had we accorded deference to factual findings of the district court. If the agency makes clear that it commits to timely posting on an ongoing basis, such a declaration will moot PETA's non-redaction claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In light of USDA's seemingly unproblematic rationale for removing the records; the one-time nature of the takedown; the absence of any signs of bad faith in litigation; and a presumption of regularity when government officials express a clear intention to do as the complaint requests, we conclude that a declaration by (or on behalf of) USDA officials that the agency intends to post documents in the inspection reports and entity lists categories on an ongoing basis will moot PETA's claims. This is so, we emphasize, even though USDA continues to assert that posting the records is a matter of discretion, rather than a FOIA-imposed duty (as plaintiffs would have it). Given our holding, we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying plaintiffs' request for discovery against the agency aimed at showing that the \"voluntary cessation\" doctrine isn't met. See\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12522923\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/285/307/#p313\">\n    285 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   315 n.7 ;\n   <em>\n    Citizens for Responsibility &amp; Ethics in Washington v.

Cir. 2009).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   To sum up, as to reposted records featuring new redactions, the complaint is most plausibly read as requesting that USDA repost\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   information that those records contained before their takedown. The district court should thus proceed to the merits on remand. As to \"voluntary cessation,\" we affirm the mootness dismissal as to the research reports but remand for further elucidation as to the inspection reports and the entity lists. If the agency unambiguously commits to continued posting of those documents, plaintiffs' claims should be dismissed as moot, without discovery, even if USDA continues to regard its postings as voluntary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <em>\n    So ordered\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
