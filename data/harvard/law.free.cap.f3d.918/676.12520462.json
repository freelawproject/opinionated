Similar to other popular tourist destinations, Santa Monica is struggling to manage the disruptions brought about by the rise of short-term rentals facilitated by innovative startups such as Appellants HomeAway.com, Inc. and Airbnb Inc. (the \"Platforms\"). Websites like those operated by the Platforms are essentially online marketplaces that allow \"guests\" seeking accommodations and \"hosts\" offering accommodations to connect and enter into rental agreements with one another.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   As of February 2018, Airbnb had approximately 1,400 listings in Santa Monica, of which about 30 percent are in the \"coastal zone\" covered by the California Coastal Act, while HomeAway.com had approximately 300 live listings in Santa Monica, of which approximately 40 percent are in the coastal zone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Santa Monica's council reported that the proliferation of short-term rentals had negatively impacted the quality and character of its neighborhoods by \"bringing commercial activity and removing residential housing stock from the market\" at a time when California is already suffering from severe housing shortages. In response, the city passed an ordinance regulating the short-term vacation rental market by authorizing licensed \"home-sharing\" (rentals where residents remain on-site with guests) but prohibiting all other short-term home rentals of 30 consecutive days or less.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Platforms filed suit, alleging that the city ordinance is preempted by the Communications Decency Act and impermissibly infringes upon their First Amendment rights. The district court denied preliminary injunctive relief, and dismissed\n   the Platforms' complaints for failure to state a claim under the Communications Decency Act and the First Amendment. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In May 2015, Santa Monica passed its initial ordinance regulating the short-term vacation rental market by authorizing licensed \"home-sharing\" (rentals where residents remain on-site with guests) but prohibiting all other forms of short-term rentals for 30 consecutive days or less. Santa Monica Ordinance 2484 (May 12, 2015),\n   <em>\n    codified as amended\n   </em>\n   , Santa Monica Mun. Code \u00a7\u00a7 6.20.010-6.20.100. The ordinance reflected the city's housing goals of \"preserving its housing stock and preserving the quality and character of its existing single and multi-family residential neighborhoods.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   As originally enacted, the ordinance prohibited hosting platforms from acting to \"undertake, maintain, authorize, aid, facilitate or advertise any Home-Sharing activity\" that was not authorized by the city. Hosting platforms also were required to collect and remit taxes, and to regularly disclose listings and booking information to the city.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Platforms each filed a complaint in the Central District of California challenging the initial ordinance, and the district court consolidated the cases for discovery and pretrial matters. On September 21, 2016, the parties stipulated to stay the case while the city considered amendments to the local ordinance. During the stay period, the district court for the Northern District of California denied a preliminary injunction requested by the plaintiffs in a separate case challenging a similar ordinance in San Francisco.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Airbnb Inc. v. City &amp; County of San Francisco\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12271835\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/217/1066/\">\n    217 F.Supp.3d 1066\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (N.D. Cal. 2016). That case ended in a settlement in which the Platforms agreed to comply with an amended version of San Francisco's ordinance that prohibited booking unlawful transactions but provided a safe harbor wherein any platform that complies with the responsibilities set out in the Ordinance will be presumed to be in compliance with the law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In January 2017, Santa Monica likewise amended its own ordinance. The version challenged here, Ordinance 2535 (the \"Ordinance\"), retains its prohibitions on most types of short-term rentals, with the exception of licensed home-shares. In addition, the Ordinance imposes four obligations on hosting platforms directly: (1) collecting and remitting \"Transient Occupancy Taxes,\" (2) disclosing certain listing and booking information regularly, (3) refraining from completing any booking transaction for properties not licensed and listed on the City's registry, and (4) refraining from collecting or receiving a fee for \"facilitating or providing services ancillary to a vacation rental or unregistered home-share.\" If a housing platform operates in compliance with these obligations, the Ordinance provides a safe harbor by presuming the platform to be in compliance with the law. Otherwise, violations are punishable by a fine of up to $ 500 and/or imprisonment for up to six months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   After the district court lifted the stay, the Platforms amended their complaint to challenge the revised ordinance and moved for a preliminary injunction. Santa Monica moved to dismiss the amended complaint. The court denied the Platforms' motion for preliminary injunctive relief and subsequently granted Santa Monica's motion to dismiss on the ground that the Platforms failed to state a claim under federal law, including the Communications Decency Act of 1996 and the First Amendment. The district court also declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over their remaining\n   state-law claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Platforms timely appealed these decisions, and we consolidated the appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    JURISDICTION AND STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   We have jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201291\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Construing this immunity broadly, the Platforms argue that the Ordinance requires them to monitor and remove third-party content, and therefore violates the CDA by interfering with federal policy protecting internet companies from liability for posting third-party content. Santa Monica, on the other hand, argues that the Ordinance does not implicate the CDA because it imposes no obligation on the Platforms to monitor or edit any listings provided by hosts. Santa Monica contends that the Ordinance is simply an exercise of its right to enact regulations to preserve housing by curtailing \"incentives for landlords to evade rent control laws, evict tenants, and convert residential units into\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   hotels.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   We begin our analysis with the text of the CDA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    BP America Prod.

Section 230(c)(1) states that \"[n]o provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553607\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/84/#p91\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 230(c)(1). The CDA explicitly preempts inconsistent state laws: \"Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent any State from enforcing any State law that is consistent with this section. No cause of action may be brought and no liability may be imposed under any State or local law that is inconsistent with this section.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553607\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/84/#p91\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 230(e)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   We have construed these provisions to extend immunity to \"(1) a provider or user of an interactive computer service (2) whom a plaintiff seeks to treat, under a state law cause of action, as a publisher or speaker (3) of information provided by another information content provider.\"\n   <em>\n    Barnes v.

Only the second element is at issue here: whether the Ordinance treats the Platforms as a \"publisher or speaker\" in a manner that is barred by the CDA. Although the CDA does not define \"publisher,\" we have defined \"publication\" in this context to \"involve[ ] reviewing, editing, and deciding whether to publish or to withdraw from publication third-party content.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3663159\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/570/1096/#p1100\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 1102 (citing\n   <em>\n    Fair Hous.

First, the Platforms claim that the Ordinance is expressly preempted by the CDA because, as they argue, it implicitly requires them \"to monitor the content of a third-party listing and compare it against the City's short-term rental registry before allowing any booking to proceed.\" Relying on\n   <em>\n    Doe v. Internet Brands\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4323565\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/824/846/#p851\">\n    824 F.3d 846\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 851 (9th Cir. 2016), the Platforms take the view that CDA immunity follows whenever a legal duty \"affects\" how an internet company \"monitors\" a website.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   However, the Platforms read\n   <em>\n    Internet Brands\n   </em>\n   too broadly. In that case, two individuals used the defendant's website to message and lure the plaintiff to sham auditions where she was drugged and raped.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4323565\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/824/846/#p851\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4323565\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/824/846/#p851\">\n    at 848\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We held that, where the website provider was alleged to have known independently of the ongoing scheme beforehand, the CDA did not bar an action under state law for failure to warn.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4323565\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/824/846/#p851\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4323565\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/824/846/#p851\">\n    at 854\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Though the defendant did, in its business, act as a publisher of third-party content, the underlying legal duty at issue did not seek to hold the defendant liable as a \"publisher or speaker\" of third-party content.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4323565\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/824/846/#p851\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 853 ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20230\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 230\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1).

The Ordinance prohibits processing transactions for unregistered properties. It does not require the Platforms to review the content provided by the hosts of listings on their websites. Rather, the only monitoring that appears necessary in order to comply with the Ordinance relates to incoming requests to complete a booking transaction-content that, while\n   <em>\n    resulting from\n   </em>\n   the third-party listings, is distinct, internal, and nonpublic. As in\n   <em>\n    Internet Brands\n   </em>\n   , it is not enough that the third-party listings are a \"but-for\" cause of such internal monitoring.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4323565\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/824/846/#p851\">\n    824 F.3d at 853\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Contrary to the Platforms' claim, the Ordinance does not \"require\" that they monitor or screen advertisements. It instead leaves them to decide how best to comply with the prohibition on booking unlawful transactions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Nor can the Platforms rely on the Ordinance's \"stated purpose\" to argue that it intends to regulate speech. The Ordinance itself makes clear that the City's \"central and significant goal ... is preservation of its housing stock and preserving the quality and nature of residential neighborhoods.\" As such, with respect to the Platforms, the only inevitable effect, and the stated purpose, of the Ordinance is to prohibit\n   them from completing booking transactions for unlawful rentals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   As for the second prong of our inquiry, whether the Ordinance has the effect of \"singling out those engaged in expressive activity,\"\n   <em>\n    Arcara\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6211828\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/478/697/#p706\">\n    478 U.S. at 706-07\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6211828\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/478/697/#p706\">\n    106 S.Ct. 3172\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , we conclude that it does not. As the Platforms point out, websites like Craigslist \"advertise the very same properties,\" but do not process transactions. Unlike the Platforms, those websites would not be subject to the Ordinance, underscoring that the Ordinance does not target websites that post listings, but rather companies that engage in unlawful booking transactions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Moreover, the incidental impacts on speech cited by the Platforms raise minimal concerns. The Platforms argue that the Ordinance chills commercial speech, namely, advertisements for third-party rentals.

However, the Supreme Court has drawn a bright line in certain contexts, such as holding that the First Amendment requires statutes imposing criminal liability for obscenity or child pornography to contain a scienter requirement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    New York v.
