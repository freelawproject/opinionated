However, that does not end the inquiry in this case because the district court properly focused on specific language in the 2007 and 2010 CBAs. The court concluded that Article 24, Section 7, of the 2007 CBA was \"sufficiently specific in duration\" to overcome the CBA's general durational clause because it limited Honeywell's \"retiree health care contributions\" beginning in calendar year 2011, after the three-year contract expired in 2010. Likewise, the court concluded that the Special Retirement Program in Section 7 of the 2010 CBA \"constituted an express promise of specific duration\" because it provided that employees who retired \"between August 1, 2010 and February 1, 2013\" were eligible for retiree medical coverage, and January 31, 2013 was \"technically,\n   the last day of the term of the agreement.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   We cannot agree that these specific provisions are a sufficient basis to disregard the Supreme Court's analysis of durational clauses in\n   <em>\n    Tackett\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Reese\n   </em>\n   .

Honeywell Int'l Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264270\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/875/321/#p326\">\n    875 F.3d 321\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 326 (6th Cir. 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Second, we disagree with the district court's conclusion that Section 7 unambiguously reflected an intent to confer vested retiree healthcare benefits. The provisions noted by the district court must also be read in the context of the CBAs' general durational clauses, which provided (i) that each CBA \"shall remain in full force and effect from year to year\"\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   its initial expiration date unless one party gives notice of its intent to terminate or modify the CBA, and (ii) that \"issues including fringe benefits shall not be subject for collective bargaining\" during the term of the CBA. Reading these contractual provisions as a whole, putting a limit on Honeywell's retiree benefit contributions beginning in 2011 did not reflect an intent to provide vested benefits after the 2007 CBA expired. Rather, it put in place a collectively bargained limit that would apply after the initial three-year term until the CBA expired because one party gave timely notice of intent to modify. Even then, the limit would continue in the modified CBA if the notice to modify did not include that provision, as happened in the 2010 CBA. Likewise, the provision in the Special Retirement Program in Section 7 of the 2010 CBA making employees who retired \"between August 1, 2010 and February 1, 2013\" eligible for retiree healthcare benefits did not reflect an intent to provide vested benefits beyond the term of the CBA. It simply specified the benefits that would continue to be paid if the CBA remained in effect after January 31, 2013, the end of its three-year term, because neither party gave notice of intent to modify.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In addition to the general and specific durational clauses, properly construed under\n   <em>\n    Tackett\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Reese\n   </em>\n   , there are other provisions in the 2007 and 2010 CBAs that confirm an unambiguous intent not to confer vested retiree healthcare benefits. First, the SPDs that accompanied the CBAs reserved for Honeywell \"the right to terminate the Plan, or any portion of the Plan, at any time and for any reason except as limited by the provisions of any applicable Federal or State law or the provisions of a written [CBA].\" \"We have repeatedly held that an unambiguous reservation-of-rights provision is sufficient without more to defeat a claim that retirement welfare plan benefits are vested.\"\n   <em>\n    Maytag\n   </em>\n   , 687 F.3d at 1085 (citations omitted). Consistent with ERISA, the CBAs referred both employees and retirees to the SPDs for details regarding the Healthcare Plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Second, both the 2007 and 2010 CBAs explicitly extended healthcare benefits for past retirees. As the Sixth Circuit explained in\n   <em>\n    Cooper\n   </em>\n   , \"if a promise that retirees will continue to be covered until age 65 vested those benefits -- notwithstanding a\n   CBA's intervening expiration -- then why would each successive CBA need to repeat the same promise? .... The only reasonable inference, of course, is that the parties did not believe this language created a vested right to lifetime healthcare benefits and thus had to include it in each new CBA.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516208\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/884/612/#p614\">\n    884 F.3d at 620\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Morrell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1848700\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/37/1302/#p1307\">\n    37 F.3d at 1307\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (providing \"continued health benefits for past retirees is evidence that prior benefits were not vested\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Third, Article 24 of the 2007 CBA explicitly made early retiree healthcare benefits a mandatory subject of collective bargaining, suggesting that these benefits were subject to negotiation, not inalterably fixed.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tackett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12594426\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/926/#p933\">\n    135 S.Ct. at 936\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thereafter, Honeywell and the union negotiated modifications to those benefits in the 2010 and 2013 CBAs, with no objection that such changes violated vested rights. \"[T]he fact that modifications were routinely negotiated is fundamentally inconsistent with the notion that\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   retirement health benefits were\n   <em>\n    ever\n   </em>\n   vested.\"\n   <em>\n    Morrell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1848700\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/37/1302/#p1307\">\n    37 F.3d at 1307\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Finally, the lack of explicit vesting language in the CBAs and their accompanying SPDs is even stronger evidence of the parties' intent not to provide vested healthcare benefits when viewed together with specific references in the pension plan SPDs to \"vested pension benefits\" and \"vested terminated employees.\"\n   <em>\n    Morrell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1848700\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/37/1302/#p1307\">\n    37 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1307 ;\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cooper\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516208\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/884/612/#p614\">\n    884 F.3d at 620-21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As the Supreme Court noted in\n   <em>\n    Reese\n   </em>\n   , \"[i]f the parties meant to vest health care benefits for life [or until age 65], they easily could have said so.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12616855\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/761/\">\n    138 S.Ct. at 766\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   For these reasons, we conclude that the 2007 and 2010 CBAs unambiguously reflected the parties' intent to adopt non-vested \"Retiree Health Care (Pre 65 only)\" healthcare benefits. In these circumstances, though Plaintiffs submitted declarations and other evidence that Honeywell and its staff made representations that early-retiring employees would be \"guaranteed healthcare until 65\" if they retired before February 2013, \"extrinsic evidence\n   <em>\n    may not be considered\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Maytag\n   </em>\n   , 687 F.3d at 1086 (emphasis in original). Thus, Plaintiffs have no likelihood of success on their claims that Honeywell's termination of early retiree healthcare benefits breached either the CBAs or the ERISA plans, and the grant of a preliminary injunction must be reversed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The Orders of the district court dated December 29, 2017, and January 31, 2018 are reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    \"A 'vested right' is a right that so completely and definitely belongs to a person that it cannot be impaired or taken away without the person's consent.\"\n    <em>\n     Maytag Corp. v.
