Suffice it to say, in 2010, Yueh-Lan Wang, the widow of Taiwanese plastics magnate and billionaire Yung-Ching (\"Y.C.\") Wang, sued three D.C.-based entities (hereinafter \"the Trusts\") created before her husband's death, alleging that the transfer of a large portion of her husband's assets to the Trusts unlawfully denied her the full marital estate to which she was entitled. Suing initially through Dr. Wong to whom she had granted her power of attorney and upon her death in 2012 through the executors of her estate, the widow raised claims under District of Columbia and Taiwanese law. After seven years of litigation on whether diversity jurisdiction exists, as well as litigation in Taiwan to appoint executors for her estate, the Trusts moved to dismiss the complaint on\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   grounds. The district court granted the motion, subject to conditions that the Trusts consent to process and jurisdiction in Taiwan and also waive statute of limitations defenses, their necessary or indispensable parties argument, and challenges to the power of attorney used to file suit.\n   <em>\n    Hsu v.

All the while, the Trusts also challenged the validity of the widow's power of attorney under Taiwan law and sought dismissal for failure to state a claim on the same Taiwanese law issues that they now claim are too foreign and difficult for a U.S. court to handle.

The widow's claims focus on whether Y.C. owned the assets that were transferred to the Trusts and whether Y.C. formed the Trusts to reduce the widow's share of the Marital Estate.

Whether another \"wife\" has claims to any assets that may be added to the Marital Estate as a result of the widow's lawsuit may be an issue in this litigation down the line, but the widow's claims do not center chiefly on Taiwanese-language documents.

The Trusts can hardly complain now that they are burdened by being sued in their home jurisdiction when Y.C. Wang specifically bestowed upon the District of Columbia an interest in this case by establishing the Trusts here.

Although Taiwan and its citizens may have an interest in the division of the estate of one of their wealthiest citizens, Y.C. allegedly transferred significant assets into the United States in order to hide them and avoid legal responsibilities, Second Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 37-45. In this circumstance, Taiwan's interest does not clearly outweigh the District of Columbia's interest in this dispute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    DiRienzo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9408102\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/294/21/#p32\">\n    294 F.3d at 31-32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The district court concluded that a jury composed of residents of the District of Columbia should not be burdened with this case.\n   <em>\n    Hsu\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523185\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/288/272/\">\n    288 F.Supp.3d at 293\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . There are obviously significant contacts with the District of Columbia given the Trusts' operations here. \"Any economic burden to the forum is justified because the defendant has undertaken both the benefits and burdens of citizenship and of the forum's laws.\"\n   <em>\n    Reid-Walen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10545471\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/933/1390/#p1395\">\n    933 F.2d at 1400\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This impact on a jury of D.C. residents would not justify dismissing a case against D.C.-based entities on\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   grounds.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10545471\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/933/1390/#p1395\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The district court further concluded this litigation would require it to apply Taiwanese family and inheritance law, which \"weighs strongly in favor of dismissal.\"\n   <em>\n    Hsu\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523185\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/288/272/\">\n    288 F.Supp.3d at 292\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But the need to apply foreign law alone is \"not sufficient to warrant dismissal when a balancing of all relevant factors shows that the plaintiff's chosen forum is appropriate.\"\n   <em>\n    Piper\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6185480\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/454/235/#p257\">\n    454 U.S. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   260 n.29,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6185480\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/454/235/#p257\">\n    102 S.Ct. 252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The widow alleges claims under District of Columbia and Taiwanese law, and U.S. courts regularly apply foreign law when conflict of laws principles demand it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Manu Int'l,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1366045\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/641/62/#p67\">\n    641 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   67-68 ;\n   <em>\n    Mobil Tankers Co. v.

The ultimate importance of interpreting Taiwanese law regarding division of the Marital Estate among multiple putative \"wives\" is unclear because the widow's lawsuit centers on the\n   <em>\n    size\n   </em>\n   of the estate to be divided, not how it is to be divided. As discussed, the district court therefore placed undue emphasis on whether Pao Chu Lee was legally a wife of Y.C. Wang, a question that is at most only of secondary importance to the widow's case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The district court clearly erred in overemphasizing the public interest factors, particularly the need to answer difficult questions of Taiwanese law that may have no or minimal bearing on the widow's suit. And in view of Y.C. Wang's decision to establish the Trusts in the District of Columbia and take advantage of both the benefits and burdens under District of Columbia law, even a complex trial in the widow's chosen forum and the Trusts' home jurisdiction does not impose unjustified burdens or administrative difficulties on the district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Accordingly, we must reverse and remand the case to the district court for further proceedings. The district court's errors, considered together, constitute a clear abuse of discretion. The district court failed to give appropriate weight to the widow's legitimate choice of forum and erred in concluding that the private interest factors weighed slightly in favor of dismissal and in overemphasizing the public interest factors in deciding to dismiss this case on\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   grounds. The doctrine of\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   is to be applied only in rare cases, and only where the defendant meets a heavy burden of showing that suit in the United States is so inconvenient as to be harassing, vexing, or oppressive. No such showing has been made here.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Convention of 18 March 1970 on the Taking of Evidence Abroad in Civil or Commercial Matters, List of Contracting Parties, https://www.hcch.net/en/instruments/conventions/status-table/?cid=82 (last visited Feb. 19, 2019).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
