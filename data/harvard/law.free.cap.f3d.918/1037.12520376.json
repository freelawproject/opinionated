The motel is owned by Palmdale Lodging, LLC, a privately owned company formed by Bill and Mona. The City of Palmdale (\"City\") licensed Palmdale Lodging to operate the motel. After purchasing the motel in June 2016, Bill, Mona, and Palmdale Lodging spent approximately $250,000 to upgrade and to renovate the motel, and contracted with Motel 6 to operate the motel as a franchise. They also evicted those whom they considered to be \"problem tenants who had prior to their ownership and possession caused crime problems at the motel.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On November 17, 2016, the City obtained a civil inspection warrant to investigate suspected violations of the Palmdale Municipal Code, the California Building Standards Code, the California Health and Safety Code, and other laws. The warrant was executed on November 21, 2016. Bill and Mona allege that the inspection warrant was executed without notice and included a search of their personal residence, located within the motel, without their permission. They further claim that sheriffs from the County of Los Angeles (\"County\") held Bill and their two children at gunpoint for an hour and a half during the inspection of their personal residence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On December 13, 2016, the City issued a Notice and Order to Repair or Abate (\"Notice and Order\"), which identified more than 400 code violations on the motel property. The Notice and Order required the violations to be repaired or abated within thirty days, and ordered the Herrera family and all motel tenants to vacate the property within two days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On December 15, 2016, the City and County closed the motel and evicted the Herrera family and all motel tenants. Bill and Mona contend that they were not afforded an opportunity to appeal the Notice and Order. Bill and Mona further contend that the City and County prevented them from doing \"any work to upgrade or repair the motel for the alleged code violations\" despite their requests to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On December 21, 2016, Bill and Mona, individually and on behalf of their minor daughter, their son William Ryan Herrera, and Palmdale Lodging (collectively, the \"Herreras\") filed this federal civil rights action in the Central District of California against the City, County, and individual defendants, alleging violations under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and the Fair Housing Act (\"FHA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203601\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , et. seq. (\"the federal action\"). A First Amended Complaint alleged numerous federal constitutional violations by the City, County, and City and County officials, and a disparate impact claim under the FHA. The Herreras requested declaratory and injunctive relief, monetary damages, and attorney's fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Almost simultaneously, the City filed a Nuisance Complaint in Los Angeles County Superior Court against Bill Herrera and Palmdale Lodging (\"the state action\"). The City sought, among other things, a declaration that the motel is a public nuisance, the appointment of a receiver to take possession and control of the property, and injunctive relief prohibiting the state-action defendants \"from maintaining or allowing\n   any public nuisances\" and \"requiring [them] to abate all violations of law\" on the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In the federal action, the City filed a motion for abstention, or, in the alternative, a motion to dismiss. The County filed a nearly identical motion the next day. The Herreras opposed both motions. On May 16, 2017, the district court granted both motions, concluding that abstention was appropriate under\n   <em>\n    Younger v. Harris\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11711728\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/401/37/\">\n    401 U.S. 37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11711728\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/401/37/\">\n    91 S.Ct. 746\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11711728\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/401/37/\">\n    27 L.Ed.2d 669\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1971). The district court therefore dismissed the claims for declaratory and injunctive relief in the federal action, and stayed the claims for damages pending resolution of proceedings in the state action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Herreras timely appeal, challenging the district court's order granting the motions for abstention.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   As a threshold matter, the City argues that our court lacks jurisdiction over the appeal from the district court order granting the motions for abstention because the district court has not entered final judgment. Specifically, the City argues that we are without jurisdiction over the appeal because the district court has merely stayed, rather than dismissed, the Herreras' damages claims, and thus it retains jurisdiction over such claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201291\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the Court of Appeals has jurisdiction over appeals from \"final decisions of the district courts of the United States.\" Generally, \"[a] district court order abstaining under\n   <em>\n    Younger\n   </em>\n   and dismissing the case ends the litigation.

Indeed, when a court abstains under\n   <em>\n    Younger\n   </em>\n   , claims for injunctive and declaratory relief are typically dismissed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gilbertson v.

However, our court has also recognized that, when a district court abstains from considering a\n   <em>\n    damages\n   </em>\n   claim under\n   <em>\n    Younger\n   </em>\n   , it must\n   <em>\n    stay\n   </em>\n   -rather than dismiss-the damages action until state proceedings conclude.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9201278\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/381/965/#p975\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9201278\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/381/965/#p975\">\n    at 984\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[W]hen damages are at issue rather than discretionary relief, deference-rather than dismissal-is the proper restraint.

The City, a state actor, obtained and executed an inspection warrant, and identified more than four hundred violations of State and local laws on the motel property. Such investigation by the City is characteristic of the state actions that warrant\n   <em>\n    Younger\n   </em>\n   abstention under\n   <em>\n    Sprint\n   </em>\n   . The City then issued a Notice and Order to Repair or Abate the violations, and, as described in\n   <em>\n    Sprint\n   </em>\n   , \"initiate[d]\" an action for nuisance abatement and receivership, alleging that the motel property \"contains numerous violations of State and local laws and poses a severe life and health and safety hazard to any occupants, nearby residents, and the public.\" The state nuisance complaint requested, among other forms of relief: the appointment of a receiver to take possession and control of the property, an injunction preventing Bill Herrera and Palmdale Lodging from collecting rent or income from the property and from claiming any state tax deduction on the property, and imposition of civil penalties against Bill Herrera and Palmdale Lodging. In keeping with the objective of the enforcement actions described in\n   <em>\n    Sprint\n   </em>\n   , such relief would \"sanction\" the Herreras for their alleged failure to comply with state and local laws. The investigation, initiation, and requested sanctions of the proceeding here are therefore consistent with the enforcement actions described in\n   <em>\n    Sprint\n   </em>\n   and at issue in\n   <em>\n    Huffman\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   We are satisfied that the state nuisance enforcement action brought by the City against Bill Herrera and Palmdale Lodging is a civil enforcement proceeding within the scope of the\n   <em>\n    Younger\n   </em>\n   doctrine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The Herreras next argue that, even if the state action falls within one of the\n   <em>\n    NOPSI\n   </em>\n   categories,\n   <em>\n    Younger\n   </em>\n   abstention is nonetheless inappropriate because two of the three\n   <em>\n    Middlesex\n   </em>\n   factors are not met.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   1\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Initially, the Herreras argue that the state proceeding does not implicate important state interests. The City disputes such argument, claiming that it has an important interest in eliminating public nuisances and enforcing local and state codes to protect the public from dangerous conditions. The state action sought to enforce health and safety provisions, and to abate public nuisances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   We have previously held that such nuisance actions implicate important state interests and thus satisfy this second\n   <em>\n    Middlesex\n   </em>\n   factor.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Woodfeathers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11668498\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/180/1017/#p1021\">\n    180 F.3d at 1021\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that a state action enforcing ordinances declaring waste to be a nuisance implicated important state interests);\n   <em>\n    Potrero Hills Landfill, Inc. v.

The state proceeding is a civil action in Los Angeles County Superior Court over which the state court has general jurisdiction. According to the California Code of Civil Procedure, in such a proceeding, \"[a] party against whom a cause of action has been asserted in a complaint or cross-complaint may file a cross-complaint setting forth ... [a]ny cause of action he has against any of the parties who filed the complaint or cross-complaint against him.\" Cal. Code Civ. Pro. \u00a7 428.10.

In fact, Mona-though not a named defendant in the state action-is a co-founder of state-defendant Palmdale Lodging. And the children, with their parents, reside at the motel which is the subject of the state action. Furthermore, the federal claims arise from a single proceeding to abate code violations at Palmdale Lodging's motel and the corresponding investigation. Such relationship goes beyond identity of interests; rather, the family members were allegedly deprived of their civil rights collectively during the investigation, and the ongoing nuisance proceeding related to the motel which Bill and Mona operate and at which the family resides. The federal claims of Mona and her children present the same risk of interference in the state proceeding as do the federal claims of Bill and Palmdale Lodging-indeed, all the federal plaintiffs seek the same relief from the state court proceedings. As in\n   <em>\n    Hicks\n   </em>\n   , the comity considerations raised by the federal claims of those not party to the state action are indistinguishable from those raised by the state defendants. The parties' interests are therefore sufficiently intertwined.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   We are thus persuaded that the closely intertwined interests of Mona, the children, and the state defendants, Bill and Palmdale Lodging, warrant subjecting them all to the same\n   <em>\n    Younger\n   </em>\n   abstention considerations. The Herreras' second challenge to the adequacy of their opportunity to raise constitutional claims in the state action also fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   C\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Finally, the Herreras argue that the exercise of\n   <em>\n    Younger\n   </em>\n   abstention was improper because the relief sought in the federal action would not \"enjoin-or have the practical effect of enjoining-ongoing state proceedings.\"\n   <em>\n    ReadyLink\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6056083\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/754/754/#p759\">\n    754 F.3d at 758\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

For example, a holding by the district court that the Herreras are entitled to damages under \u00a7 1983 because City officials violated their Fifth Amendment rights would include a determination that the state action constituted a taking of property without just compensation. Plainly, such determination that the state proceeding is itself unconstitutional would interfere with the ongoing state enforcement action in the same way as would a declaratory judgment by the federal court.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9201278\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/381/965/#p975\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9201278\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/381/965/#p975\">\n    at 979-80\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
