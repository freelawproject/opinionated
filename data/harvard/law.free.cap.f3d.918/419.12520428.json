Ford sued the Defendants-Appellants\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (as well as other defendants not included in this appeal), all of whom were law enforcement officials at the time of Ford's wrongful conviction, alleging suppression of evidence, fabrication of witness statements, withholding of exculpatory evidence, and other violations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Ford filed suit in March 2015. The operative First Amended Complaint was filed on September 8, 2015. Appellants answered the complaint on December 3, 2015, while other defendants in the initial lawsuit chose to instead move to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b). Approximately three months later, on March 16, 2016, the Appellants filed a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss the case for failure to state a claim. Alternatively, they moved for the Appellee to add details to the allegations pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 7(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The district court denied the Rule 12(b)(6) motion for being untimely on December 28, 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court also denied the alternative relief under Rule 7(a). The Appellants appealed the dismissal of the Rule 12(b)(6) motion on January 23, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The first, and determinative, issue is that of appellate jurisdiction.

The Appellants argue that in denying the Rule 12(b)(6) motion, the district court made an appealable final legal decision on qualified immunity. The Appellants base this argument on a statement made by the district court regarding a possible alternative argument that the defendants did not raise in their motion - that the Rule 12(b)(6) motion should instead be considered a Rule 12(c) motion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The district court, in declining to consider the motion under\n   Rule 12(c), stated that \"there are material facts in dispute and at this stage of the litigation, the Law Enforcement Defendants are not entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\" Based on this statement, the Appellants aver that the district court essentially made a final legal determination that the Appellants were not entitled to qualified immunity. This final legal determination must be appealable, Appellants maintain, because the purpose of qualified immunity is to protect the officers from trial, not only from liability.\n   <em>\n    Mitchell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1512327\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/472/511/#p524\">\n    472 U.S. 511\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 526-27,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1512327\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/472/511/#p524\">\n    105 S.Ct. 2806\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1512327\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/472/511/#p524\">\n    86 L.Ed.2d 411\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   However, the district court specifically stated that it was making the decision on procedural grounds, rather than legal grounds: \"Accordingly, the Law Enforcement Defendants' Rule 12(b)(6) Motion to Dismiss is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   as untimely.\" The decision therefore is not based on a legal evaluation of the Appellants' entitlement to qualified immunity. We take the district court at its word and decline to hold that the district court inadvertently made a final legal determination as to whether the Appellants are entitled to qualified immunity. Accordingly, we note that nothing in the district court's order bars the Appellants from asserting qualified immunity by appropriate, timely procedural vehicle in the future.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kiser v.
