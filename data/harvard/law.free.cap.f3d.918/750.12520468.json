During his crime spree, Korte was on parole and had consented to warrantless, suspicionless searches of his person, residence, and any property under his control. Relying on this parole condition, officers placed a Global Positioning System (\"GPS\") device on his car and later searched its trunk. Officers also obtained Korte's historical cell site location information (\"CSLI\") by court order. On appeal, Korte primarily challenges the district court's denial of his suppression motions as to each of these searches.

FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   In a world of cybercrime and identity theft, Korte stole money the old-fashioned way - he robbed banks. After serving time in state prison for bank robbery, Korte was paroled in August 2016. As a parolee in California, Korte was \"subject to search or seizure ... at any time of the day or night, with or without a search warrant or with or without cause.\" CAL. PENAL CODE \u00a7 3067(b)(3) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201291\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 3067(a). On October 25, 2016, Korte acknowledged his parole conditions, including that he was now subject to searches of \"[y]ou, your residence, and any property under your control.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In October 2016, the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department (\"LASD\") began investigating a series of bank robberies. The first robbery took place on October 7. A masked robber entered a bank and demanded \"all your hundreds.\" The frightened teller, protected by bulletproof glass, activated the silent alarm and retreated to a back office. The robber left with no money. On October 12, the masked robber\n   targeted another bank, this time brandishing a toy gun. He was more successful this go-around, escaping with $1,600. He then hit two more banks on October 27. Again displaying the toy gun, the robber pocketed $2,200 and $7,000. In total, the masked robber stole less than $11,000 - not a Neil McCauley heist by any means.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Working with LASD, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (\"FBI\") began to suspect that Korte was the masked robber. Surveillance video from one of the robberies showed a car registered to the address that Korte provided to his parole officer. An LASD officer who saw video of the masked robber also reported that the individual resembled Korte, who the officer knew was on parole for bank robbery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On November 4, 2016, without a warrant or Korte's consent, LASD placed a GPS tracking device on Korte's car and periodically monitored the vehicle's movements over the next six days. That same day, the Government obtained a court order under the Stored Communications Act (\"SCA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202703\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2703\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d), to acquire Korte's CSLI. This information placed Korte's cell phone near three of the four banks at the time of the respective robberies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On November 10, 2016, LASD learned that the FBI had obtained an arrest warrant for Korte. Officers followed Korte as he drove from his home to a bank and parked nearby, seeming to surveil his next target. An officer saw Korte open the car's trunk and place something inside. Shortly thereafter, they arrested Korte and searched the car. The officers' search of the trunk revealed the toy gun used during the three armed robberies and the shirt Korte had been wearing while casing the bank just prior to his arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   A grand jury indicted Korte for one count of attempted bank robbery in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202113\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) and three counts of bank robbery in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202113\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), (d). Korte pled not guilty and moved to suppress (1) the evidence found in his car's trunk, (2) the information derived from the GPS tracker on his car, and (3) his CSLI. The district court denied all three suppression motions. The court reasoned that Korte's parole status permitted the warrantless search of the trunk and placement of the GPS tracker on his car. As for the CSLI, it held that even if the acquisition of this information violated Korte's Fourth Amendment rights,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Carpenter v. United States\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612910\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2206/\">\n    138 S.Ct. 2206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612910\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2206/\">\n    201 L.Ed.2d 507\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018), the good-faith exception clearly applied based on the case law at that time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Korte went to trial. As to Count 1 - the unsuccessful robbery - the bank teller testified that even though bulletproof glass separated her from the robber and she saw no weapon, she was nevertheless \"[k]ind of panicked,\" \"[s]hocked,\" and \"[s]cared.\" Korte filed a motion for a judgment of acquittal, under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 29, focusing on Count 1. The district court rejected his argument that the Government failed to prove the element of \"force and violence, or by intimidation,\" as\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202113\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) requires. Citing the teller's \"testimony with regard to a mask and the demand,\" the court found sufficient evidence of \"intimidation\" to send the matter to the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The jury returned a guilty verdict as to all four counts. Korte was sentenced to 210 months in prison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Generally, a lawful search of a fixed space or premise extends to its entire area, whether or not that requires opening a confined space: \"[N]ice distinctions between closets, drawers, and containers, in the case of a home, or between glove compartments, upholstered seats, trunks, and wrapped packages, in the case of a vehicle, must give way to the interest in the prompt and efficient completion of the task at hand.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.
