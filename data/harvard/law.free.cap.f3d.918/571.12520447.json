Unity requested $ 741,308 for fiscal year 2006, the difference between its Medicare inpatient operating costs ($ 5,698,829) and its DRG payments ($ 4,957,521) in that year. The contractor reclassified $ 664,994 in costs as \"variable\" for: (i) billable medical supplies; (ii) billable drugs and intravenous solutions; (iii) professional services and supplies obtained from outside providers for physical therapy, reference laboratory, blood bank, and radiology; and (iv) dietary and linen services and supplies. The contractor calculated the net VDA payment as $ 76,314. Unity appealed the decision to the Board.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Lakes Regional requested $ 1,184,574 for fiscal year 2006, the difference between its Medicare inpatient costs ($ 4,923,186) and its DRG payments ($ 3,738,612) for that year. The contractor reclassified $ 1,360,118 in costs as \"variable\" for: (i) billable medical supplies associated with anesthesia, laboratory, oncology and emergency departments and respiratory therapy services; (ii) billable drugs and intravenous solutions; (iii) professional services and supplies obtained from outside providers for physical therapy, speech therapy, blood bank, and radiology; and (iv) dietary and linen services and supplies. Because Lakes Regional's decreased total costs were now lower than the DRG payments Lakes Regional had received for that year, the contractor denied a VDA. Lakes Regional appealed that decision to the Board.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   St. Anthony requested $ 1,954,257 for fiscal year 2009, the difference between its total inpatient operating costs ($ 8,333,903) and its total Pay Per Service payments\n   for that year. The contractor excluded $ 1,619,594 attributed to services and supplies similar to those excluded for Unity and Lakes Regional, corrected the subtracted payment total to equal total DRG payments ($ 6,273,905) and calculated the VDA payment as $ 440,404. St. Anthony appealed that decision to the Board.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Board upheld the contractor's classification of certain costs as variable in all three cases. However, the Board disagreed with the contractor's method for calculating the VDA. In its decisions in the Unity and Lakes Regional cases, the Board proposed a formula under which a contractor would first ask if the precondition was satisfied that a VDA was warranted. If so, then the VDA amount would be the hospital's total fixed costs, but capped at the regulatory \"ceiling\" that the payment would not exceed the difference between the hospital's total Medicare inpatient operating costs (including variable costs) and its DRG payments. Since Unity's and Lakes Regional's total fixed costs were far in excess of that ceiling, the Board ruled that each was entitled to a payment equal to the difference its total Medicare inpatient operating costs and its DRG payments, which was the amount the hospitals originally requested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Board used a different formula to calculate St. Anthony's VDA. The Board used a proportional method in which it used the ratio of the hospital's fixed costs to total costs to apportion some of the DRG payments to the hospital's fixed costs. The Board then subtracted the \"fixed portion\" of the DRG payments from the hospital's fixed costs to determine the VDA (concluding it would equal $ 1,690,823).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Administrator reversed the Board's VDA calculation methodology in all three cases, holding that the contractor's initial methodology was correct. The Administrator affirmed, however, the Board's rulings that the contractors had properly classified certain costs as variable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Each hospital sought judicial review, claiming that the Secretary's decision was arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to the statute. In support of their calculation methodology, the hospitals relied heavily on sample calculations contained within \u00a7 2810.1(B) of the Manual that subtracted total DRG payments from \"Program Inpatient Operating Costs.\" The hospitals also focused on evidence suggesting that more generous formulas had occasionally been used to calculate the VDA before 2006. The hospitals asserted that in the absence of any formal rule change, the Secretary could not adopt the different formula.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   While the hospitals' cases were pending, the agency issued a notice of proposed rulemaking to modify the method used to calculate the VDA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%2019%2C796\">\n    82 Fed. Reg. 19,796\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 19,933 -35 (Apr. 28, 2017). The substance of the new proposed rule largely tracked the proportional method the Board had used in the St. Anthony case. Under the new rule, contractors would estimate the \"fixed portion\" of a hospital's DRG payments by using the ratio of the hospital's fixed costs to total costs. They would then calculate the VDA as the difference between the hospital's fixed costs and the \"fixed portion\" of its DRG payments. The proposed rulemaking made clear, however, that the agency \"continue[d] to believe that [its] current approach in calculating volume decrease adjustments is reasonable and consistent with the statute.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%2019%2C796\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%2019%2C796\">\n    at 19,934\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The precise language at issue says that the VDA should be given \"as may be necessary to fully compensate\" a qualified hospital \"for the fixed costs it incurs ... in providing inpatient hospital services.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395ww(d)(5)(D)(ii). The Secretary's interpretation ensures that the total amount of a hospital's fixed costs in a given cost year are paid out through a combination of DRG payments and the VDA. As the Secretary points out, the prospective nature of DRG payments makes it difficult to determine how best to allocate those payments against the actual fixed costs a hospital incurs. Given the lack of guidance in the statute and the substantial deference we afford to the agency in this case, the Secretary's decision reasonably complied with the mandate to provide full compensation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   That the Secretary has prospectively adopted a new interpretation (the proportional approach) is not a sufficient reason to find the Secretary's prior interpretation arbitrary or capricious. \"An initial agency interpretation is not instantly carved in stone.

The agency received substantial feedback from hospitals that separating total DRG payments into \"fixed\" and \"variable\" estimates before calculating the VDA would better fulfill the statutory command to ensure \"full\" compensation. On the basis of that feedback, the agency re-evaluated the \"wisdom of its policy\" through a formal rulemaking. But that re-evaluation does not require us to conclude that the prior interpretation was unreasonable. A statute can have more than one reasonable interpretation, as in this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Smiley v.

At first glance, the Secretary's interpretation of the relevant regulations in these cases is clearly consistent with their text.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20412.92\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 412.92\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(3). The formula adopted by the Secretary ensures that any given VDA will not exceed \"the difference between the hospital's Medicare inpatient operating costs and the hospital's total DRG revenue for inpatient operating costs.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20412.92\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   And in all three cases, the Secretary considered individual characteristics of each hospital alongside the fixed or non-fixed nature of their costs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20412.92\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The hospitals' main argument to the contrary relies on the premise that the Manual's sample calculations unambiguously conflict with the Secretary's interpretation and that the Secretary is bound by the Manual as incorporated via later regulations. The hospitals point out that the Secretary has previously stated that \u00a7 2810.1(B) of the Manual, where the examples are located, contains \"the process for determining the amount of the volume decrease adjustment.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=71%20Fed.%20Reg.%2047%2C870\">\n    71 Fed. Reg. 47,870\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 48,056 (Aug. 19, 2006). However, the examples are not presented in isolation. The same section of the Manual reiterates that the volume-decrease adjustment is \"not to exceed the difference between the hospital's Medicare inpatient operating cost and the hospital's total DRG revenue.\" In a decision interpreting \u00a7 2810.1(B) immediately following the Secretary's guidance, the Board found \"that the examples are intended to demonstrate how to calculate the adjustment limit as opposed to determining which costs should be included in the adjustment.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Greenwood Cty. Hosp. v. BlueCross BlueShield Ass'n\n   </em>\n   , No. 2006-D43,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2006%20WL%203050893\">\n    2006 WL 3050893\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *9 n.19 (P.R.R.B. Aug. 29, 2006). That decision was not reviewed by the Secretary and therefore became a final agency action. The agency's conclusion that the examples are meant to display the ceiling for a VDA, rather than its total amount, is a reasonable interpretation of the regulation's use of \"not to exceed,\" rather than\n   \"equal to,\" when describing the formula.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   We conclude that the Secretary's interpretation was not arbitrary or capricious and was consistent with the regulation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   C. The Secretary's Classification of Certain Costs as Variable\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The costs at issue in this case are reasonably classified as variable costs. The agency emphasizes that its overriding principle for classifying costs as variable is whether costs vary with patient volume. Each of the identified costs varies with patient volume. The hospitals are correct that some costs that the agency classified as semi-fixed may also, over time, vary with volume. However, that only serves to demonstrate the sound judgment behind considering some \"semi-fixed costs, such as personnel-related costs ... as fixed on a case-by-case basis.\" Manual \u00a7 2810.1(B);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20412.92\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 412.92\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(3)(i) (requiring intermediaries to \"consider\" semi-fixed costs in determining the VDA, without specifying a particular method of incorporating them into the VDA).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The agency's decision to classify certain costs that are directly tied to patient volume as variable was neither arbitrary nor capricious. To the extent any of the hospitals now claims that some portion of its variable costs were in fact semi-fixed, each has failed to meet its burden of demonstrating entitlement to a payment adjustment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395g(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    III.
