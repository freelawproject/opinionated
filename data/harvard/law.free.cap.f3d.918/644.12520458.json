A judge requested a vote on whether to rehear the matter en banc, and the matter failed to receive a majority of the votes of the nonrecused active judges in favor of en banc consideration. Fed. R. App. P. 35. The petition for panel rehearing and the petition for rehearing en banc are\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   BENNETT, Circuit Judge, with whom R. NELSON, Circuit Judge, joins as to Part III, dissenting from the denial of rehearing en banc:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   I respectfully dissent from our decision not to rehear this case en banc. I believe that the panel made two fundamental errors of enormous scope, both of which we should have corrected en banc.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   First, the panel has wrongfully stripped the State of Washington of its Eleventh Amendment immunity from suit by permitting a damages claim to proceed against the State under the guise of an injunction requiring the State to return to Plaintiffs \"their\" property. The property was never Plaintiffs', and, in any case, is simply money-uncredited interest that will now be paid to Plaintiffs from the State's treasury. That decision, which contravenes clear Supreme Court and Ninth Circuit precedent and creates a circuit split, strips the Eleventh Amendment of much of its vitality. It takes little in the way of imagination to foresee future plaintiffs recasting their otherwise-barred claims for money damages against a state as injunctive relief claims for return of what is supposedly their property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Having bypassed Washington's immunity from suit, the panel then created a Fifth Amendment property right no court has ever recognized. According to the panel, when a state chooses to hold individuals' funds in an interest-bearing account, that account must, constitutionally, accrue interest day-to-day, because that was the way the common law worked in centuries past:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   Because the right to daily interest is deeply ingrained in our common law tradition, this property interest is protected by the Takings Clause regardless of whether a state legislature purports to authorize a state officer to abrogate the common law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    Fowler v. Guerin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518035\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/899/1112/#p1119\">\n    899 F.3d 1112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1119 (9th Cir. 2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In other words, neither the Washington legislature, nor the legislatures of its sister states, nor even Congress, may constitutionally\n   allow interest to accrue weekly, monthly, or annually on retirement (or other) accounts they establish by statute. The panel's decision is wholly untethered to the text of the Fifth Amendment and unsupported by any case. Many states and the United States currently have retirement systems with interest-bearing accounts that, just like Washington's, do not accrue interest daily. If the panel is correct, these states and the United States are all currently violating the Fifth Amendment and have been for decades.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Both of the panel's errors-stripping Washington of its constitutional immunity from suit and creating a never-before-recognized constitutional right-independently warrant rehearing en banc. Thus I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   I start with a bit of background.

The panel's understanding of the interest-follows-principal rule, though, is deeply flawed.

The panel must also demonstrate why the common law rule that interest is apportioned daily is so much a fixture of the legal landscape that the Plaintiffs \"have more than an abstract need or desire [or] a unilateral expectation of it,\"\n   <em>\n    Roth\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1782964\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/408/564/#p577\">\n    408 U.S. at 577\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1782964\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/408/564/#p577\">\n    92 S.Ct. 2701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , to justify setting aside otherwise lawful state modification of the rule. And the fact that no court has, before now, held that state governments cannot modify the daily interest rule when they hold cash strongly suggests that the rule is not so deeply ingrained in our tradition that states may not modify it without running afoul of the Takings Clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    B\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Rehearing en banc is also warranted here because of the tremendous potential impact of the panel's incorrect decision. It is no small thing to hold that a significant aspect of a State's retirement system is unconstitutional, particularly when the state has used that system, in some form, since the 1930s.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Probst\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=271%20P.3d%20966\">\n    271 P.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   972 (citing Washington Laws of 1937, ch. 221 \u00a7 1(22)). The impact of the panel's decision, though, will be felt well beyond Washington's borders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The panel's holding will cast significant doubt on the legitimacy of retirement systems administered by numerous states and the federal government that apportion interest less frequently than daily.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Congress and the administrators of the Federal Employees Retirement System (\"FERS\") will, I imagine, be very surprised to discover that they are committing an unconstitutional taking by failing to pay daily interest on refunds of employees' contributions to FERS defined-benefit plans.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   In addition to Washington and the United States, public employee retirement systems in Alabama, Alaska, Connecticut, Kansas, Kentucky, South Dakota, Virginia, and Wisconsin all apportion interest on retirement account funds less frequently than daily.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   By the panel's logic, these states are committing an unconstitutional taking, and I have little doubt that lawyers in these jurisdictions will use the panel's opinion as a basis for Takings Clause challenges to these retirement plans.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    IV\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   If the Eleventh Amendment is to continue to have meaningful force, we cannot permit plaintiffs to attain otherwise prohibited retrospective relief against a state's treasury simply by describing that relief in terms of an injunction or other equitable remedy. Nor should we as a court create a property right to daily interest when nothing in the precedents of the Supreme Court or this court have ever even suggested that when a state awards interest, it must do so daily. The effects of the panel's novel holding will be felt around the country in the form of legal challenges to state and federal retirement plans that similarly award interest less frequently than daily. We should have taken this case en banc to correct our errors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Hutto v.
