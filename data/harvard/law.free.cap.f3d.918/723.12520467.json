Thousands of those copyrighted photos come from VHT, the largest professional real estate photography studio in the country.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The copyright claims on appeal concern Zillow's use of VHT's photos on two parts of Zillow's website: the \"Listing Platform\" and \"Digs.\" The Listing Platform is the core of the website, featuring photos and information about real estate properties, both on and off the market. Zillow claims that the site includes \"most homes in America.\" Digs features photos of artfully-designed rooms in some of those properties and is geared toward home improvement and remodeling. Zillow tags photos on the Listing Platform so that Digs users can search the database by various criteria, like room type, style, cost, and color.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Real estate brokers, listing services, and agents hire VHT to take professional photos of new listings for marketing purposes. A VHT photographer takes the photos and sends them to the company's studio for touch-up, where they are saved to VHT's electronic photo database, and then delivered to the client for use under license. Each license agreement between VHT and its clients differs slightly, but each contract generally grants the requesting client the right to use the photos in the sale or marketing of the featured property. Zillow receives these photos and other data in feeds from various real estate-related sources.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In 2015, VHT sued Zillow Group, Inc., and Zillow, Inc., (collectively \"Zillow\") for copyright infringement, alleging that Zillow's use of photos on the Listing Platform and Digs exceeded the scope of VHT's licenses to brokers, agents, and listing services who provided those photos to Zillow. The district court granted partial summary judgment on a limited set of claims, while other claims advanced to trial. The jury found in favor of VHT on most remaining claims, awarding over $ 8.27 million in damages. The district court partially granted Zillow's post-trial motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, reversing in part the jury verdict and reducing total damages to approximately $ 4 million.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The parties cross-appealed issues stemming from partial summary judgment, the jury verdict, and judgment notwithstanding the verdict. We affirm in part and reverse in part.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   To simplify and make sense of the various claims, this opinion does not split out the appeal and cross-appeal as was done in the briefing to the court. Instead, the opinion separately addresses liability for each of the categories of photos at issue, followed by a discussion of damages. In view of the multiple theories of liability and categories of photos, following is an overview of the opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   I.

Conclusion\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The heart of this dispute is Zillow's copyright liability for use of VHT photos. VHT argues that Zillow directly infringed its copyrighted photos, both those on the Listing Platform and Digs. VHT also argues that Zillow indirectly infringed through use of the photos on Digs. These claims pertain to different images, focus on different features of Zillow's website, and have different procedural postures, so we consider the various categories of photos separately.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Direct Infringement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   VHT's key claim is that Zillow is directly liable for infringing VHT's copyright on photos that were posted on the Listing Platform and Digs. To prevail on a claim of direct copyright infringement, VHT must establish \"ownership of the allegedly infringed material\" and that Zillow \"violate[d] at least one exclusive right granted to\" VHT under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20106\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    A&amp;M Records, Inc. v.

It is undisputed that VHT is the copyright holder of the allegedly infringed photos and therefore has the exclusive right to reproduce, adapt, and display them.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20106\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   VHT must also establish causation, which is commonly referred to as the \"volitional-conduct requirement.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Perfect 10, Inc. v. Giganews, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12188132\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/847/657/#p666\">\n    847 F.3d 657\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 666 (9th Cir. 2017). As we set out in\n   <em>\n    Giganews\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   decided on the first day of the VHT/Zillow trial and the closest circuit precedent on point-\"volition in this context does not really mean an act of willing or choosing or an act of deciding\"; rather, \"it simply stands for the unremarkable proposition that proximate causation historically underlines copyright infringement liability no less than other torts.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . (internal citations omitted). Stated differently, \"\n   <em>\n    direct\n   </em>\n   liability must be premised on conduct that can reasonably be described as the\n   <em>\n    direct cause\n   </em>\n   of the infringement.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12188132\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/847/657/#p666\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citation omitted). This prerequisite takes on greater importance in cases involving automated systems, like the Zillow website.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In addressing this concept, Justice Scalia noted that \"[e]very Court of Appeals to have considered an automated-service provider's direct liability for copyright infringement has adopted [the volitional-conduct] rule.\"\n   <em>\n    Am.

By contrast, activities that fall on the other side of the line, such as \" 'automatic copying, storage, and transmission of copyrighted materials, when instigated by others, do[ ] not render an [Internet service provider] strictly liable for copyright infringement[.]' \"\n   <em>\n    Giganews\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12188132\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/847/657/#p666\">\n    847 F.3d at 670\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    CoStar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9232981\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/373/544/#p550\">\n    373 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   555 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In other words, to demonstrate volitional conduct, a party like VHT must provide some \"evidence showing [the alleged infringer] exercised control (other than by general operation of [its website] ); selected any material for upload, download, transmission, or storage; or instigated any copying, storage, or distribution\" of its photos.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9232981\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/373/544/#p550\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9232981\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/373/544/#p550\">\n    at 666, 670\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . VHT failed to satisfy that burden with respect to either the photos on the Listing Platform or on Digs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Direct Infringement-Listing Platform Photos\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   VHT asserted that Zillow directly infringed the photos displayed on the Listing Platform after a real estate property was sold because VHT's license agreements only authorized use of those photos in relation to the sale of the property. This claim, involving 54,257 non-searchable photos, was resolved on summary judgment. The Listing Platform is the core of Zillow's online real estate marketplace. It features photos and information about properties, which Zillow receives through digital feeds from real estate agents, brokerages, and multiple listing services, among others (collectively \"feed providers\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Zillow has agreements with its feed providers granting it an express license to use, copy, distribute, publicly display, and create derivative works from the feed data on its websites. Feed providers represent that they \"ha[ve] all necessary rights and authority to enter into\" the agreements, and that \"Zillow's exercise of the rights granted [t]hereunder will not violate the intellectual property rights, or any other rights of any third party.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   These agreements provide Zillow with either \"evergreen\" or \"deciduous\" rights in the photos provided through the feeds. An evergreen right permits use of a photo without any time restriction, \"on and in connection with the operation, marketing and promotion of the web sites and other properties, owned, operated or powered by Zillow or its authorized licensees.\" By contrast, a deciduous right is temporally limited: Zillow may use the photo when the\n   real-estate listing for its corresponding property is active, but once the listing is removed (for example, when the property sells), the photo must be taken down from Zillow's websites. To treat each photo consistently with its deciduous or evergreen designation, Zillow developed automated \"trumping\" rules to determine which photos to display on the Listing Platform.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   VHT argues that Zillow \"designed its system to ... cause[ ] the reproduction, display, and adaptation of VHT photographs post-sale on the Listing Platform,\" and \"chose to simply ignore VHT's notices that post-sale use was beyond the scope of VHT's licenses.\" The district court granted summary judgment to Zillow, concluding that it did not engage in volitional conduct and therefore did not directly infringe VHT's copyrights in 54,257 photos by displaying them on the Listing Platform after a real estate property was sold.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   On de novo review, we agree with the district court's analysis and affirm.\n   <em>\n    Kelly v. Arriba Soft Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1537834\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/336/811/#p817\">\n    336 F.3d 811\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 817 (9th Cir. 2003). Although the district court did not have the benefit of\n   <em>\n    Giganews\n   </em>\n   at the time of summary judgment, its careful reasoning was prescient in invoking the same principles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Zillow did not engage in volitional conduct necessary to support a finding of direct liability. The content of the Listing Platform is populated with data submitted by third-party sources that attested to the permissible use of that data, and Zillow's system for managing photos on the Listing Platform was constructed in a copyright-protective way. The feed providers themselves select and upload every photo, along with the evergreen or deciduous designations, that wind up on the Listing Platform. As a result, the photos on the Listing Platform were not \"selected\" by Zillow.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Giganews\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12188132\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/847/657/#p666\">\n    847 F.3d at 670\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Nor did Zillow \"exercise[ ] control\" over these photos beyond the \"general operation of [its website].\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12188132\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/847/657/#p666\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Zillow required feed providers to certify the extent of their rights to use each photo. Consistent with these designations, Zillow's system classified each photo as deciduous or evergreen and programmed its automated systems to treat each photo consistently with that scope of use certified to by the third party.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Further, when multiple versions of the same photo were submitted through the various feeds, Zillow invoked its copyright-protective \"trumping\" rules. For example, one rule might prefer a photo provided by an agent over one provided by a multiple listing service, and another might prefer a local broker to an international one. Zillow used a rule that gave preference to photos with evergreen rights over photos with deciduous rights in the same image. As the district court recognized, \"trumping\" is a reasonable way to design a system to manage multiple versions of the same photo when the authorized use varies across versions. These rules, along with other features of the system, facilitate keeping the photos with evergreen rights on the website and removing the photos with deciduous rights once a property has sold. Thus, Zillow actively designed its system to avoid and eliminate copyright infringement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Notably, VHT's argument is primarily cast in terms of Zillow facilitating or enabling infringement by VHT's clients that are Zillow's feed providers. But this type of claim more properly falls in the category of secondary infringement, a claim not advanced by VHT with respect to the Listing Platform photos.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   VHT also asserts that Zillow failed to remove photos once it received notice that infringing content was on the Listing Platform, a conscious choice that amounts to volitional conduct on Zillow's part. This claim is unavailing because, once VHT put Zillow on notice of claimed infringement,\n   Zillow took affirmative action to address the claims. Additionally, VHT's assertion that it \"repeatedly notified Zillow that it was infringing\" is unsupported in the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   In July 2014, VHT sent Zillow a takedown notice letter with a list of thousands of allegedly infringing photos by residential street address (but not by web address). Zillow promptly requested all executed license agreements between VHT and the feed providers who had provided photos to Zillow, as well as license agreements between VHT and its photographers, so that Zillow could evaluate whether VHT possessed exclusive rights to the photos on the Listing Platform. VHT responded with an unsigned form contract, which it stated was used with many feed providers, but which was not tied to any specific photos on Zillow's website. Zillow again reiterated its need to see the specific contracts governing the contested photos. Instead of responding with the contracts, VHT filed suit. Zillow's reasonable response to VHT's single formal inquiry (supplemented in a follow-on email) can hardly be characterized as rising to the level of volitional conduct or turning a blind eye.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   In sum, VHT failed to \"provide[ ] ... evidence showing [Zillow] exercised control (other than by general operation of [its website] ); selected any material for upload, download, transmission, or storage; or instigated any copying, storage, or distribution\" of these photos.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Giganews\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12188132\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/847/657/#p666\">\n    847 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   670 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    CoStar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9232981\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/373/544/#p550\">\n    373 F.3d at 555\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, we affirm the district court and conclude Zillow did not directly infringe VHT's copyrights in photos displayed on the Listing Platform post-sale.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Direct Infringement-Digs Photos\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   VHT also claimed that Zillow directly infringed thousands of photos used on Digs. The jury concluded that Zillow directly infringed 28,125 photos and rejected its fair use defense. Following trial, the district court granted in substantial part Zillow's motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict on the ground that insufficient evidence supported Zillow's direct infringement of 22,109 photos that were not displayed on Digs and 2,093\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   photos that were displayed but not searchable on Digs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   By contrast, the court upheld the jury's determination that Zillow directly infringed a set of 3,921 images that were selected and tagged by Zillow moderators for searchable functionality and displayed on Digs. Zillow does not appeal this ruling. However, Zillow argues that fair use insulates it from liability as to this subset of photos. The jury was instructed not to consider this legal theory as to these photos because the district court had determined pretrial that, as a matter of law, the searchability function did not constitute fair use. It is that summary judgment ruling that Zillow challenges on appeal. Because we agree with the district court that the fair use defense does not absolve Zillow of direct liability for these searchable photos, this portion of the jury verdict remains intact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The following chart clarifies the status of the Digs photos relevant to the direct infringement claims.\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-60\"><strong>Photos</strong> <strong>Jury Verdict</strong> <strong>Post-Trial</strong> <strong>Party</strong> <strong>Determination</strong> <strong>Bringing</strong> <strong>Appeal</strong> 22,109 not Direct Overturned jury VHT displayed<sup>5</sup> infringement verdict 2,094 Direct Overturned jury VHT displayed, not infringement verdict searchable (except 1 email photo) 3,921 Direct Upheld jury Zillow: displayed, infringement verdict direct searchable infringement not appealed; appeals only summary judgment on no fair use 1 blog post Direct Upheld jury Not appealed photo (not on infringement verdict Digs)</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   [\n   <strong>\n    Editor's Note\n   </strong>\n   : The preceding image contains the reference for footnote\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   ].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

The jury verdict form was framed in general terms, asking only whether \"VHT has proven its direct copyright infringement claim as to one or more of the VHT Photos[.]\" The jury answered \"yes,\" and was asked to specify how many VHT photos were directly infringed.

However, because the verdict here did not meet this standard, we affirm the district court's grant of Zillow's motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict with respect to direct infringement of 22,109 non-displayed photos and 2,093 displayed but not searchable photos.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   We first consider display rights. As background for our analysis, it is useful to consider the direct infringement by Zillow that the district court upheld and that Zillow did not appeal. The district court found substantial evidence that Zillow directly infringed VHT's display rights in 3,921 photos displayed on Digs that Zillow moderators selected and tagged for searchable functionality. Based on testimony, charts, and statistics, the court found that \"the jury could have reasonably concluded that users accessed those images through Digs's search function.\" The court went on to reason that \"the jury could have reasonably concluded that Zillow's moderation efforts, which rendered those images searchable, proximately caused the copying.\" Put differently, active conduct by Zillow met the volitional-conduct requirement for direct infringement. Zillow does not appeal this ruling upholding the jury's verdict as to the 3,921 displayed, searchable photos.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   On appeal, VHT attempts to shoehorn an additional 1,694 photos into this category. This effort falls flat both as a factual and legal matter because substantial evidence does not support direct infringement of VHT's display rights in the 1,694 searchable images that were not displayed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   VHT posits that the jury could have found that these photos were displayed because of circumstantial evidence and because Zillow failed to record whether they were displayed. Not so. This argument is foreclosed by the parties' stipulated spreadsheet that categorized each photo. The column labeled \"DISPLAYED\" included an entry for \"Y\" (yes) or \"N\" (no). The jury was instructed to \"treat every fact on this spreadsheet as proven,\" so VHT cannot recast the facts retroactively and now claim that 1,694 searchable images stipulated as \"N[OT] DISPLAYED\"\n   <em>\n    were in fact\n   </em>\n   displayed or made available for display. Up is not down.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   VHT's contention that the jury could have reasonably inferred that Zillow made \"available for public display\" all 22,109 \"N[OT] DISPLAYED\" images similarly fails. This theory presumes that the Copyright Act's display right encompasses an exclusive right to \"make available for display,\" a position neither supported by the statute nor embraced by this court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Perfect 10, Inc. v.

The jury was never instructed on the \"made available\" theory, nor did VHT raise this issue in its proposed jury instructions or in\n   objections to the final instructions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sinclair v.

For these reasons, substantial evidence did not support a finding of direct infringement of VHT's public display rights in these 22,109 photos.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Zillow also did not violate VHT's display rights in 2,093 displayed, non-searchable photos. These are photos that Digs users copied to \"personal boards\" and \"Implicit Digs,\" but which Zillow did not add to the searchable set.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   A \"personal board\" is a bespoke digital bulletin board of images that a user saves or uploads from the Listing Platform. Users can also upload their own images. These boards are typically private, though users can share a link to their boards. When a user saves a copy of an image with evergreen rights to a personal board, that image automatically joins a queue for review by a Zillow moderator. The moderator then decides whether to designate the photo for tagging so that it can be searchable on Digs, and thus select it for public display. Not all photos that are in the queue for moderation are reviewed. Additionally, in some instances, a user starts but does not finish the process of saving an image to this board. Beginning in 2014, Zillow programmed these \"clicked to save\" images-called \"Implicit Digs\"-to enter the queue for moderator review in the same manner as if the photo had been saved to a personal board.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   According to VHT, the jury could have found that Zillow \"caused the [2,093] images to be displayed ... by subjecting the non-searchable VHT Photos to the potential for moderation.\" This argument defies logic because the only display that occurred was triggered by the user. Any potential for future display is purely speculative. As the district court explained, the\n   <em>\n    possibility\n   </em>\n   that images might be moderated and tagged-conduct that is volitional-is not sufficient \"to transform Zillow from a 'passive host' to a 'direct[ ] cause' of the display of VHT's images.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Next, we consider VHT's exclusive reproduction and adaption rights in the 2,093 displayed, non-searchable photos. The Copyright Act grants copyright holders the exclusive right \"to reproduce the copyrighted work in copies or phonorecords.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20106\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1).

Following\n   <em>\n    Giganews\n   </em>\n   , we conclude that Zillow's automated processes storing or caching VHT's photos are insufficiently volitional to establish that Zillow directly infringed VHT's reproduction and adaption rights in these non-searchable photos. Unlike photos that Zillow curated, selected, and tagged for searchable functionality-activities that amount to volitional conduct establishing direct liability-these 2,093 photos were copied to \"personal boards\" and \"Implicit Digs\" based on\n   <em>\n    user\n   </em>\n   actions, not the conduct of Zillow or its moderators.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Any volitional conduct with respect to these photos was taken by the users, not Zillow. Users, not Zillow, \"selecte[d]\" images to add to their personal boards and \"instigate[d]\" the automatic caching process by saving a particular image.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Giganews\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12188132\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/847/657/#p666\">\n    847 F.3d at 670\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Zillow produced cached copies of these Digs images, a process that automatically trims or pads images whose height and width did not match the target resolution, for the purposes of accelerating website speed. This activity does not amount to volitional conduct. Nor can Zillow's promotion of Digs, including encouraging users to share photos through its site, be seen as \"instigat[ing]\" user copying.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12188132\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/847/657/#p666\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Zillow's conduct with respect to these photos amounts to, at most, passive participation in the alleged infringement of reproduction and adaption rights and is not sufficient to cross the volitional-conduct line.

We affirm the district court's grant of judgment notwithstanding the verdict as to these photos. We now turn to Zillow's fair use defense to direct infringement of 3,921 displayed, searchable photos.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Summary Judgment-Fair Use re Searchable Photos\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Zillow does not appeal the jury's finding of direct infringement with respect to the 3,921 displayed, searchable photos, but does assert a fair use defense for those photos. Zillow contends that Digs' searchable functionality constitutes fair use, which the district court rejected as a matter of law at summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   We recount the somewhat unusual history of the fair use issue in the proceedings below. On summary judgment, the district court rejected Zillow's argument that \"the images that it has made searchable on Digs\" are protected by fair use and instead \"conclude[d] as a matter of law that Digs' searchable functionality does not constitute a fair use.\" At trial, the jury was generally instructed to consider the fair use defense as to all VHT photos used on Digs that it found Zillow had directly or indirectly infringed. However, this set of photos was carved out for separate treatment. The jury considered only whether \"reproduction, cropping, and scaling\" of these photos constituted fair use because the court instructed the jury that the court \"ha[d] determined, and you are to take as proven, that the Digs searchable functionality does not constitute fair use.\" After finding that Zillow directly infringed all 28,125 VHT\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   photos used on Digs, the jury rejected Zillow's fair use affirmative defense for all photos.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The district court upheld the jury's fair use verdict, which Zillow does not appeal. Rather, Zillow's appeal reaches back to the district court's summary judgment ruling to argue that the Digs'\n   <em>\n    searchable\n   </em>\n   functionality is fair use as a matter of law, and, as a result, Zillow bears no liability for the 3,921 searchable and displayed photos. We review de novo the district court's grant of summary judgment to VHT on this mixed question of law and fact.\n   <em>\n    Kelly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1537834\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/336/811/#p817\">\n    336 F.3d at 817\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <em>\n    a.

Although the 1976 Copyright Act codified those principles, it did little to elaborate on Justice Story's description or to clarify application of the factors.

The purpose of Digs is to permit users to search for certain attributes or features, such as a marble countertop or hardwood floor, and view photos of rooms with those attributes or features. These photos are either uploaded by users to Digs, or selected manually or electronically by Zillow. Zillow then tags the photos to make them searchable. Of course, tagging makes it possible for a user's keyword search to produce relevant results. Zillow refers to these tagged photos as \"searchable images\" or components of the \"searchable set.\" VHT's 3,921 photos are in the searchable set.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Zillow contends that Digs is effectively a search engine, which makes its use of VHT's photos transformative, and therefore fair use. VHT responds that this is not fair use because Digs is not a search engine and the tagging for searchable functionality is not transformative. Dueling \"search engine\" characterizations do not resolve fair use here. Instead, we step back and assess the question holistically, as we have been instructed to do by the statute and the Supreme Court. We consider the reality of what is happening rather than resorting to labels. To do that, it is helpful to recount the history of the search engine cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   <em>\n    b.

But not all search engines are created equal. The search engines commonly used for day-to-day research are internet-wide search engines, like Google, Yahoo, or Bing. These search engines are programs powered by algorithms that search or \"crawl\" the web. A search engine like Google then indexes websites, stores them on a database, and runs users' search queries against it. Search results are typically a mix of images and text, which include hyperlinks to sources of that content elsewhere on the web.\n   <em>\n    Amazon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6046751\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/508/1146/#p1160\">\n    508 F.3d at 1155\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Unlike the internet-wide search engines considered in\n   <em>\n    Amazon\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Kelly\n   </em>\n   , Digs is a closed-universe search engine that does not \"crawl\" the web. Users can run searches on the \"searchable set\" of images within Digs' walled garden, which includes VHT photos. The search results do not direct users to the original sources of the photos, such as VHT's website. Rather, they link to other pages within Zillow's website and, in some cases, to third-party merchants that sell items similar to those featured in the photo.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   That Digs makes these images searchable does not fundamentally change their original purpose when produced by VHT: to artfully depict rooms and properties.

Zillow testified throughout trial that, in order to systematically or swiftly take down a large number of photos, it required the Zillow Image ID-a number that is in the URL for each image. This stands to reason, because \"Zillow receives multiple copies of the same photograph, depicting the same property, with the same listing agent, from different feeds.\" Merely identifying the physical property address in no way identified the proper feed or the correct photo. Thus, Zillow did not have appropriately \"specific\" information necessary to take \"simple measures\" to remedy the violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   VHT's argument that Zillow is liable for failing to ask for the URLs of the allegedly infringing photos also fails. Asking for the URLs was not Zillow's duty under the contributory liability standard: Zillow must have \"\n   <em>\n    actual\n   </em>\n   knowledge that\n   <em>\n    specific\n   </em>\n   infringing material is available using its system.\"\n   <em>\n    Amazon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6046751\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/508/1146/#p1160\">\n    508 F.3d at 1172\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation and quotation omitted). Zillow first reasonably asked to see the licenses between VHT and the feed providers; otherwise, Zillow could not assess ownership and rights in the undefined images. That Zillow did not proactively request a list of URLs before VHT filed suit does not make Zillow contributorily liable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   Additionally, Zillow's failure to systematically use watermarking technology does not show there was a \"simple measure\" available that it failed to use. Even assuming there were \"reasonable and feasible means\" for Zillow to employ watermark detection technology, in practice VHT rarely watermarked its photos.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Giganews\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12188132\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/847/657/#p666\">\n    847 F.3d at 672\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation and quotation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Nor did Zillow induce infringement.

Once VHT photos were uploaded to the Listing Platform with appropriate certification of rights, ferreting out claimed infringement through use on Digs was beyond hunting for a needle in a haystack. As the district court concluded, \"the trial record lacks substantial evidence of a practical ability to limit direct infringement for the same reasons it lacks substantial evidence of simple measures to remove infringing material.\" And linking a claimed infringement to a feed provider was even more of an impossibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   We affirm the district court's judgment notwithstanding the verdict concluding that substantial evidence did not support\n   the claim that Zillow secondarily infringed VHT's exclusive rights in its photos.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Damages\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Compilation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   The size of the damages award hinges on whether VHT's photos used on Digs are part of a \"compilation\" or if they are individual photos. This distinction makes a difference. If the VHT photo database is a \"compilation,\" and therefore one \"work\" for the purposes of the Copyright Act, then VHT would be limited to a single award of statutory damages for Zillow's use of thousands of photos on Digs.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20504\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 504\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1).

VHT did so. The Act provides for \"an award of statutory damages for all infringements involved in the action, with respect to any one work ... in a sum of not less than $ 750 or more than $ 30,000.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20504\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This provision ties statutory damages to the term \"work,\" which is undefined, except in a circular manner: copyright law protects \"original works of authorship.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20102\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

Before trial, Zillow asked for a legal determination on the compilation issue. That motion was denied. However, the district court did not make an explicit determination about compilation and the specifics of compilation were not put before the jury. In fairness to the district court, we might infer from the transcript that there was an implicit determination as to whether VHT's photos are part of a compilation, but we are left in doubt. Instead, the jury was instructed that \"[e]ach VHT Photo that has independent economic value constitutes a separate work.\" On the verdict form, the jury was asked which \"photographs have independent economic value.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   The notion of \"independent economic value\" derives not from the statute, but from case law. In the Ninth Circuit, the question of whether something-like a photo, television episode, or so forth-has \"independent economic value\" informs our analysis of whether the photo or episode is a work, though it is not a dispositive factor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Columbia Pictures Television, Inc. v. Krypton Broad. of Birmingham, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9501327\" index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/259/1186/#p1193\">\n    259 F.3d 1186\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1193 (9th Cir. 2001). But consideration of the independent economic value factor does not answer the question whether something is a compilation. That question remains unanswered here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   On appeal, the parties have polar opposite views on whether there was a compilation (Zillow's position) or whether each photo is entitled to a separate damages award (VHT's position). VHT registered thousands of photos as compilations. But the Copyright Office warns that such a registration \"may\" limit the copyright holder \"to claim only one award of statutory\n   damages in an infringement action, even if the defendant infringed all of the component works covered by the registration\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   \" U.S. COPYRIGHT OFFICE, COMPENDIUM OF U.S. COPYRIGHT OFFICE PRACTICES \u00a7 1104.5 (Sept. 2017), https://www.copyright.gov/comp3/docs/compendium.pdf. Though the registration label is not controlling, it may be considered by the court when assessing whether a work is a compilation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Yellow Pages Photos, Inc. v.

Ultimately, what counts is the statutory definition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   Because there were at least ten different copyright registrations, thousands of photos, and no explicit determination on compilation, we decline to sort out the compilation issue on appeal. We remand to the district court for further proceedings as to whether the VHT photos remaining at issue were a compilation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Willfulness\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   The jury found that Zillow willfully infringed exclusive rights to 3,373 searchable VHT photos that were eligible for statutory damages. The district court largely upheld the willfulness finding in its post-trial motions order. However, the court granted Zillow judgment notwithstanding the verdict on 673 images that were not displayed, so the court's final willfulness judgment applied to 2,700 searchable photos on Digs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   To uphold a jury's willfulness finding, there must be substantial evidence \"(1) that the [the infringing party] was actually aware of the infringing activity, or (2) that the [infringing party's] actions were the result of reckless disregard for, or willful blindness to, the copyright holder's rights.\"\n   <em>\n    Unicolors\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277332\" index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/853/980/#p984\">\n    853 F.3d at 991\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation and quotation omitted). Under the second prong, willful blindness requires that the infringing party \"(1) subjectively believed that infringement was likely occurring on their networks and that they (2) took deliberate actions to avoid learning about the infringement.\"\n   <em>\n    Luvdarts, LLC v. AT&amp;T Mobility, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3550769\" index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/710/1068/#p1073\">\n    710 F.3d 1068\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1073 (9th Cir. 2013). Reckless disregard can be demonstrated, for example, when a party \"refus[es], as a matter of policy, to even investigate or attempt to determine whether particular [photos] are subject to copyright protections.\"\n   <em>\n    Unicolors\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277332\" index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/853/980/#p984\">\n    853 F.3d at 992\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . A finding of willfulness has significant financial consequences-the jury may increase damages up to $ 150,000 per violation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20504\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 504\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   As noted with respect to infringement, we do not take lightly the decision to reverse a jury verdict, nor do we cavalierly set aside the district court's thoughtful analysis. But here, we are compelled to disagree with both because substantial evidence does not support willfulness as to the 2,700 photos.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   The test for willfulness is in the alternative:\n   <em>\n    either\n   </em>\n   actual notice\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   recklessness shown by reckless disregard or turning a blind eye to infringement. We turn first to actual notice. That VHT provided Zillow with minimal notice of infringement does not itself establish that any subsequent infringement was willful. Rather, \"[c]ontinued use of a work even after one has been notified of his or her alleged infringement does not constitute willfulness so long as one believes reasonably, and in good faith, that he or she is not infringing.\"\n   <em>\n    Evergreen Safety Council v. RSA Network Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3623600\" index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/697/1221/#p1228\">\n    697 F.3d 1221\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1228 (9th Cir. 2012) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Danjaq LLC v.

Zillow's agreements with its feed providers grant it an express license to use, copy, distribute, publicly display, and create derivative works for each photo, and the agreements include unambiguous representations by the feed providers that they have the authority to assign such rights. Zillow developed procedures to identify ex ante the scope of its license for each uploaded photo and employed automated protocols to manage the use of each photo consistent with its evergreen or deciduous designation. At no point during their year of communications prior to issuance of the notice letter did VHT raise the specter of infringement. Notably, VHT's eventual notice was minimal: one letter with a list of allegedly infringing photos, designated by residential street address, not web address.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   The notion that Zillow failed to take appropriate responsive measures after receiving this notice is belied by the record. Zillow immediately requested information to confirm VHT's copyright ownership and cross-reference the photos with licensing information. VHT was not forthcoming with that information. Rather, in response, VHT offered merely an unsigned form contract. Instead of providing helpful information, VHT then filed suit. Given the limited information provided by VHT, Zillow could not reasonably be expected to have promptly and unilaterally removed each flagged photo. As the district court noted, VHT failed to demonstrate there were simple measures available for the removal of infringing photos or that Zillow had any \"practical ability to independently identify infringing images.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   Thus, we are compelled to conclude that substantial evidence does not show Zillow was \"actually aware\" of its infringing activity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Evergreen Safety Council\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3623600\" index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/697/1221/#p1228\">\n    697 F.3d at 1228\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Zillow's belief that feed providers had properly licensed its uses and that its system effectively respected those rights was reasonable. And, as the district court observed, \"[t]he record suggests no reason to conclude that Zillow maintained that position in bad faith, and Zillow's non-infringement contention proved accurate as to most of the images at issue in this lawsuit.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   We reach the same conclusion as to whether Zillow recklessly disregarded or willfully blinded itself to its infringement. In reaching an opposite conclusion, the district court observed that Zillow did not \"perform[ ] further investigation into the rights each [feed provider] possesses,\" nor did it \"t[ake] responsive measures to obtain further information\" after VHT provided the minimal notice of potential infringement. That conclusion is at odds with the evidence, for the reasons outlined above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   VHT's argument that Zillow, a sophisticated business with a robust legal team, should have known that its feed provider license agreements were invalid is unavailing. VHT argues that when Zillow saw the non-exclusive grant of rights in VHT's unsigned form contract, showing that the feed providers did not have a right to sublicense, Zillow should have known the licenses were invalid. Despite requests for such information, Zillow did not have access to VHT's executed licenses with the feed providers who furnished VHT's photos to Zillow. Access to a blank form contract (that the district court earlier found ambiguous as a matter of law) is not enough. We conclude that substantial evidence does not show Zillow was \"reckless or willfully blind\" as to its infringement. We reverse the district court and vacate the jury's finding of willful infringement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   We affirm the district court's summary judgment in favor of Zillow on direct infringement of the Listing Platform photos. With respect to direct liability on the Digs photos, we affirm the district court's grant of judgment notwithstanding the verdict on the 22,109 non-displayed photos and the 2,093 displayed but not searchable photos.
