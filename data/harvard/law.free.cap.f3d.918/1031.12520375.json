At the time of the incident, there was no clearly established law holding\n   that officers violate the Fourth or Fourteenth Amendment when they steal property that is seized pursuant to a warrant.

The warrant, signed by Fresno County Superior Court Judge Dale Ikeda, authorized the\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   seiz[ure] [of] all monies, negotiable instruments, securities, or things of value furnished or intended to be furnished by any person in connection to illegal gambling or money laundering that may be found on the premises ... [and] [m]onies and records of said monies derived from the sale and or control of said machines.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   If the City Officers found the property listed, they were \"to retain it in [their] custody, subject to the order of the court as provided by law.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Following the search, the City Officers gave Appellants an inventory sheet stating that they seized approximately $ 50,000 from the properties. Appellants allege, however, that the officers actually seized $ 151,380 in cash and another $ 125,000 in rare coins. Appellants claim that the City Officers stole the difference between the amount listed on the inventory sheet and the amount that was actually seized from the properties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Appellants brought suit in the Eastern District of California alleging, among other things, claims against the City Officers pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   for Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment violations.

Whether that conduct violates the Fourth Amendment's prohibition on unreasonable searches and seizures, however, is not obvious. The split in authority on the issue leads us to conclude so.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11133554\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/526/603/#p617\">\n    526 U.S. at 618\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11133554\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/526/603/#p617\">\n    119 S.Ct. 1692\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (where \"judges [ ] disagree on a constitutional question, it is unfair to subject police to money damages for picking the losing side of the controversy\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In the absence of binding authority or a consensus of persuasive authority on the issue, Appellants have failed to demonstrate that it was clearly established that the City Officers' alleged conduct violated the Fourth Amendment. Accordingly, we hold that the City Officers are protected by qualified immunity against Appellants' Fourth Amendment claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Fourteenth Amendment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Appellants' Fourteenth Amendment claim suffers the same fate. Appellants argue that the City Officers' theft of their property violated their substantive due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment. Assuming that to be true, however, the City Officers are entitled to qualified immunity because that right was not clearly established. We have not held that officers violate the substantive due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment when they steal property that is seized pursuant to a warrant. The Seventh Circuit is the only circuit that has addressed the related question of whether the government's refusal to return lawfully seized property to its owner violates the Fourteenth Amendment; it held that the substantive due process clause does not provide relief against such conduct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lee\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9123330\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/330/456/#p460\">\n    330 F.3d at 466-68\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because the City Officers could not have known that their actions violated the Fourteenth Amendment's substantive due process clause, they are entitled to qualified immunity against Appellants' Fourteenth Amendment claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   We sympathize with Appellants. They allege the theft of their personal property by police officers sworn to uphold the law. Appellants may very well have other means through which they may seek relief.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   But not all conduct that is improper or morally wrong violates the Constitution. Because Appellants did not have a clearly established Fourth or Fourteenth Amendment right to be free from the theft of property seized pursuant to a warrant, the City Officers are entitled to qualified immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    Indeed, the district court noted in its Order Granting Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment that Appellants \"had access to an adequate post-deprivation remedy under California tort law.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
