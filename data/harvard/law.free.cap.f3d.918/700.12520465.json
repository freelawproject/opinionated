The School District expelled CLM for one year. CLM sued the School District primarily\n   on First Amendment grounds, and the district court held that the expulsion was constitutional. On appeal, CLM and his parents (\"Appellants\") assert that the School District cannot constitutionally regulate student speech that the student never intended to communicate to any third party. We conclude that under the particular facts in this case, including the nature of the hit list, CLM's access to firearms, and the close proximity of CLM's home to Sherwood High, the School District did not violate any of Appellants' asserted constitutional rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On or about May 25, 2014, CLM created a \"hit list\" in his personal journal, naming 22 Sherwood High students and one former employee, and stating \"I am\n   <em>\n    God\n   </em>\n   \" and \"All These People\n   <em>\n    Must\n   </em>\n   Die.\" On September 8, 2014, soon after CLM started his junior year at Sherwood High, CLM's mother, Mrs. McNeil, discovered the journal on CLM's nightstand while cleaning CLM's room. Upon reviewing the journal's contents, Mrs. McNeil came across the hit list and additional entries containing graphic depictions of violence. Mrs. McNeil made copies of some of the journal entries, including the hit list, and sought guidance from a therapist the next day regarding her findings. The therapist, alarmed by the entries and believing they triggered her duties as a mandatory reporter, informed the Sherwood Police Department (\"Sherwood Police\") about the list. The therapist told Mrs. McNeil to call a local crisis hotline, which she did. The hotline's social worker also contacted the Sherwood Police about CLM's list.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Later that day, the Sherwood Police searched the McNeils' residence. Officers found and confiscated several weapons, including a .22 caliber rifle and 525 rounds of ammunition belonging to CLM, but the officers found nothing \"to indicate any planning had gone into following through with the hit list.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Shortly after the search, CLM and his parents voluntarily went to the police station, where they provided the police with a copy of CLM's hit list. After being read his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings, CLM admitted he created the hit list and that \"sometimes he thinks killing people might relieve some of the stress he feels,\" but he also stated \"he uses the journal to vent\" and that \"he would never carry out\" such thoughts. CLM claimed he created the list about four months prior to its discovery. The Sherwood Police determined that no criminal charges would be brought against CLM at that time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Meanwhile, the Sherwood Police informed the School District of CLM's hit list, of the fact the police had seized guns from his house, and that CLM's journal contained additional entries that graphically depicted school violence. Sherwood High's principal, Ken Bell, was aware that the McNeils lived \"very close\" to Sherwood High and assembled an administrative team to address the issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Consistent with the notification requirements of Oregon Revised Statutes \u00a7 339.327(1), the School District's policies required school faculty to notify the parents of students found on a hit list within 12 hours of discovery. Within the 12-hour span, Bell's team made the necessary calls, which did not identify CLM as the hit list's author. Before the final call was made, the media began contacting the School District to inquire about the list. The School District also learned that CLM's picture had been posted on social media accounts. Upon realization of the widespread knowledge regarding CLM's hit list, Bell's team sent out a recorded voice message to all parents of students in the School District to notify them of the issue. The message\n   stated that a student of Sherwood High had authored a hit list containing 23 names, but that the list contained no specific threats and the home in which the student resided was safe. The School District also issued a press release containing similar information. Thereafter, Sherwood High received numerous calls and emails from parents, media outlets, and the public requesting information about the hit list, CLM's identity, and whether CLM posed a threat to others. Some parents demanded to meet with Bell, and other parents had their children leave school early, miss several days, or transfer out of the district. A student was caught on campus with a knife, and he alleged \"he needed it to protect himself in light of the hit list.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The School District suspended CLM pending an expulsion hearing. Bell recommended that CLM be expelled from Sherwood High for one year because news of his hit list \"significantly disrupted the learning environment at school,\" which would only be increased by CLM's return. Sherwood High's associate principal wrote a letter to the McNeils stating that he recommended that CLM be expelled for one year for making \"a threat of violence\" that \"has caused a distinct and substantial disruption to the school environment.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On September 22, 2014, an expulsion hearing was held before Pete Miller, a hearings officer for the School District. CLM was represented by an attorney at the hearing. Upon review of the testimony and evidence, Miller adopted the principal's recommendation for expulsion, largely based on \"the significant disruption\" CLM's list caused in the school environment. After the hearing, the School District's associate superintendent sent a decision letter to the McNeils, explaining that the list constituted \"a threat of violence in violation of the Student Code of Conduct.\" The letter explained that CLM could not return to school that academic year, and that the McNeils had the right to appeal the decision to the School District's board. The McNeils did not appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Following his expulsion, CLM received alternative forms of education through the School District, including online courses, in-person tutoring, and courses at a community college. However, CLM had \"no immediate or even daily access to instructors,\" and the tutors were \"inconsistent and not dependable,\" as they missed appointments and in one instance failed to follow up for weeks. CLM ultimately had to retake several classes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In June 2015, CLM and the McNeils filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon seeking damages and other relief under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . CLM sought damages for the School District's alleged violations of the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment and of the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The McNeils also brought a substantive due process challenge to CLM's expulsion. The complaint sought expungement of any documentation or reference to CLM's suspension, expulsion, and the circumstances surrounding the disciplinary proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The School District moved for summary judgment on all claims, while CLM and the McNeils moved for summary judgment on their free speech claim and substantive due process claim, respectively. The district court concluded that the School District could regulate CLM's off-campus speech for three primary reasons: (1) the\n   hit list had a sufficient connection to Sherwood High; (2) school officials could have reasonably foreseen that the effects of the hit list would spill over into the school environment; and (3) the facts in CLM's case mirrored those in\n   <em>\n    Wynar v. Douglas County School District\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3697987\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/728/1062/\">\n    728 F.3d 1062\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9th Cir. 2013). The district court further held that the one-year expulsion did not violate CLM's First Amendment rights, reasoning that a student-authored hit list would cause a substantial disruption in any school community, particularly in light of Oregon's statutory notification requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The district court also granted the School District summary judgment on the McNeils' substantive due process claim. The district court reasoned that the claim failed because it was derivative of CLM's First Amendment claim and because a school has the authority to discipline students on reasonable grounds. The district court determined that although the McNeils had a liberty interest in an \"initial 'educational venue choice,' \" their interest did not extend to temporary school discipline within that venue, which is an issue \"generally committed to the control of the state and local authorities.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Appellants timely appealed. On appeal, CLM claims that the School District lacked authority under the First Amendment to discipline CLM for his hit list. The McNeils also allege that the School District's expulsion of CLM violated their substantive due process right \"to be free from state interference with their choice of [CLM's] educational forum.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   We review \"the district court's grant of summary judgment\n   <em>\n    de novo.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Szajer v.

Additionally, although they enjoy greater freedom to speak when they are off campus than when they are on campus, their off-campus speech is not necessarily beyond the reach of a school district's regulatory authority. Our review of the School District's treatment of CLM turns on two inquiries: (1) whether the School District could permissibly regulate CLM's off-campus\n   speech at all; and if so, (2) whether the School District's decision to expel CLM violated the First Amendment standard for school regulation of speech set out in\n   <em>\n    Tinker\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    C.R. v.

There, the drawing was two years old, highly fantastical, unspecific, and unaccompanied by other indicia of a violent intent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9171660\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/393/608/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9171660\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/393/608/\">\n    at 611\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . There was no evidence Adam had ever had the capacity to carry out the actions depicted in the drawing. In contrast to this case, it was unlikely that any reasonable administrator could have believed the school faced a credible safety threat.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Taken as a whole, the three considerations that guide application of the nexus test support the School District here. First, it was reasonable for School District officials to conclude that CLM presented a credible threat of severe harm to the school community. This consideration establishes a sufficient nexus between the speech and the school to permit regulation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wynar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3697987\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/728/1062/\">\n    728 F.3d at 1069\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Second, once it learned of the hit list, the School District could reasonably foresee that news of the threat would reach and impact the school and disrupt the school environment. Oregon's notification requirement, Oregon Revised Statutes \u00a7 339.327(1), provides that \"[a] superintendent of a school district ... who has reasonable cause to believe that a person, while in a school, is or has been in possession of a list that threatens harm to other persons\" must notify the \"parent or guardian of any student whose name appears on the list as a target of the harm.\" The statute applies to enrolled students who are or\n   <em>\n    have been\n   </em>\n   in possession of a threatening list, regardless of whether the list is on or off school property. It was reasonably foreseeable that parents, once notified as required by Oregon law, would inform their children about the hit list. It was also reasonably foreseeable that information about the hit list would cause students to be fearful for their safety. Invariably, these resulting consequences would create\n   classroom distractions and substantial disruptions within the Sherwood High community. Although it was not foreseeable\n   <em>\n    to CLM\n   </em>\n   that his speech would reach the school, a lack of intent to share speech is of minimal weight when, as here, the speech contains a credible threat of violence directed at the school. Someone planning a violent act does not need to advertise it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Third, the content of the speech involved the school. As we noted in\n   <em>\n    Wynar\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    C.R.\n   </em>\n   , when all involved parties are students, that fact \"typically counsels in favor of finding that a student's speech was susceptible to discipline.\"\n   <em>\n    C.R.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4353784\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/835/1142/#p1148\">\n    835 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1150 (citing\n   <em>\n    Wynar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3697987\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/728/1062/\">\n    728 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1069 ). Here, CLM's hit list contained the names of 22 students and one former teacher of the School District, and thus, presented a particular threat to the school community. Ordinarily, schools may not discipline students for the contents of their private, off-campus diary entries, any more than they can punish students for their private thoughts, but schools have a right, indeed an obligation, to address a credible threat of violence involving the school community.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In sum, we conclude that the School District could regulate CLM's off-campus speech without violating his First Amendment rights. Although CLM may not have foreseen his speech reaching Sherwood High, the School District, when informed of CLM's hit list, reasonably determined that it faced a credible, identifiable threat of school violence. The speech bore a sufficient nexus to the school. Accordingly, the School District could take disciplinary action consistent with\n   <em>\n    Tinker\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    The School District's expulsion of CLM\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Although some disciplinary action was permissible, there remains the issue of whether the School District's expulsion was consistent with the First Amendment. \"Under\n   <em>\n    Tinker\n   </em>\n   , schools may restrict speech that 'might reasonably [lead] school authorities to forecast substantial disruption of or material interference with school activities' or that collides 'with the rights of other students to be secure and to be let alone.' \"\n   <em>\n    Wynar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3697987\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/728/1062/\">\n    728 F.3d at 1070\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (alteration in original) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Tinker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11318417\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/393/503/#p506\">\n    393 U.S. at 508, 514\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11318417\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/393/503/#p506\">\n    89 S.Ct. 733\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).

As discussed, CLM's hit list identifying specific individuals constituted a credible threat of school violence that required the School District to act in furtherance of the safety of its students. Oregon's statutory notification requirement further confirms this proposition, as the School District could reasonably foresee that informing parents that their children were identified on a student-authored hit list would cause a substantial disruption within the Sherwood High community. Moreover, CLM's hit list led to a material disruption at Sherwood High by causing safety concerns among both students and parents. The record evinces this disruption by the outcry from parents who demanded to speak with Sherwood High authorities and by the parents\n   who transferred or threatened to transfer their child out of the School District. Thus, in light of the nature of CLM's hit list and the widespread knowledge regarding the list in the Sherwood High community, it was reasonable for School District officials to forecast that CLM's presence at the school would cause a substantial disruption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Moreover, CLM's hit list also invaded the \"rights of other students to be secure and to be let alone.\"\n   <em>\n    Tinker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11318417\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/393/503/#p506\">\n    393 U.S. at 508\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11318417\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/393/503/#p506\">\n    89 S.Ct. 733\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

We thus are not called upon to determine whether a one-year expulsion was excessive. At a certain point, discipline may lose its basis in reasonable, ongoing concerns of campus safety, disruption, or interference with the rights of other students, and instead become primarily a punitive, retrospective response to the student's speech. Such discipline would be in conflict with\n   <em>\n    Tinker\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    LaVine\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11087224\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/257/981/#p987\">\n    257 F.3d at 991-92\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Although a student's expectation as to the circulation of his speech may be relevant to an evaluation of whether the speech constitutes a credible threat, the student's intent as to circulation does not condition the school's regulation of threatening off-campus speech. As we noted in\n   <em>\n    Wynar\n   </em>\n   , \"[w]e can only imagine what would have happened if the school officials, after learning of [the] writing, did nothing about it,\" and CLM did in fact come to Sherwood High with a firearm and the intent to carry out his hit list.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3697987\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/728/1062/\">\n    728 F.3d at 1070\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (alterations in original) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Boim v.

A student's lack of intent to convey his off-campus speech to any third party is relevant to an evaluation of whether the speech constitutes a credible threat, but is not dispositive. Rather, a court must consider all the relevant factual circumstances when determining whether a school's regulation of a student's off-campus speech is constitutional.
