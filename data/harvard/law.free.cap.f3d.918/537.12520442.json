Code \u00a7 35-46-5-1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .5(d). A federal district court held\n   that several terms in this statute are unconstitutionally vague and that it must be treated as if it read: \"A person who intentionally sells fetal tissue commits unlawful transfer of fetal tissue, a Level 5 felony.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523330\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/289/905/#p934\">\n    289 F.Supp.3d 905\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 934-35 (S.D. Ind. 2018). The district court also held that a definitional clause is invalid. As enacted, \u00a7 35-46-5-1.5(b) reads: \"As used in this section, 'fetal tissue' includes tissue, organs, or any other part of an aborted fetus.\" This must be treated as if it read: \"As used in this section, 'fetal tissue' includes tissue or organs of an aborted fetus.\" The district court thus held that the words \"acquires\", \"receives\", and \"transfers\", and the phrase \"any other part\", are too uncertain to have legal force. If that is right, then big chunks of the legal system are invalid, because those words are ubiquitous in statutes, regulations, and judicial opinions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This case began when Indiana University and three of its faculty members filed this suit, under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , against the state's prosecuting attorneys in two counties. They asked the district court to enjoin the prosecutors from attempting to enforce any part of \u00a7 35-46-5-1.5. According to the plaintiffs, the statute not only is excessively vague but also violates the First Amendment by blocking one kind of medical research, takes the University's property without just compensation, violates the Equal Protection Clause by distinguishing fetal tissue produced by abortions from that produced by miscarriages, and violates the dormant Commerce Clause by regulating the interstate market in fetal tissue. Plaintiffs do not contend that the statute imposes an undue burden on any woman who seeks to have an abortion, nor would they have standing to make such an argument. Instead the three faculty-member plaintiffs contend that the statute interferes with medical scholarship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   As we have recounted, the district court found four words or phrases to be unconstitutionally vague. It rejected plaintiffs' theories under the First Amendment and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. And it did not come to a conclusion with respect to the Takings Clause or the Commerce Clause, reasoning that because it could not determine what the statute means, it could not properly analyze it under either of those provisions. It then entered a permanent injunction in plaintiffs' favor and closed the case. Both sides have appealed. Plaintiffs want the whole statute enjoined, while defendants want the injunction vacated and the suit dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Justiciability is an initial problem. Indiana University, which is part of the State of Indiana, see\n   <em>\n    Haynes v. Indiana University\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518472\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/902/724/#p731\">\n    902 F.3d 724\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 731 (7th Cir. 2018), has sued two prosecutors who carry out state powers. The two defendants have been sued in their official capacities, which means that they must be treated as the State of Indiana.\n   <em>\n    Will v. Michigan Department of State Police\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6210401\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/491/58/\">\n    491 U.S. 58\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6210401\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/491/58/\">\n    109 S.Ct. 2304\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6210401\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/491/58/\">\n    105 L.Ed.2d 45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1989). There is considerable doubt that federal courts are authorized to adjust grievances among different parts of a state government. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Illinois v.

The suit is saved, however, by the fact that three faculty members are plaintiffs. All three have standing to litigate in their personal capacities, and with one exception (to which we return) they present all of the complaint's legal theories.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   We start with vagueness, the Due Process Clause theory on which the district court based its injunction, and then address the other four theories.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Constitution requires criminal statutes to have a core of understandable meaning. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Johnson v. United States\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    135 S.Ct. 2551\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    192 L.Ed.2d 569\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015) ;\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Some uncertainty at the margins does not condemn a statute. It is therefore hard to see what can be wrong with words such as \"acquires,\" which people use and understand in normal life. A person \"acquires\" a car by buying it or leasing it or receiving it as a gift from a parent or spouse-or by stealing it. Even a protean word such as \"reasonable\" has enough of a core to allow its use in situations where rights to speak are at issue. See\n   <em>\n    Thomas v. Chicago Park District\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9108214\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/534/316/#p324\">\n    534 U.S. 316\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 324,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9108214\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/534/316/#p324\">\n    122 S.Ct. 775\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9108214\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/534/316/#p324\">\n    151 L.Ed.2d 783\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2002). Words such as \"acquire\" are materially (another protean legal word) more definite than \"reasonable.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   shows that uncertainty so pervasive that most of a law's potential applications are impossible to evaluate may rule out enforcement. But the district court did not deny that each of the words \"acquires\", \"receives\", and \"transfers\", and the phrase \"any other part\", has a substantial, understandable core. Instead the judge worried about the periphery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Take \"transfers.\" The judge thought it hard to know whether a medical researcher \"transfers\" fetal material by passing a pipette containing fetal tissue to someone else at the same laboratory bench.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523330\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/289/905/#p934\">\n    289 F.Supp.3d at 920\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Or take the phrase \"any other part.\" Although this ensures that the statute covers\n   <em>\n    every\n   </em>\n   part of a fetus, the judge thought it hard to say how things work at the level of individual cells or strands of DNA. Suppose someone in Washington state (from which much of Indiana University's fetal tissue comes) extracts a few cells from an aborted fetus and uses them to create a line of stem-cell tissue, exemplars of which (dozens of generations later) are transferred to a researcher in Indiana. Is anything\n   <em>\n    derived from\n   </em>\n   fetal tissue included in the phrase \"any other part\"? The judge did not see a clear answer.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 918-19. These and similar open questions led the judge to deem the words and phrase unconstitutional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The two prosecutors did not help their defense by professing to see answers to these and similar questions. They assured the judge that\n   <em>\n    of course\n   </em>\n   stem cells derived from fetal tissue are not \"any other part\" of a fetus. They asserted that moving a pipette across a lab bench is\n   <em>\n    of course\n   </em>\n   not a \"transfer\" of fetal tissue, because \"transfer\" means \"convey ownership.\" That's implausible. Federal statutes forbid the transfer of heroin and other contraband, see, e.g.,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1), and judges implementing such laws do not condition their application on a change of ownership; those laws apply to people who act as agents as well as to principals. The prosecutors also asserted that placental or umbilical cord tissue is\n   <em>\n    of course\n   </em>\n   not \"any other part\" of a fetus. Maybe: The placenta is an independent organ and so may be outside the statutory scope, but the statute does not address the topic. Prosecutors can't offer definitive interpretations of criminal laws, and one prosecutor can't bind a successor in office. More: Indiana has 90 other counties, whose prosecutors may have different ideas about the statute's scope. The district judge was right to say that, if the prosecutors' assurances are all the plaintiffs have to go on, they are at needless risk.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Yet although prosecutorial assurances should not set anyone's mind at rest, the legal system offers a way to work out the uncertainties that lurk at every statute's periphery: the judiciary. Resolving edge questions is a principal role of the courts. If the district court's approach is correct, then every time a court needs to decide a tough question about just how far a statute reaches, it should declare the law unconstitutional. That is fundamentally inconsistent with the Supreme Court's approach, under which a core of meaning is enough to reject a vagueness challenge, leaving to future adjudication the inevitable questions at the statutory margin.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   A federal district judge cannot definitively interpret\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2035-46-5-1\">\n    Ind. Code \u00a7 35-46-5-1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .5, but the state judiciary can do so. Declaratory judgments are available in Indiana under Ind. Trial Rule 57 and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2034-14-1-1\">\n    Ind. Code \u00a7 34-14-1-1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Any medical researcher can file a suit with the theme: \"I want to do X and fear that I will be prosecuted, so please give me a declaratory judgment that X is lawful.\" Yet none of the plaintiffs has filed such a suit seeking assurances about the scope of \u00a7 35-46-5-1.5. Instead of using a readily available state-law remedy for unwelcome risk, they asked a federal court to blot the law from the books. That's not how uncertainty should be addressed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   We have held this already about uncertainty under Indiana law. Indiana forbids judges, and candidates for judicial office, from making any public commitment \"inconsistent with the impartial performance of the adjudicative duties of judicial office\". The scope for debate about the meaning of that clause puts to shame any uncertainty about the meaning of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2035-46-5-1\">\n    Ind. Code \u00a7 35-46-5-1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .5, but we held the language valid, even when rights to speak are at stake-not because it is clear, but because the state offers a process to resolve debatable issues.\n   <em>\n    Bauer v.

The National Labor Relations Act is full of vague terms [such as \"unfair labor practice\"], and the National Labor Relations Board has yet to make all of them concrete, but no one supposes that the whole Act could be chucked out. The Justices have been chary of holding laws unconstitutional \"on their face\" precisely because they have recognized that vagueness will be reduced through a process of interpretation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   This is equally true of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2035-46-5-1\">\n    Ind.

The Justices declared a statute unconstitutionally vague only after this process of interpretation had been used for more than 20 years without curtailing uncertainty. For Indiana's fetal-tissue statute, by contrast, the process has not even begun.

Indiana's statute may or may not be sensible-for even persons who find abortion immoral must recognize that neurological research using fetal tissue can save innocent lives-but choosing sides in an ethical debate does not condemn a law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The First Amendment argument is a non-starter. The statute regulates conduct, not speech. See\n   <em>\n    Clark v.

True, plaintiffs want to use fetal tissue in research that could lead to speech, in classrooms or research papers. But a desire to obtain an\n   <em>\n    input\n   </em>\n   into speech does not convert regulation of conduct into regulation of speech. Surely plaintiffs do not think that researchers at Indiana University are entitled to blow up a commercial airliner, or administer dangerous pathogens to patients in the University's hospital, just so that they can observe the results and write down their findings. Nor do plaintiffs think that they are entitled to steal pens, paper, and computers from the local Office Depot so that they can write articles at lower cost. Plaintiffs assert that the statute casts \"a pall of orthodoxy over the classroom\", but it does not. They can say, write, and teach anything they want. They can refer to results generated by work done on aborted fetal tissue in other states and nations. But they cannot treat enforcement of rules about conduct as equivalent to prohibitions of speech.

None of the three individual plaintiffs contends that he has any property interest in particular fetal tissue, so nothing has been taken from any of them. The statute does render valueless any fetal tissue, derived from abortions, owned by Indiana University. But as we observed\n   earlier, the University, as part of Indiana, is not entitled to sue its own state. Indiana's legislature is free to decide what use (including none) to make of Indiana's property. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Great Lakes Higher Education Corp. v.

The Indiana law making it a felony to acquire, receive, sell, or transfer the \"tissue, organs, or any other part of an aborted fetus\" is unconstitutionally vague. As explained below, some unusual features of this law and this lawsuit lead me to that conclusion: both the State's lawyers and the authoring legislators have tried to run away from the apparent meaning of the statutory language. As a result, it's clear that the law does not give fair notice of its scope, and it effectively abandons the proper separation of powers by delegating critical policy decisions to prosecutors and judges. I agree with my colleagues, however, that plaintiffs cannot prevail on their First Amendment, Equal Protection, and Commerce Clause challenges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The unusual features of this law, its enactment, and this lawsuit mean that the district judge's reasoning does not actually threaten to invalidate \"big chunks of the legal system.\" It was not the district judge who found it hard to know what \"transfer\" means in this statute, nor was the problem that the judge \"did not see a clear answer\" as to what is meant by \"any other part.\" See ante at 540-41. If the district judge erred, it was in taking the State of Indiana at its word that the statutory text does not mean what it seems to say. The subject of this litigation is not handwringing about the \"periphery\" of the new law. The majority's hypothesized \"core of understandable meaning\"-the transfer or acquisition of fetal organs-addresses a factual scenario that is not and was not actually happening. The new law is relevant only to practices as to which its application seems, based on the State's defense, unforeseen and indeterminate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   This case fits comfortably within the majority's description of what\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

Instead of affirming, however, the majority proposes a novel variation on\n   <em>\n    Pullman\n   </em>\n   abstention in which the federal courts direct plaintiffs who reasonably fear prosecution under a vague law to file a series of declaratory judgment cases in the state courts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Plaintiffs should not have to take such extraordinary measures to determine the scope of a criminal law.

That does not mean that the correct application of even a criminal law must be free from doubt in all cases. There will often be,\n   perhaps will always be, a periphery where there is room for disagreement and interpretation. That possibility does not mean that a law is void for vagueness, particularly as applied to the core of matters clearly covered by the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Still, there are limits.

They use tissue from aborted fetuses and derivatives from such tissue, including cells cultured in laboratories from fetal cells, as well as DNA, RNA, proteins and other molecules and sub-cellular structures obtained from such cells. The evidence in this record establishes that fetal brain tissue-or at least cells and complex molecules derived from such tissue-is essential to research on possible cures and treatments. There is no adequate substitute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Since 2011, Dr. Lahiri has received about 25 shipments of fetal tissue from the Birth Defects Research Laboratory at the University of Washington, which receives tissue from abortions performed lawfully in the State of Washington. The record here shows that the nationally recognized laboratory adheres to strict federal and state regulations for receiving donated fetal tissue and providing the tissue for research, including ensuring (1) that all women donating fetal tissue have given informed consent, and (2) that the laboratory does not sell or profit from providing fetal material. Dkt. 77-20 at 1-3 (BDRL affidavit), The shipments do not include any intact organs but only tiny tissue samples. Each shipment includes tissue contained within approximately two teaspoons of liquid medium.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Even if one could say confidently that the Birth Defects Research Laboratory material is \"fetal tissue\" for purposes of the statute (and I am not so confident), it becomes even less clear once Dr. Lahiri works with the material. One critical step in research with these tiny samples of tissues is to \"dissociate\" and culture them-i.e., to separate the cells from each other and to place them in a laboratory dish with conditions and nutrients that allow the cells to grow, divide, and redivide, thus multiplying the material available for research.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Also relevant here, medical research is collaborative, both within Indiana University and with the NIH and other institutions. To be valuable, research must be replicable. That requires cooperation and collaboration among researchers. Dr. Lahiri and his colleagues are requested and expected to transfer tissue samples between laboratories in the course of that collaboration. Such collaboration is also, understandably, a condition of their NIH funding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <em>\n    The Statutory Language, This Lawsuit, and the Legislative Process\n   </em>\n   : The Indiana law poses serious vagueness problems in terms of what counts as \"fetal tissue,\" what researchers may do with fetal tissue, and whether the law even applies to fetal tissue that is not actually sold. Some of the problems are apparent from the statutory text itself. Others have emerged in this lawsuit and examination of the legislative process that led to enactment of the law in 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The statute says: \"A person who intentionally acquires, receives, sells, or transfers fetal tissue commits unlawful transfer of fetal tissue, a Level 5 felony.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2035-46-5-1\">\n    Ind. Code \u00a7 35-46-5-1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .5(d). A key definition provides: \"As used in this section, 'fetal tissue' includes tissue, organs, or any other part of an aborted fetus.\" \u00a7 1.5(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The sharpest dispute between the parties is the scope of the \"any other part\" phrase in the definition of fetal tissue. Let's assume the statute makes criminal the receipt of shipments of fetal tissue like those plaintiffs received in the past from\n   the birth defects laboratory in Washington.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   That raises the question whether the \"any part of\" definition in the Indiana law extends to make criminal the receipt of lines of cells\n   <em>\n    derived from\n   </em>\n   fetal tissue. The parties agree here that, as a matter of biology, the process of cell division produces a culture that contains some cells remaining from the original tissue. The new culture also contains other, newly-divided cells that were not part of the original tissue, but which may well contain complex molecules (such as DNA, RNA, or proteins) that were present in the original tissue sample. See Prosecutors' Br. at 10; Plaintiffs' Br. at 40. So, to rephrase the key question, does a second-, third-, tenth-, or nth-generation cell with such molecules fall under the statutory definition as \"any other part\" of an aborted fetus?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   That question is not at the periphery of this statute but at its core. The statutory language, \"any other part,\" offers no guidance. It does not signal that the legislature even recognized this critical issue. And as the law has been defended in this lawsuit, the problem has actually become even more severe. In the district court, the State took the position that \"any other part\" does not apply to:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   (a) placental or umbilical cord blood tissue or cells, or biological material obtained from such blood, tissue or cells;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   (b) fetal cell lines including but not limited to HEK293 (or biological material obtained from such cell lines) derived from the cells of an aborted fetus, but which do not contain cells which were originally part of an aborted fetus;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   (c) fetal cells (or biological material obtained from such cells) which were derived from aborted fetal cells, but are not cells which were originally part of an aborted fetus.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Dkt. 75 at 2.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Later in the district court proceedings, the State asserted that once cells have been separated from the fetal tissue and grow, divide into new cells, and are moved from the first dish to the second dish, they can no longer be considered part of the aborted fetus. Dkt. 81 at 48. Or, the State suggests, that separation may occur even earlier in the process of culturing cells, even before the first passage, when cells are dissociated.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 48.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Those limits imply that the Indiana law would not interfere with plaintiffs' research as long as the laboratory in Washington or some other lab outside of Indiana could perform the first round of cell growth and division. If the cultures of cells would not count as \"fetal tissue\" under the Indiana law, plaintiffs would be free to obtain and use them for research.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The vagueness problem stems from the fact that it's impossible to know what weight to give the State's assurances. The proposed limits might well be sensible as a matter of policy. But as the district judge pointed out, these proposed limits have no apparent basis in the statutory text, and the State has not explained how it derives those supposedly comforting limits from the Indiana law. The State's lawyers asserted in oral argument that their assurances would be binding on the State and its present and future prosecuting attorneys. That remains to be seen.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Another focus of the vagueness challenge is the key verbs in the statute. If you have \"fetal tissue\" within the meaning of the statute, what can you do with it? A person who intentionally \"acquires, receives, sells, or transfers fetal tissue\" commits a felony. \u00a7 1.5(d). Federal law, however, already makes it a federal crime to sell fetal tissue for \"valuable consideration,\" regardless of source, see 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 289g-2(a), so \"sell\" is not at issue here.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The focus is on \"acquire,\" \"receive,\" and \"transfer.\" My colleagues correctly point out that these are common, well-understood terms in criminal law. But when plaintiffs challenged the new law, the State took the following position:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   The word 'transfer' in Section 1.5(b) of the Statute does not apply to physical movement of cells or biological materials received, generated or stored at Indiana University before the enactment of the Statute provided that:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   (a) the physical movement is within or among laboratories, buildings or physical facilities of Indiana University by any faculty member, employee, representative or agent of Indiana University;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   (b) the physical movement is the result of a faculty member, employee, representative or agent of Indiana University permanently removing such materials from Indiana University's buildings or physical facilities; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   (c) the physical movement is at the request of the National Institute of Health ('NIH') or pursuant to the terms or conditions of any NIH grant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Dkt. 75 at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The State further explained that there will be no \"transfer\" if there is no change in ownership or possession of the tissue, referring apparently to possession by Indiana University as an institution, not possession being transferred from one human being to another inside a university laboratory. Dkt. 90 at 16. The apparent concession that plaintiffs can move fetal tissue around at the request of the NIH or to comply with a grant sounds reasonable, but where does that come from?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   As with the proposed limits on \"fetal tissue\" itself, there is no apparent textual basis for these limits. These proposed limits are also inconsistent with the way the law regulates transfer and possession of so many other forms of contraband, such as illegal drug, firearms, and other weapons. If one person cooks crack cocaine in a kitchen and hands a pot of the drug to a confederate at the kitchen table, federal criminal law would say there was a transfer of possession, regardless of the ownership of the drug. The same problems are inherent in the State's approach to \"acquire\" and \"receive,\" proposing limits that have no apparent textual or other legal bases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   These attempts to defend the law by limiting it in these ways only add to the mystery of its meaning. One is left to wonder why the State proposes them. Members of this court repeatedly asked the State's lawyers to explain why they felt\n   these implausible limitations were needed. No answer was forthcoming.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   As best I can tell, the State's lawyers seem to be trying to prevent the new law from having effects that would flow naturally from the statutory language but that seem not to be sensible from a practical or policy perspective. Implicit in the effort is the concession that, as drafted, the operative portions of \u00a7 1.5 will have undesired and unintended effects that will interfere with important and legitimate medical research.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   In other words, the State's lawyers seem to be trying to save the legislature from itself. The majority nonetheless defends the potentially extreme outcome of this statute, noting that there is \"serious debate about when, if at all, it is ethical to perform medical experiments on aborted fetal tissue.\" Ante at 543. Thus, regardless of whether the statute is \"sensible,\" the fact that the Indiana legislature \"cho[se] sides in an ethical debate does not condemn [the] law.\" Ante at 543. Unfortunately, the majority describes a legislative process regarding this statutory provision that did not actually happen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The available evidence from the Indiana legislature indicates that it adopted this criminal provision on fetal tissue research without realizing it would have any impact on medical research using fetal tissue, let alone shut down this research on Alzheimer's disease. The legislature simply did not engage with the hard policy choices and the natural consequences of its language. The result was to distill here both concerns at the center of vagueness doctrine, the fair notice and separation of powers so critical to liberty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Section 1.5 was adopted as part of a broader bill, House Enrolled Act No. 1337, that imposed a variety of restrictions on abortions and related issues. The primary focal points of this bill have already been considered by this court. See\n   <em>\n    Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky, Inc. v. Comm'r of Indiana State Dep't of Health\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516680\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/888/300/\">\n    888 F.3d 300\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (7th Cir. 2018) (holding unconstitutional provisions prohibiting women from terminating pregnancies due to fetal genetic abnormalities, race, or gender and requiring burial or cremation of embryonic or fetal tissue), petition for cert. filed (U.S. Oct. 12, 2018) (No. 18-483);\n   <em>\n    Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky, Inc. v.

The only substantive discussion of the provision I could find in the legislative history came in seven minutes of a meeting of the Indiana Senate's Health &amp; Provider Services Committee. The discussion shows not a policy choice on an important issue but instead a startling disconnect between the statutory language and the stated intentions of the\n   legislators. One of the bill's sponsors, Senator Holdman, said that the provision \"has to do with the selling of fetal tissue. Which makes it illegal in the state of Indiana to sell fetal tissue, which basically addresses the issue we've seen around the country with Planned Parenthood and some of the things that have been going on there.\" Hearing, Indiana Senate Health and Provider Services Committee at 18:26-18:45 (Feb. 24, 2016), http://iga.in.gov/information/archives/2016/video/commit-tee_health_and_provider_services_3900/.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Senator Stoops asked Senator Holdman a series of questions about whether parents of an aborted fetus could consent to an autopsy or other research use of the tissue.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21:39-22:14. Senator Holdman said that would be possible, prompting this follow-up:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   S. Stoops: Right, that is a specific autopsy. But what if the parents want to donate the fetus for research into the condition? I guess that would not be allowed. I mean an autopsy to determine maybe a genetic defect after the abortion is one thing. But I think actually allowing the fetal tissue to be used for research purposes seems to be outlawed in this bill.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   S. Holdman:\n   <em>\n    Well, I wouldn't say that it\n   </em>\n   [research with fetal tissue]\n   <em>\n    is outlawed\n   </em>\n   . I think the word autopsy encompasses that research portion of what is done with that piece of tissue that is diagnosed after the fact through an autopsy. So maybe it is just a matter of semantics, here, perhaps Senator Stoop. But autopsy is the word that we landed on.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   S. Miller (Committee Chair): And just if I could elaborate, I was a part of those conversations. This is up to a parent to request the autopsy. And I think at the time the parent requests the autopsy, they could list the kind of things they are looking for. And what kind of results they want as part of that investigation. So I think for the purposes that we put in the bill, that this covers it, Senator Stoops. At least I'm comfortable with that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   S. Holdman: That's right. And to your point, Madame Chair, in any case the parent has to consent to this procedure being done. It is not going to be done just because the physician or the hospital may want to have that done. It has to be consented to by the parent itself.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   S. Stoops: Right. So on page 15, line 9, where it says: 'A person who intentionally acquires, or sells, etc. or transfers fetal tissue, commits unlawful transfer of fetal tissue and is a Level 5 felony.' So, is that if that person did not get permission from the parent?\n   <em>\n    So otherwise if the parent gave permission, then that does not apply?\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   S. Holdman:\n   <em>\n    That would be my understanding, yes.\n   </em>\n   I thought you were going to ask me what a Level 5 Felony outcome was. And we have the Criminal Courts Chair here who could answer that question for you, as well.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23:17-25:43\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   That exchange is remarkable, particularly because of the role of the pregnant\n   woman's consent for the research. Federal law already made clear that fetal tissue could not be used for any research purposes without the consent of the pregnant woman. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 289g-1(b). The evidence here shows that the birth defect laboratory in Washington always obtains the woman's consent to use tissue for research. And when called upon to explain \u00a7 1.5 to their colleagues, the sponsors said (a) that it would apply only to\n   <em>\n    sale\n   </em>\n   of fetal tissue in Indiana, and (b) that the consent of the pregnant woman for research use would amount to a complete defense to the criminal restrictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Now, I am fully aware that legislatures are not required to produce legislative history. They are not required to explain or discuss the language they enact. Courts generally presume that all legislators have read and understood the bills they vote upon. As we try to be faithful agents of the lawmakers, we thus apply the ordinary meaning of the statutory language. After all, as the majority points out, one can have a \"serious debate about when, if at all, it is ethical to perform medical experiments on aborted fetal tissue,\" ultimately \"choosing sides.\" Ante at ----.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   In this instance, however, there was no such debate. Instead, the law's defenders have backed away from those ordinary meanings at every opportunity, first in the legislative process and then in the lawsuit. This highly unusual record ought to raise warning flags for us. The statute is fatally vague because its supporters did not pay enough attention to render it intelligible as applied to this medical research, which is the relevant core, not the periphery, of this statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Consider this warning: \"Under the Constitution, the adoption of new laws restricting liberty is supposed to be a hard business, the product of an open and public debate among a large and diverse number of elected representatives. Allowing the legislature to hand off the job of lawmaking risks substituting this design for one where legislation is made easy, with a mere handful of unelected judges and prosecutors free to 'condem[n] all that [they] personally disapprove and for no better reason than [they] disapprove it.' \"\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   , 138 S.Ct. at 1228 (Gorsuch, J., concurring), quoting\n   <em>\n    Jordan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1148002\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/341/223/#p242\">\n    341 U.S. at 242\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1148002\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/341/223/#p242\">\n    71 S.Ct. 703\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Jackson, J., dissenting).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   What happened here was just such a \"hand-off\" of lawmaking power. It highlights why the majority's solution here, abstaining and leaving the statute-\n   <em>\n    writing\n   </em>\n   task to the state courts, is not an appropriate response. The majority proposes that Indiana state courts should be permitted a decade or two to resolve \"edge questions.\" like the \"concrete disputes such as the coverage of cells derived from fetal tissue.\" Ante at 541-42 &amp; 541.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   For example, will state courts decide that \"placental or umbilical cord tissue\" counts as \"any other part of a fetus\"? Maybe, the majority says. On one hand, the majority muses, \"[t]he placenta is an independent organ and so may be outside the statutory scope, but the statute does not address the topic.\" Ante at 540. On the other hand, however, Indiana permits the purchase or sale of fetal material for \"fetal stem cell\" research if \"the biological parent has given written consent for the use of the fetal stem cells,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2035-46-5-3\">\n    Ind.

Although that provision is limited to commercial transactions, which \u00a7 1.5 is not, perhaps that definition will support the criminalization of the non-commercial acquisition and transfer of\n   abortion-derived umbilical and placental cell. Plaintiffs apparently will just have to wait and see how the Indiana state courts will write that part of the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The majority bases its preference for a state-court iterative process on\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , in which the Supreme Court declared the statute at issue vague only after struggling with it for 20 years, while here \"the process has not even begun.\" Ante at 542. But that was not the real lesson of\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , even though the Court acknowledged that \"persistent efforts\" by courts to establish a meaningful standard for a statute can be one source of \"evidence of vagueness.\"\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    135 S.Ct. 2551\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2558 (2015), quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The bracketed \"[a]\" in the majority's quotation, however, stands in for\n   <em>\n    Bauer's\n   </em>\n   actual language: \"an administrative system\"-which in that case was the Commission on Judicial Qualifications and its ability to provide advisory opinions. There is no parallel administrative system here that would justify the majority's novel form of abstention. See also\n   <em>\n    Bauer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3781383\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/620/704/#p715\">\n    620 F.3d at 717\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (describing\n   <em>\n    Pullman\n   </em>\n   abstention as another path to same result).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The majority's approach also overlooks the fact that we now have experience with this statute, litigated with able counsel on both sides and full discovery, including depositions and statements from internationally recognized scientific experts. It turns out that interpreting this law is a mess. In fact, the whole process makes a mockery of the standard that any \"normal person\" could figure out what is included in \"any other part of an aborted fetus.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   It is not the job of courts to tell legislators what processes to follow toward the final enactment of the statutory language of their choice. Indiana is absolutely permitted to, as one legislator put it, move up from being \"49 out of 50\" in terms of abortion restrictions, and \"attempt[ ] to be the most restrictive state in the country ... shooting for 50.\" Senate Committee Hearing at 1:47:22-1:47:32 (Feb. 24, 2016). But it is our job to insist that the effort remain within constitutional parameters: that a new criminal law give fair notice of what is criminal and what is not, and that the legislature make the key choices rather than delegate them to prosecutors and courts. That simply did not happen with \u00a7 1.5. I would affirm the district court's injunction against its enforcement as written.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   <em>\n    Takings Claim\n   </em>\n   : Finally, we should not decide the merits of Indiana University's claim for taking of private property without compensation. That claim simply is not ripe yet. The majority mistakenly asserts that the statute \"does render valueless any fetal tissue, derived from abortions, owned\n   by Indiana University.\" Ante at 543. That is not consistent with the position taken by the law's defenders. They insist that Indiana University remains free to conduct research with materials on hand, and even to transfer it at the request of the NIH. Supra at 548-49.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   More fundamental, the legal status of Indiana University vis-\u00e0-vis the state government is more nuanced than the majority acknowledges. For example, it is well-established that the university is an arm of the state for purposes of the Eleventh Amendment and is a state actor for purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment and other constitutional provisions. See\n   <em>\n    Medlock v. Trustees of Indiana University\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3695694\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/738/867/#p871\">\n    738 F.3d 867\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 871 (7th Cir. 2013) ;\n   <em>\n    Power v.

But Indiana law does not always treat the university as the state, particularly when it comes to property. See\n   <em>\n    Sendak v.Trustees of Indiana University\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1811018\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ind/254/390/\">\n    254 Ind. 390\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=260%20N.E.2d%20601\">\n    260 N.E.2d 601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 603-05 (1970) (university not subject to constitutional bar to ownership of private stock);\n   <em>\n    State Board of Accounts v.

App. 1995) (university is \"state\" for purposes of State Board of Accounts statute but not in accepting and administering private gifts). The majority seems to imply that state legislators could simply confiscate private gifts and grants to the university (as distinct from a private foundation associated with it) and use them for more general state-government purposes. That would be a troubling prospect for many donors and grantors. We would do better to say that the university's takings claim is simply not yet ripe because the actual scope of the challenged statute remains in so much doubt.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-101\">\n    HEK293 is a line of cells first cultured in 1973 and widely used in research.
