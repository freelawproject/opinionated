(\"Advanced Building\"). The allegations in the complaint stem from an altercation between Ayers and Honan, which led to the execution of a search warrant at Advanced Building by officers of the California Highway Patrol (\"CHP\"). Honan contends that Ayers violated clearly established law by participating in the search. We agree. Because the administrative search exception does not apply and Ayers's presence was not necessary to aid in the officers' execution of the warrant, we affirm the district court's denial of qualified immunity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Robert Honan owns and operates Advanced Building, a metal fabrication business that makes metal machines and specialized metal parts. On May 7, 2012, Curtis Ayers, who at that time was employed by the BOE, arrived at Advanced Building without a prior appointment. Ayers identified himself as a BOE employee, but he did not present his ID badge and had mistaken Advanced Building for another business. Honan suspected Ayers of a \"fraudulent scam\" and, after a brief exchange of words, Honan told Ayers to \"Get the F* out.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The parties dispute what happened next, but, as Ayers was leaving (or being thrown out of) the building, his laptop dropped and sustained damaged. According to Honan, Ayers must have heard Honan approaching and \"became startled and stumbled out the exit door, falling to the ground.\" Ayers, on the other hand, claimed that Honan tackled him and pushed him through the door as he was leaving. In the process, Ayers alleges, the laptop flew out of his hands, the monitor broke, and the laptop was rendered inoperable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Ayers contacted his supervisor, Dwayne Sims to report the incident. Sims recommended that Ayers contact the police, and they ultimately reported the incident to the CHP. CHP Officer John Wilson responded and interviewed Ayers. Officer\n   Wilson subsequently detained Honan along the highway, searched his truck, and interviewed him. Honan offered to discuss the incident and invited Officer Wilson and his partner back to Advanced Building. Honan gave them a tour of Advanced Building and \"showed them some of the things Advanced was working on, including [an] ammunition reloader,\" and \"a couple gold nuggets from [his] collection.\" The parties also dispute whether, during the tour, Honan claimed to Officer Wilson that he had surveillance video that would corroborate his version of the incident with Ayers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Officer Wilson subsequently obtained a search warrant authorizing \"any sheriff, marshal or police officer in the county of Butte\" to lawfully search the premises of Advanced Building. To obtain the warrant, Officer Wilson recounted in an affidavit the events as described to him by both Ayers and Honan, and indicated that there was probable cause to believe that Honan committed felony threats and vandalism against Ayers. The warrant issued for officers to search for and seize (1) items \"capable of storing ... video and audio media,\" (2) \"indicia proving [Honan's] ownership and control\" of the business, and (3) \"evidence of correspondence\" that would corroborate the alleged felonies. Officer Wilson indicated to Sims that \"he wanted us, me and Curtis [Ayers] to ... complete the inspection\" during the execution of the search warrant because it was \"important that [the BOE] complete [their] inspection and not allow this business or owner to get away with anything.\" Sims accepted the invitation, and told Ayers that he would like the two of them to go during the search.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On May 30, 2012, the CHP executed the search warrant at Advanced Building. Sims and Ayers waited in the car until the CHP confirmed they could enter. They \"did not assist the CHP in their search efforts nor were [they] asked to do so,\" though Ayers did at one point identify Honan and show Officer Wilson where the assault occurred. Honan asserts that he saw Ayers searching through a file cabinet of personal records. Ayers acknowledged that he examined any \"sales permits or records [they] saw,\" but denied taking or damaging any property. Honan alleges that a substantial amount of gold and silver was taken that day, as well as a number of additional items and personal effects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Honan and Advanced Building collectively filed a complaint against the CHP, Officer Wilson, Ayers, and other unnamed individuals, alleging state-law claims for conversion and other tort claims, as well as a federal claim under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Sacramento Sheriff's Dep't\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266640\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/872/938/#p946\">\n    872 F.3d 938\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 946 (9th Cir. 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Ayers argues that he did not violate Plaintiffs' Fourth Amendment rights because he claims California law permits a BOE employee to request inspection of sales records from any business, and his participation in the search would thus qualify under the \"administrative search\" exception to the warrant requirement.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%207053-54\">\n    Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax Code \u00a7\u00a7 7053-54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; 18 Cal. Code Regs. \u00a7 1698(b)(1) ). Ayers's reliance on these state provisions is a nonstarter because none of the state statutes or regulations on which he relies authorizes forcible entry or searches. For example, 18 Cal. Code Regs. section 1698(b)(1) merely mandates a taxpayer to \"make available for examination ... all records necessary to determine the correct tax liability.\" As Honan correctly points out, section 1698.5 (which immediately follows the section cited by Ayers) details the audit procedures and sets forth a process for conferring and providing requested documentation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%207053-54\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1698.5. The regulation even goes so far as to impose a duty on BOE staff to \"not directly access the taxpayer's computer system if the taxpayer objects to such access, except in the case of a search warrant.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%207053-54\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1698.5(b)(4)(D). Nowhere in the regulation is there broad authorization to conduct a warrantless search and seizure of business records without first requesting them from the business owner. Ayers acknowledges that, consistent with these regulations, BOE protocol if an inspector is asked to leave would be to \"see if we can call back at a better time.\" Therefore, we conclude that Ayers's conduct is not authorized by any state statute or regulation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Even assuming that state law permits warrantless inspection of business records, the intrusive search here would not withstand scrutiny under the Fourth Amendment. Ayers argues that \"[a]dministrative searches of a commercial location pursuant to statute can present an exception to the general warrant requirement.\" However, his reading of precedent is too broad to\n   support application of such an exception to the warrant requirement here. For example, in\n   <em>\n    New York v. Burger\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court considered the diminished privacy expectations for \"pervasively regulated business[es],\" upholding warrantless inspections only where \"necessary to further [the] regulatory scheme.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6219117\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/482/691/#p702\">\n    482 U.S. 691\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 702,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6219117\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/482/691/#p702\">\n    107 S.Ct. 2636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6219117\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/482/691/#p702\">\n    96 L.Ed.2d 601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1987) (alteration in original) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Donovan v.

Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Biswell\n   </em>\n   , the Court upheld a warrantless inspection of a federally licensed weapons dealer because \"close scrutiny of [firearm] traffic is undeniably of central importance to federal efforts to prevent violent crime.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6170455\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/406/311/#p315\">\n    406 U.S. 311\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 315,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6170455\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/406/311/#p315\">\n    92 S.Ct. 1593\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6170455\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/406/311/#p315\">\n    32 L.Ed.2d 87\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1972).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Here, no analogously pervasive regulation or special governmental interest justifies a diminished expectation of privacy. Indeed, should Ayers be correct, it would seem that every business in California \"selling tangible personal property\" would be subject to a warrantless search at any time.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%207054\">\n    Cal.

In\n   <em>\n    Wilson v.

Ayers argues that\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   is not sufficiently specific because that case involved reporters, not other government agents. He contends that his position as a government employee-one charged with inspecting business records-distinguishes him from the journalists at issue in\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In fact, his liability under \u00a7 1983 is premised on this very distinction: private citizens (like reporters) are not ordinarily liable under \u00a7 1983 for their presence during the execution of a search warrant because they are not state actors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brunette v.

The \"contours of the right\" here were \"sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11133554\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/526/603/#p614\">\n    526 U.S. at 615\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11133554\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/526/603/#p614\">\n    119 S.Ct. 1692\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Anderson v.

And, although Ayers claims that he was \"acting at the direction of his supervisor,\" he did not cite to any binding precedent holding that a supervisor's instruction would somehow obviate a clear constitutional violation.

We affirm the district court's denial of qualified immunity and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    Honan sued numerous other defendants in addition to Ayers, including CHP Officer John Wilson and the CHP itself. Citing numerous factual disputes, the district court denied summary judgment and immunity to all the defendants. We address only Ayers's appeal of the denial of qualified immunity in this opinion, and resolve the remaining claims of state law immunity raised by Ayers on appeal in a memorandum disposition filed concurrently with this opinion. Similarly, we resolve Officer Wilson's and the CHP's separate appeal, No. 17-16669, in a separately filed memorandum disposition.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    Ayers suggested at oral argument that \"it's not in the record here, [but] one of the reasons he was asked to come along [was] to show where the altercation occurred.\" Indeed, the record is silent as to this purported rationale, but instead confirms that the\n    <em>\n     purpose\n    </em>\n    of inviting Ayers and Sims was for them to \"complete the inspection\" of Advanced Building's business records.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
