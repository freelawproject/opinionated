He further argues the district court abused its discretion in imposing a 540-month prison sentence. Concluding there was no abuse of discretion, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Evidentiary Issues.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   During the period in question, February 2013 to September 2015, Keys lived in the home of Heidi and Rossi Haynes, Keys's uncle, on the Sisseton-Wahpeton Sioux Tribe's reservation in Agency Village, South Dakota. During most of that period, Keys shared a bedroom with I.C., Heidi Haynes's minor daughter. On many occasions, I.C. and her younger sister, R.C., would invite friends for sleepovers in that bedroom, including J.V. and H.L.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Keys returned to his family in Milwaukee in early January, 2016. A few days later, I.C., then 12 years old, told her mother that Keys had sexually abused her. Heidi took I.C. to the Sisseton hospital emergency room. Law enforcement was notified, and a child abuse investigation began. I.C. told investigators that Keys had sexually abused her beginning in early 2013. J.V. told investigators that Keys had sexually abused her on multiple occasions when she spent the night with I.C. H.L. told investigators that Keys sexually abused her while sleeping over at I.C.'s house. This prosecution followed. The superseding indictment charged Keys with three counts of aggravated sexual abuse and one count of abusive sexual contact with I.C., and with one count of aggravated sexual abuse and one count of abusive sexual contact with J.V.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At trial, I.C. testified that the abuse began when she was nine years old. It occurred more times than she could count when she and Keys shared a bedroom. The abuse included repeated instances of vaginal touching, attempted digital penetration, oral sex, anal intercourse, and attempted vaginal intercourse. J.V. testified, by marking anatomical exhibits, that Keys pulled her pants down and attempted vaginal and anal intercourse when she stayed overnight in the bedroom Keys and I.C. shared. After a three-day trial, a jury convicted Keys of all six counts of aggravated sexual abuse and abusive sexual contact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On appeal, Keys argues the district court abused its discretion in making three evidentiary rulings, and the cumulative prejudicial effect of these errors warrants a new trial. We review evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion.

The motion for mistrial is denied.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   On appeal, Keys argues the district court erred in denying a mistrial because the court's comment to J.V., \"try to answer the questions, so you can get off the stand,\" deprived Keys of his right to a fair trial because the court \"improperly abandoned his neutral and impartial role and injected himself into the trial on behalf of the prosecution.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

We reject this contention for multiple reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   First, we have \"always been reluctant to disturb a judgment of conviction by reason of a few isolated, allegedly prejudicial comments of a trial judge.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Second, there was no immediate objection to this isolated remark, so the district court was deprived of an opportunity to clarify its remark.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Flying By\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4067250\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/511/773/#p777\">\n    511 F.3d 773\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 777 (8th Cir. 2007). Third, the district court did not question the witness or comment on her testimony, as in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Singer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1866347\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/710/431/#p436\">\n    710 F.2d 431\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 436 (8th Cir. 1983) (en banc) (trial unfair where trial judge \"injected himself into the trial throughout the entire proceeding\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Fourth, and perhaps most important, the court was attempting to deal with a distressed child testifying in public about a traumatic experience. The Supreme Court has \"recognized that a State's interest 'in the protection of minor victims of sex crimes from further trauma and embarrassment' is a 'compelling' one.\"\n   <em>\n    Maryland v.

Telling a young child witness, \"try to answer the questions,\" is not telling her how to answer the questions. The court's neutrality was confirmed during J.V.'s cross examination, when defense counsel asked a question on this subject, J.V. paused, and the district court commented, \"Can you try to answer his question, J.V.?\" In its final instructions, the court instructed the jury that \"nothing I have said or done during the trial, has been said or done to suggest to you what I think your verdicts should be.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     C.

A defendant's constitutional right to present a defense is subject to limitations based on \"concerns about harassment, prejudice, confusion of the issues, the witness' safety, or interrogation that is repetitive or only marginally relevant.\"\n   <em>\n    Never Misses A Shot\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4075384\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/781/1017/#p1027\">\n    781 F.3d at 1029\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation omitted).

The district court acted well within its discretion when it prohibited Taylor from testifying about an alleged financial dispute between Keys and I.C.'s guardians. After Taylor testified that he believed Heidi and Rossi Haynes did not want Keys to move out because of the financial help he was providing, the district court sustained an objection to this question: \"Did you believe that Dashown's leaving [the Haynes home] had something to do with [I.C.'s] allegations?\" Keys argues this evidence was relevant to establish a motive for I.C. to fabricate her claims of sexual assault. But Taylor's opinion as an observer did not establish this improbable theory, which defense counsel vigorously argued but the jury rejected. The district court did not abuse its discretion by excluding Taylor's baseless opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   2. After Taylor testified that he observed Keys giving gifts to I.C., the district court overruled the government's relevance objection to whether Taylor believed Rossi and Heidi treated R.C. better than her sister, I.C. However, when defense counsel asked Taylor\n   <em>\n    why\n   </em>\n   Keys was buying things for I.C., the government objected that Taylor \"does not know what [Keys's] true motives were.\" The court sustained this objection. Later Keys, the last defense witness, provided an explanation to counter the government's theory that the gifts were \"grooming\" I.C. for a sexual relationship. On appeal, Keys argues that excluding Taylor's opinion prevented him from presenting \"a complete defense to the charges.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Had Keys testified first, Taylor's opinion might have had probative value as corroboration of Keys's explanation for the gifts. But when Taylor testified, there was nothing to corroborate, and it was not improper to exclude his personal opinion of another person's intent. Knowing Keys would testify, defense counsel could have provisionally offered Taylor's opinion as corroboration, or counsel could have recalled Taylor after Keys testified. As the defense did neither, we cannot conclude that excluding this opinion was an abuse of the district court's wide discretion to limit testimony of marginal probative value. Nor did the ruling affect Keys's substantial rights or have more than a slight influence on the verdict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Sentencing Issues.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   At sentencing, the district court overruled defense objections to the Presentence Investigation Report and determined that the advisory guidelines sentencing range was the 30-year statutory minimum to life in prison on four of the six counts of conviction. The court heard victim impact testimony from Heidi Haynes, I.C.'s mother, and considered victim impact statements from J.V. and her mother. The court denied Keys's motion for a downward variance to 30 years but also declined to impose a life sentence. Explaining at length its weighing of the\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203553\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) sentencing factors, the court imposed a 540-month prison sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   On appeal, Keys argues the district court abused its sentencing discretion. First, Keys argues the court procedurally erred by failing to adequately explain why it rejected his argument that a lower sentence was required based on the need to avoid unwarranted disparities with similarly situated defendants. This contention is without merit. \"We will not sustain a procedural challenge to the district court's discussion of the\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203553\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) sentencing factors by a defendant who did not object to the adequacy of the court's explanation at sentencing.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Here, the district court explicitly responded to Keys's lengthy disparity argument at sentencing, acknowledging its sentencing of other child sex abuse offenders and the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities. Without question, the court provided \"substantial insight into the reasons for its determination.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Feemster\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3670730\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/572/455/#p463\">\n    572 F.3d 455\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 463 (8th Cir. 2009) (en banc) (quotation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Second, Keys argues the sentence is substantively unreasonable because the district court failed to \"adequately consider and apportion significant weight to sentencing disparities within the District of South Dakota.\" We have repeatedly declined to require district judges to compare and contrast the defendant being sentenced with allegedly similar prior offenders. \"When the argument is, as in this case, that the district court's sentence created unwarranted disparities with the sentences imposed on ... unrelated offenders by ... different judges, there is no principled basis for an appellate court to say which defendant[s] received the 'appropriate' sentence.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.
