We briefly review them here along with the factual allegations contained in the complaint, which we accept as true for purposes of this appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wadsworth v.

The reclassification was subject to several conditions, including a condition that a certain percentage of the newly constructed residential units be affordable. The Commission amended that condition over the years as ownership of the land changed hands, and by 2005, the Commission required the landowner, Bridge Aina Le'a, LLC (\"Bridge\"), to construct no fewer than 385 affordable units, which constituted 20% of the total units to be constructed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In December 2008, the Commission issued a show cause order requiring Bridge to explain why the land should not revert to its former agricultural use classification. The Commission believed that Bridge and its predecessors-in-interest had failed \"to perform according to the conditions imposed and to the representations and commitments made to the [Commission] in obtaining reclassification\" of the property. In addition to responding to the show cause order, Bridge informed the Commission\n   in February 2009 that it had entered into a purchase agreement with DW Aina Le'a Development, LLC (\"DW\") that gave DW the right to develop the residential community. DW then invested more than $28 million developing the property, constructing more than a dozen townhouses and grading the site for roads, utilities, and additional townhouses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Nevertheless, in April 2009, the Commission voted unanimously to return the land to its former agricultural use classification. Bridge sought reconsideration, with DW now on board as a co-petitioner before the Commission, but those efforts failed. Following numerous hearings, the Commission issued a final, written order on April 25, 2011, reclassifying the property as agricultural. Shortly thereafter, Bridge and DW sought judicial review of the Commission's order in state court. The Hawai'i Supreme Court ultimately vacated the Commission's order, concluding that, because use of the property had \"substantially commenced,\" the Commission improperly reclassified the property without complying with certain statutory requirements for doing so.\n   <em>\n    DW Aina Le'a\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12311545\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/134/187/\">\n    339 P.3d at 711-14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (discussing the requirements set forth in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Haw.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20205-4\">\n    Haw.

STATEMENT OF PRIOR PROCEEDINGS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On February 23, 2017, DW filed a complaint in Hawai'i state court against the Commission and the State of Hawai'i asserting takings claims under both the United States Constitution and the Hawai'i Constitution. DW alleged that the Commission's reclassification of the property as agricultural constituted a regulatory taking of DW's property without just compensation. Specifically, DW alleged that the reclassification increased the purchase price of the property after DW had agreed to purchase it, destroyed DW's \"sophisticated funding arrangement [with] Asia\" for developing the property, and caused DW to sustain other increased costs and losses in business opportunities. The State removed the case to federal court and moved to dismiss the complaint as barred by the applicable statute of limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The district court granted the State's motion to dismiss.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The parties agreed that\n   DW's takings claims accrued when the Commission issued its order on April 25, 2011.

Rev. Stat. \u00a7 657-1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (4). Finally, the court concluded that, like the federal takings claim, DW's state takings claim under the Hawai'i Constitution is time-barred under either\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Haw.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20657-7\">\n    Haw. Rev. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 657-7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   or 661-5. The court thus dismissed this action in its entirety, and DW filed a timely notice of appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   III. LEGAL CIRCUMSTANCES\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On appeal, the parties do not dispute the relevant dates for limitations purposes-DW's takings claims accrued on April 25, 2011, and DW filed its complaint on February 23, 2017, more than five years later. The only issue is identifying the applicable statute of limitations. And although the parties focus on DW's federal takings claim, DW's state takings claim remains at issue, and the applicable limitations period may control its federal takings claim as well.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, in all events, determining the correct statute of limitations for DW's state takings claim is outcome determinative for some, and perhaps all, of DW's claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Under the Hawai'i Constitution, \"[p]rivate property shall not be taken or damaged for public use without just compensation.\" Haw.

Ct. App. 2009), a decision from the Hawai'i Intermediate Court of Appeals that the State offers as \"the only Hawai'i case addressing the limitations period for takings claims.\" In that case, the plaintiffs filed an \"inverse-condemnation lawsuit\" against the State challenging a statute governing ownership of future accreted\n   land.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 442-43. The plaintiffs claimed that the statute constituted a taking of their \"right to future accretions\" without just compensation \"and thereby violated article I, section 20 of the Hawai'i State Constitution.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 460.

And following that observation, the court inserted a footnote: \"Pursuant to [ \u00a7 661-5 ], '[e]very claim against the State, cognizable under this chapter, shall be forever barred unless the action is commenced within two years after the claim first accrues.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 458 n.12 (second alteration in original) (quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Haw.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20661-5\">\n    Haw.
