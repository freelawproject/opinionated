First, he contends that he waited to file his second state habeas petition until the California Supreme Court decided\n   <em>\n    Elizalde\n   </em>\n   , which establishes good cause. We reject that contention. Valdez filed his second state habeas petition before the California Supreme Court decided\n   <em>\n    Elizalde\n   </em>\n   , \"so waiting until [\n   <em>\n    Elizalde\n   </em>\n   ] was decided does not explain the delay.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    Waldrip v.

Unlike the prisoner there, Valdez did not wait to file his second state habeas petition until after a new decision; he filed it before.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In the alternative, Valdez claims that his delay was reasonable because of the size of the state-court record and complexity of the case. This contention is likewise insufficient to establish good cause. Valdez timely filed his first state habeas petition. That petition raised the same claims he then raised in his second state petition. He has offered no explanation for why he could timely file his first petition but not his second.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Velasquez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4202657\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/639/964/#p967\">\n    639 F.3d at 968\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[E]ach of Velasquez's habeas petitions is nearly identical to the petition that came before it. It is not reasonable that Velasquez's counsel would need excess time essentially to re-file an already-written brief.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In summary, the district court correctly held that Valdez is not entitled to statutory tolling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    IV\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   We next address Valdez's contention that the district court should not have dismissed his federal habeas petition without requiring the State to respond and lodge the state-court record. Valdez contends that the district court could not determine whether his state habeas petitions were timely filed absent the state-court record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   A district court may summarily dismiss a federal habeas corpus petition\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   if \"it plainly appears from the petition and any attached exhibits that the petitioner is not entitled to relief ....\" Rule 4 of the Rules Governing Section 2254 Cases. A district court should do so, however, only after \"provid[ing] the petitioner with adequate notice and an opportunity to respond.\"\n   <em>\n    Herbst v.

Moreover, because \"federal habeas courts\" have a duty to \"independently [review] the basis for the state court's decision,\" a district court must \"obtain and review the relevant portions of the state court record,\" or hold an evidentiary hearing, as necessary to discharge its duty.\n   <em>\n    Nasby v. McDaniel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277367\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/853/1049/#p1053\">\n    853 F.3d 1049\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1053 (9th Cir. 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Valdez, in his federal habeas petition, listed the date the California Supreme Court denied his petition for review on direct appeal, the dates he filed his state habeas petitions, and the dates the state courts denied those petitions. The district court, after ordering Valdez to show cause and thereby providing Valdez \"adequate notice and an opportunity to respond,\"\n   <em>\n    Herbst\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9499022\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/260/1039/#p1043\">\n    260 F.3d at 1043\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , had Valdez's explanations for why he delayed in filing his second state habeas petition. Finally, the district court had the California Court of Appeal's decision dismissing Valdez's second state petition because Valdez attached that decision as an exhibit to his objections to the magistrate judge's findings and recommendations. As demonstrated in Section III, the foregoing information is all that is necessary to conclude that Valdez's federal habeas petition was untimely. The district court did not err by not ordering the State to respond and lodge the state-court record.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    V\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Because we conclude that Valdez is not entitled to statutory tolling for the period following the California Superior Court's denial of his first state habeas petition, Valdez's federal habeas petition is untimely, and we affirm the district court's dismissal of his petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    California has a unique postconviction review system.
