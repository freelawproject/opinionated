MVP is a natural gas company that was authorized by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (\"FERC\") to exercise the right of eminent domain in order to construct a pipeline. The United States District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia granted MVP partial summary judgment on its right to condemn certain temporary and permanent easements on the properties of several landowners, including Appellant Western Pocahontas Properties, Limited Partnership (\"WPPLP\"). The district court also granted MVP's motion for a preliminary injunction allowing MVP immediate access to the easements described in MVP's complaint. WPPLP appeals the district court's decision granting MVP's motions for summary judgment and a preliminary injunction. WPPLP also challenges the district court's exclusion of evidence proffered during the preliminary injunction hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   For the reasons that follow, we affirm the district court's order in its entirety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Natural Gas Act (\"the NGA\") authorizes the holder of a certificate of public convenience and necessity to condemn land necessary for a particular project if it cannot acquire the land through contract or cannot agree with the landowner as to the compensation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   15 U.S.C. \u00a7 717f(h). Our holding in\n   <em>\n    East Tennessee Natural Gas Co. v. Sage\n   </em>\n   allows district courts to utilize their equitable power to grant injunctions to gas companies in NGA condemnation proceedings where the company has demonstrated that it has a substantive right to the property pursuant to the NGA and has met the requirements for a preliminary injunction.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"645578\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/361/808/#p828\">\n    361 F.3d 808\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 828 (4th Cir. 2004).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On October 13, 2017, FERC issued a certificate of public convenience and necessity to MVP. The FERC certificate authorizes MVP to construct and operate a 303.5-mile natural gas pipeline from Wetzel County, West Virginia to Pittsylvania County, Virginia. After failing to acquire certain properties necessary for the pipeline through negotiation, MVP filed condemnation actions pursuant to the NGA against landowners in three district courts: in the United States District Courts for the Western District of Virginia and the Southern District of West Virginia on October 24, 2017, and in the United States District Court for the Northern District of West Virginia on December 8, 2017. This appeal concerns the action before the Southern District of West Virginia.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In that action, MVP condemned easements on three parcels of land belonging to WPPLP. MVP condemned only the surface of those properties, asserting that the pipeline project did not require condemnation of the mineral rights or coal estate. MVP moved for partial summary judgment on its right to condemn temporary and permanent easements on the properties of several landowners (including those properties belonging to WPPLP) and sought a preliminary injunction allowing immediate access to the properties. MVP requested access to the landowners' property by February 1, 2018, a date MVP claimed would allow it to adhere to its construction schedule, complete tree-clearing in accordance with environmental requirements, and place the pipeline into service in late 2018. On January 19, 2018, WPPLP filed a motion to dismiss the condemnation action for failure to join an indispensable party. The district court granted MVP's motion to strike WPPLP's motion to dismiss from the record, arguing that no pleadings outside of the answer are permitted in an eminent domain proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On February 7, 2018, the district court held an evidentiary hearing regarding MVP's motion for partial summary judgment and preliminary injunction. At a prehearing conference, WPPLP proffered testimony to be heard at the preliminary injunction hearing. The majority of the proffered evidence would not relate to the surface tracts named in MVP's complaint but would instead address potential damage to coal and to the interests of WPPLP's affiliate, Western Pocahontas Properties, LLC (\"WPPLLC\") - a party that had not been joined in the condemnation action. The district court excluded the proffered evidence. After confirming with WPPLP that the proffered evidence did not relate to property that MVP sought to condemn in the complaint, the district court found the evidence to be irrelevant. In reaching its conclusion, the district court reasoned that it would not \"hear evidence on properties that are not being taken.\" J.A. 161.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Following the evidentiary hearing, the district court granted MVP's motion for partial summary judgment and preliminary injunction. This appeal followed. WPPLP argues that the district court\n   committed reversible error by: (1) excluding WPPLP's proffered evidence; (2) failing to join WPPLP's affiliate, WPPLLC, as a party to the condemnation action; and (3) granting MVP's motion for summary judgment and preliminary injunction. We address each of WPPLP's challenges below and affirm the district court's order in its entirety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   WPPLP contends that the district court abused its discretion when it precluded WPPLP from introducing evidence regarding potential damage to WPPLP and WPPLLC's coal as a result of the pipeline. MVP responds that the district court did not abuse its discretion, because MVP had the sole power to define the extent of the taking and evidence related to property that MVP did not seek to condemn would therefore be irrelevant. We agree with MVP's position and find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in excluding the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   A district court's evidentiary ruling is reviewed for abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Medford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6050053\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/661/746/#p751\">\n    661 F.3d 746\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 751 (4th Cir. 2011) (citing\n   <em>\n    United States v.

A plaintiff must meet three requirements to exercise eminent domain under the NGA: (1) it must hold a valid FERC certificate; (2) the property it seeks must be necessary to the project; and (3) it must have been unable to acquire the property by agreement. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 717f(h) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Equitrans, L.P. v.

WPPLP does not dispute that MVP holds a valid FERC certificate and that the property it seeks to condemn is necessary to the pipeline. Rather, WPPLP argues that the motion for summary judgment should have been denied, because: (1) MVP made no offer to WPPLP or WPPLLC that included any valuation for coal; and (2) MVP failed to negotiate in good faith when it withheld its third-party engineering firm's evaluation of the effect of the pipeline on WPPLP's coal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   We do not find either of WPPLP's arguments persuasive. First, because MVP did not seek to condemn WPPLLC's property in the eminent domain action, MVP was not required to attempt to negotiate or reach an agreement with WPPLLC.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Marshall Cnty.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"203710\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/491/301/#p304\">\n    491 F.2d at 304\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Nor was MVP required to make an offer to WPPLP for any of its property that was not described in the complaint. Second, as to WPPLP's argument regarding good faith, we note that this Court has never directly addressed the issue of whether the NGA requires gas companies to seek property by agreement in good faith before exercising eminent domain. We need not resolve that issue here, however, because WPPLP has failed to point to any authority that required MVP to disclose the results of its engineering analysis during negotiations for the surface easements in order to act in good faith. Indeed, WPPLP has not pointed to any evidence in the record that it requested and was denied the analysis. Because MVP was unable to reach an agreement with WPPLP as to the easements described in the complaint, the district court did not err when it granted summary judgment to MVP on its right to condemn.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   15 U.S.C. \u00a7 717f (h).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   WPPLP has not pointed to a genuine dispute of material fact as to MVP's claim to invoke its eminent domain powers.

On this record, the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the balance of equities tipped in MVP's favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Finally, as to the fourth\n   <em>\n    Winter\n   </em>\n   element, the district court reasonably determined that the preliminary injunction was in the public interest, because it would allow for expeditious construction of a FERC-approved pipeline. As we explained in\n   <em>\n    Sage\n   </em>\n   , the issuance of a FERC certificate signifies that the Commission - the agency charged with administering the NGA - has determined that pipeline construction will advance the congressional purposes behind that Act and \"serve the public interest,\" making available to consumers an adequate supply of natural gas at reasonable prices.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"645578\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/361/808/#p828\">\n    361 F.3d at 830\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It follows, we reasoned, that granting a gas company immediate access to necessary easements during the pendency of condemnation proceedings likewise would advance the public interest, because a \"delay in construction would postpone these benefits.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"645578\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/361/808/#p828\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The district court did not abuse its discretion in applying\n   <em>\n    Sage\n   </em>\n   to the facts of this case. As the district court recognized, MVP's certificate rests on an agency finding that the proposed pipeline will benefit the public by meeting a market need for natural gas, and will do so in a way that is environmentally acceptable. J.A. 1141 (\"FERC conducted a careful analysis of the [project] and determined that the project will promote [the NGA's] goals and serve the public interest.\" (quoting\n   <em>\n    Sage\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"645578\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/361/808/#p828\">\n    361 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   830 )). A delay in construction would therefore result in a delay of the benefits of the pipeline.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   That is not to say, of course, that a FERC certificate necessarily will be dispositive of the public interest inquiry under\n   <em>\n    Winter\n   </em>\n   . Apart from setting an in-service deadline, a FERC certificate does not address timing, and so cannot establish by itself that immediate possession, as opposed to pipeline construction generally, is in the public interest. But echoing our reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Sage\n   </em>\n   , the district court here concluded that because delaying construction would delay the public benefits identified by the Commission, the public interest factor favored preliminary relief. And while there may be cases in which there are public-interest arguments against immediate possession that were not considered by the Commission in reviewing the public benefit of the pipeline project writ large, this is not one of them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   We note that the district court did not expressly recognize the distinction between the public interest in pipeline construction generally and in immediate access specifically.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Winter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679402\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/7/#p22\">\n    555 U.S. at 20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679402\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/7/#p22\">\n    129 S.Ct. 365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"A plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction must establish ... that an\n   <em>\n    injunction\n   </em>\n   is in the public interest.\" (emphasis added)). The district court did, however, incorporate our reasoning under the public-interest prong in\n   <em>\n    Sage\n   </em>\n   , which does address that issue and finished with the common-sense observation that a construction delay would postpone the benefits relied on by FERC in issuing its certificate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   J.A. 1141 (citing\n   <em>\n    Sage\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"645578\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/361/808/#p828\">\n    361 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   830 ). Under these circumstances, the absence of additional analysis of the public-interest prong does not amount to an abuse of discretion. We therefore affirm the district court's grant of an injunction to MVP.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   V.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   In sum, the district court did not abuse its discretion in excluding WPPLP's proffered evidence as to property that MVP did not identify in the complaint as part of its taking. The district court also properly declined to join WPPLLC as an indispensable party to the action. Finally, the district court properly granted summary judgment in favor of MVP and did not abuse its discretion in granting MVP's motion for a preliminary injunction. We therefore affirm the district court's order in its entirety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <em>\n    AFFIRMED\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    Other landowners in the three condemnation actions challenge the district courts' issuance of preliminary injunctions before this Court in a consolidated appeal.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Mountain Valley Pipeline, LLC v. 6.56 Acres of Land\n    </em>\n    , No. 18-1159(L).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    In\n    <em>\n     Marshall County\n    </em>\n    , the Court applied this rule to the government, but the rule also applies to a gas company to which eminent domain power has been delegated.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Columbia Gas Transmission, LLC v. 76 Acres, More or Less, in Baltimore and Harford Counties, Maryland\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12404736\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/701/221/#p226\">\n     701 F.

After considering the affidavit and other evidence, the district court required MVP to deposit an amount four times the preliminary estimate of its appraiser before taking possession of the condemned property described in the complaint. Similarly, to the extent that the taking impacts the value of improvements on the surface or the value of WPPLP's minerals below the surface, this would also factor in to the ultimate compensation determination in this action.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    For the same reason, even if the FERC certificate required MVP to negotiate with landowners of condemned property, as WPPLP argues, such a requirement would not compel MVP to negotiate for land it was not condemning or with a party that did not own condemned property.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
