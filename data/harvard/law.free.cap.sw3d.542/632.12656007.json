The suspect, Benito Garza, fled the scene in a car and was pursued by SAPD at a high rate of speed. The chase was suspended when Garza entered the exit ramp of Interstate Loop 410 traveling the wrong direction into oncoming traffic.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Garza v.

Pedro was killed on impact and Roxana was severely injured.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Roxana Tenorio, individually and on behalf of Pedro, brought suit against the City under the Texas Tort Claims Act, alleging the SAPD officers were negligent in initiating and continuing the high speed chase and in failing to terminate the high speed chase. The City filed a plea to the jurisdiction in which it asserted that Tenorio failed to provide the requisite notice of her claims within six months as required by section 101.101(a) of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code or within ninety days as required under Article XII, Section 150 of the City of San Antonio Charter. In response, Tenorio did not deny that she had not provided formal notice, but instead argued that the City had actual notice of her claims as a result of the Texas Peace Officer's Crash Report prepared by SAPD after the accident; a number of written witness statements; and the SAPD Incident Report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After a hearing, the trial court denied the City's plea to the jurisdiction, and the City pursued this interlocutory appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   A plea to the jurisdiction challenges a trial court's subject matter jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    City of Dallas v.

Thus, we must consider the evidence in the record before us in the light most favorable to Tenorio to determine what facts the investigation performed in this case revealed to the City.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Among the evidence attached to the City's plea to the jurisdiction was (1) the Texas Peace Officer's Crash Report; (2) the written statements of ten witnesses and police officers; and (3) the SAPD Offense Report concerning the accident. Tenorio attached the following evidence to her amended response to the plea to the jurisdiction: (1) San Antonio Police Department Procedures; (2) SAPD Pursuit Evaluation Report; and (3) the deposition of SAPD Deputy Chief Roy Waldheim. The City argues that none of the evidence in the record alleges that the City, or any employee of the City, caused the accident, was at fault, did anything wrong, or was in any way culpable, and thus, the City did not have actual notice of Tenorio's claims. We must be careful, however, not to overstate the plaintiff's burden at this juncture. The determination to be made at this preliminary stage of the proceedings is not whether there is evidence in the record showing that SAPD negligently initiated the pursuit or negligently failed to terminate the pursuit, but rather, whether there is evidence raising a fact issue as to whether SAPD was subjectively aware that it played a role in producing\n   <em>\n    or contributing to\n   </em>\n   Roxana's and Pedro's injuries.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Simons,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9212456\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/140/338/#p347\">\n    140 S.W.3d at 347-48\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Applying this standard, we conclude the evidence in this case raises a fact issue as to whether the City was subjectively aware of its responsibility,\n   <em>\n    as alleged by Tenorio,\n   </em>\n   for the injuries suffered by Pedro and Roxana.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The SAPD Pursuit Evaluation Report was prepared on October 3, 2012, thirty-one days after the accident. Included in the report is the Texas Peace Officer's Crash Report. The report is dated September\n   21, 2012, the same date as the accident. Box No. 36 of the crash report is titled \"Contributing Factors (Investigator's Opinion).\" The investigating officer opined that a factor and condition \"contributing\" to the crash was Garza's \"Fleeing or Evading Police.\" Absent this finding in the report, the case before us might be similar to\n   <em>\n    Muniz v.

In\n   <em>\n    Muniz,\n   </em>\n   a police officer was pursuing a pickup truck traveling at a high rate of speed when the truck veered into oncoming traffic and struck another vehicle, killing the occupant.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *1. In the police report, the investigating officer determined that the driver of the pickup truck-who was driving under the influence of multiple drugs at the time of the accident-was solely responsible for the accident and consequently, the death of the occupant of the vehicle.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2. The family of the deceased filed a lawsuit against the County alleging that the deputy initiated and continued a reckless, high-speed pursuit and caused the collision by bumping the pickup truck into oncoming traffic.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In response, the County filed a plea to the jurisdiction asserting that it had not been provided with the requisite notice under section 101.101(c).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Thirteenth Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court's granting of the plea to the jurisdiction, holding that nothing in the police report or dispatch log suggested that the deputy caused the collision as alleged, and thus the County was not placed on notice that appellants would seek to hold it responsible for the fatal collision.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Unlike\n   <em>\n    Muniz,\n   </em>\n   we are presented with a police report that specifically notes that Garza's fleeing or evading police was a factor contributing to the fatal collision. It stands to reason that there can be no fleeing or evading without pursuit or chase by the police. Hence, the evidence indicates that SAPD's active pursuit was a factor contributing to Garza's entering the freeway in the wrong direction and his head-on collision with the Tenorios within a minute of entering the freeway. The crash report need not indicate that SAPD acted unreasonably, but must only provide a \"subjective signal\" to the City within the 90-day period required by the City's charter \"that there might be a claim, even if unfounded, at issue.\"\n   <em>\n    Univ. of Tex.

Subjective awareness of fault is not implied anytime there is a high speed pursuit that results in an accident.

The suspect after entering the highway traveled approximately 300 feet prior to the first collision occurring.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The San Antonio Police Department Report, written by Officer Joe Carmona, confirmed\n   the statements of Officers Zachary and Reygadas and states,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   [O]nce myself and other officers secured the scene, victims, and witnesses [at the scene of the originating crime], I discovered the V3 was killed in the accident that API caused while he was evading the police. API also severely injured V4.... Apparently while API was operating the listed vehicle, he was traveling south bound in the north bound lanes of SW Loop 410. As he was fleeing the police he jumped onto the main lanes and stuck V3 and V4....\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   These reports and witness statements consistently and conclusively establish that the police pursuit of Garza had ceased by the time he entered the exit ramp and by the time he struck the motorcycle carrying the Tenorios. Officers Zachary and Reygadas's reports both establish conclusively that the order to terminate the pursuit occurred before Garza drove up the exit ramp and before he entered the highway going the wrong direction. This evidence is undisputed. Therefore, there can be no fact issue with regard to whether the pursuit of Garza implicated the City of San Antonio or should have made the City of San Antonio subjectively aware of its potential fault because the undisputed evidence conclusively establishes the pursuit of Garza had ceased.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Next, the San Antonio Police Report written by Officer Carmona and Officer Zachary's statement conclusively establish that Garza was already in flight from the original scene of an alleged armed burglary when Officer Carmona and Officer Zachary began pursuit. This evidence is undisputed. Because Garza was already in flight when the police pursuit began, his flight or evasion of police pursuit cannot raise a fact issue whether the City of San Antonio was subjectively aware of its potential fault. This undisputed evidence establishes conclusively that the City of San Antonio did not cause Garza to flee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Finally, Officer Reygadas's report establishes conclusively that he made the order to terminate pursuit based upon safety concerns when Garza entered the exit ramp. This evidence is undisputed and provides indication of Officer Reygadas's perception of the events as they were unfolding and his perception of the potential implication of the officers' action. Officer Reygadas exercised this judgment by commanding all police officers to cease pursuit. Because the police officers acted according to Officer Reygadas's command to terminate the pursuit, the police officers' actions in stopping the pursuit, and instead, taking the turnaround, exemplifies that the police officers acted prudently to ensure the safety of the public and themselves. Thus, the undisputed evidence conclusively establishes the police officers acted with prudence based upon safety concerns, and therefore, do not raise a fact issue whether the City of San Antonio was subjectively aware of its potential fault.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   For these reasons, the statement in the Peace Officer's Report that the cause of the accident was Garza's \"Fleeing or Evading Police\" is not sufficient to raise a fact issue whether the City of San Antonio was subjectively aware of any alleged fault in causing or contributing to the accident. In fact, these statements and the Reports conclusively establish the City of San Antonio was not subjectively aware of its potential fault.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Aside from this conclusive undisputed evidence, this court cannot conclude a fact issue exists with regard to subjective awareness based upon police pursuit, alone.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Muniz v. Cameron Cnty.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%201656326\">\n    2012 WL 1656326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6. Thus, as a matter of law, the majority opinion cannot hold that Garza's flight or evasion of police pursuit was sufficient to raise a fact issue of the City of San Antonio's subjective awareness.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%201656326\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Finally, the majority's conclusion in this case, that an indication of flight or evasion of police is sufficient to implicate fault because \"[i]t stands to reason that there can be no fleeing or evading without pursuit or chase by the police,\" results in a bright-line determination that subjective awareness must be implied any time there is a high speed pursuit that results in an accident. This holding promotes a result that is outside the guidelines provided in the\n   <em>\n    Cathey, Simons,\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Carbajal\n   </em>\n   precedential authority because it allows a presumptive conclusion with regard to subjective awareness and goes against the purpose of the statutory notice requirement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Carbajal,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7322524\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/324/537/#p538\">\n    324 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   539 ;\n   <em>\n    Simons,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9212456\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/140/338/#p347\">\n    140 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   345 ;\n   <em>\n    Cathey,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10008337\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/900/339/#p341\">\n    900 S.W.2d at 341\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   In this case, the record shows conclusively that the City of San Antonio was not subjectively aware of its alleged fault in causing or contributing to the accident from which Ms. Tenorio derives her claims. Therefore, as a matter of law, Ms. Tenorio did not comply with the prerequisite notice requirements of Section 101.101 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. CIV. PRAC. &amp; REM. CODE ANN. \u00a7 101.101 (West 2011). Failure to comply with the notice requirements deprives the trial court of jurisdiction. TEX. GOV'T CODE ANN. \u00a7 311.034 (West 2013). Following this analysis under the undisputed facts presented, I would reverse the trial court's order denying the City of San Antonio's plea to the jurisdiction and render judgment dismissing the cause for want of subject matter jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    While determination of the City of San Antonio's subjective awareness is intertwined with the facts pertaining to the substantive merits of the liability question, this finding does not affirmatively determine the issue of the City of San Antonio's liability or potential negligence. This court's review is limited to determination of the City of San Antonio's subjective awareness. Therefore, this court may review these facts and evidence for this limited purpose and in this limited context, without deciding the substantive merits of the ultimate litigation.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Miranda,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9256802\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/133/217/#p228\">\n     133 S.W.3d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    227-28 ;\n    <em>\n     Estate of Arancibia,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7322599\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/324/544/#p549\">\n     324 S.W.3d at 549\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
