The trial court granted Schlumberger's motion for summary judgment based on the affirmative defense of limitations. Pasko argues on appeal that the trial court erred in granting Schlumberger's motion for summary judgment. We conclude that Pasko raised a genuine issue of material fact concerning the date he became aware of his injury and reverse and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Pasko was working as a third-party contractor for JC Fodale Energy Services, LLC on a well site in DeWitt County on May 6, 2013. Schlumberger is a third-party contractor that supplied employees, equipment, and chemicals to the well site. Pasko claims that while he was waiting for his job safety analysis sheet to be signed, a Schlumberger employee told Pasko that a\n   berm was about to overflow due to a water spill. Under the direction of Schlumberger's employee, Pasko cleaned the spill. However, the spilled water actually contained a mixture of chemicals described as \"frac chemical residue\" that caused his hands to burn when the mixture came into contact with him. Pasko was taken to several hospitals but ultimately received treatments for his chemical burns in San Antonio. In September 2013, Pasko was diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Pasko filed suit against various parties and individuals on May 5, 2015 for negligence, gross negligence, negligent misrepresentation, fraud, fraudulent concealment, conspiracy, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Pasko amended his petition to include Schlumberger as a defendant in August 2015. Among several other claims, Pasko alleged that Schlumberger negligently rigged a hose containing U028, a gelling agent, on May 5, 2013, the day before the incident. In other words, Pasko does not argue that Schlumberger's negligence caused the frac chemical residue overflow on May 6, but rather he alleges that Schlumberger's negligence on May 5 caused U028 to leak into the frac chemical residue that he was forced to clean.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Schlumberger filed a motion for summary judgment based upon limitations. Schlumberger argued that more than two years had passed since Pasko's injury and thus Pasko's claims against Schlumberger were barred by the statute of limitations. Pasko filed a second amended petition that pled the discovery rule as to all causes of action against Schlumberger. The trial court granted Schlumberger's motion for summary judgment and severed Schlumberger from the original lawsuit. This appeal ensued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II. SUMMARY JUDGMENT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In three issues, Pasko argues on appeal that it was an error for the trial court to grant summary judgment because: 1) the trial court considered untimely evidence from Schlumberger; 2) Schlumberger did not disprove each element of the discovery rule as pled by Pasko; and 3) Pasko established a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the statute of limitations was tolled by fraudulent concealment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Discovery Rule\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In Pasko's second issue, he claims that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment because he raised genuine issues of material fact regarding the application of the discovery rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In response to Schlumberger's motion for summary judgment based on limitations, Pasko amended his petition to plead the discovery rule. Pasko was injured on May 6, 2013 but did not serve Schlumberger until August 2015, more than two years later. Schlumberger asserts that because Pasko failed to serve Schlumberger within two years of discovering the injury on May 6, 2013, his suit against Schlumberger is barred by the statute of limitations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. CIV. PRAC. &amp; REM. CODE ANN. \u00a7 16.003(a) (West, Westlaw through 2015 R.S.). However, Pasko argues that he did not discover the injury he suffered from Schlumberger on May 6. Pasko admits that he knew he suffered chemical burns to his hands as of May 6 but argues that he did not discover the latent disease until September of 2013 when he was diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma. He also argues that he exercised due diligence in fully discovering the extent of his injury through discovery with the defendants; however, he claims that the defendants\n   took several months to disclose vital information regarding what was in the mixture he was exposed to, which delayed his ability to discover his latent disease.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Furthermore, Pasko claims that he was initially unaware of Schlumberger's alleged wrongful acts and negligence on May 5; he asserts that he did not discover the alleged negligent hose set up until he was diagnosed with carcinoma, filed suit, and commenced discovery. Thus, according to Pasko, the accrual date for the injuries he suffered as a result of Schlumberger was in September of 2013 when he became aware of his latent disease.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Markwardt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7322765\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/325/876/#p887\">\n    325 S.W.3d at 887\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Schlumberger counters by arguing that Pasko was aware of his injury on May 6, 2015. Since the squamous cell carcinoma developed in the exact area he was burned, Pasko should have already been aware of that injury. Therefore, Schlumberger argues that the discovery rule is inapplicable because Pasko knew he was harmed on May 6, 2013 and that is when the limitations period began to accrue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7322765\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/325/876/#p887\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Pasko admits that he was aware of the chemical burn on May 6, 2013, but asserts that he was not aware that his exposure to U028 was allegedly caused by Schlumberger's wrongful acts on May 5 until his diagnosis several months later.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Childs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11693560\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/974/31/#p40\">\n    974 S.W.2d at 40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Pasko argues that until he had conducted discovery for several months and had been diagnosed with skin cancer, he had no reason to suspect Schlumberger of negligent behavior and he had no reason to believe he would develop squamous cell carcinoma.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Viewing all the evidence in the light most favorable to Pasko, we conclude that he raised a genuine issue of material fact concerning when he discovered, or should have discovered, that he suffered from an occupational disease as a result of Schlumberger's alleged negligence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Provident\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9258218\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/128/211/#p216\">\n    128 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   215 ;\n   <em>\n    Transcon.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7323260\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/321/685/#p692\">\n    321 S.W.3d at 692\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

However, Schlumberger failed to establish as a matter of law that as of May 6, 2015, Pasko was aware, or that diligent investigation would have led Pasko to be aware, that he suffered from a latent occupational illness.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Childs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11693560\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/974/31/#p40\">\n    974 S.W.2d at 47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
