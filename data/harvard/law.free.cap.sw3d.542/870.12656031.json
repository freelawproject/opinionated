ABRAMSON, Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Appellant Kevin Sandy appeals the decision of the Arkansas Board of Review (Board) that reversed the Appeal Tribunal's (Tribunal) decision to grant unemployment benefits. The Tribunal found that Sandy's actions leading to his discharge did not constitute misconduct. The Board reversed the Tribunal's decision on the basis that Sandy intentionally disregarded the employer's interest, warranting denial of unemployment benefits. We disagree with the Board and reverse and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Sandy began working for the City of Fort Smith (the City) on August 28, 1989. He received several promotions during his employment and last served as the deputy director of business administration. He was discharged on January 23, 2017. The City cited the following reasons for his discharge: Sandy (1) failed to provide a password when requested by the employer's internal audit, (2) failed to follow procedures in processing a purchase request and a bond-reimbursement request, (3) removed a computer from one of the City's locations and took it to another location without permission, and (4) failed to approve a fuel-purchase request in a timely manner. The City did not administer any disciplinary action against Sandy during his twenty-seven-year tenure aside from his discharge. Sandy testified that the incidents cited by the City were miscommunications, erroneous assumptions about his actions, and the result of procedural and policy changes that were not made known to him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Tribunal concluded that the City did not prove by a preponderance of the evidence that Sandy's conduct constituted misconduct. The Board reversed on the basis that Sandy intentionally disregarded the City's interest when he did not give a password to an internal auditor and when he did not approve a fuel-purchase request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The standard of review is well settled.

The claimant was reprimanded for failing to properly clean a milk pitcher, and she denied that she had failed to clean the pitcher.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   She refused to sign the reprimand, and her employer discharged her.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Board found that this refusal to sign the reprimand constituted misconduct, and we reversed the Board because there was no policy against refusing to sign a reprimand, and she was never informed that refusing to sign a reprimand would result in disciplinary action.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   We held that under these circumstances, substantial evidence did not support a finding of misconduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In the present case, the Board based its finding of misconduct on the instances of Sandy's failure to provide a password to an internal auditor and his failure to timely process a fuel request. The Tribunal found that the facts supported a finding that these instances were merely the result of miscommunications, erroneous assumptions about his work, and new policies that were not known to Sandy. The evidence relied on by the Board merely shows that two tasks were not completed to the City's satisfaction. As we have said, mere inefficiency and unsatisfactory conduct do not constitute misconduct that will disqualify a claimant from unemployment benefits. The City has not presented evidence that Sandy intended to disregard his employer's interest. There is\n   no evidence that he knew his actions were in disregard of his employer's interest as there was no policy he knew of prohibiting his actions, and he had not previously been disciplined for those actions. Simply put, the City did not present any evidence that Sandy engaged in misconduct, because none of Sandy's actions allow a reasonable person to find that he disregarded his employer's interests. Therefore, substantial evidence does not support the Board's finding that Sandy engaged in misconduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Since substantial evidence does not support the Board's finding, we reverse and remand for an award of benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Reversed and remanded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Gruber, C.J., and Klappenbach, J., agree.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
