He complains in two points on appeal that the trial court erred in finding Bugg's petition did not allege sufficient facts to support personal jurisdiction over the defendants in the state of Missouri. Because a published opinion would have no precedential value, a memorandum has been provided to the parties. The judgment is affirmed. Rule 84.16(b).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
