Goldin, J.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    Background and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This appeal concerns a local zoning board's denial of a permit to replace an old billboard with a new digital billboard. After the zoning board denied the permit for the new billboard, the applicants who had requested the permit filed a petition for a writ of certiorari in chancery court. The chancery court found no basis to disturb the zoning board's denial of a permit based upon its review of the administrative record. Although the applicants have appealed from the chancery court's decision, we conclude that we cannot reach the merits of their appeal. Because the applicants did not file a petition for a writ of certiorari that complied with Tennessee Code Annotated section 27-8-106 within sixty days of the zoning board's order, we conclude that\n   the chancery court was without subject matter jurisdiction to review the zoning board's actions. We accordingly vacate the chancery court's order and dismiss this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Appellants are the owners of a parcel of land located municipally at 4500 Harding Pike, Nashville, Tennessee 37205. This land is located adjacent to the intersection of White Bridge Pike and Harding Pike and is the former site of a billboard. In recent years, the billboard at the site had been used to advertise a hospital's emergency room wait time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In June 2013, the Appellants applied to the Metropolitan Government Department of Codes and Building Safety for a permit to replace the old billboard that had existed on the site with a new LED digital billboard that was proposed to be located closer to the street. After the Zoning Administrator denied the Appellants' request for a permit, the Appellants appealed to the Metropolitan Board of Zoning Appeals (\"BZA\"). On July 22, 2013, the BZA entered an order upholding the Zoning Administrator's decision to deny a permit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On September 20, 2013, the Appellants filed a petition for a writ of certiorari in the Davidson County Chancery Court. Within their petition, the Appellants contended that the BZA had acted capriciously, illegally, and arbitrarily in denying their application for a permit and contended that its decision was not supported by the evidence. The Appellants also generally contended that the BZA had violated their equal protection rights and asserted that other permit applicants had been granted permits in identical factual circumstances. After the Appellants filed an amended petition for a writ of certiorari on November 12, 2013, the trial court issued a writ of certiorari directing the BZA to make a complete record of its proceedings regarding the subject property available for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Following the filing of the administrative record from the BZA in the trial court, the Appellants filed a motion to supplement the record to include applications for zoning permits the BZA had previously approved that were allegedly identical and/or similar to the Appellants' application. The Appellants asserted that such proof would be relevant to show that the BZA had acted capriciously and arbitrarily in denying their application for a permit. The trial court eventually denied the motion to supplement the record by finding that there were no \"common circumstances between the [proposed evidence] and the [Appellants'] Petition.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On July 29, 2015, the trial court entered an order upholding the BZA's decision to deny the requested permit. Although the Appellants subsequently filed a motion to alter or amend the trial court's ruling pursuant to Rule 59 of the Tennessee Rules of Civil Procedure, the trial court denied the motion by order entered on November 30, 2015. This timely appeal then ensued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On appeal, the Appellants raise two issues for our review. First, they contend that the trial court erred in upholding the BZA's decision to deny a permit. Second, they assert that the trial court erred by denying their motion to supplement the record. As will be explained below, because we conclude that the trial court was without subject matter jurisdiction to review the Appellants' certiorari petition, these raised concerns are pretermitted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \"The concept of subject matter jurisdiction involves a court's lawful authority to adjudicate a controversy brought before it.\"\n   <em>\n    Northland Ins.

App. 2001) (citations omitted). On appeal, we are required to consider the subject matter jurisdiction of both this Court and that of the trial court \"regardless of whether the existence thereof is presented as an issue.\"\n   <em>\n    Morrow v. Bobbitt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11916068\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/943/384/#p392\">\n    943 S.W.2d 384\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 392 (Tenn. Ct.

Metro.

Ct. App. 2006) (citations omitted). In Tennessee, the decision to file a petition for a writ of certiorari is governed by our State Constitution, as well as a number of statutory provisions. In pertinent part, the Tennessee Constitution provides as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   The Judges or Justices of the Inferior Courts of Law and Equity, shall have power in all civil cases, to issue writs of certiorari to remove any cause or the transcript of the record thereof, from any inferior jurisdiction, into such court of law, on sufficient cause, supported by oath or affirmation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Tenn. Const. art. 6, \u00a7 10. In accordance with this provision, the Tennessee Code provides that the \"judges of the inferior courts of law have the power, in all civil cases, to issue writs of certiorari to remove any cause or transcript thereof from any inferior jurisdiction, on sufficient cause, supported by oath or affirmation.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2027-8-104\">\n    Tenn.

Tennessee Code Annotated section 27-8-106 specifically provides that the \"petition for certiorari may be sworn to before the clerk of the circuit court, the judge, any judge of the court of general sessions, or a notary public, and shall state that it is the first application for the writ.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2027-8-106\">\n    Tenn.

The requirement that a petitioner swear to the contents of the petition under oath \"necessarily connotes that the petitioner is first administered an oath and then states in accordance with that oath that the contents of the petition are true.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *3 (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In this case, the Appellants' original petition for a writ of certiorari was timely filed within the sixty-day time period provided for in Tennessee Code Annotated section 27-9-102. It did not, however, comply with the verification requirement of Tennessee Code Annotated section 27-8-106. Attached to the end of the petition was an \"Oath,\" which we reproduce in its entirety below:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   I am a petitioner in this action and a representative of BMP Partnership II and I have personal knowledge of the foregoing facts.

As previously noted, that statute provides that \"[t]he petition for certiorari may be\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     sworn to before\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   the clerk of the circuit court, the judge, any judge of the court of general sessions, or a notary public[.]\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2027-8-106\">\n    Tenn.

Like the first petition, the amended petition contained a representation that the matters set forth in the petition were true and correct, but it did not reflect that it was \"sworn to before the clerk of the circuit court, the judge, any judge of the court of general sessions, or a notary public[.]\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2027-8-106\">\n    Tenn.

Assuming\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   that the amended petition had, in fact, complied with Tennessee Code Annotated section 27-8-106, we note that it was not filed within sixty days of the BZA's order.
