The judgment is affirmed in part; the appeal is dismissed in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Public Defender's pleadings, which are taken as true for purposes of this appeal, asserted that for fiscal year 2017, which began July 1, 2016, and ended June 30, 2017, the General Assembly appropriated $41,497,581 to the Public Defender. This sum represented approximately a $4.5 million increase over the appropriation received in fiscal year 2016. In July 2016, the Governor withheld $3.5 million of the Public Defender's appropriation. The State of Missouri's official financial system, SAM II, indicated that the Public Defender was scheduled to receive $1 million of the $4.5 million increase in four equal quarterly installments of $250,000. The Governor issued a proclamation to the General Assembly that the withholding was made pursuant to his authority to control the rate of expenditure provided in\n   article IV, section 27 of the Missouri Constitution. Article IV, section 27.1 provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   The governor may control the rate at which any appropriation is expended during the period of the appropriation by allotment and may reduce the expenditures of the state or any of its agencies below their appropriations whenever the actual revenues are less than the revenue estimates upon which the appropriations were based. The governor shall not reduce any appropriation for the payment of principle and interest on the public debt.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The withholding represented approximately 1% of the state general revenue appropriated to all state departments for fiscal year 2017 but 8.5% of the budget of the Public Defender.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Public Defender filed its petition for declaratory judgment and injunctive relief against the Governor in July 2016 and its first amended petition in August 2016 asserting four claims that the withholding violated the Missouri Constitution. Count I asserted that the withholding violated the expenditure reduction provision of article IV, section 27 because the Public Defender is not a state agency within the meaning of that provision. Count II asserted that the withholding violated the expenditure reduction provision of article IV, section 27 because the withholding did not apply to the state as a whole. Count III asserted that the withholding violated the expenditure rate control provision of article IV, section 27 because it constituted a permanent expenditure reduction, not a temporary rate control. Finally, Count IV alleged that the withholding violated the separation of powers doctrine in article II, section I because it allowed the executive branch of government to impede the proper functioning of an independent department of the judicial branch.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Governor moved to dismiss all counts on ripeness grounds arguing that fiscal year 2017 \"has barely begun\" and at this point, it could not be known whether the Governor is exercising his constitutional authority to control the rate of appropriation or whether they are being reduced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In September 2016, the trial court dismissed Count III based on ripeness. It denied the motion as to Counts I, II, and IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Governor filed a renewed motion to dismiss based on ripeness or, in the alternative, motion for judgment on the pleadings in October 2016. The trial court granted the motion and entered judgment on the pleadings in favor of the Governor on Counts I, II, and IV. It found that the Public Defender is a \"state agency\" for purposes of article IV, section 27 and that the provision does not require the reduction of expenditures of the state as a whole. Finally, it found that the Public Defender does not exercise judicial power; therefore, it cannot claim that a restriction in its funding by the Governor (the executive) constitutes a violation of the separation of powers clause. This appeal by the Public Defender followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The appellate court reviews the trial court's grant of a motion to dismiss or a motion for judgment on the pleadings\n   <em>\n    de novo.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mo.

In point I, the Public Defender argues that the Governor's withholding under article IV, section 27 violated the separation of powers doctrine in article II, section I because it is an independent department of the judicial branch under section 600.019.1, RSMo 2016, and the withholding targeted it for substantially disproportionate reductions and impermissibly impeded its proper functioning. In points II and III, the Public Defender contends that it is not an agency within the meaning of the expenditure reduction provision of article IV, section 27 and the withholding violated that provision because it did not apply to the state as a whole. Finally, in point IV, the Public Defender contends that the trial court erred in dismissing Count III as not ripe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    Ripeness\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Before addressing the merits, the issue of ripeness is examined. \"A declaratory judgment is not a general panacea for all real and imaginary legal ills.\"\n   <em>\n    Mo.

The provision contains two fiscal control mechanisms. It \"broadly authorizes the governor to control the rate at which any appropriation is expended and to balance the state's budget by reducing expenditures in the event that state revenues fall below the revenue expectations.\"\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

While the Governor indicated in his proclamation to the General Assembly that the withholding was made pursuant to his authority in article IV, section 27 to control the rate of expenditures, the Public Defender framed Counts I, II, and IV of its declaratory judgment action as a challenge to the Governor's authority to reduce expenditures. As in\n   <em>\n    Schweich\n   </em>\n   , such challenges were not ripe because at the time of the trial court's judgment before the end of the fiscal year, it could not be known if the withholding was temporary to control the rate of expenditure or would be permanent or whether the constitutional requirements for permitting a permanent withholding were met, namely, if actual revenues would be less than revenue estimates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Public Defender asserts that this case is unlike\n   <em>\n    Schweich\n   </em>\n   . It contends that article IV, section 27 was amended after the\n   <em>\n    Schweich\n   </em>\n   opinion to include two new subsections that require the Governor to notify the General Assembly by proclamation whenever the Governor exercises one of the fiscal control mechanism in that section-control of the rate of expenditure or reduction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MO. CONST. art. IV, section 27.2 &amp; 27.3. The General Assembly then may reconsider the Governor's rate control or reduction.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Specifically, section 27.2 provides, in pertinent part, \"The governor shall notify the general assembly by proclamation whenever the rate at which any appropriation shall be expended is not equal quarterly allotments, the sum of which shall be equal to the amount of the appropriation.\" MO. CONST. art. IV, section 27.2. Section 3 provides, in pertinent part, \"The governor shall notify the general assembly by proclamation when the governor reduces one or more items or portions of items of appropriation of money as a result of actual revenues being less than the revenue estimates upon which the appropriations were based.\" MO. CONST. art. IV, section 27.3. The Public Defender argues that the Governor subverted the intent of the amendments by labeling the withholding as control of the rate when, in fact, it was a permanent reduction. It argues that SAM II, the state's official financial system, indicated that the Public Defender was scheduled to receive only $1 million of the $4.5 million budget increase in four equal quarterly installments of $250,000. It further argues that the Governor has a history of claiming that withholds are only rate controls but then later proclaiming them to be permanent reductions after the fiscal year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   By its nature, the rate control provision of article IV, section 27 allows the Governor to control the cash flow of an appropriation as revenue comes into the state throughout the fiscal year. If the actual revenues are less than the revenue projections upon which the appropriation is based, the Governor can then permanently reduce the expenditure below the appropriation under the expenditure reduction provision of section 27. While SAM\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   II may have shown the expenditure schedule for $1 million of the budget increase for the Public Defender, nothing in the Public Defender's pleadings showed if or how SAM II accounts for expenditures that are restricted or withheld during the fiscal year. In his proclamation, the Governor notified the General Assembly that the rate of expenditure for the appropriation for the Public Defender is not in equal quarterly allotments, the sum of which shall be equal to the amount of the appropriation. The Public Defender's pleadings did not demonstrate that the Governor's withholding or restriction of $3.5 million from its office was in fact a permanent reduction. And, as discussed in\n   <em>\n    Schweich\n   </em>\n   , before the end of the fiscal year, it could not be known whether the withholding to temporarily control the rate of expenditures would become permanent or whether actual revenues would be less than revenue estimates by the end of the fiscal year. The Public Defender's challenges in Counts I, II, and IV to the Governor's authority to reduce expenditures were, therefore, premature, and the trial court should have dismissed the counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The parties agree, however, that as of the end of the fiscal year, June 30, 2017, it became known that the actual revenues were less than the revenue estimates and the withholding constituted a permanent expenditure reduction, therefore, those claims are now ripe. In some cases, events occurring after the trial court's judgment may be properly considered in weighing a ripeness claim.\n   <em>\n    Lower Colo. River Auth. v.

With the close of the 2017 fiscal year and the parties' agreement that the withholding constituted a permanent expenditure\n   reduction, a decision regarding the Governor's authority to control the rate of expenditures is unnecessary.

The Missouri Constitution declares:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   The powers of government shall be divided into three distinct departments-the legislative, executive, and judicial-each of which shall be confided to a separate magistracy, and no person, or collection of persons, charged with the exercise of powers properly belonging to one of those departments, shall exercise any power properly belonging to either of the others, except in the instances in this constitution expressly directed or permitted.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   MO.

Article IV, section 12, which sets out the composition of the executive department, provides in pertinent part, \"Unless discontinued all present or future boards, bureaus, commissions and other agencies of the state exercising administrative or executive authority shall be assigned by law or by the governor as provided by law to the office of administration or to one of the fifteen administrative departments to which their respective powers and duties are germane.\" Article IV, section 16, which recognizes the authority of the executive branch to issue regulations, provides, \"All rules and regulations of any board or other administrative agency of the executive department, except those relating to its organization and internal management, shall take effect no less than ten days after the filing thereof in the office of the secretary of state.\" To hold that the term state agency in article IV, section 27 is limited to executive branch administrative agencies as urged by the Public Defender would render the modifying clause \"exercising administrative or executive authority\" in section 12 and the modifiers \"administrative\" and \"of the executive department\" in section 16 wholly redundant and superfluous. A court must assume that every word contained in a constitutional provision has effect and meaning and is not mere surplusage.\n   <em>\n    State v.

It argues that it was targeted for a substantially disproportionate reduction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The Public Defender recognizes that the expenditure reduction provision of article IV, section 27.1 is stated in the disjunctive, allowing the Governor to reduce the expenditures either of the state or any state agencies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <em>\n    Council Plaza Redevelopment Corp. v.

As discussed above, the Public Defender is a state agency as the term in used in the provision.
