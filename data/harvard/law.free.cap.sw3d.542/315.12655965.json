In each case, the trial court granted summary judgment in the co-employees' favor. On appeal, this Court affirms because the plaintiffs failed to allege the co-employees breached a duty separate and distinct from an employer's duty to provide a reasonably safe workplace, i.e., a breach of a duty unrelated to employment or a breach of the employer's duty to provide a safe workplace that was not reasonably foreseeable to the employer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Conner\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In 2007, Michael Conner was injured after touching a live power line he thought had been de-energized. On the day of the accident, Conner, a journeyman lineman, was working near an old shoe factory to retire a transformer bank for his employer, Intercounty Electric Cooperative Association (\"Intercounty\"). Conner was joined by four co-employees, including Dale Ogletree and Scott Kidwell. Ogletree, a supervisor, was responsible for enforcing Intercounty's safety manual, rules, and guidelines as the crew worked. Intercounty's safety manual meticulously explains how to safely de-energize a power line. Those instructions were not followed on the day of the accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Before Conner arrived, Kidwell (a serviceman) used an improper tool to de-energize the power line and did not properly confirm the line had been de-energized. He and the rest of the crew mistakenly believed he had successfully de-energized the line and began working next to it. Conner later arrived at the work site. Seeing the rest of the crew working next to the line, Connor assumed it had been de-energized. Out of caution, Conner asked Ogletree whether the line had been de-energized. Even though Ogletree had not properly confirmed the line was de-energized, Ogletree told Conner it was. Conner then climbed atop a work platform and attempted to cut the line. The resulting shock blew him off the platform and rendered him a quadriplegic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Conner brought a negligence action against Kidwell and Ogletree, alleging they negligently carried out the details of their work in several respects. Generally, Conner alleged Kidwell failed to de-energize the line, failed to ensure the line had been de-energized, failed to warn Connor the line had not been de-energized, and failed to abide by Intercounty's safety rules. Conner also alleged Ogletree failed to supervise Kidwell in carrying out these responsibilities. Kidwell and Ogletree argued that Conner's petition merely alleges breaches of Intercounty's nondelegable duty to provide a reasonably safe workplace.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The trial court agreed and granted summary judgment. Connor appealed, this Court granted transfer, and it has jurisdiction under article V, section 10, of the Missouri Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Evans\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In November 2009, Russell Evans was injured on the job when a forklift driven by his co-employee, Monte Barrett, struck him and ran over his foot. Evans and Barrett were working to construct apartment buildings for their employer, Wilco Contractors, Inc. (\"Wilco\"). At the time of the accident, Barrett was driving a forklift with a load of trusses hanging from one of its two prongs. To stabilize the load, Evans walked alongside and held a tagline connected to the forklift and trusses. Barrett allegedly hit a rock, causing the load to shift. As the load shifted, Evans was pulled toward the forklift, which struck him and ran over his foot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Evans sued Barrett for negligently operating the forklift. Barrett argued that Evans' petition merely alleges a breach of Wilco's nondelegable duty to provide a reasonably safe workplace. The trial court agreed and granted summary judgment in Barrett's favor. Evans appealed, this Court granted transfer, and it has jurisdiction under article V, section 10, of the Missouri Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   This Court reviews a grant of summary judgment\n   <em>\n    de novo.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Parr v.

To determine whether Conner and Evans met this burden, this Court must examine the scope of an employer's nondelegable duty to provide a safe workplace at common law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The common law surrounding workplace injuries arose against the backdrop of\n   <em>\n    re\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    spondeat superior\n   </em>\n   , i.e., the principle that a master generally is liable for the acts of its servants within the course and scope of their employment. Using this doctrine, an employee could sue the employer for injuries resulting from a co-employee's negligence. To prevent this, this Court-and others-adopted an exception to the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior\n   </em>\n   known as the \"fellow servant\" rule, holding an employer was not liable for an employee's injury resulting from the negligence of a co-employee.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McDermott v.

A review of these common law principles is instructive only because they set the stage for an exclusion to the \"fellow servant\" exception known as the \"nondelegable duty\" rule.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hough v.

(\"[P]erhaps the most important [exception to the 'fellow servant' rule] arises from the obligation of the master, whether a natural person or a corporate body, not to expose the servant, when conducting the master's business, to perils or hazards against which he may be guarded by proper diligence upon the part of the master.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   This exclusion was referred to as the \"nondelegable duty\" rule because this Court (and many others) had held the \"duty of the master to exercise ordinary care to furnish his servant a reasonably safe place ... cannot be delegated.\"\n   <em>\n    Bender v.

The name \"nondelegable duty\" was somewhat misleading, however, because this Court repeatedly had emphasized that corporations and other employers often can act only through their employees. As a result, such employers had no choice but to delegate to their employees the responsibility for complying with this \"nondelegable duty.\"\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Dayharsh v.

If true, the allegations show Kidwell was negligent, but that is beside the point. The question presented is whether, assuming Kidwell was negligent, his negligence was due to a breach of Intercounty's duty to provide a reasonably safe workplace or a breach of some duty separate and distinct from Intercounty's duty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The risks associated with working around an energized line are reasonably foreseeable to Intercounty. Therefore, the duty to ensure lines are de-energized before its workers confront them is part of Intercounty's nondelegable duty to provide its workers with a reasonably safe workplace. It attempted to fulfill these duties by promulgating safety rules and relying upon its workers and supervisors to ensure transmission lines were de-energized. There is no reason to believe Intercounty was negligent in doing so, but that-too-is irrelevant because Intercounty is immune for any liability stemming from its own negligence or that of its employees. Instead, what matters is whether Kidwell's negligence in fulfilling Intercounty's duty to ensure the line was de-energized was reasonably foreseeable to Intercounty. It was. Accordingly, Kidwell's negligence was due to a breach of Intercounty's nondelegable duty to provide a safe workplace.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   At common law, prior to workers' compensation, Intercounty would have been liable for Kidwell's negligence. In the present circumstances, however, the trial court properly granted summary judgment in Kidwell's favor.\n   <em>\n    Peters\n   </em>\n   , 489 S.W.3d at 800 (employer has a \"nondelegable duty to provide a safe work environment, and it breaches that duty where it charged an employee with the responsibility to provide a reasonably safe work environment but the employee did not so provide\") (citing\n   <em>\n    Bender\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=276%20S.W.%20405\">\n    276 S.W. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   406 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Similarly, Conner claimed Ogletree negligently carried out the details of his work by failing to ensure the line was de-energized, failing to warn Conner the line was energized, failing to abide by Intercounty's safety rules, and failing to\n   properly supervise Kidwell. In every instance, the thing Conner alleges Ogletree failed to do was something Intercounty instructed Ogletree to do as part of Intercounty fulfilling its duty to provide a reasonably safe workplace. More importantly, it was reasonably foreseeable to Intercounty that an employee would be negligent in carrying out these responsibilities in the way Ogletree was negligent.\n   <em>\n    Peters\n   </em>\n   , 489 S.W.3d at 799 (affirming judgment because \"this is a classic case of a supervisory employee breaching the employer's nondelegable duty to provide a safe workplace\"). Accordingly, Conner failed to allege Ogletree breached a duty separate and distinct from Intercounty's duty to provide a reasonably safe workplace, and the trial court properly granted summary judgment in Ogletree's favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Evans\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Evans, like Conner, alleged his co-employee negligently carried out the details of his work in that Evans claims Barrett negligently drove the forklift and was not licensed, certified, or adequately trained to operate the forklift safely. Injuries to employees working on and around moving forklifts were reasonably foreseeable to Wilco and, therefore, Wilco had a duty to take reasonable precautions to protect its employees from such risks. Moreover, it was reasonably foreseeable to Wilco that an employee would be injured if a co-employee negligently operated a forklift in the same way Evans alleges Barrett was negligent in this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 795 (\"[i]ncluded within the employer's duty to provide a safe workplace is a duty to see that instrumentalities of the workplace are used safely\");\n   <em>\n    Parr\n   </em>\n   , 489 S.W.3d at 779 (duty to ensure that all drivers were \"safe to operate a commercial motor vehicle\" fell \"squarely within the [employer's] duty to provide a safe workplace\").
