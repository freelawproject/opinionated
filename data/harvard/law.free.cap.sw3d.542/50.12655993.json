Boyce, Justice\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Appellee Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. sued appellant Gerald Godoy to collect a deficiency on a debt that Godoy guaranteed. Godoy moved for summary judgment on grounds that Wells Fargo's claims were\n   barred by a two-year statute of limitations applying to deficiency claims; Wells Fargo moved for partial summary judgment on grounds that Godoy contractually waived any limitations defense. The trial court denied Godoy's motion for summary judgment, granted Wells Fargo's motion as well as a subsequent motion for summary judgment on the deficiency claim, and signed a final judgment in favor of Wells Fargo.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   At issue in this appeal is whether a general waiver of \"any and all rights or defenses\" that might be available to a guarantor is sufficient to waive application of a shortened statute of limitations applicable to deficiency actions. Because the Texas Supreme Court has determined that such a waiver applies to all defenses under the applicable statute, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Wachovia Bank loaned $250,000 to GDG Mortgage, Inc. in 2005. The loan was evidenced by a promissory note and secured by a construction deed of trust on certain real property. Godoy guaranteed the promissory note.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   GDG defaulted on the note, and Wells Fargo-Wachovia's successor by merger and holder of the note-foreclosed on the real property securing the note on November 1, 2011. Wells Fargo purchased the real property at the foreclosure sale with a bid that was insufficient to satisfy the outstanding balance on the promissory note, leaving a deficiency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Wells Fargo sued Godoy to collect the deficiency on June 24, 2015-more than three years after the foreclosure sale. Godoy moved for summary judgment on the sole ground that Wells Fargo's claim was barred by a shortened two-year statute of limitations applicable to suits to collect deficiencies from guarantors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2051.003\">\n    Tex.

Wells Fargo moved for partial summary judgment on Godoy's limitations defense, asserting that Godoy specifically waived his limitations defense in the guaranty agreement. The trial court denied Godoy's motion for summary judgment and granted Wells Fargo's motion for partial summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Wells Fargo then moved for final summary judgment on its deficiency claim seeking judgment for the outstanding balance as well as attorney's fees and costs. The trial court granted Wells Fargo's motion for summary judgment on its deficiency claim against Godoy and signed a final judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   A party moving for summary judgment must conclusively prove all elements of its cause of action or defense as a matter of law.

So, Godoy agreed to the waiver and also agreed that the waiver would cease to be effective once a court determined that the waiver violated public policy.

Instead, Wells Fargo asserted that Godoy was not entitled to a new trial based on this defense because Godoy waived the defense by not pleading it in his answer and by not asserting it in his summary-judgment response.\n   <footnotemark>\n    96\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, Wells Fargo's motion-for-new-trial response did not contain an objection that Godoy was relying on a summary-judgment argument without a pleading required to support that argument.\n   <footnotemark>\n    97\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   In addition, even if Wells Fargo had complained in its motion-for-new-trial response that Godoy was asserting this defense in the summary-judgment proceedings without any pleading to support the defense, this complaint would have been untimely and incompetent to avoid trial by consent, given that Wells Fargo filed this response after the trial court granted summary judgment, rejected Godoy's Public Policy Argument, and rendered a final judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    98\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   The majority also relies upon\n   <em>\n    950 Corbindale, L.P.\n   </em>\n   as support for its conclusion that by failing to plead the Public Policy Argument, Godoy waived the defense even without an objection from Wells Fargo.\n   <footnotemark>\n    99\n   </footnotemark>\n   In\n   <em>\n    950 Corbindale, L.P.\n   </em>\n   , this court held that a party waived its argument that the arbitration agreements caused a waiver of rights and remedies and thus were unconscionable when the party failed to raise this argument at any point in the trial court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    100\n   </footnotemark>\n   In today's case, Godoy raised the defense in response to Wells Fargo's summary-judgment motion. Unlike today's case,\n   <em>\n    950 Corbindale, L.P.\n   </em>\n   did not involve a void-as-against-public-policy defense. The statements in\n   <em>\n    950 Corbindale, L.P.\n   </em>\n   on which the majority relies are not necessary to the court's holding, so they are nonbinding obiter dicta.\n   <footnotemark>\n    101\n   </footnotemark>\n   And, the obiter dicta from\n   <em>\n    950 Corbindale, L.P.\n   </em>\n   are not on point.\n   <footnotemark>\n    102\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nor do they compel the conclusion that Godoy would waive the Public Policy Argument by failing to plead it in his answer, even with no objection by Wells Fargo.\n   <footnotemark>\n    103\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   <strong>\n    This court should reverse, not affirm.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   The majority errs in concluding that the provision in the guaranty agreement completely waiving the statute of limitations in section 51.003(a) does not violate public policy. Established precedent from the Supreme Court of Texas says that it does. Godoy did not have to plead the Public Policy Argument in his answer because the Facial Exception relieved him of complying with that requirement. Even if a pleading were required, Wells Fargo tried the issue by consent because Wells Fargo did not object before rendition of judgment that Godoy was asserting this defense in the absence of any pleading to support it. Godoy did not waive this defense, and he preserved error in the trial court by raising the defense in his summary-judgment response.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   In the course of explaining its rejection of the Public Policy Argument, the majority creates a lack of uniformity in this court's decisions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    104\n   </footnotemark>\n   Instead of rejecting the Public Policy Argument, this court should sustain Godoy's sole appellate issue, reverse the trial court's judgment, and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-101\">\n    The dissent heads down a rabbit trail by discussing whether an affirmative pleading is required when illegality is claimed only as to one provision of a contract-as opposed to a different circumstance in which the entire contract is claimed to be illegal. Any such distinction is irrelevant here because the guaranty agreement at issue is not illegal on its face-in whole or in part. The guaranty agreement is not illegal on its face because (1) its express waiver of all section 51.003 defenses \"does not violate public policy,\"\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Grace Interest, LLC\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6938968\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/431/110/#p118\">\n     431 S.W.3d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    128 ; and (2) the guaranty agreement expressly says the separate provision addressing waiver of other potentially applicable limitations periods \"shall be effective only to the extent permitted by law or public policy.\" If the guaranty agreement's separate, open-ended waiver of any other limitations period outside of section 51.003 is not enforceable as the dissent contends, then the guaranty agreement on its face says this separate waiver is not effective. If the guaranty expressly provides that the open-ended waiver of any other limitations period is not effective, then the guaranty agreement is not illegal on its face-in whole or in part. And if the guaranty agreement is not illegal on its face even in part, then the dissent's posited distinction makes no difference to the resolution of this appeal.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-102\">\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Simpson v.
