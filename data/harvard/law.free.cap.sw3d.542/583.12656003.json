Crim. App. 2013) ). I dissent for the reasons stated in my dissenting opinion in\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Fournier\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6839235\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/473/789/#p800\">\n    473 S.W.3d 789\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 800-805 (Tex. Crim. App. 2015) (Yeary, J., dissenting). However, I write further because I believe it is time for the Court to reconsider whether the decision in\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Lo\n   </em>\n   was decided correctly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Lo\n   </em>\n   , the Court invalidated Section 33.021(b) of the Penal Code on the ground that the statute was unconstitutionally overbroad because the statute prohibited a substantial amount of protected speech and was not narrowly tailored to promote a compelling State interest.\n   <em>\n    Lo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6951634\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/424/10/\">\n    424 S.W.3d at 18-19, 23-24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Chance,\n   </em>\n   the Court applied\n   <em>\n    Lo\n   </em>\n   retroactively despite the fact that the applicant in\n   <em>\n    Chance\n   </em>\n   never argued the statute's constitutionality at trial or on direct appeal.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6923726\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/439/918/#p918\">\n    439 S.W.3d 918\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 918 (Tex. Crim. App. 2014). And later, in\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Fournier\n   </em>\n   , the Court affirmed the retroactive application of\n   <em>\n    Lo\n   </em>\n   , noting that an unconstitutional statute is void from its inception.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6839235\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/473/789/#p800\">\n    473 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   796 n.54.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Mitcham,\n   </em>\n   No. WR-87,738-01,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%20847655\">\n    2018 WL 847655\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Tex. Crim. App. Feb. 14, 2018) (Yeary, J., concurring), I noted that the Court has granted over forty-five applicants post-conviction relief since\n   <em>\n    Fournier\n   </em>\n   was decided, on the basis that Section 33.021(b) was declared unconstitutionally overbroad. Not one of the applicants could demonstrate that their conduct constituted protected speech or that the statute was unconstitutionally applied to them.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Nevertheless, the Court granted post-conviction relief to the applicant in\n   <em>\n    Mitcham\n   </em>\n   , along with three other applicants in separate cases.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%20847655\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Perry\n   </em>\n   , No. WR-87,925-01,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%20850481\">\n    2018 WL 850481\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Tex.

Because our decision in\n   <em>\n    Lo\n   </em>\n   could potentially mislead members of the Legislative Department concerning their legitimate authority to regulate conduct, I believe that the Court should reconsider whether it was decided correctly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Because the Court does not, I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
