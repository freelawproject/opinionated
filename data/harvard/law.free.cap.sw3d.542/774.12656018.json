After real party in interest Ralph Figgs refused to produce the settlement agreements, relator GreCon, Inc. moved to compel Figgs to produce them. The trial court denied the motion. GreCon asks this court to grant mandamus relief compelling the Honorable Michael Gomez, presiding judge of the 129th District Court of Harris County, to vacate the order denying GreCon's motion to compel and to sign an order compelling Figgs to supplement his disclosure responses and produce the settlement agreements.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   We conditionally grant this mandamus relief, though the grounds for conditionally granting relief divide the panel. Justices Boyce and Jewell conclude that mandamus should conditionally issue for the reasons stated in section I, whereas Chief Justice Frost and Justice Jewell conclude mandamus should conditionally issue for the reasons stated in section II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Figgs suffered injuries during a fire at a plywood manufacturing plant owned by Georgia Pacific South. Seeking recovery for his injuries, Figgs sued GreCon, asserting claims for negligence, gross negligence, strict liability, and breach of express and implied warranties in connection with the sale, installation, and maintenance of the detection, prevention, and suppression systems, which Figgs claims failed to prevent, warn, or eliminate hazards that caused the explosion. Figgs also sued a number of other defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Figgs settled with defendants Georgia Pacific LLC, Georgia Pacific Building Products, LLC, Georgia Pacific Wood Products LLC, Georgia Pacific Wood Products South LLC, Georgia Pacific Equity Holdings LLC, International Paper Company, and Mid-South Engineering, Inc. (collectively the \"Settling Parties\"). Under Rule of Civil Procedure 194.2, GreCon requested disclosure from Figgs of \"any settlement agreements described in Rule 192.3(g).\" Tex. R. Civ. P. 194.2(h) . Rule 192.3(g) provides that \"[a] party may obtain discovery of the existence and contents of any relevant portions of a settlement agreement.\" Tex. R. Civ. P. 192.3(g). When Figgs refused to produce any of his settlement agreements with one or more of the Settling Parties (collectively the \"Settlement Agreements\"), GreCon filed its motion to compel Figgs to supplement his response to the request for disclosure under Rule 194.2(h) and to produce copies of all the Settlement Agreements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The trial court held a hearing on June 12, 2017, and a few months later denied GreCon's motion to compel the Settlement Agreements, stating the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   After having conducted an in camera review of the proffered settlement agreements, and after considering the motions, responses, and arguments of counsel, the Court is of the opinion that the motions should be DENIED, at this time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS THEREFORE, ORDERED AND ADJUDGED\n   </strong>\n   that Defendant GreCon's (and all other Defendants') Motions to Compel Settlement Agreements are hereby\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   , at this time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The trial further stated in a footnote in the order that \"Defendants may be entitled to the settlement agreements at trial and may re-urge the same at that time.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In this mandamus proceeding, GreCon asserts that the Settlement Agreements are relevant because GreCon needs them to: (1) prove up its entitlement to settlement credits; (2) evaluate any potential witness bias; and (3) evaluate GreCon's potential exposure before trial. GreCon asks this court to grant mandamus relief compelling the respondent to vacate his order denying GreCon's motion to compel and to sign an order compelling Figgs to supplement his disclosure responses and produce the Settlement Agreements.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    MANDAMUS STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Generally, to be entitled to mandamus relief, a relator must demonstrate (1) the trial court clearly abused its discretion; and (2) the relator has no adequate remedy by appeal.\n   <em>\n    In re Nat'l Lloyds Ins.

Figgs signed a settlement agreement with defendants International Paper Company, Georgia-Pacific LLC, Georgia-Pacific Building Products LLC, Georgia-Pacific Equity Holdings LLC, Georgia-Pacific Wood Products LLC, and Georgia-Pacific Wood Products South LLC (among other Georgia-Pacific entities) on February 22, 2017. Figgs also settled with Mid-South Engineering Company in a separate agreement, but our copy of that settlement agreement\n   is not dated.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to GreCon, it learned of at least the International Paper and Georgia-Pacific entities settlements in early March 2017. GreCon served Figgs with requests for disclosure on March 3, which included a request under Rule 194.2(h) for \"settlement agreements described in Rule 192.3(g).\" Three days later, on March 6, Figgs filed a non-suit of the International Paper and Georgia-Pacific entities without disclosing that a settlement had occurred. Figgs's responses to GreCon's requests for disclosure were due April 3. Figgs timely served a response, which stated as to \"discoverable settlement agreements,\" \"none at this time.\" By April 3, Figgs did not file a motion for protection (or any other motion) arguing that any portion of the undisclosed Settlement Agreements ought to be withheld from production on relevancy or other grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   GreCon filed a motion to compel, to which Figgs responded. In the relevant documents, GreCon argued that Settlement Agreements existed, they were relevant and discoverable, and they were past due because the mandatory thirty-day deadline for production had expired and Figgs had not disclosed the agreements. GreCon argued in its motion to compel that the Settlement Agreements were discoverable under Rule 194.2(h) and that Figgs had failed to supplement his disclosure responses. In Figgs's response, filed June 9, 2017, he argued that it was GreCon's burden to prove the Settlement Agreements' relevance. In reply, GreCon urged that it was Figgs's burden to prove that any portion of the Settlement Agreements ought to be withheld from disclosure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The existence and contents of relevant portions of settlement agreements are presumptively discoverable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tex.

P. 192.6(a) (person affected by discovery request may move for protection \"within the time permitted\n   for response to the discovery request\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Figgs did not meet his burden of proof because he did not timely or properly assert his relevancy arguments for two reasons. First, Figgs did not file a motion for protection. Figgs's first filing challenging the relevance of the Settlement Agreements was his response to GreCon's motion to compel. Even construing Figgs's response as a motion for protection, it came too late because it was filed after the April 3, 2017 disclosure deadline. The deadline to fully respond to the disclosure requests having passed, any attempt by Figgs to meet his burden in the response to the motion to compel was moot. Figgs did not invoke the protections available under rule 192.6.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Morse\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9035646\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/153/578/#p582\">\n    153 S.W.3d 578\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 582 (Tex. App.-Amarillo 2004, orig. proceeding) (party's failure to fully respond to request for disclosure or move for protection constituted abuse of discovery process). Thus, Figgs's arguments asserted for the first time in response to GreCon's motion to compel were insufficient to establish that any portion of the Settlement Agreements-\"information ordinarily discoverable\"-should be protected from disclosure on relevancy grounds.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tex. R. Civ. P. 194, 194.5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Second, Figgs's response to the request for disclosure, though timely, also did not advance his burden of proof. He responded that no \"discoverable\" settlement agreements existed. Although, as discussed\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   in Section II, Figgs's argument against disclosure focuses on the relevance of the settlement\n   <em>\n    amounts\n   </em>\n   , other aspects of the Settlement Agreements were unquestionably relevant and discoverable at the time Figgs served his response to the requests for disclosure.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    White v. Zhou Pei\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6889580\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/452/527/#p548\">\n    452 S.W.3d 527\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 548 (Tex. App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 2014, no pet.) (\"Settlement agreements are generally discoverable, and not just once a settlement credit is deemed to apply.\"). These include, at a minimum, the identity of all settling parties and the scope of the claims released. In GreCon's answer, it pleaded comparative fault and proportionate responsibility under Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code chapter 33.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2033.003\">\n    Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. \u00a7 33.003\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (West 2015). GreCon also pleaded its right to credits or offsets resulting from settlements with co-defendants.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2033.003\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 33.012, 33.013 (West 2105). Given those pleadings, GreCon was entitled to know the identity of all settling parties because the court is required to include a jury submission in the charge as to settling persons, assuming the evidence supports it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2033.003\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 33.003(a)(3). GreCon has a right to know that information before trial. It was due thirty days after the requests for disclosure were served, absent a motion for protection, which Figgs did not file. Figgs has not contested this point yet he nonetheless failed to disclose even the existence of the Settlement Agreements when he served his timely response. Accordingly, Figgs's disclosure response, which disclosed no portion of the Settlement Agreements and stated that no \"discoverable\" settlement agreements existed as of April 3, was misleading and an abuse of the discovery process.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tex. R. Civ. P. 194 cmt. 1;\n   <em>\n    Morse\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9035646\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/153/578/#p582\">\n    153 S.W.3d at 581\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Rule 194 does not contain any exceptions for settlement agreements other than the motion for protection procedure. If it were true, as Figgs argues, that settlement agreements were not relevant \"before trial,\" then the rules would not require their disclosure thirty days following a valid request, and Rule 193.5 would not require their supplementation thirty days before trial. Tex. R. Civ. P. 193.5. The burden was on Figgs to show why the Settlement Agreements should not be disclosed,\n   and to make that showing by the deadline to respond to the requests for disclosure. Because Figgs did not meet his burden to demonstrate by the applicable deadline that any portion of the Settlement Agreements should be withheld from disclosure, GreCon was entitled to full and unredacted disclosure of all Settlement Agreements on or before April 3, 2017. The trial court's refusal to compel production of the Settlement Agreements was a clear abuse of discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    II. The Settlement Agreements Are Relevant and Discoverable Before Trial\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   GreCon contends that the Settlement Agreements are relevant: (1) for determining settlement credits; (2) evaluating whether any witness at trial will be biased against GreCon; and (3) determining GreCon's potential exposure and evaluating its trial strategy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

But, I respectfully decline to join section I of the majority opinion because in it the court relies upon a waiver argument not presented to the respondent trial judge, not argued in this mandamus proceeding, not necessary to the disposition of today's case, and not correct under applicable law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The majority improperly grants mandamus relief based on a waiver argument that no party presented to the trial judge.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Real party in interest Ralph Figgs sued various parties, including Georgia Pacific LLC, Georgia Pacific Building Products, LLC, Georgia Pacific Wood Products LLC, Georgia Pacific Wood Products South LLC, Georgia Pacific Equity Holdings LLC, International Paper Company and Mid-South Engineering, Inc. (collectively\n   the \"Settling Parties\"), as well as relator GreCon, Inc. Under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 194.2, GreCon requested disclosure from Figgs of \"any settlement agreements described in Rule 192.3(g).\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rule 192.3(g) provides that \"[a] party may obtain discovery of the existence and contents of any relevant portions of a settlement agreement.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, GreCon asked Figgs to disclose the existence and contents of any relevant portions of a settlement agreement. Figgs timely responded to this request on April 2, 2017, asserting that there were no relevant portions of a settlement agreement at the time of Figgs's response.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   After Figgs's counsel informed GreCon that Figgs had settled with various defendants, GreCon moved to compel Figgs to supplement his response to the request for disclosure with information as to Figgs's settlements with the Settling Parties and to \"produce copies of all settlement agreements.\" Figgs responded in opposition, arguing that at present no part of any settlement agreement with one of the Settling Parties was relevant. Figgs asserted that GreCon had not met its burden of establishing relevancy. In his response, Figgs expressly moved the court for protection from discovery based on the arguments asserted in the response. In its reply GreCon asserted that all portions of Figgs's settlement agreements with one or more of the Settling Parties (hereinafter the \"Settlement Agreements\") were relevant and that Figgs had the burden to show that the Settlement Agreements were not relevant. Though GreCon argued that Figgs had not satisfied this burden in his response to GreCon's motion to compel, GreCon did not assert that Figgs had to satisfy this burden by April 3, 2017, the deadline for responding to the request for disclosure (hereinafter the \"Request-for-Disclosure Deadline\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   At no time in the trial court did GreCon or any other party assert that Figgs had waived his argument that the Settlement Agreements are not relevant by failing to assert that argument in a motion for protection filed by the Request-for-Disclosure Deadline (hereinafter the \"Waiver Argument\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   In section I of the majority opinion, the majority concludes that Figgs waived his argument that the Settlement Agreements are not relevant by failing to assert the argument in a motion for protection filed by the Request-for-Disclosure Deadline.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The majority grants mandamus relief based on the Waiver Argument, an argument that no party presented to the respondent trial judge.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In doing so the majority contradicts binding precedent under which this court may not grant mandamus relief based on an argument that the relator did not present to the trial judge.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under the majority's analysis, even if no part of the Settlement Agreements were relevant, the trial court still would have abused its discretion in denying the relator's motion to compel and Figgs still would have to produce the Settlement Agreements because Figgs waived his relevancy argument by not asserting it by the Request-for-Disclosure Deadline.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   In section I of the majority opinion, the majority concludes that Figgs did not meet\n   his burden of proving that the Settlement Agreements were not relevant because Figgs failed to file a motion for protection asserting this relevancy argument by the Request-for-Disclosure Deadline.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The term \"burden of proof\" refers to a party's duty to prove an assertion or charge; the term does not refer to any applicable deadline by which a party must make an assertion or charge.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Presuming for the sake of argument that Figgs was required to assert the relevancy argument by the Request-for-Disclosure Deadline, Figgs's failure to timely assert this argument would not constitute a failure to satisfy a burden of proving it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rather, a failure to timely assert the argument would constitute a waiver of the argument, and there would be no need to determine whether Figgs satisfied his burden of proving the relevancy argument.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   In addition to incorrectly asserting that Figgs's alleged duty to assert his relevancy argument by the Request-for-Disclosure Deadline constitutes part of Figgs's burden of proving the relevancy argument, the majority also states that the parties disputed in the trial court and in this court whether Figgs had the burden of proving that the Settlement Agreements were not relevant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   To the extent the majority is suggesting in section I that the parties raised the Waiver Argument in the trial court and in this court, this suggestion clashes with the record. The parties have disputed whether in responding to GreCon's motion to compel, Figgs had the burden to prove that the Settlement Agreements were not relevant or whether GreCon, in moving to compel, had the burden to prove that the Settlement Agreements were relevant. No party has argued that Figgs waived his relevancy argument by failing to assert the argument by the Request-for-Disclosure Deadline.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Requiring a relator to raise an issue in the trial court or forfeit the issue as a potential basis for obtaining mandamus relief against the trial judge gives the trial judge a chance to consider the claimed error and, if appropriate, correct it. The trial judge in today's case never got that chance. Nor did Figgs get the chance to respond to the Waiver Argument, which is an issue of apparent first impression in Texas jurisprudence. Thus, under applicable law, GreCon should not able to get mandamus relief based on an argument that GreCon did not raise in the proceedings before the trial judge.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nonetheless, in section I, the majority grants mandamus relief based on the Waiver Argument, even though GreCon did not present the argument to the respondent trial judge.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The court improperly grants mandamus based on a waiver argument that GreCon waived by its failure to raise or brief the argument in its mandamus petition.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   In GreCon's mandamus petition,\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   GreCon does not assert that GreCon is entitled to mandamus relief based on the Waiver Argument. GreCon's petition contains no argument, analysis, record citations, or legal authority in support of the Waiver Argument.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   So, GreCon waived the Waiver Argument by not briefing it in the mandamus petition, and this court may not grant mandamus relief based on the Waiver Argument.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   The analysis in section II-based on arguments presented to the respondent trial judge and briefed in GreCon's mandamus petition-provides ample basis to grant mandamus relief. This court should not stretch for a reason to grant mandamus that was not raised in this court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   Instead, the court should grant mandamus relief based only on the analysis in section II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Even if it were proper to consider the Waiver Argument, the argument would not provide a basis for granting mandamus relief.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Presuming for the sake of argument that (1) GreCon presented the Waiver Argument to the respondent as a reason to grant GreCon's \"Motion to Compel Production of Settlement Agreements\"; (2) GreCon briefed the Waiver Argument in its mandamus petition; and (3) this court must reach the Waiver Argument because the other arguments in GreCon's mandamus petition lack merit, this court would have to address the issue. Yet, neither the parties nor the majority have cited any Texas case addressing the Waiver Argument, and research has not revealed any. The issue appears to be one of first impression under Texas law, and for this additional reason the Waiver Argument would be better left for another day and another case-one in which the parties have raised it and briefed it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   As allowed under Rule 194.2(h), GreCon requested that Figgs disclose \"the existence\n   and contents of any relevant portions of a settlement agreement.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   Figgs responded before the Request-for-Disclosure Deadline. In his response to the request under Rule 194.2(h), Figgs asserted that there were no relevant portions of a settlement agreement at the time of Figgs's response.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   Even presuming for the sake of argument that Figgs had to assert by the Request-for-Disclosure Deadline any privilege, any ground for protection from discovery, or any basis for avoiding disclosure of all relevant portions of a settlement agreement, Figgs's failure to assert any of these matters would mean only that Figgs had a duty to disclose to GreCon \"the existence and contents of any relevant portions of a settlement agreement.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   The relevance of all or part of any settlement agreement in Figgs's possession is a matter subject to dispute. In his timely response and in his arguments in opposition to GreCon's motion to compel in the trial court and GreCon's mandamus petition in this court, Figgs has asserted that no part of the Settlement Agreements is relevant. Under the unambiguous text of the rules of civil procedure, by failing to file a motion for protection or assert a privilege by the Request-for Disclosure Deadline, Figgs did not waive his right to argue that the Settlement Agreements are not relevant in response to GreCon's motion to compel.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   No rule or other legal authority required Figgs to assert by the Request-for-Disclosure Deadline a motion for protection or other motion presenting argument and proof that the Settlement Agreements are not relevant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   Figgs timely argued that the Settlement Agreements are not relevant in response to GreCon's motion to compel. Figgs did not waive this argument by failing to assert it in a motion before the Request-for-Disclosure Deadline.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Though the majority concludes that Figgs waived this argument by failing to assert it and prove it in a motion filed by the Request-for-Disclosure Deadline, the majority cites no rule, case, or other legal authority that imposes this requirement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   The majority cites\n   <em>\n    In re Morse\n   </em>\n   , but that case imposes no such requirement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   In\n   <em>\n    Morse\n   </em>\n   , the real parties in interest did not fully respond to a request for disclosure of identity information as to potential parties under Rule 194.2(b) ; there was no issue as to a request for disclosure under Rule 194.2(h).\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   In today's case, Figgs moved for protection and presented non-frivolous arguments in the trial court that the respondent trial judge should deny GreCon's motion to compel because the Settlement Agreements are not relevant. In\n   <em>\n    Morse\n   </em>\n   , the real parties in interest did not move for protection, nor did they assert in the\n   mandamus proceeding that the requested information was privileged or that they had a valid basis for seeking protection.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   In\n   <em>\n    Morse\n   </em>\n   , Rule 194.2(b) required the disclosure of the name, address, and telephone number of any potential parties, and the real parties did not argue that the information at issue was not the name, address, and telephone number of any potential parties.\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   In today's case, Rule 194.2(h) requires the disclosure of the existence and contents of any relevant portions of a settlement agreement, and Figgs argued in the trial court and in this proceeding that no part of the Settlement Agreements is relevant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   Though the\n   <em>\n    Morse\n   </em>\n   court stated that the real parties in interest's failure either to file a motion for protection or to fully respond to the request for disclosure constituted an abuse of the discovery process, the\n   <em>\n    Morse\n   </em>\n   court did not hold that any argument had been waived, nor did the\n   <em>\n    Morse\n   </em>\n   court address whether an argument would have been untimely if the real parties had presented it to the respondent trial judge after the deadline for responding to the disclosure request.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   The\n   <em>\n    Morse\n   </em>\n   case does not address the Waiver Argument and so is not on point.\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   In concluding that Figgs had the burden of proving that the Settlement Agreements were not relevant, the majority cites\n   <em>\n    In re Univar USA, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7322711\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/311/175/#p180\">\n    311 S.W.3d 175\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Tex.

Parties undertaking to follow this rule may face transaction costs asserting and proving relevancy arguments as to settlement agreements that no party seriously could argue were relevant to the litigation. Parties who fail to follow this rule and simply respond that no part of any settlement agreement is relevant run the risk of the discovering party asserting that the responding party has waived all relevancy arguments and is required to produce every settlement agreement in the responding party's possession. For responding parties who have entered into many settlement agreements, this rule will impose significant transaction costs in either asserting\n   and proving that all the settlement agreements are not relevant or in having to produce all of these settlement agreements if a court concludes that the party waived its relevancy arguments under this rule. In both scenarios, the rule puts litigants to unnecessary time and expense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Figgs asserted that the Settlement Agreements were not relevant in a response and motion for protection filed within seventy days after the Request-for-Disclosure Deadline and before the respondent trial judge ruled on GreCon's motion to compel.
