While considered a waterfront property, its property line does not extend to the lakefront. Rather, Lot 8 extends to a point identified as \"Elevation 1084\", which is the elevation of the top of the Medina Lake dam.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Lot 8 was transferred to the Lances by F.D. and Helen Franks by way of a Warranty Deed. At the same time, and by way of a Deed Without Warranty, the Franks also conveyed to the Lances a .282 acre tract of land below Lot 8, or between Lot 8 and the lakefront. This .282 acre tract (\"the subject land\") begins at the property line of Lot 8, at \"Elevation 1084\", and ends at \"Elevation 1072\", or what is typically the lakefront.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is undisputed that the Franks held title to Lot 8, and this title was legally transferred to the Lances. It is also undisputed the Franks did not hold title to the subject land, nor did they hold any deed or other instrument from which an ownership or possessory interest in the subject land was derived. Rather, the Franks created the Deed Without Warranty and thereby transferred any purported interest held in the subject land to the Lances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Judith Robinson is the owner of Lot 1, which is adjacent to the Lances' Lot 8. Ms. Robinson's property line on Lot 1 also extends to \"Elevation 1084\". For many years, the homeowners in Redus Point Addition Subdivision have all used as common property the beachfront area that sits below Elevation 1084 corresponding to Lots 1 and 8. The homeowners in Redus Point Addition Subdivision collectively improved the common beachfront area with a wooden pier, a deck, and boat ramp. These improvements are all on the subject land below the Lances' Lot 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In April 2012, the Lances sent a letter to Judith Robinson informing her they were going to fence off the subject land, and if Robinson did not remove the deck and pier within 30 days, the Lances would remove them. In June 2012, the Lances began building a permanent wooden fence around the subject land, blocking access to the beachfront. The Lances also cut trees, posted \"no trespassing\" signs, and precluded all use of the common beachfront area within the subject land.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Judith Robinson, joined by other neighbors in the Redus Point Addition Subdivision (the Robinson parties) filed suit alleging the Deed Without Warranty which purportedly transferred the subject land from the Franks to the Lances was fraudulent and recorded in violation of Chapter 12 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code. The Robinson parties alleged the Franks did not own any property below Elevation 1084 to convey to the Lances, as legal title to the property belongs to BMA (subject to any express and implied easements appurtenant). The Robinson parties alleged the Lances conspired with the Franks and intended to use the fraudulent deed to assert a bogus claim to the subject land and infringe the express and implied easement allowing the\n   use and enjoyment of the subject land by the other property owners in the subdivision. The Robinson parties contend this express and implied easement is derived from a 1917 deed from Theresa Spettle to a predecessor of the BMA (the Spettle Deed), and through the Spettle Deed, they hold \"at least an equitable interest in the subject property in the form of an implied easement appurtenant and other equitable and littoral/riparian rights.\" The Robinson parties asserted several causes of action and damages for injury to property and nuisance, as well as a claim for declaratory relief on multiple issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The trial court issued a temporary injunction, precluding the Lances from preventing use of the subject land pending litigation. This court affirmed this injunction on interlocutory appeal.\n   <em>\n    Lance v. Robinson,\n   </em>\n   No. 04-12-00754-CV,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%20820590\">\n    2013 WL 820590\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (Tex.App.-San Antonio Mar. 6, 2013, no pet.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In the continuing litigation and based upon the Fifth Amended Petition, the Robinson parties moved for partial summary judgment on some of the requested declaratory relief. Following a hearing, the trial court entered an amended order on June 11, 2014, in which it granted in part the Robinson parties' motion for partial summary judgment, awarding the following declaratory relief:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   (1) The Franks-to-Lance Deed dated October 13, 2011 did not convey any ownership or other interest in the .282 acre property to the Lances;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   (2) The Franks never acquired ownership or other possessory interest in the .282 acre property by deed or other written instrument, and therefore had no fee ownership of the land to convey to the Lances;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   (3) ...;\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   (4) The Spettle Deed expressly reserves an easement in the lands conveyed to MVICO (BMA predecessor) in the grantors under this deed.

The right to use the lake water for domestic purposes;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   b. The right to use the lake water for bathing, boating, fishing, and hunting; and,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   c. The right to construct upon the edges of the reservoir at their own peril and expense and without any liability of the grantors for the destruction thereof by water or otherwise, such improvements as may be necessary to the privileges above reserved by the grantors, their heirs and assigns, which privileges are to be exercised by said parties only to the extent and in the proportion which the acreage above described bears to the total acreage under the flow line of the reservoir;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   (5) The land comprising the Redus Point Addition Subdivision is part of the land partitioned to Mathilda Spettle Redus in the partition deed dated July 18, 1917, signed by Theresa Spettle, et al.;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   (6) The Lances do not own the .282 acre tract, but do have appurtenant easement rights in the area as lot owners in the Redus Point Addition Subdivision, along with the plaintiffs and other lot owners, under the express easement reserved\n   in the Spettle deed. These easement rights do not give the Lances the right to exclude other lot owners from using any portion of the land below the flow line of the lake;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   (7) The Deed Without Warranty referenced in Paragraph 1 is an invalid cloud and burden on the easement rights of the plaintiffs. The county clerk is ordered to file a copy of this amended order in the deed records of Bandera County;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   (8) The Deed Without Warranty is a \"deed or other record\" for purposes of Chapter 12 of the CPRC, \u00a7 12.002(a) ;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   (9) The defendants Franks and Lances made, used, and/or presented the Deed Without Warranty with the intent to create the appearance of an actual conveyance of ownership in the .282 acre property, pursuant to CPRC \u00a7 12.002(a)(2) ;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   (10) ...;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   (11) Plaintiffs own an express easement in the .282 acre property, and have standing under CPRC \u00a7 12.003(a)(8).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Following entry of this order granting partial summary judgment, the trial court severed all other causes of action. Subsequently, the Robinson parties and BMA filed motions for attorney fees. The trial court held a hearing on these motions, and on October 29, 2014, signed an Amended Award of Attorney's Fees and Final Judgment. The trial court entered Corrected Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law with regard to the attorney-fee award only, on November 18, 2014. The Lance parties perfected this appeal from the following: (1) Amended Order on Plaintiffs' Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, dated June 11, 2014, and (2) Amended Award of Attorney's Fees and Final Judgment dated October 29, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    Standard of Review\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Declaratory judgments rendered by summary judgment are reviewed under the same standards that govern summary judgments generally.\n   <em>\n    Hourani v.

Deficiency of Summary Judgment Record\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The Lance parties first argue the trial court improperly granted summary judgment because it did not have necessary evidence before it to determine the summary judgment awarded. Specifically, the Lance parties contend the Franks-to-Lance deed and the 1917 Spettle deed, which the Robinson parties contend established the implied and appurtenant easements for common use of the subject land, were not attached as evidence to the motion for partial summary judgment, and thus, are not part of the summary judgment record. Because these deeds were not part of the summary judgment record, the Lance parties contend the trial court had no basis upon which to grant the declaratory relief.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The Robinson parties respond that the motion for partial summary judgment specifically referenced and relied upon the testimony and exhibits admitted during the temporary injunction hearing held on July 12, 2011 before the same judge. The Robinson parties contend the deeds were properly before the trial court because the deeds were admitted during the temporary injunction hearing and were on file with the clerk of the court, and the exhibits and transcript of the temporary injunction hearing were present, referenced, and discussed, without objection, at the hearing on the motions for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Public policy dictates that procedural errors be raised at the trial court level to allow for correction without substantial interference with the judicial process.\n   <em>\n    Jones v. McSpedden,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9930505\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/560/177/#p180\">\n    560 S.W.2d 177\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 180 (Tex.App.-Dallas 1977, no writ). Pursuant to this public policy, any defect in the form of summary judgment evidence will not be grounds for reversal unless the defect is specifically pointed out by objection by an opposing party with opportunity, but refusal, to amend. TEX. R. CIV. P. 166a(f) ;\n   <em>\n    Cluett v. Med.

Thus, a movant's failure to attach necessary summary judgment evidence to the motion must be raised and ruled on by the trial court to preserve error for complaint on appeal, and a non-movant's failure to object to defects in a movant's summary judgment evidence constitutes waiver of challenge based upon\n   those defects.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cluett,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9989333\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/829/822/#p825\">\n    829 S.W.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   825 ;\n   <em>\n    Segal v.

The Lance parties did not object to any discussion or review of the deeds at the summary judgment hearing. Accordingly, the Lance parties waived this complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cluett,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9989333\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/829/822/#p825\">\n    829 S.W.2d at 825\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   To some extent the Lance parties' argument could suggest the Robinson parties' failure to attach the deeds to their motion for partial summary judgment was a substantive defect that requires reversal. To support this contention, the Lance parties rely on\n   <em>\n    Sorrells v.

In\n   <em>\n    Sorrells,\n   </em>\n   a lender with a promissory note moved for summary judgment against the borrower, but did not attach the note to either the summary judgment motion or any other properly filed document in the record.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10019170\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/780/936/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10019170\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/780/936/\">\n    at 937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court held the promissory note could not serve as a basis for summary judgment because the note was completely absent from the record. Because the absence of any evidence was a substantive defect, the trial court held the borrower's failure to object was irrelevant to the issue of sufficiency of summary judgment evidence.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10019170\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/780/936/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10019170\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/780/936/\">\n    at 937-38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The complete lack of evidence in\n   <em>\n    Sorrells\n   </em>\n   was the substantive defect which precluded summary judgment, not the failure to physically attach the promissory note to the motion.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10019170\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/780/936/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10019170\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/780/936/\">\n    at 937-38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, the Lance parties' reliance on\n   <em>\n    Sorrells\n   </em>\n   is misplaced. Review of the summary judgment evidence reveals the Franks-to-Lance deed and the Spettle deed do not appear in the summary judgment record as independent attachments to the Robinson parties' motion for partial summary judgment; however, the deeds were admitted into evidence at the Preliminary Injunction Hearing, and the transcript and exhibits from this hearing were referenced in the motion for partial summary judgment and were discussed at the summary judgment hearing. While the physical copies of the deeds may not have been attached to the summary judgment motion, the transcript of the summary judgment hearing reveals the trial court reviewed the deeds, the parties and the judge discussed the deeds, and the deeds were present in the courtroom at the summary judgment hearing as part of the transcript of the preliminary injunction hearing, without objection from the Lance parties. Therefore, the Robinson parties' failure to physically attach the deeds to their motion for partial summary judgment was not a substantive defect.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Segal,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%206306623\">\n    2011 WL 6306623\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   For these reasons, the Lance parties' first issue is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Relief Requested Must Be Raised in a Suit to Try Title\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The Lance parties contend the Robinson parties seek declaratory judgment on an issue of ownership that can only be determined in a trespass-to-try-title cause of action. Because any action that involves a dispute over title to land is effectively an action in trespass to try title, the Lance parties contend the Robinson parties cannot challenge the validity of the Franks' deed to the Lances without pleading and proving a trespass-to-try-title cause of action. The Lance parties contend that to find title in a party other than the grantee (the Lances), a court must first set aside the grantee's deed. Until\n   there is a successful suit to set aside the Franks-to-Lance deed without warranty, the Lances contend the deed is valid and represents prima facie evidence of title vested in the Lances.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The Robinson parties respond that the Lance parties mischaracterize their claims and requested relief. The Robinson parties assert they seek the right to use and enjoy an express easement, and this express easement was negatively affected by the Lances' invalid claim to the easement property. Because the Robinson parties seek to declare the validity of an easement to use and enjoy the subject land, a trespass to try title action was not appropriate to obtain the desired relief. The Robinson parties admit that only a party in possession, or that alleges entitlement to possession, of property may file a trespass to try title action; however, easement rights are properly adjudicated, as here, through request for declaratory relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \"A trespass to try title action is the method of determining title to lands, tenements, or other real property\" and is the exclusive method to adjudicate rival claims of title to real property.

The Robinson parties contend the Spettle-to-BMA deed at issue in\n   <em>\n    Wallace\n   </em>\n   was not the same deed at issue in this case, and the language contained in the deed at issue in this case contains additional points of reference from which the contours of the property described can be sufficiently ascertained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Assuming the challenge of the validity of the 1917 Spettle Deed was adequately raised and presented in the trial court through the Lance parties' response to the motion for partial summary judgment, the proposed application of\n   <em>\n    Wallace\n   </em>\n   is an overextension of its holding. First, it is undisputed that the deed at issue in\n   <em>\n    Wallace\n   </em>\n   is not the same deed as the Spettle Deed at issue in this case. Because the Spettle-to-BMA deed at issue in\n   <em>\n    Wallace\n   </em>\n   was not the same deed at issue in this case, the holding in\n   <em>\n    Wallace\n   </em>\n   does not\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   invalidate the Spettle Deed in this case. To extend the holding in\n   <em>\n    Wallace\n   </em>\n   to this case, then, this court must analyze the Lance parties' argument and designation of insufficient language in the Spettle Deed that renders it void under\n   <em>\n    Wallace\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Without quoting any language in the Spettle Deed or directing this court to any particular deficiency, the Lance parties state \"the description of land ... employs an identical technique and description as contained in the deed this court found to be void.\" The Lance parties argue the Spettle Deed uses points of beginning as in\n   the\n   <em>\n    Wallace\n   </em>\n   deed, such as \"point 0\", \"point 1\", etc., and uses calls without reference to any object or monument that would enable one to locate the land \"on the ground.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   While the subject Spettle Deed may contain similar language as that in\n   <em>\n    Wallace\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ,\n   </em>\n   such as \"point 0\", \"point 1\", as the Lances argue,\n   <em>\n    Wallace\n   </em>\n   does not hold that use of this language renders a deed,\n   <em>\n    per se,\n   </em>\n   insufficient.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wallace,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9976643\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/619/551/#p554\">\n    619 S.W.2d at 554\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Lance parties contend the Robinson parties' chain of title goes back to the Spettle Partition Deed, not the Spettle Deed, and the Spettle Partition Deed \"contains no reference to any type of reservation, grant or license with regard to usage of water, access to the Lake or any other such matter.\" The Lance parties conclude by stating, \"[t]here is nothing to support Plaintiffs' claim to an express easement based on a deed which is not in their chain of title.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Again, the Lance parties do not provide citations to the record nor provide argument or explanation of any application to caselaw. However, this court will liberally construe and analyze this argument based\n   upon known, or otherwise referenced, portions of the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The summary judgment record includes testimony presented at the Preliminary Injunction Hearing. At this hearing, the Robinson parties presented testimony of land surveyor Lemeul Sinclair. Mr. Sinclair testified the Spettle Deed from Theresa Spettle to MVIC conveyed land up to Elevation 1084 upon which MVIC was to construct Medina Lake. Thus, the Spettle Deed conveyed the land for the creation of Medina Lake. Mr. Sinclair also testified, and it is undisputed, that the Spettle Deed reserves to Theresa Spettle and her heirs and assigns the right to use and enjoy the land below \"Elevation 1084\" and the waters in the lake for domestic purposes, the right to use the waters for bathing, boating, fishing, and hunting, and the right to construct upon the edges of the lake such improvements as may be necessary and incident to the exercise of the privileges reserved. It is undisputed that this reservation of rights is the origin of the express and implied appurtenant easements upon which the Robinson parties assert the right to use and enjoy the subject land.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Mr. Sinclair further testified that following execution of the Spettle Deed, Theresa Spettle executed several deeds which partitioned land in her possession and conveyed these partitions to her children. The partition deed executed by Theresa Spettle to her daughter, Mathilde Spettle Redus, conveyed certain land to elevation 1084 that was adjacent to the land transferred to MVIC for the creation of Medina Lake. Mr. Sinclair testified the land transferred to MVIC in the Spettle Deed and the land transferred to Mathilde Spettle in the Spettle Partition Deed were both originally part of the same survey of land, \"survey no. 231 out of Adams, Beaty and Moulton survey.\" Finally, Mr. Sinclair testified, and it is undisputed that the land upon which the Redus Point Addition Subdivision was established was part of the land transferred to Mathilde in the Spettle Partition Deed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Also included in the summary judgment record is the Spettle Partition Deed. The Spettle Partition Deed states that the grantors (Theresa Spettle) do:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   GRANT, CONVEY, RELEASE AND CONFIRM the aforesaid tracts or parole of land aggregating 728 acres ... unto her, the said MATHILDE SPETTLE REDUS, ... TO HAVE AND TO HOLD the said ... tracts ... with all and singular the hereditaments and appurtenance thereunto belonging, or in anywise incident or appertaining, unto her the said Mathilda Spettle Redus, to her sole and separate use and as her separate estate, her heirs and assigns, in severalty, absolutely, in fee simple and forever.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The Lance parties did not submit any evidence at the summary judgment hearing to controvert this testimony or evidence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Thus, through the undisputed facts and Mr. Sinclair's testimony, the summary judgment record before the trial court established the land conveyed in the Spettle\n   Deed and the land conveyed in the Spettle Partition Deed originated from a contiguous property. Theresa Spettle conveyed a portion of this contiguous property to MVIC for the creation of Medina Lake. The land conveyed in the Spettle Deed reserved in Theresa Spettle and her heirs and assigns the right to use the land below Elevation 1084 that surrounded Medina Lake and that corresponded to the land she retained. From the land retained by Theresa Spettle, the Spettle Partition Deed conveyed to Mathilde Spettle Redus certain land, some of which abutted Medina Lake. The Spettle Partition Deed specifically transferred to Mathilde Spettle Redus all \"hereditaments and appurtenance thereunto belonging, or in anywise incident or appertaining\" to the land conveyed. Thus, the Spettle Partition Deed transferred to Mathilde Spettle Redus the specific rights to use and enjoy the waters and the land surrounding Medina Lake that was reserved by Theresa Spettle in the Spettle Deed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Although the Lance parties argue the Spettle Partition Deed \"contains no reference to any type of reservation, grant or license with regard to usage of water, access to the Lake or any other such matter,\" it does contain the habendum clause which conveys \"all and singular the hereditaments and appurtenance thereunto belonging, or in anywise incident or appertaining\" to the land conveyed. Moreover, in certain situations, a deed conveying affected land need not specifically mention an existing easement because an easement can follow the land without any mention whatever.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McDaniel v. Calvert,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10009872\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/875/482/#p484\">\n    875 S.W.2d 482\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 484 (Tex.App.-Fort Worth 1994, no pet.). Therefore, regardless whether the Spettle Deed specifically described any easement, it could have been conveyed with the land.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10009872\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/875/482/#p484\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Therefore, this argument fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   From the summary judgment evidence presented, the Robinson parties conclusively established their chain of title back to specific land held by Theresa Spettle. Mr. Sinclair testified Theresa Spettle (and others) at one time owned a large piece of property, which included \"Survey 231\". The Spettle Deed divided the property within the portion identified as Survey 231, conveying to MVIC title below Elevation 1084 for the creation of Medina Lake. Of the land within Survey 231 retained by Theresa Spettle, she partitioned a portion to Mathilde Spettle Redus. Mathilde Spettle Redus, then, eventually sold a portion of this property, which became the Redus Point Addition Subdivision, and thereby, the property owned by the Robinson parties. Therefore, the Lance parties' argument fails based upon the uncontroverted summary judgment evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   In any event, even if, as the Lance parties contend, the Robinson parties' chain of title only goes back to the Spettle Partition Deed, the evidence presented conclusively establishes that upon execution of the Spettle Partition Deed, Mathilde Spettle Redus received all \"hereditaments and appurtenance thereunto belonging, or in anywise incident or appertaining\" that were incident to the land conveyed. Such \"hereditament and appurtenance\" held by Theresa Spettle, and thus, conveyed, included the right to use and enjoy the land below Elevation 1084 up to the lakefront. From this evidence, the Robinson parties conclusively established the rights and entitlements to use and enjoy the subject land that were reserved by Theresa Spettle in the Spettle Deed and were passed to Mathilde Spettle Redus in the Spettle Partition Deed.

The Language Does Not Comply With the Statute of Frauds\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The Lance parties present this \"reason\" with recitation of common law pertinent to the requirement that the description of an easement must satisfy the statute of frauds and thus, must contain a sufficient certainty for its location. The Lance parties then close with the statement, \"[t]he language relied upon by Plaintiffs in the Spettle Deed is silent as to where the claimed easement is located. The language does not even attempt to locate the easement to the degree where a surveyor could go upon the land and locate the easement.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   While the caselaw cited accurately outlines the requirements for satisfaction of the statute of frauds, the type of easement at issue in this case is one of use and enjoyment of the subject land.

The general statement of law is followed by the single-statement conclusion, \"[t]he language relied upon by Plaintiffs contains no reference to a dominant or servient estate.\" In the Reply Brief, the Lance parties provide insight into their substantive argument on this point by dispelling the Robinson parties' response; however, the Lance parties provide little more than the proposition that the alleged easement upon which the Robinson parties rely did not originate from the Spettle Deed because it \"does not identify a dominant estate.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   For these reasons, this argument is inadequately briefed and is waived for appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <strong>\n    c.

This general statement of law is followed by the\n   single-statement conclusion, \"[t]he language relied upon by Plaintiffs creates a license or an easement in gross, not an easement appurtenant.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   This argument is not adequately briefed.

The trial court granted the Robinson parties' motion and, on June 11, 2014, entered its \"Amended Order on Plaintiffs' Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\" adjudicating the declaratory relief, only. On June 12, 2014, the trial court granted the Robinson parties' motion to sever the action for declaratory relief from the remaining causes of action. The Robinson parties also requested attorney fees as allowed under the Uniform Declaratory Judgment Act. Following a hearing, the trial court awarded attorney fees to the Robinson parties and to BMA and entered an \"Amended Award of Attorney's Fees and Final Judgment\" on October 29, 2014. Subsequently, on November 18, 2014, the trial court rendered \"Corrected Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law\" pertaining to the attorney fees only.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   On appeal, the Lance parties contend the record does not contain legally or factually sufficient evidence to support a finding that the attorney fees awarded were reasonable and necessary or that the fees awarded are equitable and just. The Lance parties argue the only fees that would be reasonable to award would be those associated with the temporary injunction and motion for summary judgment; however, \"the fee statements and attorney testimony upon which the trial court based its award envelop a much larger litigation universe than the work that was necessary for the motion for summary judgment.\" Thus, the Lance parties contend the Robinson parties presented insufficient evidence to support the reasonableness or justness of the awarded attorney fees by failing to separate the fees incurred in the declaratory-relief litigation from the fees incurred in the litigation on the remaining causes of action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   The Robinson parties respond that the Lance parties waived any argument or complaint pertaining to the attorney-fee award because they failed to specify the trial court's findings of fact and conclusions of law they challenge, nor do they provide any basis from which this court can conclude the findings of fact or conclusions of law are in any way erroneous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Findings of fact are reviewable for legal and factual sufficiency of the evidence to support them.\n   <em>\n    First Nat'l Bank in Dallas v.

Finding of fact 1 states, \"the amount of segregated, reasonable and necessary attorney's fees attributable to and incurred by plaintiffs in prosecuting their severed claims against the defendants ... is $90,000.00\", and finding of fact 2 states the same attributable to and incurred by BMA as $31,025.00.

The record reveals more than a scintilla of evidence that the Robinson parties and BMA did separate the attorney fees incurred in litigating the preliminary injunction and summary judgment from the remaining causes of action. The Robinson parties' lead counsel, Stephan B. Rogers, testified to the attorney fees they incurred. Mr. Rogers testified that 85% of the itemized work related to the issues resolved in the summary judgment order in the segregated cause. The trial court's award is less than the amount testified. BMA's lead counsel, Ed Hecker, testified the BMA's claims include only the declaratory relief and the CPRC Chapter 12 claims. Mr. Hecker testified he redacted from the submitted invoices all attorney fees BMA incurred that pertained to the CPRC Chapter 12 claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   Although this court must disregard all evidence to the contrary of the challenged findings of fact, the record contains no controverting evidence with regard to the issue of separation of fees incurred. The Lance parties' attorney, Cynthia Cox Payne testified with regard to the reasonability of the hourly rate and the total amount of attorney fees invoiced; however, she did not address the issue whether the attorney fees invoiced were unreasonable because they included work from the severed cause. Therefore, the record contains sufficient evidence to support the trial court's findings of fact 1 and 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   For these reasons, the Lance parties' challenge to the legal and factual sufficiency of the evidence to support the trial court's award of attorney fees is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   The trial court's Amended Order on Plaintiffs' Motion for Partial Summary Judgment and Amended Award of Attorney's Fees and Final Judgment are affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-140\">\n    It is common thought, but is disputed in this litigation, that with regard to lakefront property on Medina Lake, Elevation 1084 is the dividing line between privately-owned property and property owned by Bexar-Medina-Atascosa Water Improvement District No. 1 (\"BMA\").
