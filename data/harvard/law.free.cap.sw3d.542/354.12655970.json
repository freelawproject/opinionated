Doe began serving on the grand jury on May 7, 2014, at which time she was administered her oath of secrecy. Doe has brought federal and state law claims against the respondent, Robert P. McCulloch (\"McCulloch\"), who is the elected prosecutor of St. Louis County. Doe alleges that McCulloch's handling of the case, such as how evidence was presented, \"differed significantly from how evidence was presented in the hundreds of other matters presented to her and the other empaneled grand jurors earlier that same term.\" More specifically, amongst other things, Doe alleges that \"the evidence was presented in a way that implied Brown was the wrongdoer and not Wilson[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Doe seeks an exception to the secrecy obligations imposed by various Missouri Revised Statutes, including \u00a7\u00a7 540.080, 540.310, and 540.320, as she wishes to \"speak publicly about her experience on the grand jury\" and \"contribute to the current dialogue concerning race relations.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Initially, Doe filed a complaint in federal district court on January 5, 2015, \"alleging only that her First Amendment rights were being violated by \u00a7\u00a7 540.080, 540.120, 540.310, and 540.320, as well as any other provision of Missouri law prohibiting Doe from discussing or expressing an[y] opinions related to her grand jury service.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Doe v.

In particular, we have noted several distinct interests served by safeguarding the confidentiality of grand jury proceedings. First, if preindictment proceedings were made public, many prospective witnesses would be hesitant to come forward voluntarily, knowing that those against whom they testify would be aware of that testimony. Moreover, witnesses who appeared before the grand jury would be less likely to testify fully and frankly, as they would be open to retribution as well as to inducements. There also would be the risk that those about to be indicted would flee, or would try to influence individual grand jurors to vote against indictment. Finally, by preserving the secrecy of the proceedings, we assure that persons who are accused but exonerated by the grand jury will not be held up to public ridicule.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    Butterworth v.

Overview of the Issues Presented\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In the trial court's Judgment, it aptly identified and articulated some of the issues now before us:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   [Doe] does not specify in her Petition what she would like to say, or what evidence or other materials, specifically, she would like to disclose. Rather, Plaintiff alleges generally that she would like to discuss her experience as a grand juror, and she alleges that she would like to use her experience as a grand juror, and she alleges that she would like to use her experience to contribute to the current public dialogue concerning race relations, to educate the public, and to advocate for legislative change.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   [Doe] is seeking an order completely invalidating Missouri's grand jury secrecy laws as applied to her, not an order that allows her to make certain disclosures for certain purposes. As such, [Doe's] purposes in seeking freedom from Missouri's secrecy laws are not relevant here.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   Under normal circumstances, Missouri grand jurors are not permitted to make any of the disclosures contemplated by Plaintiff, regardless of their purpose.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 540.080, 540.310, 540.320, 540.330. Therefore, in order for [Doe] to succeed, she must explain how her circumstances are unique, and why an exception to the rule of secrecy should be made for her in this case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Doe has only directed us to, and our research has only revealed, one case in which an exception to Missouri's grand jury secrecy laws has been granted to grand jurors. The exception was granted under very unique circumstances in a case handed down by the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri in 1962.\n   <em>\n    Palmentere v. Campbell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1466600\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/205/261/\">\n    205 F.Supp. 261\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (W.D. Mo. 1962). There, the court found that disclosure of certain grand jury details was necessary for the grand jurors to be able to mount a defense in a lawsuit brought against them for their alleged conduct committed in the course of the grand jury proceedings.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1466600\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/205/261/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1466600\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/205/261/\">\n    at 263\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . With that in mind, we turn to the merits of the four points Doe offers on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    d. Point I-Practical Effect of Declaratory Judgments Sought\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Doe argues the trial court \"mistakenly concluded that it could provide no relief that would have a practical effect.\" First, we must note that we are unclear if Doe's premise is correct. We find the trial court concluded that it could provide no relief that would have a practical effect only as it pertains to the enforcement of \u00a7\u00a7 540.080 and 540.310. The trial court never explicitly rejected the idea that preventing enforcement of \u00a7 540.320 would have a practical effect. In fact, the court appears to have implicitly accepted that \u00a7 540.320 would have a practical effect.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   This is further supported by the fact that the trial court never questions the justiciability of the petition, never mentions the potential for issuing an advisory opinion, and fully addresses whether Doe adequately states a claim in any of her three counts in the petition. For the reasons expressed\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   in this section, we find that only \u00a7 540.320 would have a practical effect, which appears to be consistent with the trial court's finding. However, whether Point I is considered \"denied\" or \"granted in part\" (as it concerns \u00a7 540.320), it yields the same result: we find that preventing McCulloch from enforcing \u00a7 540.320 against Doe would have a practical effect. Accordingly, we will address Doe's remaining points on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The Supreme Court of Missouri has explained that \"[a] declaratory judgment should have a conclusive effect and should lay to rest the parties' controversy.\"\n   <em>\n    Missouri Soybean Ass'n v. Missouri Clean Water Comm'n\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9126927\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/102/10/#p25\">\n    102 S.W.3d 10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 25 (Mo. banc 2003). In the case before us, declaratory and injunctive relief preventing McCulloch from enforcing \u00a7\u00a7 540.080 and 540.310 would not have a conclusive effect. Doe argues that \"[a] declaratory judgment prohibiting enforcement [by McCulloch] would have the practical effect of allowing [her] to speak both publicly and privately about her experience as a grand juror without fear or prosecution.\" However, as Doe acknowledges in her petition, grand jury secrecy laws could still be enforced by other government officials.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   For example, the St. Louis County Circuit Court retains primary authority to enforce \u00a7\u00a7 540.080 and 540.310 against Doe through contempt proceedings, and the court may appoint an attorney to represent the court or the state.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rule 36.01;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Smith v.

However, we still find that there is a justiciable controversy as to the application of \u00a7 540.320. Accordingly, we will address Doe's remaining three points.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    e. Point II-Trial Court's Authority to Rule on Count I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In her second point on appeal, Doe contends that the trial court \"erred in reaching the merits of Doe's federal constitutional claim [based on freedom of speech]-and dismissing it with prejudice-because that claim was not before the [trial] court,\" as it was pending in the federal district court. However, we find Doe injected the freedom of speech issue into the petition. In her petition, Doe argued the grand jury secrecy statutes were unconstitutional as applied to her, and the only constitutional right she refers to is freedom of speech. Thus, the trial court could only address that argument by considering how the grand jury secrecy statutes potentially affected Doe's freedom of speech.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    i.

Specifically, Doe argues that \"justice requires Doe be allowed to speak publicly about her experiences on the grand jury to correct the misinformation McCulloch provided to the public.\" She also contends that McCulloch's disclosures about the grand jury proceedings created \"unusual circumstances.\" After reviewing McCulloch's statements identified by Doe, we do not find these arguments persuasive.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, Doe points to the following statements by McCulloch:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   \u2022\n   <em>\n    Statement 1\n   </em>\n   : \"McCulloch said the jurors were therefore 'able to assess the credibility of the witnesses, including those witnesses who[se] statements and testimony remained consistent throughout every interview and were consistent with the physical evidence.' \"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   \u2022\n   <em>\n    Statement 2\n   </em>\n   : \"McCulloch publicly announced that the jurors asked questions of every witness, requested specific witnesses, requested certain physical evidence, and asked that certain photographs be taken and presented to them.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   \u2022\n   <em>\n    Statement 3\n   </em>\n   : \"McCulloch then announced that the grand jurors 'discussed and debated the evidence among themselves before arriving at their\n   <em>\n    collective decision\n   </em>\n   ,' [and] [h]e stated, 'after their exhaustive review, the grand jury deliberated and ... determined that no probable cause exists to file any charges against Officer Wilson and returned a 'no true bill' on each of the five indictments.' \"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Regarding Statement 1, Doe argues that the statement \"impl[ies] all twelve of the jurors found the same witnesses to be credible.\" We disagree. Statement 1 is a broad, generic statement that could apply to almost any grand jury proceeding. The statement is neutral; it could just as easily be used to explain why a grand jury chose to return a \"true bill.\" The same can be said about Statements 2 and 3; we view these articulations as neutral recitations of facts. We do not believe \"collective\" implies unanimity. Rather, we find \"collective decision\" describes the process of grand jury deliberations, not the outcome. The grand jury process inherently requires a collective decision, as no indictment can be found without the concurrence of at least nine grand jurors. \u00a7 540.250. We agree with Doe's stance that misrepresenting grand jury proceedings would reduce the benefits associated with secrecy-and disclosure of facts to correct any misinformation would be a benefit to the public's interest. Nonetheless, the statements Doe references do not reveal any evidence or testimony that was presented to the grand jury, which is what Doe proposes to do.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Doe does not, in any way, limit the scope of the disclosures she seeks to make. In\n   her petition, Doe states that the grand jury investigation differed \"in significant ways from how evidence was presented in the\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     hundreds\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   of matters presented to the same grand jury earlier in its term,\" and Doe \"wishes to express opinions about ... [her] impression that evidence was presented differently than in other cases presented to the same grand jury.\" (emphasis added). Thus, the exception Doe seeks in her petition is not just limited to Wilson's grand jury proceedings; Doe seeks an exception that would allow her to disclose information from potentially \"hundreds of matters.\" Affording a grand juror unrestrained ability to disclose her interpretation of what happened in the proceedings completely destroys the idea of secrecy, which is crucial to the proper functioning of the grand jury process; the secrecy requirement promotes vitally important interests, such as protecting the jurors themselves, encouraging prospective witnesses to come forward and speak candidly, protecting the integrity of the grand jury process by shielding witnesses from threats, bribes, or other means of inducing fabricated testimony,\n   <em>\n    inter alia.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Butterworth\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5507\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/494/624/#p630\">\n    494 U.S. at 630\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5507\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/494/624/#p630\">\n    110 S.Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1380 ;\n   <em>\n    Douglas Oil Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1779812\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/441/211/#p218\">\n    441 U.S. at 218-19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1779812\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/441/211/#p218\">\n    99 S.Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1672-73 ;\n   <em>\n    Mannon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1903808,10162410\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/295/158/\">\n    295 S.W.2d at 164\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Doe also contends that the reasons for secrecy are \"no longer relevant\" and preventing disclosure \"does not promote\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     any\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   recognized reasons for grand juror secrecy.\" (emphasis added).

The United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri noted that \"[t]he only question for determination by this court at this time is whether the grand jury may be freed from their oath of secrecy under the [Missouri] statute so that they may defend themselves against the plaintiff's charge of violating his civil rights.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1466600\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/205/261/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1466600\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/205/261/\">\n    at 264\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The district court held that the grand jurors may reveal information \"as necessary to a proper defense of this action\" but only \"to such extent as necessary to meet the charges which have been made against them in the [c]omplaint filed in [that] case.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1466600\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/205/261/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1466600\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/205/261/\">\n    at 268\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   We find the facts in the case before us and\n   <em>\n    Palmentere\n   </em>\n   to be strikingly distinct. First, we note that the defendant grand jurors in\n   <em>\n    Palmentere\n   </em>\n   could only defend against the potential loss of property (via damages) by disclosing certain facts about the grand jury proceedings.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1466600\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/205/261/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1466600\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/205/261/\">\n    at 263\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The district court noted that preventing the grand jurors from disclosing information would \"prevent them from offering a proper defense and therefore the maintenance of [the] action would result in a deprivation of [those] defendants' property without due process of law in violation of the Constitution and the laws of the United States.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1466600\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/205/261/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Here, although Doe's alleged aspirations for disclosing grand jury information may aid her in her pursuits, we do not find that making specific disclosures about particular grand jury proceedings is necessary for her to reach many of her goals stated in the petition. For example, in paragraphs 34-36 in her petition, she alleges:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   34. Plaintiff believes by sharing Plaintiff's experience, Plaintiff could aid in educating the public about how grand juries function.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   35. Plaintiff would also like to use Plaintiff's own experiences to advocate for legislative change to the way grand juries are conducted in Missouri.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   36. Plaintiff's views would add to the public debate-occurring in Missouri and across the country-about the proper role of state grand juries and whether they continue to serve their original purpose of protecting the accused, or are now increasingly used to deprive those accused of crimes of due process to which those individuals are otherwise entitled.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   We believe Doe would be able to address all of these issues without specifically divulging details of particular proceedings. Unless the grand jurors in\n   <em>\n    Palmentere\n   </em>\n   were allowed to make limited relevant disclosures, the action would have \"result[ed] in a deprivation of [the] defendants' property without due process of law in violation of the Constitution and laws of the United\n   States.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1466600\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/205/261/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1466600\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/205/261/\">\n    at 263\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In the present case, disclosure of occurrences, as Doe perceived them, is not necessary to pursue the aforementioned goals Doe cites in her petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Additionally, the exception granted by the district court in\n   <em>\n    Palmentere\n   </em>\n   was narrowly tailored to protect the defendant grand jurors themselves for a limited, specific goal. The exception allowed the grand jurors to make disclosures \"as may be necessary\" to mount a defense against the plaintiff's allegations.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1466600\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/205/261/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1466600\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/205/261/\">\n    at 268\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The subject matter of the disclosures sought by Doe is also vastly different than in\n   <em>\n    Palmentere\n   </em>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Palmentere\n   </em>\n   , the district court found it of great importance that the subject matter of the disclosures fall outside the realm of \"the legal function of a grand jury.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1466600\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/205/261/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The district court explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Certainly a grand jury or a grand juror cannot be held to answer for any act within the area of the grand jury's jurisdiction\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   . If this question had arisen over some matter pertaining to an indictment or some matter pertaining to an investigation which the grand jury was conducting, or were in the general area of its jurisdiction, there would be\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     no hesitancy\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   on the part of this court to [prohibit disclosure(s) ].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1466600\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/205/261/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). The disclosures Doe wishes to make involve the essential functions of grand jury proceedings and the jury's ultimate determination of whether there is sufficient evidence (i.e., probable cause) to indict a criminal suspect. Thus, the rationale articulated in\n   <em>\n    Palmentere\n   </em>\n   actually supports the findings of the trial court in this case. After considering relevant precedent and independently weighing the reasons for secrecy against the present need for disclosure based on the unique facts alleged in Doe's petition, we decline to grant an exception contravening Missouri's grand juror secrecy statutes. Accordingly, we deny Point III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    g. Point IV-The Court's Authority to Release a Grand Juror from Her Oath\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Finally, Doe argues the trial court erred in granting the motion to dismiss because it \"misconstrued the authority of a circuit court to release a grand juror from her oath of secrecy in that the circuit court retains jurisdiction to release a grand juror from her oath to keep the grand jury proceeding secret.\" We find that this argument is without merit, as there is nothing on the record to suggest the trial court concluded it had no jurisdiction to entertain Doe's claims. In fact, the court provided a very thorough, detailed explanation for the conclusions it reached in its fourteen-page Order and Judgment. Moreover, the court addressed the issue of jurisdiction specifically over three pages. The trial court concluded that \"Plaintiff's federal lawsuit was filed in the wrong venue, and that this Court has jurisdiction to hear all of Plaintiff's claims.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Doe also claims that the \"court's analysis of whether to release Doe from her oath under the circumstances of this case was constrained by its conclusion that there are no exceptions to grand jury secrecy.\" Again, this is a clear misrepresentation. The trial court stated in its Order and Judgment, \"[a]lthough disclosure of grand jury materials may be had when required by the public interest or in the protection of private rights, neither exception applies here.\" Accordingly, Point IV is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     Conclusion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Even assuming, as we must, that all facts alleged in the petition are true, we still find Doe has failed to establish she would be entitled to an exception to Missouri's grand jury secrecy laws. Moreover, in regards to Doe's second point on appeal,\n   we find the trial court had authority to rule on Count I. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Mary K. Hoff, J., concurs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Lisa S.

The substance of the disclosures is the important consideration, not McCulloch's purported justification for making those disclosures.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
