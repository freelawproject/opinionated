The circuit court's judgment ordered the Clean Water Commission to withdraw its decision granting Callaway Farrowing an operating permit for a concentrated animal feeding operation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   We conclude that the circuit court erred in issuing a writ of mandamus, because the Friends organization had an available statutory remedy by petitioning for judicial review of the Commission's permit decision. We accordingly reverse the circuit court's decision, and remand the case to the circuit court with instructions that it deny the Friends' mandamus petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On November 21, 2014, the Department of Natural Resources issued General State Operating Permit MO-GS10485 to Callaway Farrowing. The Permit was for the operation of a class IB concentrated animal feeding operation (or \"CAFO\") to be located in Callaway County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On December 19, 2014, the Friends of Responsible Agriculture filed an appeal of the Permit with the Administrative Hearing Commission (\"AHC\"). On April 17, 2015, the AHC issued a decision in the Friends' appeal, recommending that the Clean Water Commission approve the Permit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On June 3, 2015, the Friends filed a petition for writ of prohibition against the Department, the Commission, and Callaway Farrowing in the Circuit Court of Cole County (Case No. 15-AC-CC00259). The petition sought to disqualify five of the seven members of the Clean Water Commission from participating in the permit appeal. The petition alleged that the five challenged Commissioners had driven by and observed the site of the proposed CAFO, and thus possessed extra-record information relevant to the disposition of Callaway Farrowing's permit application. On July 26, 2015, the circuit court issued its judgment prohibiting two Commissioners (Todd Parnell and Ashley McCarty) from participating in proceedings concerning Callaway Farrowing's permit application, based on the court's finding that they had in fact viewed the location of Callaway Farrowing's proposed CAFO. Neither the\n   Commission nor Callaway Farrowing appealed this judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The remaining five members of the Commission participated in a hearing on Callaway Farrowing's permit application on October 5, 2016. A vote was taken. Three of the five participating Commissioners voted in favor of granting Callaway Farrowing's permit application, and two Commissioners voted against.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Commission took the position that the motion to approve Callaway Farrowing's Permit had been passed by a majority of the voting Commissioners, and that the Permit was therefore approved. The Commission accordingly issued a \"Final Decision on Appeal,\" which adopted the AHC's recommended decision with a single modification. The decision was signed by the three Commissioners who had voted in favor of approving Callaway Farrowing's permit application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On October 6, 2016, the Friends filed a petition in mandamus and for a temporary restraining order in the Circuit Court of Cole County against the Commission, the Department, and Callaway Farrowing, arguing that the Permit had been approved without the four votes required by \u00a7 644.066.3(3).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Section 644.066.3(3) provides that \"[a]ll final orders or determinations or other final actions by the commission shall be approved in writing by at least four members of the commission.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The circuit court issued a preliminary order in mandamus to all Respondents, and the Respondents filed responses to the Friends' petition. In their responses, the Respondents argued, among other things, that under \u00a7 1.050, the affirmative votes of a majority of the Commission's five participating members was sufficient to approve Callaway Farrowing's permit application. The Respondents argued in the alternative that the \"rule of necessity\" should be invoked to permit the disqualified Commissioners to participate in deciding whether to grant Callaway Farrowing a permit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On December 21, 2016, the circuit court entered its judgment issuing a peremptory writ in mandamus. Although the court recognized that the five participating members of the Commission constituted a quorum under \u00a7 644.021.3, it concluded that by virtue of \u00a7 644.066.3(3), four affirmative votes were required to take final action approving Callaway Farrowing's permit application. Because the motion to approve Callaway Farrowing's permit application failed to garner four affirmative votes, the circuit court concluded that the motion had failed. The circuit court held that it was inappropriate to invoke the \"rule of necessity,\" because with five participating Commissioners \"it was fundamentally possible for the Commissioners to vote to approve the motion.\" The court's judgment also held that, because the motion to approve Callaway Farrowing's Permit did not win four affirmative votes, \"there is no 'final decision' of the Clean Water Commission in effect regarding the Permit issued to Callaway Farrowing, LLC,\" and as a result, \"Relator has no adequate remedy at law under \u00a7\u00a7 621.250 or 644.051, RSMo.\" The court ordered the Commission to withdraw its Final Decision on Appeal, and announce at its next meeting that the motion to approve Callaway Farrowing's permit application \"failed because the motion did not receive four 'Yes' votes.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Callaway Farrowing appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \"The purpose of the extraordinary writ of mandamus is to compel the\n   performance of a ministerial duty that one charged with the duty has refused to perform.\"\n   <em>\n    Furlong Cos. v.

It provides in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   The director [of the Department of Natural Resources] shall promptly notify the applicant in writing of his or her action and if the permit is denied state the reasons for such denial.

The Department's initial decision is subject to administrative appeal to the Administrative Hearing Commission. The AHC issues a\n   <em>\n    recommended\n   </em>\n   decision in the administrative appeal. The Commission reviews the AHC's recommended decision, and issues its own permitting decision. The Commission's \"final decision\" is then subject to judicial review.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 621.250.7 (specifying that \"[n]o cause of action or appeal arising out of any finding, order, [or] decision\" of the Commission \"shall accrue in any court unless the party seeking to file such cause of action or appeal shall have ... received a final decision\" from the Commission).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The Friends organization argues that the Commission's Final Decision on Appeal was not a \"final decision\" subject to judicial review under \u00a7\u00a7 621.250.7 and 644.051.6, because the Final Decision on Appeal was not signed by four Commissioners. The Friends point out that \u00a7 644.066.3(3) provides that \"[a]ll final orders or determinations or other final actions by the commission shall be approved in writing by at least four members of the commission.\" According to the Friends, under \u00a7 644.066.3(3), the Commission lacked the authority to issue a final decision on Callaway Farrowing's permit application with the concurrence of only three of its members.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The Friends organization confuses the\n   <em>\n    finality\n   </em>\n   of the Commission's decision for purposes of judicial review, with the\n   <em>\n    legal correctness\n   </em>\n   of the decision.

The Commission plainly intended its Final Decision on Appeal to constitute the \"terminal, complete resolution\" of the proceeding involving Callaway Farrowing's permit application.

The Final Decision on Appeal adopts the AHC's recommended decision with a single modification; the AHC's recommended decision, in turn, recommended\n   that the Commission sustain the Department of Natural Resources' decision granting Callaway Farrowing an operating permit. The Commission's Final Decision on Appeal cites to \u00a7 621.250.3, which specifies the procedural requirements for a \"final decision\" by the Commission. The Commission's Final Decision on Appeal was not \"tentative, provisional, or contingent\"; to the contrary, it specified that it would become effective on the date on which it was mailed to the parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In these circumstances, the Commission's Final Decision on Appeal constituted a \"final decision\" subject to judicial review under \u00a7\u00a7 621.250.7 and 644.051.6. During a statutory judicial review proceeding, the Friends would have been entitled to argue, among other things, that the Commission's decision was \"in excess of the statutory authority or jurisdiction of the agency,\" or was \"unauthorized by law,\" because only three Commissioners' indicated their approval in writing. \u00a7 536.140.2(2), (4);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Mo.

Section 644.051.6 provides that \"the court of appeals district with territorial jurisdiction coextensive with the county where the point source is to be located shall have original jurisdiction\" over any petition for judicial review of a Commission permit decision. The Friends did not file their petition for judicial review in this Court, however, but instead in the Circuit Court of Cole County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In addition, by filing an original petition for writ of mandamus in the circuit court, the Friends essentially treated the administrative proceeding as a \"non-contested case,\" in which the record necessary for review of the agency decision would be developed in the circuit court.\n   <em>\n    Furlong Cos. v.

Rather than invoking the statutory review procedure, however, the Friends organization filed a non-statutory mandamus proceeding in the circuit court. The Friends were not entitled to seek mandamus relief where they had an available statutory remedy. We accordingly reverse the circuit court's grant of a peremptory writ of mandamus, and remand the case to the circuit court with instructions to deny the Friends' petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   All concur.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    Unless otherwise indicated, statutory citations refer to the 2016 edition of the Revised Statutes of Missouri.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    <em>\n     Accord\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     St. Louis Cnty.
