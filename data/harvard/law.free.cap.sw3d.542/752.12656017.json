Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In January 2011, the Department received a referral of neglectful supervision of Fay by Mother. It was reported that Mother placed Fay, who was 11 months old, at substantial risk of harm through inadequate supervision, drug usage, and domestic violence. Father was not contacted at that time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Department filed a petition for protection of a child, conservatorship, and termination in a suit affecting the parent-child relationship (First Suit). Father, identified as the \"alleged father,\" was named in the First Suit, but not served. The Department was named temporary managing conservator of Fay during the pendency of the proceedings. Fay was returned to Mother and on February 24, 2012, a decree was signed granting the Department sole managing conservatorship of Fay and naming Mother a possessory conservator of Fay. The decree made no findings as to Father.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The decree did not terminate either parent's parental rights to Fay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Approximately five months later, Fay was again removed from Mother based on Mother's positive test for cocaine. In early 2013, Mother filed a motion to modify the parent-child relationship. Subsequently, the Department filed an \"original motion to modify conservatorship and for termination of the parent-child relationship\" (Second Suit). The Department's motion requested modification of the February 24, 2012 order, to which Father was not a party. Father was again identified as an \"alleged father.\" As to Father, the Second\n   Suit is an original custody determination and termination suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   An acknowledgement of paternity naming Father as Fay's biological father was filed. Father filed a waiver of service and his answer. On September 6, 2013, an order was signed suspending visitation, as to Father, until paternity was established and he provided a clean drug test.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Father took both tests, but his visitation with Fay was not resumed. Almost two years later, Mother filed a voluntary relinquishment. The case went to trial May 10, 2017, four years after it was filed. The order terminating both parents' rights and appointing the Department as sole managing conservator of Fay was signed June 22, 2017. The order also adjudicated Father's paternity as to Fay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Trial Proceedings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Evidence about Father\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Father\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   testified he was in a relationship with Mother for one to two years and lived with Mother prior to Fay's birth. Father has been employed as a shrimper for twenty to thirty years. As a result of his work, Father is out to sea five to ten times a year for five to six weeks at a time. Father visited Fay when he was home from work and provided monetary support to Mother and Fay. Mother testified Father visited whenever he could, helped with Fay, financially provided anything she needed, was a good father, and would do anything for Fay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Father was out to sea when Fay was first removed from Mother. During the original proceedings for conservatorship and termination, Father provided funds for Mother to retain a lawyer. Father believed the lawyer retained by Mother was working on his behalf as well. Mother testified Father and the retained lawyer spoke about paternity. Father acknowledged he did not retain a lawyer for himself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Mother testified she told Father a bit about the case, but did not provide him all of the information, telling him everything was taken care of. Mother admitted she kept Father \"out of the loop\" on some things because initially she wanted Fay to live with her mother to be closer to her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Department caseworker testified that Father first participated in the case in late 2013, when she was assigned to the case. She testified her notes indicated Father refused to sign a service plan provided by a previous caseworker, but she could not confirm if the previous caseworker provided a translator during the interaction or if Father knew what he had been given. The new caseworker did not present Father a service plan. Father testified the Department did not provide him with a service plan and that he was not provided a translator during his interactions with the Department.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The caseworker further testified that Father had not provided any support for Fay since 2013. Father acknowledged he had not sent financial support to anyone since 2014, but stated he was not asked to provide financial support and he was not provided information about where to send support. He testified he would have provided financial support if it was requested.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Because of a 2013 court order suspending his visitation, Father had not seen Fay in approximately three years. Father testified that he asked the court for visitation approximately three to four years prior to trial. He assumed that, because Mother was not allowed to visit Fay, he was not allowed to visit Fay either.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Father wanted to have \"my child back to the family.\" When he goes out to sea, he wants his current girlfriend to watch Fay for him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Evidence about Fay\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Fay was placed with her current foster family in March 2013, when she was three years old. When she first arrived, she repeated things the foster family said and when asked her name she simply said \"name.\" Fay starting seeing a psychologist in January 2014. The psychologist testified Fay initially presented with echolalia (repetition of words spoken by another), select mutism, and difficulty engaging and attaching to others. The psychologist felt Fay's problems stemmed from a parent or caregiver being intermittently unavailable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Fay's foster mother testified today she is a thriving, wonderful seven year old. Fay has friends in the community and excels in school. The psychologist testified she has improved since placement with her foster family. Fay is now very bright, articulate, and able to express her emotions, and she has formed a secure attachment with her foster parents and social setting. The foster family hopes to adopt Fay. The Department caseworker testified it is in Fay's best interest to terminate Father's parental rights because Fay is bonded to the foster family and is in a stable, secure, loving environment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The psychologist testified Fay's well-being would be endangered by placing her with anyone other than the foster parents. She opined a different placement would result in a psychological disruption because of the secure attachment she has formed in the foster home. The psychologist did not recommend visits or placement with Father. She had concerns about his being at sea for five to six weeks at a time and his proposed plan of leaving Fay with his girlfriend while he was gone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Trial Court Findings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On June 22, 2017, the trial court signed a decree terminating Mother's and Father's parental rights and appointing the Department sole managing conservator of Fay. The trial court found Father engaged in the conduct described in subsections (C) (voluntary abandonment), (E) (endangerment), (F) (failure to support), and (N) (constructive abandonment) of section 161.001(b)(1) of the Family Code. The court additionally found termination of Father's parental rights was in Fay's best interest. The trial court continued the appointment of the Department as Fay's sole managing conservator. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Father raises three primary issues challenging the trial court's judgment. In his first issue, Father challenges the legal and factual sufficiency of the evidence to support the trial court's findings necessary for termination under section 161.001(b). In his next issue, Father contends the trial court violated his due process rights by not providing him with a translator throughout the proceedings. Finally, Father contends the trial court's appointment of the Department as sole managing conservator of Fay violates his fundamental rights and liberty interests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Father contends the evidence shows he was on land five to ten times a year and would visit Fay whenever he was onshore. Father also contends the evidence shows that he provided adequate financial support to Mother and Fay. The Department contends the evidence was conclusive as to voluntary abandonment. The Department states Father did not visit Fay for the three years before trial and did not provide support for Fay while she was in the Department's care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Father's argument utilizes evidence of his interactions and support of Fay while she was in Mother's care. Alternatively, the Department utilizes the evidence of Father's interactions and support of Fay after the second removal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The only time period for which Father may have been away from Fay for at least six consecutive months is during the second removal. Subsection (C) requires evidence that Father voluntarily left the child in the possession of another and remained away for at least six consecutive months.

We note that this order was signed before Father made an appearance in the case. Additionally, the record does not establish that Father's visitation was reinstated, although there is evidence that Father requested the court to reinstate his visits three to four years prior to trial, which would have been in 2013 or 2014. We conclude that Father's time away from Fay after September 6, 2013 was not \"voluntary.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re J.K.H.\n   </em>\n   , No. 06-09-00035-CV,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%202948575\">\n    2009 WL 2948575\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Tex.

The Department contends the trial court was free to disregard the testimony that Father was unaware of Mother's drug use based on the referrals to the Department alleging Mother's drug use and Father's testimony that he lived with Mother before and after Fay's birth.

We note there is no evidence that Father was present or otherwise notified by the Department when Fay was removed, and he was not served in the original lawsuit at all. Further, there is evidence that Father participated in visitation at the Department after the first and second removal of Fay from Mother. Father met with Fay's psychologist regarding visitation.

The Department does not cite any case law in support of its argument. Additionally, at trial, no evidence was offered to establish that only the Department could receive financial support intended for Fay beginning on February 24, 2012 when it was appointed managing conservator. We note that Father was not served in this proceeding and was not ordered to pay the Department for Fay's support or notified where support should be sent. The Department bears the burden of proving the elements necessary for termination under this subsection by clear and convincing evidence. Based on the evidence in the record, we conclude the Department did not establish Father's provision of financial support to Mother for Fay between February 24, 2012 and July 13, 2012 was a failure to support Fay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Fay was removed from Mother July 13, 2012.

Construing all the evidence in the light most favorable to the finding, we conclude a reasonable fact finder could not have formed a firm belief or conviction that its finding was true.

First, the Department notes a service plan was prepared for Father in 2011. The permanency goal as stated in this service plan was \"Alt. Family: [u]nrelated, [a]doption,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   and not family reunification. The caseworker was unable to confirm that Father had received or understood the plan. During the First Suit, the Department did not obtain service on Father, despite his name being on Fay's birth certificate as her father.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Department first attempted service on Father during the Second Suit one time at a Houston, Texas address and one time at a Port Arthur, Texas address, but Father was not located. Despite knowing that Father worked off-shore for several weeks at a time, the Department, according to our record, made no further attempts to personally serve Father. Instead, the Department received permission to serve Father by publication in September 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   After Father appeared, there is evidence that the Department caseworker met with Father in a visitation setting. Subsequently, the trial court entered an order suspending Father's visitation until paternity could be established, despite Father's name being on the birth certificate, and until Father submitted a clean drug test, despite there being no allegations of Father's drug use. The record does not contain evidence of the arguments made in support of the order. The record contains a copy of Father's acknowledgement of paternity and negative drug tests related to Father. However, there is no evidence the Department made any attempt to resume Father's visitation with Fay. Father met with Fay's psychologist. The psychologist recommended that Father not be allowed any visitation with Fay as such would endanger her emotional well-being because she is bonded to the foster family.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   We do not agree that the Department's actions constitute a reasonable effort to return Fay to Father. The record does not shed light on the Department's failure to serve Father with notice of the first suit or whether any attempt at service was made. Additionally, the Department's 2011 permanency goal of unrelated adoption is contrary to an attempt to return Fay to Father. Construing all the evidence in the light most favorable to the finding, we conclude a reasonable fact finder could not have formed a firm belief or conviction that its finding was true. We conclude the evidence was legally insufficient to support the trial court's finding under section 161.001(b)(1)(N).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re A.L.H.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6847591\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/468/738/#p744\">\n    468 S.W.3d at 745-46\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that in the absence of a service plan or aggravating circumstances, Department's evidence of attempted service of suit and establishment\n   of paternity were insufficient to produce in the trial court's mind a firm belief or conviction that the Department made reasonable efforts at reunification).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Having concluded that the evidence was legally insufficient to support termination of Father's parental rights pursuant to subsections (C), (E), (F), and (N), we sustain Father's first issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Her testimony included that when she originally began seeing three-year-old Fay, her behaviors of echolalia and her inability to attach were likely related to the intermittent unavailability of her caregiver. She opined Father had endangered Fay's emotional well-being through his inaction. Fay had been in her current placement over four years at the time of trial. The psychologist testified that Fay, who was seven years old, had formed a secure attachment to her foster parents and her social setting. The psychologist testified Fay has been able to\n   psychologically heal during her placement with the foster family. The record contained evidence that Fay has greatly improved since placement with the current foster family. The record reflects that Fay's placement is stable and meeting her needs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Fay's thought of family did not include anyone beyond the foster family and Fay did not know her biological family. During a session, Fay told the psychologist she was \"born in a hospital and that this lady carried her in her tummy and that when she was born in the hospital, the neighbor came and picked her up and took her to her family the [foster family].\" It is unclear whether Fay has been told why her last name is not the same as her foster family. The psychologist believed any change in her placement would be detrimental to her emotional well-being. She also testified Fay needs to be cared for by the person who will parent her and to be in an environment that helps her grow psychologically. The psychologist did not feel Father could provide this type of environment being gone five to six weeks at a time, several times a year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   The evidence before us is similar to several cases in which the courts found the evidence insufficient to rebut the presumption set out in section 153.131.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%20153.131\">\n    Tex.

The trial court's conservatorship finding here does not rest solely on evidence that (1) Fay is better off living elsewhere, or (2) uprooting her would be disruptive and detrimental. There is additional probative and substantive evidence in this record to support the trial court's conservatorship finding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   The psychologist testified about Fay's emotional well-being. According to the psychologist, Fay displayed behaviors of echolalia and inability to attach when the psychologist first started seeing her; these behaviors likely were related to the intermittent unavailability of her caregiver. The\n   psychologist opined that Father's conduct contributed to the behaviors displayed by Fay. Father was \"missing in action\" while Mother experienced \"a serious drug and alcohol problem;\" she \"was not invested in parenting\" as a result of this problem and \"there was no one there ... other than the mother ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   The psychologist opined regarding causation of the problems she observed in Fay's behavior. The psychologist testified that \"there were probably moments when the caregiver, whether it's the parent or someone else, was intermittently unavailable.\" She further testified that Fay \"had no one available to emotionally secure a relationship. She had no one available to invest in whatever she needed at that time.\" According to the psychologist, Fay \"was just left alone to experience whatever she was presented with on her own.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Fay had been in her current placement over four years at the time of trial. The psychologist testified that Fay, who was seven years old, had formed a very secure attachment to her foster parents and her social setting. The psychologist testified Fay has been able to psychologically heal during her placement with the foster family. The record contained evidence that Fay has greatly improved since placement with the current foster family. The record also reflects that Fay's placement is stable and meeting her needs. Further, witnesses testified Fay is thriving, articulate, and able to express her emotions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Fay's thought of family did not include anyone beyond the foster family and Fay did not know her biological family. The psychologist believed any change in her placement would be detrimental to her emotional well-being. She also testified Fay needs to be cared for by the person who will parent her and to be in an environment that helps her grow psychologically. The psychologist concluded that the environment associated with Father does not fit these needs because of absences of five to six weeks at a time occurring several times a year. The psychologist was asked this question: \"[T]he father is gone five to six weeks at a time at sea and [Fay is] left with his girlfriend, would that concern you as far as a placement for this child?\" She answered, \"Yes.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   On this record, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in appointing the Department as managing conservator of Fay.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
