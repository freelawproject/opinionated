She contends this Court should use its equitable powers to create a narrowly tailored exception allowing her an out-of-time appointment.

Ms. Mickels's application for appointment as personal representative was time-barred by section 473.020.

By the time the application was filed, he had been deceased for seven years. The probate division denied Ms. Mickels's application as untimely and barred by section 473.020, which provides that all petitions for personal representative \"must be filed within one year after the date of death of the decedent.\" Section 473.020.2. This appeal follows.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The probate division's decision to dismiss Ms. Mickels's application for appointment as personal representative as untimely is analogous to the dismissal of a claim as barred by a statute of limitations. This is a question of law this Court reviews\n   <em>\n    de novo.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bateman v. Platte Cnty.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7314573\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/363/39/#p42\">\n    363 S.W.3d 39\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 42 (Mo. banc 2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Ms. Mickels argues equity requires she be appointed personal representative of Mr. Mickels's estate. It is Ms. Mickels's position that this Court announced in\n   <em>\n    Mickels I\n   </em>\n   a new cause of action for the \"deprivation of the opportunity to delay death\" that had not been available at the time of the original wrongful death suit. She argues it would be a \"perversion of justice\" to deny her the ability to move forward with the claim, and so this Court should direct the probate division to exercise its \"complete and unrestricted equitable powers in probate matters\" and grant her application for appointment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   This Court does not agree\n   <em>\n    Mickels I\n   </em>\n   announced a new cause of action. Though the claim had never before been classified as the 'deprivation of the opportunity to delay death,' a survivor's ability to bring negligence actions-including claims for the deprivation of the opportunity to delay death-has long been recognized under Missouri law. The original survivorship law, created in 1907, tracks-almost verbatim-the language found in today's section 537.020:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Causes of action upon which suit has been or may hereafter be brought by the injured party for personal injuries, other than those resulting in death, whether such injuries be to the health or to the person of the injured party, shall not abate by reason of his death, nor by reason of the death of the person against whom such cause of action shall have accrued; but in case of the death of either or both such parties, such cause of action shall survive to the personal representative of such injured party, and against the person, receiver or corporation liable for such injuries and his legal representatives, and the liability and the measure of damages shall be the same as if such death or deaths had not occurred.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1907%20Mo.%20Laws%20252\">\n    1907 Mo. Laws 252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Although the dissent characterizes\n   <em>\n    Mickels I\n   </em>\n   as an announcement of a cognizable cause of action and no reported Missouri case had yet outlined the scope of this claim, this negligence claim has been available in the survivorship context since 1907.\n   <em>\n    Mickels I\n   </em>\n   simply articulated how this missed opportunity is indeed an actionable personal injury available to survivors under this century-old statutory language. See\n   <em>\n    Mickels I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6802983\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/486/327/\">\n    486 S.W.3d at 329-30\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It did not announce a new cause of action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In arguing\n   <em>\n    Mickels I\n   </em>\n   broke new legal ground, Ms. Mickels directs this Court to a court of appeals decision-\n   <em>\n    Morton v. Mutchnick\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9997032\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/904/14/#p17\">\n    904 S.W.2d 14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 17 (Mo. App. 1995) -in which this sort of claim was explicitly rejected. In\n   <em>\n    Morton\n   </em>\n   , parents of a decedent brought a negligence action against their son's doctors for failing to diagnose and treat their son for AIDS.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9997032\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/904/14/#p17\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9997032\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/904/14/#p17\">\n    at 15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Their petition alleged, but for the negligence of the defendants, their son would have lived longer.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9997032\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/904/14/#p17\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In affirming the dismissal of the plaintiffs' petition, the court of appeals stated: \"It appears that plaintiffs are arguing they should be allowed to recover damages for [the decedent's] lost chance to have his life extended by an unknown period of time until his ultimate death.... Unfortunately, Missouri does not recognize such a cause of action.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9997032\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/904/14/#p17\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9997032\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/904/14/#p17\">\n    at 17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This Court denied transfer.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   But as this Court set out in\n   <em>\n    Mickels I\n   </em>\n   , a claim for an injury of this type is available under section 537.020, which sets out the cause of action. To the extent\n   <em>\n    Morton\n   </em>\n   held Missouri law does not recognize a personal injury action to recover damages for a decedent's lost chance to have his life extended, it is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Ms. Mickels nevertheless insists equity requires the allowance of an out-of-time appointment. But this Court, in applying statutes of limitations, has frequently and consistently rejected such policy arguments-however compelling-under the principle of legislative deference.\n   <em>\n    Laughlin v.

Section 472.030, RSMo 2000, provides, \"The probate division of the circuit court has the same legal and equitable powers to effectuate and to enforce its orders, judgments and decrees in probate matters as circuit judges have in other matters....\" Likewise, in construing section 472.030, this Court held the probate division has \"\n   <em>\n    complete and unrestricted\n   </em>\n   equitable powers in 'probate matters.' \"\n   <em>\n    In re Myers' Estate\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10157493\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/376/219/#p224\">\n    376 S.W.2d 219\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 224 (Mo. banc 1964) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   I remain dismayed by this Court's inability to conceive of a scenario in which the circuit court could exercise its equitable power to afford an aggrieved party relief from the rigid enforcement of the statute of limitations, especially in light of this Court's announcement in\n   <em>\n    Mickels I\n   </em>\n   that Ms. Mickels had a cognizable cause of action.\n   <em>\n    Mickels v.
