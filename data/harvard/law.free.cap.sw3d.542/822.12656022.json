R. App. P. 42.2. Because this court has not delivered an opinion, we grant appellant's request. The appeal is dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    DISSENTING OPINION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   ( Frost, C.J., dissenting)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Kem Thompson Frost, Chief Justice, dissenting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Appellant Kenneth Junior Arthur did not timely perfect this appeal. This court never has had jurisdiction over the appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Slaton v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11788699\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/981/208/#p210\">\n    981 S.W.2d 208\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 210 (Tex. Crim. App. 1998). So, this court can take no action other than to dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11788699\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/981/208/#p210\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Garcia v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9405764\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/76/33/#p36\">\n    76 S.W.3d 33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 36 (Tex. App.-Amarillo 2001, pet. ref'd). Rather than grant appellant's motion to dismiss the appeal under Texas Rule of Appellate Procedure 42.2(a), this court should dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Slaton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11788699\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/981/208/#p210\">\n    981 S.W.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   210 ;\n   <em>\n    Garcia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9405764\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/76/33/#p36\">\n    76 S.W.3d at 36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Granting a motion to dismiss under Rule 42.2(a) does not show that this court lacks jurisdiction over the appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tex. R. App. P. 42.2(a). Because the court fails to dismiss this appeal for lack of jurisdiction, I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
