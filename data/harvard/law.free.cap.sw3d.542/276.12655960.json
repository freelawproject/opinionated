Smith, vehicle during a traffic stop. The Commonwealth contends that the Court of Appeals erred by concluding that 1) the sniff search improperly extended the traffic stop; 2) the traffic stop was the only legal justification for stopping Appellee; and 3) the Commonwealth failed to preserve for appellate review its claim that Appellee's parole status alone permitted police to conduct a warrantless, suspicionless search of his vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   We granted discretionary review. For the reasons stated below, we affirm the Court of Appeals' decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Franklin County Sheriff's Detective Richard Qualls had been surveilling Appellee for about three weeks trying to corroborate tips received from confidential informants that Appellee had been trafficking in cocaine at a bar in Frankfort. Qualls knew that he lacked probable cause to arrest Appellee on drug trafficking charges. On the evening of Appellee's arrest, Qualls followed in an unmarked police car as Appellee left his workplace in his SUV, went to his residence, left the residence, and then drove to a gas station where he interacted with another resident of his apartment building who leaned into the passenger-side window.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Qualls\n   watched Appellee drive back to his apartment and then leave again a few minutes later in a different vehicle. Eventually, Qualls saw Appellee turn without using his turn signal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Because Qualls was in plain clothes and driving an unmarked car with no emergency lights or siren, he did not attempt to stop Appellee. Instead, he had prearranged for canine officer Eaton to be on standby, briefed on the situation and ready to respond. Qualls radioed Eaton to inform him of Appellee's improper turn. Eaton responded immediately by stopping Appellee's vehicle. He introduced himself as the sheriff's office canine handler, and he informed Appellee that he was stopped for failure to use his turn signal; an allegation which Appellee denied. Eaton asked Appellee if illegal drugs were in his car, and Appellee said there was none. Eaton described Appellee as fully cooperative but nervous. Eaton went back to his cruiser to get the drug dog and then commenced a sniff search around Appellee's car. When the dog alerted at the driver's door, Eaton asked Appellee to exit the vehicle. He searched Appellee's car and found seven grams of cocaine tucked between the front seats. He then arrested Appellee, searched his person, and found $4,299.00 in his wallet. According to the uniform citation issued by Eaton, eight minutes passed from the time of the traffic violation to the time Appellee was arrested. The citation also noted that Appellee appeared nervous when asked about the presence of drugs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Appellee was indicted for first-degree trafficking in cocaine, second or greater offense, greater than or equal to four grams of cocaine. He moved to suppress the evidence obtained during the search of his vehicle and his person. He argued that the traffic stop was not legal because the alleged traffic violation did not occur in Eaton's presence, and the officers did not have a reasonable, articulable suspicion of illegal activity to justify the initial investigative stop of the vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The trial court concluded that Qualls and Eaton together did not have sufficient knowledge of criminal activity to authorize the initial stop, and that the only valid basis for the stop was the alleged turn signal violation which Eaton did not witness. The trial court also concluded that Eaton's continued detention of Appellee to conduct the dog sniff search exceeded what was reasonably necessary to achieve the purpose of the traffic stop, and for that reason, too, the warrantless search was unreasonable. Consequently, the trial court suppressed the cocaine discovered in the car and the cash found in Appellee's wallet.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After the Commonwealth moved to alter, amend, or vacate the suppression order, the trial court reiterated that \"[r]egardless of the circumstances imputing probable cause from one police officer to another, it is clear to the Court that the Defendant was detained during the stop longer than necessary to dispose of the alleged traffic violation.\" The trial court maintained its initial conclusion that Qualls' long surveillance of Appellee produced nothing of substance to justify a reasonable suspicion that Appellee was engaged in illegal drug activity on the occasion of the traffic stop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Commonwealth appealed the suppression order. The Court of Appeals agreed that the collective knowledge rule permitted Eaton to rely upon Qualls' observation of the turn signal violation, and so, it held that the stop of Appellee's vehicle was justified. Nevertheless, the Court of Appeals agreed with the trial court's\n   conclusion that the police officers' collective knowledge of Appellee's criminal record and informants' reports of his drug-dealing activity were insufficient to justify a\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   stop of his vehicle, and that nothing happened during the stop to generate a reasonable and articulable suspicion that Appellee was engaging in criminal activity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court of Appeals also agreed with the trial court that the drug sniff search improperly exceeded the scope of the traffic stop without reasonable cause and that the dog sniff unreasonably prolonged the traffic stop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Finally, upon grounds that the issue had not been preserved for appellate review, the Court of Appeals refused to consider the Commonwealth's claim that as an active parolee, Appellee's Fourth Amendment rights were curtailed and the warrantless, suspicionless search of his person and vehicle was proper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   We granted discretionary review, and for reasons stated below, we affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The Court of Appeals noted that Eaton did none of the routine matters associated with a traffic stop, including the issuance of a citation, while he conducted the sniff search. The Commonwealth contends that Eaton's sniff search did not unreasonably extend the time of Appellee's detention beyond what would reasonably be necessary to effectuate the purpose of the stop since Eaton could not have run a license and registration check or completed the citation paperwork in the time taken to conduct the sniff search. What the Commonwealth overlooks is that Eaton conducted the sniff search\n   <em>\n    instead\n   </em>\n   of conducting the usual procedures incidental to a routine traffic stop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Prolonging a stop beyond what is reasonably required to complete the stop's mission violates the Fourth Amendment's proscription against unreasonable seizures.\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12588788\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/1609/#p1615\">\n    135 S.Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1616 (citing\n   <em>\n    Caballes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5902584\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/405/#p407\">\n    543 U.S. at 407\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5902584\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/405/#p407\">\n    125 S.Ct. 834\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). The legitimate purpose of the traffic stop, Eaton's proper mission, was to cite Appellee for making an improper turn. \"[W]hen tasks tied to the traffic infraction are-or reasonably should have been-completed,\" further detention of the driver is unreasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1614 (\"[I]n determining the reasonable duration of a stop, 'it [is] appropriate to examine whether the police diligently pursued [the] investigation.' \" (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Significantly, instead of diligently pursuing the purpose of the traffic stop, Eaton seemingly abandoned the legitimate purpose of issuing a traffic citation because he immediately asked Appellee about drugs and launched the dog's sniff search. \"The critical question [is] whether conducting the sniff 'prolongs'-\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   adds time to-'the stop.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1616. Obviously, the search added time to the stop because it was conducted before the purpose of the stop was addressed. Indeed, along with the other undisputed facts of record, it is apparent that the traffic stop was anticipated as an advantageous opportunity to conduct a sniff test for drugs, rather than the genuine enforcement of traffic laws.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Commonwealth cites\n   <em>\n    Davis v.

We reject the Commonwealth's argument that Eaton avoided the\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   problem simply by deploying the dog at the beginning of the stop, before addressing the traffic violation, instead of at the end of the stop after addressing the traffic violation. If the traffic citation was deferred to complete the sniff search, then the officer did not act with reasonable diligence to pursue the legitimate object of the traffic stop. Either way, the stop was prolonged beyond what was reasonably needed to complete the purpose of the stop. Eaton deferred the issuance of the citation to conduct the dog sniff search, and thereby unreasonably prolonged the stop, albeit for a very brief time. \"There is no '\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   exception' to the rule that a traffic stop cannot be prolonged for reasons unrelated to the purpose of the stop.\"\n   <em>\n    Davis,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6810405\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/484/288/#p290\">\n    484 S.W.3d at 294\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"[A]n officer cannot detain a vehicle's occupants beyond completion of the purpose of the initial traffic stop unless something happened during the stop to cause the officer to have a reasonable and articulable suspicion that criminal activity [is] afoot.\"\n   <em>\n    Turley,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7093296\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/399/412/\">\n    399 S.W.3d at 421\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation and internal quotes omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Specifically, the informants provided Appellee's name, alias, residence, vehicles, employment, and the bar Appellee frequented for transacting cocaine sales. Qualls' surveillance confirmed some of that information. Second, the officers knew that Appellee was on parole for a previous conviction for trafficking in cocaine.

Qualls described none of the typical observations\n   ordinarily indicative of suspicious drug-related activity. There was no complaint from neighbors about suspicious activity at Appellee's apartment or reports of numerous people coming and going from Appellee's residence. There was no controlled buy of cocaine from Appellee to corroborate the informants' tips. There was no indication that Appellant was using his car to transport cocaine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth v.

The officers' knowledge that Appellee had been convicted of and was then on parole for trafficking in cocaine does not support reasonable, articulable suspicion that he was in possession of cocaine at the time of the stop, and the confidential tips that he was known to be trafficking at a nearby bar did not provide sufficient additional information to create a reasonable suspicion to conduct the stop, or to extend the otherwise lawful stop to conduct the search.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The Commonwealth cites\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth v.

We do not disagree. We simply conclude, as did the trial court and the Court of Appeals, that nothing happened before Eaton launched the dog sniff search that transformed the situation from a routine stop for a traffic infraction into a drug trafficking case. The only additional factor cited is Appellee's apparent nervousness. While that is certainly part of the totality of circumstances to be examined,\n   <em>\n    Adkins v.

Consequently, the trial court made no specific findings relating to Appellee's parole status or his susceptibility to a warrantless, suspicionless search on account of that status. The Commonwealth complains that the trial court's findings of fact are, therefore, incomplete, arbitrary, and clearly erroneous, since Appellee's parole status was clearly a determinative fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   RCr 8.20(2) plainly states that \"[w]hen factual issues are involved in deciding [the suppression] motion, the court shall state its essential findings on the record.\" Nevertheless, even if Appellee's parole status was as determinative as the Commonwealth now contends, it was obliged to raise the omission by motion under CR 52.02 asking the trial court to make the additional findings and amend its order accordingly.

Therefore, I do not\n   support the use of canine inspection of vehicles without the circumstances reaching such a level, even if done simultaneously with the processing of the traffic stop and without any delay of that purpose.
