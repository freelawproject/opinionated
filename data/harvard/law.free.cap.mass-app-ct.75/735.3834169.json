L. c. 268, \u00a7 32B.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On appeal, the defendant claims the judge erred in not giving the defendant\u2019s requested jury instruction that a resisting arrest conviction cannot rest on postarrest conduct. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-15\">1. <em>Background. </em>During the early evening hours of July 20, 2006, State police Trooper Ron Solimini was on routine patrol in Boston when he stopped a yellow Honda automobile because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>it had excessive window tint.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> When Solimini first approached the car, he thought he saw someone throw something out of a rear, passenger side window. The car had five occupants, four women and one man, the defendant, who was seated in the back seat behind the driver. When he used his flashlight to look in the back seat, Sohmini saw the female in the middle of the back seat reaching forward and grabbing for something, which she said was a cellular telephone. He also noticed that both the defendant and the woman seated next to the other rear door were slouched against their doors as though they were concealing something.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">Based on what he had seen, Solimini asked everyone inside the car for their names and dates of birth. With the exception of the defendant, all cooperated. The defendant looked away from Solimini, and ignored the request for his name. When Solimini again asked for the defendant\u2019s name, the defendant replied, \u201c[T]his is fucking bullshit, this is because we\u2019re black, I don\u2019t have to give you anything.\u201d In response to Solimini\u2019s third request for his name and identification, the defendant replied, \u201cI don\u2019t have to give you anything.\u201d Based on the defendant\u2019s demeanor and furtive behavior, as well as that of the other passengers, Solimini perceived the defendant as a threat and asked him to leave the vehicle so he could pat frisk him for a weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">The defendant reluctantly got out of the car. Once he was outside, the defendant became very aggressive and called Solimini \u201cracist motherfucker\u201d and \u201cwhite boy.\u201d He said, \u201c[W]hat are you going to do, you\u2019re not going to search me,\u201d took \u201calmost a fighting stance,\u201d \u201cbladed himself away from\u201d Solimini, crossed his arms, and said, \u201c[YJou\u2019re not going to search me, what are you going to do about it[?]\u201d Solimini asked the defendant to mm around and place his hands behind his back so Solimini could pat frisk him for weapons. The defendant refused. Solimini handcuffed the defendant to protect both of them. The defendant called Solimini \u201ca fucking dickhead,\u201d screamed for help, and yelled, \u201c[Discrimination, discrimination\u201d; he was \u201cout of control.\u201d At this point, Solimini placed the defendant under arrest for disorderly conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>Solimini called for backup and waited for other troopers to arrive. He could not pat frisk the defendant until other troopers arrived because the defendant was spinning away from him and he could not get a grasp on the defendant even though he was handcuffed. Traffic was backing up because of the defendant\u2019s behavior. Once the other troopers arrived, Solimini was able to pat frisk the defendant. He did not find any weapons. While Troopers Shervan, Franzella, and Cameron were attempting to place the defendant in Solimini\u2019s cruiser, he continued to be belligerent, and screamed and yelled at the troopers. He called them \u201cracist motherfuckers\u201d and refused to get inside. As Trooper Shervan was guiding the defendant into the cruiser, the defendant gave a backward \u201cdonkey kick\u201d to Shervan\u2019s leg. Trooper Cameron \u201cgrabbed the backseat of [the defendant\u2019s] pants\u201d and slid him into the cruiser. Inside the cruiser, the defendant continued to be belligerent and spouted obscenities. The driver of the Honda automobile was written a citation and all four women were permitted to leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">In his defense, the defendant testified to a different version of the events. In his version, he was compliant and cooperative with Trooper Solimini during the entire roadside stop. Outside the car, the defendant \u201cassumed the position,\u201d was pat frisked, and then was handcuffed for safety. After Solimini requested backup, they waited in silence for a few minutes until the other troopers arrived. A second search of the defendant revealed nothing, and the defendant was put in the cruiser. Because the defendant was over six feet tall, he requested help to get in the cruiser; the troopers told him \u201cto shut up and get in the car.\u201d When the defendant was unable to get in on his own, a trooper forced him inside. The defendant denied ever resisting arrest, kicking any of the troopers, or yelling.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>The defendant claims that he was arrested when he was ordered out of the car and told to \u201cassume the position,\u201d and that all of his subsequent conduct could not be considered by the jury in support of the resisting arrest charge. Because the judge erroneously refused his requested instruction, he claims, the jury were not prevented from considering postarrest conduct. We disagree.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b760-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>In determining whether the evidence required an instruction concerning action taken during the incident in question, here postarrest conduct, we view the evidence in its light most favorable to the defendant. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kendall, </em>451 Mass. 10, 11 (2008) (necessity defense instruction); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Espada, </em>450 Mass. 687, 690 (2008) (self-defense instruction). Beginning with the defendant\u2019s own testimony, we find it provides him no assistance because he claimed that he offered no resistance at all as opposed to segmented episodes of resistance. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grandison, </em>433 Mass. 135, 143-147 (2001). Similarly unhelpful to the defendant is Trooper Solimi-ni\u2019s testimony, which described the defendant\u2019s continuous course of resistance. Trooper Cameron testified that when he arrived, the handcuffed defendant was \u201cbecoming unruly, [and] was shouting and yelling.\u201d Upon her arrival, Trooper Carney testified that she saw the defendant standing on the sidewalk handcuffed. \u201cAs [she] turned her attention to the females in the motor vehicle,\u201d she noticed the defendant causing a \u201ccommotion,\u201d \u201c[Resisting, struggling [and] not being cooperative,\u201d as the troopers tried to put him in the cruiser. Thus, in the light most favorable to the defendant, there may have been a brief pause in the defendant\u2019s resistive effort. However, as we determine below, this is insufficient to justify the requested instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">\u201cAn arrest occurs where there is (1) \u2018an actual or constructive seizure or detention of the person, [2] performed with the intention to effect an arrest and [3] so understood by the person detained.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 145, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>419 Mass. 192, 198 (1994). For purposes of G. L. c. 268, \u00a7 32B, the act of preventing, or attempting to prevent, the effecting of an arrest does not invite a snapshot of a moment in time that is deemed to be \u201cthe arrest\u201d after which the defendant\u2019s behavior becomes wholly irrelevant.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Rather, effecting an arrest is a process <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>that begins when the above three criteria are present and ends when the person is fully detained by his submission to official force or placed in a secure location from which he can neither escape nor harm the police officer or others nearby.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">Contrary to the defendant\u2019s claim, his arrest was not complete at the point when he was ordered out of the car or even when he was handcuffed. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Katykhin, </em>59 Mass. App. Ct. 261, 262-263 (2003). Although he had been seized in the constitutional sense when he was handcuffed, the defendant\u2019s arrest had not been \u201ceffect[ed],\u201d within the \u201cmeaning of G. L. c. 268, \u00a7 32B, at least until he was fully detained in the cruiser.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 263. His aggressive resisting conduct, \u201cimmediately [before and] after being handcuffed, prevented and preceded the conclusion of\u201d his arrest. <em>Ibid. </em>For the purposes of G. L. c. 268, \u00a7 32B, the defendant\u2019s behavior prevented or attempted to prevent the State troopers from \u201ceffecting\u201d his arrest before the arrest was complete. A brief pause in the resistive effort is insufficient to constitute the submission necessary for the arrest to be fully effected. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ocasio, </em>71 Mass. App. Ct. 304, 306, 311, cert. denied, 129 S. Ct. 314 (2008) (where defendant was handcuffed for fifteen minutes in apartment before he resisted being placed in police cmiser, that conduct was not \u201cpostarrest\u201d where process of \u201ceffecting\u201d his arrest continued until he was placed in cruiser).</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">As he did at trial, the defendant claims his requested instruction was required in light of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grandison, supra </em>at 145-146. However, as the trial judge ruled, that reliance is misplaced. In <em>Grandison, </em>there were two distinct events of resistance that were separate in time. There, the defendant was first detained and handcuffed at the scene. During this sequence, he stiffened his arms and refused to comply with the officer\u2019s request to put his hands behind his back. <em>Id. </em>at 143-144. This behavior satisfied the statutory requirements for resisting arrest. <em>Id. </em>at 145. He was then brought to the police station, where a scuffle ensued. The court concluded that the defendant had been immobilized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>when he was handcuffed at the scene, and that therefore the arrest had been effected at that time. Consequently, the police station scuffle sequence was postarrest, and could not be considered by the jury in connection with the charge. Because it could not be said with certainty that the jury had relied exclusively on the evidence of the defendant\u2019s conduct during the arrest, the court determined that there was a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. <em>Id. </em>at 147.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">Unlike the <em>Grandison </em>case, this case does not feature two distinct sequences of resistance separated by an effected arrest. Rather, the defendant\u2019s actions here constituted a \u201ccontinuous course of conduct,\u201d which was specifically noted by the <em>Grandi-son </em>court as a circumstance different from the two separate events described in that case. <em>Ibid. </em>See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Katykhin, supra </em>at 263. Also, even if there was a brief pause in the handcuffed defendant\u2019s resistive effort, that pause was insufficient to constitute the submission necessary for his arrest to be fully effected, which did not occur until he was placed in the cruiser. Because there were no separate incidents of resistance as in <em>Grandison, </em>an instruction that the jury must not consider post-arrest conduct was not only unnecessary, but would have been inappropriate. Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Conefrey, </em>420 Mass. 508, 513 (1995) (\u201cwhere evidence of separate incidents is offered to the jury and any one incident could support a conviction, a general unanimity instruction may not suffice\u201d). The judge did not err by refusing to give the requested instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b757-16\"> The jury found the defendant not guilty of refusing to give his name and address to a police officer at night, disorderly conduct, threatening to commit a crime, and assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b758-7\"> Aided by a tint meter, Solimini determined that the car\u2019s windows had a transparency level of six percent, whereas thirty-five percent is the lowest acceptable level.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b759-7\"> The Commonwealth argues that the claimed error was not properly preserved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>at trial. The defendant claims that the judge saved his rights when she denied the request at the charge conference, which obviated any need for him to object again when the instruction was not given. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gre-nier, </em>415 Mass. 680, 686 n.8 (1993). Because we determine there was no error in denying the request, we need not decide whether it was properly preserved.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b760-8\"> General Laws c. 268, \u00a7 32B, states in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-9\"><em>\u201c(a) </em>A person commits the crime of resisting arrest if he knowingly prevents or attempts to prevent a police officer, acting under color of his official <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>authority, from effecting an arrest of the actor or another, by: (1) using or threatening to use physical force or violence against the police officer or another; or (2) using any other means which creates a substantial risk of causing bodily injury to such police officer or another.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
