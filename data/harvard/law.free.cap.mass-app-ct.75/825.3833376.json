App. Ct. 306, 313-316 (2007), that an administrative judge in the Department of Industrial Accidents (department) need not adopt the conclusions of an impartial medical examiner\u2019s (IME\u2019s) report in a workers\u2019 compensation case where the judge finds the factual foundation of the report not credible. As such, we affirm the decision of the department\u2019s reviewing board, which summarily affirmed the decision of the administrative judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-14\"><em>Facts. </em>On September 7, 2005, the employee, Thomas Brom-mage, injured his lower back while helping to put food into a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>refrigerator.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Shortly thereafter, he allegedly began suffering from major depression related to the accident. On the day Brom-mage informed his employer about his disability, his employment was terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\">Brommage filed both physical and psychiatric workers\u2019 compensation claims, under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7\u00a7 34 &amp; 35, seeking benefits under \u00a7\u00a7 13 and 30 for his medical and psychiatric care. Two IMEs were assigned pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 11A(2), to evaluate the two different claims. Concerning the physical claim, the IME concluded that Brommage was partially disabled. The administrative judge agreed, granting workers\u2019 compensation benefits under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 35. Conversely, the administrative judge disagreed with the IME evaluating the psychiatric claim, who concluded that Brommage suffered from major depression, moderate to severe, and mild to moderate anxiety. The psychiatric IME further stated that Brommage was temporarily totally disabled as a result of his psychiatric condition.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">Following a hearing on October 1, 2007,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the administrative judge found the report of the psychiatric IME to be adequate.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He further found, however, the testimony of Brommage regarding his psychiatric claim not credible, concluding that it was exaggerated and concocted to maintain compensation benefits.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>Determining that the psychiatric IME\u2019s report was based on a factual foundation that was not credible, he declined to adopt it, thus denying the psychiatric claim under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 30. The department\u2019s reviewing board summarily affirmed the administrative judge\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">On appeal, Brommage argues that the administrative judge impermissibly substituted his lay judgment for that of the expert IME. Since the administrative judge was entitled to weigh the IME\u2019s report against other evidence, including Brommage\u2019s testimony, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\"><em>Standard of review. </em>In cases where the department\u2019s reviewing board summarily affirms the decision of an administrative judge, the reviewing court inspects the findings and reasoning of the administrative judge. <em>Dalbec\u2019s Case, </em>69 Mass. App. Ct. at 313. We consider \u201cwhether the decision is factually warranted and not \u2018[arbitrary or capricious,\u2019 in the sense of having adequate evidentiary and factual support and disclosing reasoned decision making within the particular requirements governing a workers\u2019 compensation dispute.\u201d <em>Scheffler\u2019s Case, </em>419 Mass. 251, 258 (1994), quoting from G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7)(g). \u201cIn so doing, we must ascertain whether the decision contain[s] conclusions which are adequately supported by subsidiary findings which are not lacking in evidential support or . . . tainted by error of law.\u201d <em>Patterson </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>48 Mass. App. Ct. 586, 587 n.5 (2000) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b849-7\">\u201cWhether an employee has suffered a total disability is a question of fact, and a board\u2019s finding on that issue must stand unless unsupported by the evidence.\u201d <em>MacDonald\u2019s Case, </em>73 Mass. App. Ct. 657, 662 (2009), quoting from <em>Trant\u2019s Case, </em>21 Mass. App. Ct. 983, 984 (1986). \u201cFindings of fact, assessments of credibility, and determinations of the weight to be given the evidence are the exclusive function of the administrative judge.\u201d <em>Pilon\u2019s Case, </em>69 Mass. App. Ct. 167, 169 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b849-8\"><em>The report of the IME. </em>Under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 11A(2), as amended by St. 1991, c. 398, \u00a7 30, an IME\u2019s \u201creport shall constitute prima facie evidence of the matters contained therein,\u201d and absent contradictory medical evidence an administrative judge is required to accept the IME\u2019s report as true. <em>Young\u2019s Case, </em>64 Mass. App. Ct. 903, 904 (2005). However, prima facie <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>evidence is rebuttable, not conclusive, and \u201cmay be met and overcome by evidence sufficient to warrant a contrary conclusion.\u201d <em>Dalbec\u2019s </em>Case, 69 Mass. App. Ct. at 313-314, quoting from <em>Anderson\u2019s </em>Case, 373 Mass. 813, 817 (1977). \u201cAn IME opinion does not attain the status of prima facie evidence if it goes beyond the medical issues in the case; if it is not expressed in terms of probability; or if it is unsupported by admissible evidence in the record or any other proper basis.\u201d <em>Young\u2019s Case, 64 </em>Mass. App. Ct. at 904 (citations omitted). To this we add that the IME\u2019s report is not entitled to any weight unless the fact finder believes the facts on which the report is based.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-4\">An administrative judge may uncover deficiencies in the findings and reasoning in the IME\u2019s report and if so, that report may give way to a contrary conclusion for one or more reasons. <em>Dal-bec\u2019s Case, 69 </em>Mass. App. Ct. at 314. The administrative judge may also give \u201cdecisive weight\u201d to the testimony of the employee. <em>Ibid. </em>See <em>Orange </em>v. <em>Shay, </em>68 Mass. App. Ct. 358, 361-362 (2007), quoting from <em>Johnston </em>v. <em>Johnston, </em>38 Mass. App. Ct. 531, 536 (1995) (judge\u2019s credibility determinations \u201cclose to immune from reversal on appeal except on the most compelling of showings\u201d). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>437 Mass. 554, 561 (2002); Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7 702 (2008-2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">Here, the administrative judge found Brommage\u2019s testimony lacking in credibility.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Since the conclusions of the psychiatric IME were based on the same facts the administrative judge discredited, the administrative judge declined, properly in our view, to adopt those conclusions. The administrative judge made a reasoned decision based on the evidence before him. \u201cWe will not disturb the judge\u2019s findings that are \u2018reasonably deduced from the evidence and the rational inferences of which it was susceptible.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pilon\u2019s Case, 69 </em>Mass. App. Ct. at 169, quoting from <em>Chapman\u2019s Case, </em>321 Mass. 705, 707 (1947).</p>\n<p id=\"b850-6\">\n<em>Decision of reviewing board affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b848-6\"> At the time of the injury, Brommage was a vice-president and corporate director at Unidine Corporation, but was helping out in the kitchen due to a personnel shortage.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b848-7\"> The psychiatric IME\u2019s report stated, among other things, that Brommage denied any previous history of depression or other psychiatric problems or treatment prior to his back injury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b848-8\"> The psychiatric IME was deposed in lieu of testifying at the hearing, and a transcript of his deposition was in evidence before the administrative judge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b848-9\"> The adequacy of an IME\u2019s report relates to whether it conforms to the proper scope and purpose of an examination under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 11A(2). See <em>Coggin </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Parole Bd., </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 584, 588-589 (1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b848-10\"> Specifically, the administrative judge found that Brommage\u2019s testimony that he could not concentrate, spent a lot of time watching television, was unable to read a book or finish a task, had recurring nightmares that affected his sleep, had racing or consuming thoughts, and needed to take daily naps, was inconsistent with his ability at the hearing to follow questions and formulate responses. The administrative judge further noted that Brommage had an excellent memory. While it would have been fully permissible for the administrative judge to accept Brommage\u2019s complaints as credible, he was not required to do so.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b850-7\"> Conversely, in <em>Dalbec\u2019s Case, </em>69 Mass. App. Ct. at 314-316, wherein the IME opined the employee could return to full employment, the administrative judge found otherwise, relying in large part on the credibility of the employee.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
