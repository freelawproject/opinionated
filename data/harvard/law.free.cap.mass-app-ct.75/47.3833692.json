We conclude that the provision passes muster.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">Joseph W. Gordon filed a complaint for a writ of mandamus, seeking an order that the registry of motor vehicles (RMV) reissue his license without the requirement that he install an ignition interlock device (HD) in accordance with G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24 V2, a provision of Melanie\u2019s Law.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Gordon subsequently filed an amended complaint seeking a declaratory judgment, and preliminary and permanent injunctive relief. Gordon asserted that the HD requirement of \u00a7 24Va violated his constitutional rights to be free from ex post facto laws and double jeopardy, and that the requirement impermissibly deprived him of his due process rights. Both the RMV and Gordon filed motions for summary judgment. On November 30, 2007, the judge allowed the RMV\u2019s motion for summary judgment and denied Gordon\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Gordon appealed. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\"><em>Background.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In 1989, Gordon committed his first offense of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol (OUI), in violation of G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24D. That case was continued without a finding. On December 17, 2003, Gordon was convicted of a subsequent OUI. As a result, Gordon received a second-offense alternative disposition. As part of that disposition, Gordon was required to take alcohol education classes and his license was suspended for two years. Subsequently, Gordon requested and received a hardship license from the RMV, which allowed him to operate his vehicle in the daytime hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">On January 1, 2006, G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24V2, went into effect, requiring individuals with two or more OUI convictions (offender) who seek a new license or a reinstatement of a license to install an HD on all vehicles they own, lease, or operate. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 241/2.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> An HD must remain installed for a period of two years, <em>ibid., </em>and the offender bears the cost of installation and maintenance. See 540 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 25.07 (2006). Once installed on a motor vehicle, the offender must blow into the IID in order to start the vehicle\u2019s engine. The HD prevents a vehicle from starting if it detects a blood alcohol concentration level over a preset limit of .02 or 20 mg of alcohol per 100 ml of blood. See G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 12(c)</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">Gordon was eligible to apply for his license reinstatement on December 17, 2005. He applied for the reinstatement on January 3, 2006, a few days after G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 241/2, went into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>effect. The RMV informed Gordon that his license would be reinstated only after he demonstrated proof of having installed an IID on his vehicle. The RMV then sent Gordon a letter informing him that his hardship license would also be revoked unless he installed the IID by March 4, 2006. Because Gordon failed to install the IID, his hardship license was revoked as of March 5, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>Standard of review. </em>\u201cThe standard of review of a grant of summary judgment is whether, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, all material facts have been established and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Augat, Inc. </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>410 Mass. 117, 120 (1991). See Mass.R.Civ.P. 56(c), as amended, 436 Mass. 1404 (2002). In this case, the facts are undisputed; thus, we review the record to determine if either party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. See <em>Nelson </em>v. <em>Salem State College, </em>446 Mass. 525, 530 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">2. <em>The ex post facto claim. </em>The United States Supreme Court has held that every law which \u201cchanges the punishment, and inflicts a greater punishment, than the law annexed to the crime, when committed,\u201d is in violation of the ex post facto clause of the United States Constitution.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Calder </em>v. <em>Bull, </em>3 U.S. (3 Dall.) 386, 390 (1798). This prohibition, however, applies only to statutes <em>that are </em>punitive in nature; civil remedies are not subject to the prohibition against ex post facto laws. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fourteen Thousand Two Hundred Dollars, </em>421 Mass. 1, 6 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">Gordon avers that the IID requirement is punitive and it therefore violates his constitutional right to be free from ex post facto laws. We disagree. \u201cWhether a statute was intended to be criminal or civil depends on the Legislature\u2019s intent, which is a matter of statutory construction.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bruno, </em>432 Mass. 489, 500 (2000), quoting from <em>Kansas </em>v. <em>Hendricks, </em>521 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>U.S. 346, 361 (1997). If a statute was intended to be civil, then it must be interpreted as such unless the \u201cparty challenging the statute provides \u2018the clearest proof\u2019 that \u2018the statutory scheme [is] so punitive either in purpose or effect as to negate [the State\u2019s] intention\u2019 to deem it \u2018civil.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kansas, supra, </em>quoting from <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>448 U.S. 242, 248-249 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">In support of his argument, Gordon relies on the statute\u2019s emergency preamble,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> which states: \u201cWhereas, [t]he deferred operation of this act would tend to defeat its purpose, which is to increase penalties for drunk drivers in the Commonwealth, therefore it is hereby declared to be an emergency law, necessary for the immediate preservation of the public safety.\u201d St. 2005, c. 122, preamble. General statements in the preamble of a statute do not control its specific provisions. See <em>Milk Control Bd. </em>v. <em>Gosselin\u2019s Dairy, </em>301 Mass. 174, 179-180 (1938). Although the preamble refers to \u201cpenalties,\u201d that term does not necessarily render the entire statute penal. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>One Assortment of 89 Firearms, </em>465 U.S. 354, 364 n.6 (1984) (statute labeled \u201cpenalties\u201d included provisions with remedial purpose). In fact, the preamble goes on to state that it is aimed at the \u201cpreservation of public safety\u201d \u2014 a purpose that is remedial. See <em>Luk </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>421 Mass. 415, 423-430 (1995); <em>Leduc </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>421 Mass. 433, 436 (1995), cert. denied, 519 U.S. 827 (1996); <em>Bruno, supra. </em>Thus, while some of the provisions in Melanie\u2019s Law are penal in nature, see, e.g., G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24V (creating new penalties for driving while intoxicated with a child in the car), we think that the preamble\u2019s reference to increased penalties was not particularly tailored to the ED provision, and that the ED provision is part of a large statutory scheme aimed at reducing the number of accidents caused by drunk driving. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Stoller, </em>78 F.3d 710, 722 (1st Cir. 1996) (concluding statutory provision was remedial notwithstanding fact that sentence in legislative history contained \u201cpenal\u201d element and other provisions within statute increased punishments).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-10\">Additionally, the Supreme Judicial Court, on numerous occa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>sions, has ruled that statutes imposing conditions on eligibility for continued licensure are remedial and nonpunitive in nature. See, e.g., <em>Rushworth </em>v. <em>Registrar of Motor Vehicles, </em>413 Mass. 265, 270-271 (1992); <em>Luk, </em>supra; <em>Leduc, supra </em>at 435-436; <em>Du-pont </em>v. <em>Chief of Police of Pepperell, </em>57 Mass. App. Ct. 690, 694-695 (2003). For instance, in <em>Luk, supra </em>at 430, the court upheld a provision of G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24, which mandates suspension of the driver\u2019s license of any individual who refuses to submit to a breathalyzer test in the event of an arrest based on OUI. The court emphasized that a driver\u2019s license is \u201ca privilege voluntarily granted\u201d and that \u201c[r] evocation of this privilege has long reflected public safety concerns.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 423.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">In sum, the legislative scheme and case law considering that scheme support the conclusion that the IID restriction, with its goal of public safety, is not punitive.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> While the IID requirement may be burdensome on Gordon,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> that circumstance alone does not transform the statutory sanction into criminal punishment. See <em>Fleming </em>v. <em>Nestor, </em>363 U.S. 603, 614 (1960) (even though restriction may bear harshly on individual, it is not punishment). Compare <em>Hawker </em>v. <em>New York, </em>170 U.S. 189, 196 (1898) (even laws preventing individual from practicing profession as a result of criminal conduct are not punitive if underlying purpose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>is remedial). As Gordon failed to meet the burden of demonstrating that the statutory scheme at issue here is punitive, we determine that the IID requirement does not violate Gordon\u2019s constitutional protection against ex post facto laws.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\">3. <em>The double jeopardy claim. </em>The double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution protects against three distinct abuses: (1) \u201ca second prosecution for the same offense after acquittal\u201d; (2) \u201ca second prosecution for the same offense after conviction\u201d; and (3) \u201cmultiple punishments for the same offense.\u201d <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Pearce, </em>395 U.S. 711, 717 (1969). In addition to its application as a State constitutional or common-law doctrine, the double jeopardy clause applies to State prosecutions by operation of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. See <em>Benton </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>395 U.S. 784, 787, 794 (1969). See also <em>Powers </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>426 Mass. 534, 537 n.5, 540 n.13 (1998) (Massachusetts has common-law and statutory protections equivalent to those provided for in the double jeopardy clause). Gordon asserts that G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24V2, violates the third protection provided by the double jeopardy clause, claiming that it punishes him a second time for the offense he committed in 2003.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> As with the ex post facto clause, the double jeopardy clause applies only if Gordon demonstrates that the HD requirement is punitive. See <em>Luk, </em>421 Mass. at 419.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>Gordon contends that based on <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hudson, </em>14 F.3d 536, 540 (10th Cir. 1994), \u201cif a sanction is not exclusively remedial, but rather can only be explained as also affecting deterrence or retribution, it is punishment for double jeopardy analysis. \u201d In fact, however, <em>Hudson </em>eventually reached the United States Supreme Court, which ruled that the statute at issue was remedial, despite having a punitive element. Specifically, the Court stated: \u201c[W]e recognize that the imposition of both money penalties and debarment sanctions will deter others from emulating petitioners\u2019 conduct, a traditional goal of criminal punishment. But the mere presence of this purpose is insufficient to render a sanction criminal, as deterrence \u2018may serve civil as well as criminal goals.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hudson </em>v. <em>United States, 522 </em>U.S. 93, 105 (1997) <em>(Hudson II), </em>quoting from <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ursery, </em>518 U.S. 267, 292 (1996). The Court further emphasized that the sanction at issue, \u201cwhile intended to deter future wrongdoing, also serve[s] to promote the stability of the banking industry. To hold that the mere presence of a deterrent purpose renders such sanction[] \u2018criminal\u2019 for double jeopardy purposes would severely undermine the Government\u2019s ability to engage in effective regulation of institutions such as banks.\u201d <em>Hudson II, supra. </em>See <em>Stoller, </em>78 F.3d at 724 (\u201cWhere . . . double jeopardy analysis proceeds under an appraisal of the totality of the circumstances, a civil sanction need not be solely remedial to pass constitutional muster. In other words, the fact that something akin to punishment occurs along with, and incidental to, a sanction\u2019s overriding remedial purpose will not transform a permissible civil penalty into a prohibited multiple punishment\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">To be sure, the double jeopardy prohibition cannot be avoided by merely calling a statute civil when, in effect, it is criminal. However, here, as we determined above, the main purpose and effect of the IID requirement are clearly remedial and civil.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> See <em>Hudson II, supra </em>at 104, quoting from <em>Flemming </em>363 U.S. at 617 (\u201cWhile petitioners have been prohibited from further participating in the banking industry, this is \u2018certainly nothing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>approaching the \u201cinfamous punishment\u201d of imprisonment\u2019 \u201d). As such, Gordon\u2019s double jeopardy claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">4. <em>Due process claim. </em>Finally, Gordon appears to contend that the IID requirement violates his substantive due process rights, and that its application as to him constitutes impermissble retroactive enforcement. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">a. <em>Substantive due process. </em>Substantive due process prohibits the government from engaging in conduct that \u201cshocks the conscience,\u201d <em>Rochin </em>v. <em>California, </em>342 U.S. 165, 172 (1952), or interferes with rights \u201cimplicit in the concept of ordered liberty.\u201d <em>Palko </em>v. <em>Connecticut, </em>302 U.S. 319, 324-326 (1937). \u201cIn substantive due process analysis, the nature of the individual interest at stake determines the standard of review that courts apply when deciding whether a challenged statute meets the requirements of the due process clause.\u201d <em>Aime </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>414 Mass. 667, 673 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">It is well established that the due process clause applies to the deprivation of a driver\u2019s license by the State. <em>Dixon </em>v. <em>Love, </em>431 U.S. 105, 112 (1977). The interest at stake, however, is not a fundamental right; therefore, the due process inquiry is focused on whether the statute is reasonably related to a permissible legislative objective. <em>Rushworth, </em>413 Mass. at 269 n.5, 270. The statute in the instant case is entitled to a presumption of validity, see <em>Marshal House, Inc. </em>v. <em>Rent Control Bd. of Brookline, </em>358 Mass. 686, 694 (1971), and Gordon has the burden of establishing that the statute lacks a rational basis. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Franklin Fruit Co., </em>388 Mass. 228, 235 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-8\">We concur with the Superior Court judge that enforcing G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 241/2, in the instant case, rationally serves the legislative purpose of protecting the public from the danger of drunk driving. In effectuating its interest, the Legislature has determined that all repeat OUI offenders pose a danger to the public safety and are, therefore, subject to the HD requirement. The authority to select the most effective procedures for dealing with a serious problem such as drunk driving belongs to the Legislature. See <em>Luk, </em>421 Mass. at 429. Further, the Legislature is not confined to individualized determinations in order to implement public safety. See <em>Spence </em>v. <em>Gormley, </em>387 Mass. 258, 270 (1982). While Gordon contends that the IID requirement will unduly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>impose burdens on drivers who are subject to G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24V2, we note that the Legislature \u201cis not bound to choose the best or gentlest of methods\u201d to achieve the objective of public safety, <em>id. </em>at 271, and \u201c[sjome degree of overinclusiveness or underinclusiveness is constitutionally permissible\u201d in applying the rational basis test. See <em>Massachusetts Fedn. of Teachers, AFT, AFL-CIO </em>v. <em>Board of Educ., </em>436 Mass. 763, 778 (2002). In view of the carnage caused by individuals driving while intoxicated, the IID requirement can hardly be characterized as excessive. In sum, we hold that G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24 V2, as applied to Gordon, does not impermissibly infringe on his substantive due process rights.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">b. <em>Retroactivity. </em>Gordon contends that the IID requirement of \u00a7 24\u00bd was applied retroactively to him in violation of his due process rights, as it imposed sanctions against him for conduct committed before its enactment. However, the application of the IID requirement to Gordon was not retroactive as the event triggering the requirement was Gordon\u2019s decision to seek the reinstatement of his license, which occurred after the statute went into effect, and not his prior OUI conviction. See <em>Bruno, </em>432 Mass. at 497-498 (\u201cWhen the conduct triggering the statute\u2019s application occurs on or after its effective date, the statute\u2019s application is deemed prospective, and therefore permissible\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">Even if the IID requirement was deemed to be retroactive, it is still constitutional. <em>Doe, Sex Offender Registry Bd. No. 8725 </em>v. <em>Sex Offender Registry Bd., </em>450 Mass. 780, 788 (2008) <em>(Doe No. 8725). </em>\u201cRetroactive laws must meet the test of \u2018reasonableness\u2019 to comport with. . . constitutional due process requirements.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>quoting from <em>American Mfrs. Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>374 Mass. 181, 189-190 (1978). A retroactive statute will satisfy the due process requirement of reasonableness if it (1) serves an important public interest, such as health, safety, or welfare; (2) restricts or burdens a right or interest that is not fundamental or substantial; and (3) if it diminishes that right or interest to a rationally measured degree. See <em>American Mfrs. Mut. Ins. Co., supra </em>at 189-196; <em>Doe No. 8725, supra </em>at 788-793.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>Here, the IID requirement serves a very important purpose of safety on the roads. While it restricts an individual\u2019s freedom, as has been noted, \u201cthere is no fundamental right to operate a motor vehicle.\u201d <em>Rushworth, </em>413 Mass. at 269 n.5. In any event, the restriction \u2014 triggered by two OUI convictions, and not a single aberrant mistake \u2022\u2014 applies only for two years, and at an intermediate expense. Quite clearly, the HD requirement passes the reasonableness test of the due process clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\"><em>Conclusion. </em>For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court, allowing the RMV\u2019s motion for summary judgment and denying Gordon\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b70-8\"> At the same time, Gordon also requested, and was later denied, a preliminary injunction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b70-9\"> The underlying facts, which we take from the summary judgment record, are not disputed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b71-6\"> General Laws c. 90, \u00a7 24V2, inserted by St. 2005, c. 122, \u00a7 13, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-7\">\u201cNo person whose license has been suspended in the commonwealth or any other jurisdiction by reason of: an assignment to an alcohol or controlled substance education, treatment or rehabilitation program; or a conviction for violating paragraph (a) of subdivision (1) of section 24, subsection (a) of section 24G, operating a motor vehicle with a percentage by weight of blood alcohol of eight one-hundredths or greater, or while under the influence of intoxicating liquor in violation of subsection (b) of said section 24G, section 24L, section 13V2 of chapter 265, subsection (a) of section 8 of chapter 90B, section 8A or 8B of chapter 90B or, in the case of another jurisdiction, for any like offense, shall be issued a new license or right to operate or have his license or right to operate restored if he has previously been so assigned or convicted, unless a certified ignition interlock device has been installed on each vehicle owned, each vehicle leased and each vehicle operated by that person as a precondition to the issuance of a new license or right to operate or the restoration of such person\u2019s license or right to operate. A certified ignition interlock device shall be installed on all vehicles owned, leased and operated by the licensee for a period of 2 years and person restricted by a certified ignition interlock device shall have such device inspected, maintained and monitored in accordance with such regulations as the registrar shall promulgate.

A person aggrieved by a decision of the registrar pursuant to this section may file an appeal in the superior court of the trial court department.

See G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24A; 540 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 25.07(1). The individual also is required to visit an authorized service provider approximately every thirty days. See 540 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 25.07(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b75-5\"> Gordon\u2019s reliance on <em>Bruno </em>is misplaced; in fact, the case favors the RMV and not Gordon. In <em>Bruno, </em>432 Mass. at 499, the defendants argued that the sexual predator statute at issue was an ex post facto law, claiming that it was punitive in both intent and effect. The court rejected the argument, holding that the statute was civil and remedial as evidenced by its over-all statutory purpose. <em>Id. </em>at 500.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b75-6\"> Gordon maintains that as to the punishment of his 2003 offense, he paid his fines, had his license revoked, and participated successfully in his probation. He further argues that the fee that the RMV charges for the installation and use of the IID is comparable to the probation process itself. For instance, when an individual is on probation, that individual pays a monthly probation fee, checks in with a probation officer on regular basis, and where drugs and alcohol have been involved, can be required to provide a urine or hair sample for testing. According to Gordon, the IID requirement is equivalent to a regular probation scheme in that there is a monthly fee of $85, a monthly requirement to go to an IID installation location, and the requirement to utilize the HD in order to start and operate a vehicle. Gordon therefore concludes that \u201c[i]f probation is considered punishment, surely the HD requirement is punishment as well.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b76-6\"> As we have noted above, although the preamble refers to \u201cpenalties,\u201d that term does not render the statute penal. See <em>One Assortment of 89 Firearms, </em>465 U.S. at 364 n. 6.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b78-7\"> We also note that the minimal risk of erroneous deprivation of an individual\u2019s driver\u2019s license presented by \u00a7 24V2 and its postdeprivation procedural safeguards promote due process interests.
