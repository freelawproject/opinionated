Maginn, Jr. Count one alleged that the defendant breached a contract in which he purportedly agreed to assign to the plaintiffs certain shares of stock of iBasis, Inc. (iBasis), an Internet-based privately held company. Count two alleged that in breaching the contract, the defendant also committed unfair and deceptive practices in violation of G. L. c. 93A. The defendant filed counterclaims with respect to each count. Ultimately, a Superior Court judge ordered summary judgment dismissing all of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims and the defendant\u2019s counterclaims. The plaintiffs filed an appeal from the judgment dismissing the breach of contract claim only. The defendant noticed an appeal from the dismissal of his counterclaims. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">1. <em>Background.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>a. <em>The Jenzabar investment. </em>The defendant and Frishman first came into contact in May or June of 1999. At that time, the defendant, who was a partner at Bain &amp; Company (Bain), was raising capital for a privately held company called Jenzabar, Inc. (Jenzabar).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Charles Farkas, also a partner at Bain and a common acquaintance of the defendant and Frishman, asked Frishman if he would be interested in making an investment in Jenzabar. Frishman responded that he would be interested in making such an investment. Shortly thereafter, the defendant contacted Frishman to discuss Frishman\u2019s possible investment. Frishman confirmed to the defendant that he would like to proceed with the investment.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">On May 27, 1999, a limited liability company known as New Media Investors II, LLC (NM II), was formed as a vehicle for investing in unregistered securities of Jenzabar. Participation in NM II was limited to \u201caccredited investors.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The defendant became the managing partner of NM II.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>In or about June of 1999, Frishman informed a number of his friends and family members about the investing opportunity with Jenzabar. Thereafter, he assembled a group of investors that invested a total of $200,000 in Jenzabar via NM II. The group included Frishman himself, Simon, Jack Frishman (Jack), Edward Nassberg (Edward), Kenneth Gross, Yun Peng Wei, Gang Xiao, and Lily E. Deng.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">On various dates in June of 1999, Frishman, Simon, Jack, Edward, and Gross made their investments.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The defendant advised Frishman that neither Deng, nor Wei or Xiao, could invest directly in Jenzabar because none of them was an accredited investor.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The defendant further informed Frishman that if those individuals wanted to invest in Jenzabar, they would have to do so through Frishman. Accordingly, on June 14, 1999, Frish-man sent one of his own checks in the amount of $13,000 to Jenzabar as an investment through NM II on behalf of Deng, Wei, and Xiao.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">b. <em>The iBasis investment. </em>In 1996 or 1997, the defendant and other partners at Bain decided to invest in iBasis, Inc. The investment was done through an entity known as Sunapee Securities, Inc. (Sunapee). Sunapee purchased unregistered shares of series A convertible preferred iBasis stock (iBasis A shares) for $1 per share in December, 1997, and June, 1998. This stock would automatically convert into iBasis common stock upon the closing of an iBasis initial public offering (IPO). The amount of $75,000 was withheld from the defendant\u2019s compensation at Bain for purposes of his investment in iBasis through Sunapee.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>In the first or second quarter of 1999, iBasis decided to offer unregistered series C convertible preferred shares (iBasis C shares). In June, 1999, New Media Investors m, LLC (NM III), was created to allow Bain partners with preemptive rights to acquire interests in the iBasis C shares. Like the iBasis A shares, the iBasis C shares automatically converted into iBasis common stock upon the closing of an iBasis public offering and all purchasers had to be accredited investors.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">iBasis issued its C shares to NM III on July 12, 1999, at a price of $4.37 per share. The defendant contributed $340,062 to the capital of NM HI for the purchase of iBasis C shares thereby acquiring an interest in 77,817 iBasis C shares through NM III.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In issuing these unregistered shares, iBasis relied upon the exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 set forth in regulation D (17 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 230.501-230. 506). As part of their purchase of iBasis C shares, all purchasers were required to represent and warrant that they were \u201caccredited investors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">c. <em>Plaintiffs\u2019 participation in the iBasis investment. </em>On August 10, 1999, the defendant suggested to Frishman that he might be able to offer him some unregistered shares in iBasis. In the subsequent telephone conversation, the defendant told Frishman that he hoped to provide Frishman with $40,000 worth of unregistered pre-EPO shares of iBasis in gratitude for the $200,000 that Frishman raised for Jenzabar. The defendant also told Frishman that iBasis was planning an IPO in late 1999 and that the iBasis shares which he would be assigning to Frishman would be \u201clocked up\u201d for a period of six months following the IPO. Later on August 11, 1999, Frishman sent an electronic mail message (e-mail) to the defendant, setting forth his understanding of the proposed assignment from the defendant\u2019s NM III position, which read, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-9\">\u201cI am posting to you a check for $40,000 to cover the 20% \u2018linkage\u2019 in [iBasis] through New Media III based on our group\u2019s $200,000 investment in Jenzabar. The group <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>consists of the following accredited investors (Jenzabar investment):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-5\">\u201cDick Simon ($50,000)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-6\">Alan Frishman ($50,000)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-7\">Jack Frishman ($25,000)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-8\">Ed Nassberg ($25,000)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-9\">Ken Gross ($25,000)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-10\">\u201cThe remaining $25,000 is a consortium (boy, is that an overstatement or what?) headed by Dana\u2019s trust and including 3 other friends of [Deng]. This stock is held in my name given the eventual investment accredation [szc] requirement in Jenzabar.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b129-11\">Further, Frishman asked the defendant to let him know when the check got deposited, so that Frishman could ask his co-investors for reimbursement</p>\n<p id=\"b129-12\">On August 12,1999, Frishman sent an e-mail to Simon, Edward, Gross, Xiao, and Deng informing them of the proposed assignment from the defendant\u2019s NM HI position. Frishman indicated in the e-mail that the proposed assignment was not certain yet. He also advised that, \u201c[a]s an insider, however, we will have to hold the stock before we can sell it for 6 months from the IPO date.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b129-13\">The defendant replied to Frishman\u2019s August 11, 1999, e-mail on August 12, 1999, stating, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-14\">\u201c[T]hank you for your email. I will have the lawyer draft an assignment from my new media III position to you and your group, your share will be 75k over 200k and the rest as indicated in your email. As you know only accredited investors can invested [szc] in New Media II or HI. Have a great trip. I believe the lawyers should have the assignment drafted by-next week so I would go ahead and ask for the others to reimburse you next week and I will deposit your check then too.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b129-15\">On August 12, 1999, Frishman mailed a check to the defendant for $40,000; the check was deposited on August 30, 1999. In October of 1999, Frishman received reimbursements from Simon ($10,000), Nassberg ($5,000), Jack ($5,000), Xiao ($600), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>Wei ($1,000), and Deng ($1,000). Frishman\u2019s co-investors Xiao, Wei, and Deng remained unaccredited investors. Gross never sent Frishman any money for the proposed assignment; thus, his share was picked up by Frishman.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">At the time he sent his $40,000 check to the defendant, Frish-man expected to receive a document confirming the defendant\u2019s assignment of the iBasis shares to him and his co-investors. As of October 7, 1999, Frishman advised Edward that the iBasis opportunity \u201cis not yet fully resolved.\u201d What Frishman meant was that he had not yet received the necessary paperwork from the defendant. At the time, Frishman was concerned; he testified that \u201c[i]f it turned out to be a huge successful deal and [the defendant] decided it\u2019s too good a deal and changed his mind, [that he, Frishman] could have a problem.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Anz\">iBasis had its IPO on November 10, 1999. On November 11, 1999, Frishman sent the defendant an e-mail in which he stated, \u201cWhen you get a chance, can you please get us the [iBasis] paperwork.\u201d On November 13, 1999, the defendant responded to Frishman, stating, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-5\">\u201cThanks for your email . . . Lets <em>[sic] </em>keep thinking what we can each do to help iBasis make its numbers. New Media HI will be locked up for at least 6 months and IBAS (the name under which basis was traded on the NASDAQ National Market Systems) may well be a stock for the ages like ATT.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-6\">Thanks for the attached email since I was confused about which one you referred too <em>[sic] </em>on the phone. As indicated in the old email, I have only deposited your 40K and will leave you to deal with the others. They are only in new media because of you and I dont [ric] have time as this 430am email attests to deal with these small amounts</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b130-8\">d. <em>Frishman\u2019s involvement with Jenzabar. </em>In November, 1999, Frishman had a series of meetings with the defendant and Chai, which resulted in their offering him a position at Jenzabar as its senior vice president for operations. On January 31, 2000, Frish-man was discharged by Jenzabar on bad terms. During the brief time that Frishman was employed by Jenzabar, he saw the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>ant \u201cwhen he would come over to the Jenzabar office, frequently, on a daily basis.\u201d The defendant and Frishman never discussed the $40,000 that Frishman had given the defendant on behalf of himself and the other investors for the proposed assignment of the defendant\u2019s NM HI position.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">On May 15, 2000, Frishman filed an action against Jenzabar, Chai, the defendant, and NM II asserting claims arising out of his employment with Jenzabar (Jenzabar litigation). About two months after attempted mediation of the Jenzabar litigation, the defendant\u2019s attorney, on April 11, 2002, enclosed a check for $40,000 from the defendant representing a return of the money given by Frishman to the defendant for the proposed assignment of the defendant\u2019s NM III position. By letter dated May 3, 2002, Frish-man advised the defendant\u2019s attorney that he would credit the $40,000 check against the damages owed to him by reason of the defendant\u2019s breach of his contract to sell the iBasis shares, but not in full satisfaction of the amount owed.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">The Jenzabar litigation was ultimately resolved by a release and settlement agreement (Jenzabar settlement agreement) dated October 31, 2002. While the Jenzabar settlement agreement preserved Frishman\u2019s right to pursue claims relating to the proposed investment in iBasis, it specifically stated that it was intended to resolve \u201call matters relating to the [Jenzabar] litigation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">e. <em>Distribution of the iBasis shares. </em>On March 7, 2000, Frish-man heard from Farkas that iBasis was contemplating a secondary offering in which ten percent of all the iBasis common stock owned by the members of NM HI would be sold, including ten percent of the Frishman group\u2019s interest. Frishman informed his co-investors about that. The iBasis shares were sold in the secondary offering around March 15, 2000. On March 21, 2000, when the prices of the stock had risen to above $90 per share, Frish-man sent an e-mail to the defendant, inquiring as to when he could expect to receive his shares. The defendant never responded to that e-mail.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">As NM III purchased the iBasis shares on July 12, 1999, the defendant and other NM III members could sell their shares one year later, upon the expiration of the lock-up period, on July 12, 2000. When the lock-up expired, NM III distributed 77,816 iBasis shares to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>The defendant held all of the iBasis C shares distributed to him until January 14, 2005. On that day, he sold 44,000 shares at $1.871 per share, pursuant to a stop loss order of $2.00 per share implemented on September 29, 2004. Overall, the defendant lost $2.50 per share, since he had paid $4.37 per share for his interest through NM III.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">The plaintiffs claim that had the defendant delivered to the plaintiffs the balance of their 9,193 iBasis shares on July 12, 2000, the plaintiffs would have received stock worth an additional $320,901.73.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>Our analysis proceeds under familiar summary judgment principles. See <em>Kourouvacilis </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., </em>410 Mass. 706, 711 (1991). As we have noted, the relevant facts here are essentially undisputed; thus, we review the record to determine if either party is entitled to judgment as matter of law. <em>Nelson </em>v. <em>Salem State College, </em>446 Mass. 525, 530 (2006). See <em>Buchanan </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>65 Mass. App. Ct. 244, 247 n.5 (2005) (\u201cBecause the interpretation of the terms of a contract or agreement is a pure question of law, we exercise de novo review over this issue\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">We focus first on the breach of contract claim alleged by the plaintiffs in count one, and the defendant\u2019s contentions that the claim must fail because there was no contract, and that, as a result of Frishman\u2019s inclusion of unaccredited investors in his group, enforcement of the alleged contract would violate the public policy underlying Federal securities laws and regulations. We then address the defendant\u2019s appeal of the dismissal of counts one and two of his counterclaims.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">a. <em>Existence of a contract between the parties. </em>As did the judge, we begin our analysis with the basic issue of whether there was a contract formed between the defendant and the plaintiffs concerning the sale/transfer of the iBasis shares.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-9\">\u201cIt is axiomatic that to create an enforceable contract, there must be agreement between the parties on the material terms of that contract, and the parties must have a present intention to be bound by that agreement.\u201d <em>Situation Mgmt. Sys., Inc. </em>v. <em>Malouf, Inc., </em>430 Mass. 875, 878 (2000). However, not every last term need be specified. We recognize that an agreement may be enforceable that anticipates a more formal writing, but in such a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>case, the parties must have agreed upon either the material terms, or upon the \u201cformulae and procedures\u201d that will provide the material terms at some future date. See <em>Lafayette Place Assocs. </em>v. <em>Boston Redev. Authy., 427 </em>Mass. 509, 518 (1998) (purchase option provision constituted a binding preliminary agreement because the parties specified an arbitration mechanism to resolve open term questions). See also <em>Situation Mgmt. Sys., Inc. </em>v. <em>Malouf, Inc., supra </em>at 878-879 (oral agreement to extend agency relationship was a binding preliminary agreement where the parties had signed three previous contracts with substantially the same terms); <em>Goren </em>v. <em>Royal Invs. Inc., </em>25 Mass. App. Ct. 137, 139 (1987) (preliminary agreement for purchase and sale of premises was binding contract where transaction was not \u201cparticularly complex\u201d and parties agreed upon all material terms and where the unexecuted purchase and sale agreement was a mere \u201cformality\u201d containing \u201cministerial and nonessential terms of the bargain\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">In the present case, both the defendant and Frishman expected a final written agreement, memorializing the terms of the iBasis shares\u2019 assignment, as evident by the defendant\u2019s August 12, 1999, e-mail. Despite the parties\u2019 numerous conversations pertaining to the execution of the written agreement, no document ever materialized. However, various communications that took place \u2014 both oral and written \u2014 signified the parties\u2019 intentions, as well as the specifics of the assignment. See <em>Situation Mgmt. Sys., Inc. </em>v. <em>Malouf Inc., </em>430 Mass. at 878-879; <em>Lafayette Place Assocs. </em>v. <em>Boston Redev. Authy., </em>427 Mass. at 521.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">For the defendant to be contractually obligated to the plaintiffs, the following essential elements must be present: the quantity of iBasis shares, the amount to be paid for the shares, and the time at which the shares would be delivered to the plaintiffs. See <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>Tobin, </em>429 Mass. 84, 86 (1999). Here, we have all of the elements demonstrating the existence of a contract between the parties. First, as the judge properly concluded, the amount of $40,000, together with the amount that the defendant paid for the shares ($4.37), provides that there were 9,153.32 shares representing Frishman\u2019s and his co-investors\u2019 interests.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Therefore, two key elements \u2014 the number of shares and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>price per share, are present. Furthermore, the timing of the transfer of shares to Frishman can be inferred from the surrounding circumstances and the parties\u2019 pertinent communications. As NM III purchased the iBasis shares on July 12, 1999, the defendant and other NM IU members could sell their shares one year later, upon the expiration of the lock-up period, on July 12, 2000. Thus, the defendant was obligated to transfer the shares to Frishman on July 12, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">Because the three key elements \u2014 signifying parties\u2019 agreement to the material terms \u2014 are present here, we hold that a contract concerning the transfer of the iBasis shares existed between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">b. <em>Enforceability of the iBasis contract. </em>The defendant next argues that enforcement of the iBasis contract is against public policy as it violates the policy underlying the Securities Act of 1933 (Act) and regulation D, issued pursuant to the Act. We first examine whether regulation D is applicable and if so, whether the parties\u2019 contract violates it.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">The Act prohibits sales of securities unless such sales are in compliance with registration requirements of the Act. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77e (2009). Hazen, Treatise on the Law of Securities Regulation, \u00a7 2.2 (6th ed. 2009). The purpose of the Act is to protect unsophisticated investors by providing full disclosure of information necessary to make knowledgeable investment decisions.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Pinter </em>v. <em>Dahl, </em>486 U.S. 622, 637 n.13 (1988). <em>Geiger </em>v. <em>Securities &amp; Exch. Commn., </em>363 F.3d 481, 484 (2004). The Act generally prohibits the sale of unregistered securities. One exception is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>for the sale of stock in nonpublic offerings, the requirements for which are contained in regulation D, 17 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 230.501-506. See Hazen, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 4.20. Central to regulation D is the \u201caccredited investor.\u201d Rule 230.501(a) of regulation D defines the term to mean any person who comes within, or whom the issuer reasonably believes comes within, any of the eight categories of investors at the time of sale. 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 230.501(a)(l)-(8). These categories define \u201ctypes of purchasers that, based on objective criteria indicating financial sophistication and ability to fend for themselves, do not require the protections of registration under the federal securities laws.\u201d 2001 W.L. 34681692 (S.E.C. Release No. 33-8041) (December 19, 2001). Generally, \u201caccredited\u201d investors include \u201cwealthy and/or financially sophisticated investors such as banks, insurance companies, tax-exempt organizations, directors and executive officers of the issuer, and natural persons who have considerable net worth or large annual incomes.\u201d Hazen, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 4.20[2][A].</p>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">It is undisputed that in issuing its unregistered securities, which were subsequently converted into iBasis common stock, iBasis relied on 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 230.506, applicable to private offerings. Furthermore, both parties agree that for purposes of the iBasis shares\u2019 issuance, all investors had to be \u201caccredited,\u201d 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 230.501(a)(8), and that Xiao, Deng, and Wei were not accredited investors.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> However, the plaintiffs dispute application of regulation D to their transaction. They argue that regulation D is inapplicable to the parties\u2019 contract as it only pertains to the issuer of securities, here iBasis. As the defendant is not the issuer but rather a \u201creseller\u201d of the iBasis shares, the plaintiffs maintain that regulation D does not apply.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b136-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>Instead, the plaintiffs contend that \u00a7 230.144 of Title 17 of the Code of Federal Regulations applies to the transaction. Section 230.144 pertains to resales of securities issued pursuant to regulation D. 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 230.144 (2007). It presents a \u201csafe harbor for persons selling securities that have been acquired in a private placement or pursuant to a Regulation D exemption.\u201d Hazen, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 4.27 at 15-16. See Hazen, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 4.29 at 27. The re-sale under \u00a7 230.144 is permitted to unaccredited, as well as to accredited investors.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 230.144.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">With regard to the plaintiffs\u2019 arguments, we agree with the judge that their position overlooks a significant principle of securities laws and regulations, which is that the registration requirements under the Act are designed not only to protect immediate recipients of the securities but also the subsequent purchasers. See <em>Securities &amp; Exch. Commn. </em>v. <em>Harwyn Indus. Corp., </em>326 F. Supp. 943, 953 (S.D.N.Y. 1971). The Act \u201cmust be construed not technically and restrictively, but flexibly to effectuate [its] remedial purposeQ.\u201d <em>Securities &amp; Exch. Commn. </em>v. <em>Brigadoon Scotch Distributors, Ltd., </em>388 F. Supp. 1288, 1290 (S.D. N.Y. 1975), quoting from <em>Securities &amp; Exch. Commn. </em>v. <em>Capital Gains Research Bureau, Inc., </em>375 U.S. 180, 195 (1963). The \u201cremedial purpose\u201d and the over-all policy here is the protection of unaccredited investors; the plaintiffs\u2019 arguments ignore this principle, essentially subverting the requirements of the Act and its exemptions. See <em>In re Integrated Resources Real Estate Ltd. Partnerships Security Litigation, </em>815 F. Supp. 620, 628 (S.D.N.Y. 1993) (purpose of \u201caccredited\u201d investor requirement is to preclude inexperienced purchasers and those unable to afford professional advice from participating in regulation D offerings). As the judge observed, \u201cFrishman \u2014\u2022 and Maginn, as well \u2014 should not be able so facilely to avoid the protection of Regulation D by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>simple artifice of having iBasis issue the shares to NM III, in which Maginn had an interest, and then permit Maginn to transfer or assign his interest in those very same shares to Frishman, who was known to be acting on behalf of some unaccredited investors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">Additionally, the plaintiffs\u2019 characterization of the transaction as governed by \u00a7 230.144 is unavailing. Basically, the plaintiffs claim a contractual right of the investing group \u2014 containing unaccredited investors \u2014 to receive unregistered iBasis shares upon the conclusion of the lock-up period. As the judge properly determined, however, this would in effect be an impermissible \u201cloophole\u201d which would gut the requirements of the Act and its exemptions.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Indeed, one commentator has observed, \u201cAs is the case with any safe harbor rule, [\u00a7 230.144] will not protect a transaction that ... is part of a scheme to evade the 1933 Act\u2019s registration requirements.\u201d Hazen, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 4.29 at 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">In sum, we hold that regulation D is applicable to the parties\u2019 transaction. Furthermore, the parties\u2019 contract \u2014 by putting unregistered securities issued pursuant to regulation D in the hands of unaccredited investors \u2014 violates regulation D and thereby implicates the policy behind the Act and its exemptions. Consequently, we next turn to the issue of the contract\u2019s enforceability in light of public policy.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">\u201c[I]t is a principle universally accepted that the public interest in freedom of contract is sometimes outweighed by public policy, and in such cases the contract will not be enforced.\u201d <em>Beacon Hill Civic Assn. </em>v. <em>Ristorante Toscano, Inc., </em>422 Mass. 318, 321 (1996). In such context, \u201cpublic policy\u201d is understood to refer to the \u201ccourt\u2019s conviction, grounded in legislation and precedent, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>denying enforcement of a contractual term is necessary to protect some aspect of the public welfare.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">Courts will not go out of their way to discover an illegality in a contract, see <em>id. </em>at 320, and they proceed with great caution when determining whether the contract must be voided due to the public policy issues. <em>Starr </em>v. <em>J. Abrams Constr. Co., </em>16 Mass. App. Ct. 74, 81 (1983). However, it is well established that a contract violating public policy will not be enforced. <em>A.Z. </em>v. <em>B.Z., </em>431 Mass. 150, 160 (2000). See <em>Beacon Hill Civic Assn. </em>v. <em>Ristorante Toscano, Inc., supra </em>at 320-321.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">The factors examined by the courts when determining whether a contract violating public policy should be enforced are the following: \u201cthe nature of the subject matter of the contract; what was the extent of the illegal behavior; was that behavior a material or only an incidental part of the performance of the contract . . . ; what was the strength of the public policy underlying the prohibition; how far would effectuation of the policy be defeated by denial of an added sanction; how serious or deserved would be the forfeiture suffered by the plaintiff, how gross or undeserved the defendant\u2019s windfall.\u201d <em>Town Planning &amp; Engr. Assocs. </em>v. <em>Amesbury Specialty Co., </em>369 Mass. at 745-746 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">As we articulated earlier, one of the main purposes of the Act and its exemptions is the protection of unsophisticated investors in nonpublic offerings, precisely such as Deng, Xiao, and Wei<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> here. Moreover, as the judge found, \u201cFrishman did not possess any knowledge at all that would enable him to provide his unaccredited investors the \u2018professional advice regarding the merits and risks of purchasing the offered securities\u2019 called for in <em>[In re] Integrated [Resources] Real Estate Ltd. Partnership Security Litigation, . . . </em>815 F. Supp. at 628.\u2019 \u201d Enforcement of the parties\u2019 contract would therefore violate the fundamental safeguards of the securities laws. Examining the \u201cvector of considerations\u201d outlined above, see <em>Town Planning &amp; Engr. Assocs. </em>v. <em>Amesbury Specialty Corp., </em>369 Mass. at 746, we are of the opinion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>that the illegality here was not incidental or minor; rather, it \u201cpermeate[d] the parties\u2019 transaction.\u201d <em>Yankee Microwave, Inc. </em>v. <em>Petricca Communications Sys., Inc., </em>53 Mass. App. Ct. 497, 509 (2002), quoting from <em>Tocci </em>v. <em>Lembo, </em>325 Mass. 707, 710 (1950). Furthermore, the public policy considerations are not outweighed by the plaintiffs\u2019 loss or the defendant\u2019s windfall. The full $40,000 was returned to Frishman by the defendant. There was no windfall to the defendant, as he sold his iBasis shares at a total loss of approximately $110,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">Contrary to the plaintiffs\u2019 assertion, the contract cannot be enforced solely as to the plaintiffs. The entire agreement that the plaintiffs seek to enforce contravenes regulation D and the overall public policy behind that regulation. Specifically, and as the defendant properly notes, Frishman\u2019s group of investors qualifies as an \u201caccredited\u201d investor only where <em>all </em>equity owners are accredited investors. See 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 230.501(8) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">Finally, the plaintiffs contend that the defendant should be estopped from asserting that the iBasis contract violates public policy. See <em>Daynard </em>v. <em>Ness, Motley, Loadholt, Richardson &amp; Poole, P.A., </em>188 F. Supp. 2d 115, 129 n.9 (D. Mass. 2002) (listing factors for finding estoppel).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> We disagree. While it is true that the defendant was involved in an illegal contract, he warned Frishman that unaccredited investors could not participate, but Frishman proceeded with the investment nonetheless. Additionally, there is no evidence that the defendant induced participation of the unaccredited investors and caused, in any way, Frish-man\u2019s reliance thereon. Finally, there was no detriment, as the full amount of $40,000 was returned to Frishman. Thus, we find the estoppel argument to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">In sum, we uphold the judge\u2019s determination that the parties\u2019 contract concerning the transfer of the iBasis shares to Frish-man\u2019s group, which included unaccredited investors Xiao, Wei, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>and Deng, contravenes the principles behind the Act and regulation D. As the contract violates public policy, we conclude that it is void and unenforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">c. <em>The defendant\u2019s counterclaims. </em>The defendant appeals the judge\u2019s dismissal of counts one and two of his counterclaims. Count one \u2014 fraud in the inducement \u2014 was properly dismissed by the judge based on his determination (and our agreement with his holding) that the parties\u2019 contract was unenforceable on the public policy grounds. See <em>Powers </em>v. <em>Boston Cooper Corp., </em>926 F.2d 109, 111 (1st Cir. 1991) (complaint that releasee defrauded releasor into signing release failed to state an actionable claim where release pertained to agreement that was, in any event, unenforceable); <em>Catex Vitol Gas, Inc. </em>v. <em>Wolfe, </em>178 F.3d 572, 579 (1st Cir. 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">Count two of the defendant\u2019s counterclaims provides that Frishman breached the parties\u2019 settlement agreement pertaining to the Jenzabar litigation by bringing G. L. c. 93A claims \u2014 which were allegedly released in the Jenzabar settlement agreement \u2014 in this litigation. While the Jenzabar settlement agreement released all claims pertaining to the Jenzabar litigation, it had an important carve-out regarding Frishman\u2019s potential claims with respect to the \u00bfBasis deal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-7\">\u201cFrishman does not release, waive or discharge, in whole or part, any demands, claims, actions, causes of action, suits, liens, controversies, proceedings, debts and liabilities, of every name, nature and description (including without limitation those in law, equity, negligence, tort, breach of contract, fraud, misrepresentation, or violation of G. L. c. 93A or other statute) against Maginn <em>arising from or relating to the investment, or alleged, promised or intended investment by Frishman in the stock of IBasis Inc. and/or New Media III, LLC and/or Maginn\u2019s interest in IBasis Inc. and New Media III, LLC . . . </em>.\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">We disagree with the defendant\u2019s characterization of Frish-man\u2019s G. L. c. 93A claims as relating to the Jenzabar litigation. The essence of the Frishman\u2019s claim was that the defendant committed an unfair and deceptive act by wrongfully withholding the $40,000 paid to him by Frishman. Thus, the claim was clearly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>related to the iBasis contract and it was precisely the sort of claim that was specifically exempted from the Jenzabar settlement agreement. Accordingly, we determine that Frishman did not breach the Jenzabar settlement agreement by bringing the c. 93A claim in the current litigation.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b126-7\"> The relevant facts are undisputed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b126-8\"> At that time, Jenzabar was called CollegeNet, Inc.

The Act provides that securities must be registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission before any person may sell or offer to sell such securities. See 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77e; <em>Securities &amp; Exch Commn. </em>v. <em>Kern, </em>425 F.3d 143, 147 (2d Cir. 2005).

Indeed, the defendant returned $5,000 to Deng because she was an unaccredited investor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b135-12\"> In their argument, the plaintiffs mainly rely on the preliminary notes to regulation D, which provide that \u201cRegulation D is available only to the issuer of the securities and not to any affiliate of that issuer or to any other person for resales of the issuer\u2019s securities.\u201d 17 C.F.R. at 736. They also cite to <em>West Park Assocs. </em>v. <em>Butterfield Sav. &amp; Loan Assn., </em>60 F.3d 1452, 1457 (9th Cir. 1995), which merely quotes preliminary note 4 in support of the plaintiff\u2019s argument; however, that court did not examine or decide the issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b136-5\"> In support of his argument, Frishman further points to a memorandum that makes references to \u00a7 230.144.

With regard to the plaintiffs\u2019 \u00a7 230.144 argument, the defendant responds that the plaintiffs should not be allowed to avoid regulation D by the clever maneuvering of having iBasis issue the shares to NM III (in which the defendant had interest), and then have the defendant transfer the shares to Frishman.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b137-8\"> In arguing that the judge\u2019s determination of the \u201cimpermissible loophole\u201d is incorrect, the plaintiffs properly note that <em>Securities &amp; Exch. Commn. </em>v. <em>Harwyn Indus. Corp., </em>326 F. Supp. at 953, cited by the judge, does not involve a similar factual scenario. However, the analogy with that case is correct in that courts do not permit \u201cloopholes\u201d where investors are attempting to achieve an improper purpose by characterizing transactions at issue as something that they are not. <em>Id. </em>at 945, 953.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b137-9\"> As we decided that the parties\u2019 contract was in violation of regulation D, we rule as matter of law on the consequences.
