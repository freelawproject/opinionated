L. c. 119, \u00a7 26, as in effect prior to St. 2008, c. 176, \u00a7 84, and St. 2008, c. 215, \u00a7 64D.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The biological mother of Thomasina and Neil, and Thomasina\u2019s biological father, appeal from that adjudication, both claiming that the judge\u2019s ultimate findings are not supported by the evidence and that parental unfitness was not clearly and convincingly established.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The father additionally claims that the adjudication regarding visitation and placement do not adequately consider Thomasina\u2019s best interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">Following final adjudication in the underlying care and protection action, separate guardianship petitions were filed by Thoma-sina\u2019s and Neil\u2019s foster parents. The trial judge \u2014 who also had presided over the care and protection proceeding \u2014 allowed the guardianship petitions and appointed the foster parents permanent guardians of the children pursuant to G. L. c. 201, \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 5, as in effect prior to St. 2008, c. 521, \u00a7 21.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b586-8\">The department moved to dismiss the within appeal, arguing that, upon entry of a final judgment on the guardianship petition, the children were no longer in the department\u2019s care and custody and any appeal from the care and protection judgment was thus moot. For reasons we shall discuss, we do not agree that the appeal is moot. Proceeding to the merits, we affirm the adjudication placing the children in the department\u2019s permanent custody; we will remand for entry of orders as to visits with the children consistent with the judge\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-9\">1. <em>Procedural background. </em>As reflected on the dockets, in September, 2006, the department filed its petitions and thereafter, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>pursuant to G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 26, sought permanent custody of the children. The department is authorized under that statute to seek an adjudication \u201cthat the child is in need of care and protection. ... If the child is adjudged to be in need of care and protection, the court may commit the child to the custody of the department until he becomes 18 years of age or until, in the opinion of the department, the object of his commitment has been accomplished, whichever occurs first. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">It will be significant to the department\u2019s claim of mootness that, despite its notice of intent to do so, the department apparently did not, as authorized by G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 26(4), seek to \u201cdispense with parental consent to adoption, custody, guardianship or other disposition of the child.\u201d Because the department did not seek the dispensation of parental consent, the judge made no order in that regard, nor did she make findings addressing the standards set forth in G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 3, as would have been required for termination of parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">Following four days of evidentiary hearings that commenced in early October, 2007, and concluded in November, 2007, the department was awarded permanent custody of Thomasina, age eleven at the time of trial, and Neil, then seven years old. The judge\u2019s written findings and \u201cAdjudication, Commitment and Order\u201d issued on August 31, 2008, nunc pro tunc to January 3, 2008. The judge found that \u201cno professional believes that termination of parental rights is in the Children\u2019s best interests.\u201d The judge then determined that, in light of the foregoing, \u201cin addition to approving the goal of guardianship with the [foster parents] for both [Thomasina] and [Neil], the Court will order visitation at least four times a year, with pictures and letters to be exchanged in addition. Visits should be supervised for both parents unless the guardians deem unsupervised visits to be in the Children\u2019s best interests.\u201d Additional visits would be permitted at the discretion of the guardians and consistent with the children\u2019s best interests. The trial judge concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-7\">\u201c[N]either [m]other nor [father] are currently able to assume parental responsibility for the Children, or either of them; . . . [m] other and [father] are likely to remain unable to parent the Children for the indefinite future; . . . [and] the best interests of the Children are served by granting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>the Department permanent custody pursuant to G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 26, with the goal of placing them in the guardianship of the [foster parents].\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">The father and mother filed timely notices of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">As reflected in the supplemental appendix filed by the department, before the appeal entered on the docket of this court, the trial judge allowed petitions for guardianship under authority of G. L. c. 201, \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 5, and appointed the foster parents as permanent guardians of the children.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It was represented to us during oral argument that a trial had been conducted in connection with the guardianship petition and that the parents have appealed from the judgment. No appeal has been docketed in this court, and the matter is not before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">2. <em>Discussion, </em>(a) <em>Mootness. </em>We first address the department\u2019s motion seeking dismissal on the ground of mootness, which is premised on the department\u2019s argument that \u201callowance of the guardianship petition effectively superseded the care and protection judgment\u201d and that, as a consequence, it \u201cis no longer the custodian of the children, and with the appointment of permanent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>guardians they are no longer in need of care and protection.\u201d The department further argues that the within appeal will serve no purpose as \u201ceven a reversal of the final judgment\u201d in the care and protection action \u201ccannot alter the final judgment of the guardianship petition.\u201d The parents\u2019 sole recourse, according to the department, is to appeal from the entry of the guardianship decrees or to seek revocation of the guardianships.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">Our discussion is guided by the principle that \u201cwhere two or more statutes relate to the same subject matter, they should be construed together so as to constitute a harmonious whole consistent with the legislative purpose.\u201d <em>FMR Corp. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Rev., </em>441 Mass. 810, 819 (2004), quoting from <em>Board of Educ. </em>v. <em>Assessor of Worcester, </em>368 Mass. 511, 513-514 (1975). We begin by summarizing the statutory authority and obligations that repose in the department when a child has been committed to its care by a final adjudication under G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 26, and the residual rights that remain with parents whose rights have not been terminated under c. 119, \u00a7 26(4),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">Where a child has been adjudicated to be in need of care and protection under c. 119, \u00a7 26, but parental rights have not been terminated, as here, the child is committed to the department\u2019s custody \u201cuntil he becomes 18 years of age or until, in the opinion of the department, the object of his commitment has been accomplished.\u201d The object of the child\u2019s commitment, and the department\u2019s obligation while the child is committed to its care, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>is to keep the child safe from \u201cserious risk of peril from abuse, neglect, or other activity harmful to the child,\u201d at the hands of a parent or guardian.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Care &amp; Protection of Bruce, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 758, 761 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">As defined in G. L. c. 119, \u00a7\u00a7 21 and 23(a)(3), as appearing in St. 2008, c. 176, \u00a7 83,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> custody of a child gives to the department certain powers, including the power to \u201cdetermine the child\u2019s place of abode, medical care and education.\u201d The department is generally charged with placing children in its care or custody \u201cin private families\u201d unless the child\u2019s best interests require placement in a public or private institution for \u201cspecial care, treatment or education of children.\u201d G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 32, as appearing in St. 1954, c. 397, \u00a7 4. It is responsible for ongoing visitation between parent and child. G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 35. The department also plays a role in both grandparent and sibling visitation. See G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 26B, inserted by St. 2008, c. 176, \u00a7 84.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">Chapter 119, \u00a7 26, as in effect prior to St. 2008, c. 176, \u00a7 84, and St. 2008, c. 215, \u00a7 64D,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> gives to the Juvenile Court broad authority to make appropriate orders for the care of the child. In addition to committing the child to the department\u2019s permanent custody, the court also may make \u201cany other appropriate order with reference to the care and custody of the child as may be in his best interest including, but not limited to, any one or more of the following:\u201d-\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-7\">\u201c(1) It may permit the child to remain with his parents, guardian, or other custodian, subject to conditions and limitations which the court may prescribe including supervision as directed by the court for the care and protection of the child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AWn\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>\u201c(2) It may, subject to such conditions and limitations as it may prescribe, transfer temporary legal custody to any of the following: \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-4\">\u201c(i) any individual who, after study by a probation officer or other person or agency designated by the court, is found by the court to be qualified to give care to the child;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-5\">\u201c(\u00fc) any agency, or other private organization licensed or otherwise authorized by law to receive and provide care for the child;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-6\">\u201c(iii) the department of [children and families].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-7\">\u201c(3) It may order appropriate physical care including medical or dental care.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b591-8\">As noted earlier, the court may also \u2014 but did not do so here \u2014 \u201center an order to dispense with the need for consent... to the adoption, custody, guardianship or other disposition of the child . . . , upon a finding that the child is need of care and protection pursuant to [c. 119, \u00a7 26,] and that the best interests of the child[, as defined by c. 210, \u00a7 3,] will be served by such an order.\u201d See note 7, <em>supra. </em>This same provision goes on to state that the department need not seek to \u201cdispense with parental consent to the adoption, custody, guardianship or other disposition of the child if the child is being cared for by a relative or ... [if there exists a compelling reason that such action] would not be in the best interests of the child.\u201d G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 26(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-9\">After a child is placed in the department\u2019s \u201cpermanent\" custody under c. 119, \u00a7 26, parents retain a number of residual rights. \u201c \u2018Unless the [parents\u2019] legal relation to [their] children is terminated, [they] would be entitled to receive notice of all proceedings affecting the welfare of the children, to petition every six months \u2018for review and redetermination\u2019 of their current needs, and to participate in an annual permanency planning hearing. G. L. c. 119, \u00a7\u00a7 26, 29B.\u2019 <em>Adoption of Willow, </em>433 Mass. 636, 647 n.11 (2001).\u201d <em>Adoption of Gillian, </em>63 Mass. App. Ct. 398, 403 n.5 (2005). Compare <em>Adoption of Helen, </em>429 Mass. 856, 861 (1999) (\u201c[G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 3,] explicitly states that \u2018any person against whom a decree to dispense with consent to adoption has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>been entered . . . shall not have such right of petition for review and redetermination\u2019 \u201d). In addition to these rights, a parent has the right to visit the child; the right to legal representation at each stage of the proceedings, see G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 29, as appearing in St. 2008, c. 176, \u00a7 85<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>; <em>Care &amp; Protection of Stephen, </em>401 Mass. 144, 148-149 (1987), and the right to receive services from the department. See Ireland, Juvenile Law \u00a7 3.6, at 45-47 (2006 &amp; Supp. 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">Significant among the residual rights is the right to seek periodic review and redetermination of the child\u2019s commitment every six months. \u201cA review and redetermination proceeding is a readjudication of the custody order under G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 26[, wherein] . . . the judge is deciding . . . whether to maintain the separation of parent from child.\u201d <em>Care &amp; Protection of Erin, </em>443 Mass. 567, 571 (2005). \u201cThis provision is, \u2018primarily, the means by which a parent or other interested party, including the department, may bring to a judge\u2019s attention a change in the situation of a child, or of a child\u2019s parent, which might warrant reconsideration or modification of the original order adjudicating the child in need of care and protection.\u2019 \u201d <em>Adoption of Helen, </em>429 Mass. at 861, quoting from <em>Care &amp; Protection of Isaac, </em>419 Mass. 602, 611-612 (1995). The parent has the burden to go forward with credible evidence of such a change, but \u201cthe department bears the ultimate burden to prove that the child is still in need of care and protection.\u201d <em>Care &amp; Protection of Erin, supra </em>at 572. It does so by establishing that the parent is still unfit and that it remains in the child\u2019s best interests to be removed from the parent\u2019s custody. \u201c[T]he department must meet this burden by clear and convincing evidence.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">Only if parental rights are terminated does a parent lose the right to seek review and redetermination. In comparison, the guardianship statute, G. L. c. 190B, \u00a7 5-212, inserted by St. 2008, c. 521, \u00a7 9, appears to place on the petitioner seeking revocation of the guardianship the burden of proving that revoca<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>tion \u201cwould be in the best interest of the [child].\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Nor is there a specific statute that provides for appointment of counsel, unless the department is a party to the proceedings. G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 29.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> See note 12, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">Were we to accept the department\u2019s argument that the care and custody of a child is no longer governed by G. L. c. 119, but is superseded by a subsequent guardianship adjudication, then all of a parent\u2019s residual rights under c. 119 disappear upon appointment of a permanent guardian. This view is inconsistent with the statutory scheme governing care and protection of children who have been committed to the department\u2019s care, but whose parents\u2019 rights have not been terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">We expressed similar views in <em>Adoption of Gillian, </em>63 Mass. App. Ct. 398, 399 (2005). In that case, it was not the department but the parents who argued that entry of a permanent guardianship under separate petition resolved the pending care and protection proceeding as to their daughter. The department had filed care and protection petitions regarding the parties\u2019 three children and sought to terminate parental rights for two of the children. Temporary custody of them was awarded to the department, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>the case had not been finally adjudicated when Gillian\u2019s paternal aunt filed a guardianship petition pursuant to G. L. c. 201, \u00a7 1. The court awarded temporary custody to the aunt \u201cunder the supervision of the department.\u201d <em>Adoption of Gillian, </em>63 Mass. App. Ct. at 401. Following a joint trial on the care and protection petitions and the guardianship petition, the judge appointed the aunt permanent guardian of Gillian. It was, however, \u201cunclear whether there was a final judgment as to custody in the care and protection case at that point.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>In subsequently issued written findings and conclusions of law, the judge found the parents unfit, terminated their parental rights with respect to Gillian (and, at a later point, also with respect to one sibling), and committed Gillian to the custody of the department.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">Gillian\u2019s parents argued that the appointment of a permanent guardian for Gillian \u201cbrought the care and protection petition to conclusion,\u201d and \u201crendered the care and protection issues moot.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 405. The parents argued in that case that the department was required to re-institute a care and protection proceeding in order to regain jurisdiction over Gillian.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">Addressing in that case whether the department was required to refile a care and protection petition \u2014\u25a0 and concluding that it was not \u2022\u2014 we discussed the statutory scheme, and our observations on that score are relevant to the case at hand. We rejected the parents\u2019 claim \u201cthat the judge\u2019s appointment of a permanent guardianship under a separate petition was, in effect, a resolution of the care and protection petition. The appointment of the aunt ... as Gillian\u2019s permanent guardian was the final judgment relative to the guardianship petition. However, that action did not dictate that the care and protection case be dismissed.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The care and protection petition in <em>Gillian </em>had not been finally resolved when the aunt was appointed permanent guardian. We noted that the statutory framework \u201cpermits the judge to issue more than one dispositional order, in addition to or instead of granting custody to the department, including allowing the child to remain in the custody of the guardian and terminating parental rights.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>\u201c[Termination need not be a prerequisite to a permanency plan.\u201d <em>Ibid., </em>quoting from <em>Adoption of Nancy, </em>443 Mass. 512, 518 (2005).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b595-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>A guardian for a child committed to the department\u2019s care may be appointed in conjunction with the department\u2019s permanency plan on behalf of the child. That process is governed by G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 29B, as amended by St. 2008, c. 176, \u00a7 86, which provides for, among other options, referral of a child \u201cfor legal guardianship.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> When parental rights are terminated and a guardianship ensues, all legal relations between the parent and child end. <em>Adoption of Nancy, </em>443 Mass. at 515. <em>Adoption of Gillian, </em>63 Mass. App. Ct. at 404. See G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 26(4).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> In the context of a care and protection case that does not result in the termination of parental rights, even if the plan is for a guardianship, the parents retain residual rights as set forth above. Cf. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number><em>Adoption of Nancy, supra </em>at 516.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Therefore, the appointment of the foster parents as guardians for the children does not remove the matter from the purview of c. 119 in this case. The appeal is not moot, and we deny the department\u2019s motion to dismiss it.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">(b) <em>Parental unfitness. </em>We turn now to the parents\u2019 claim that the judge\u2019s findings as to unfitness are not supported by clear and convincing evidence. No claim is made that any subsidiary finding is without a basis in the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">The parents met in 1995 at a treatment center. Thomasina was born a year later, in October of 1996, after which the couple and Thomasina lived with the father\u2019s parents for two years, and then lived in their own apartment for a period before separating. In 2000, the mother married Neil\u2019s father, who is now deceased. Prior to, and during, trial, the children had been placed with the same foster parents \u201call three times they ha[d] been in foster care.\u201d When the children first came into foster care in 2001, \u201c[Thomasina] tended to act like a mother to [Neil], although [the foster mother], by her own clear parenting of [Neil], was able to get [Thomasina] to give up that role over a six-month period.\u201d The children were returned to the mother; in 2003, when they were again placed in foster care, Neil was \u201cwild and out-of-control\u201d and \u201c[Thomasina] was once again acting as his mother, attempting to direct and nurture him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">The judge found that the mother failed to monitor the children,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> to seek prompt medical attention for the children\u2019s injuries, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>to address Neil\u2019s special needs, and to act appropriately with the social worker and the children during visitation.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Despite receiving substantial in-home support from the department, the mother failed to acquire and learn basic skills required for proper parenting. The mother\u2019s inability to supervise and provide appropriate parenting for the children resulted in serious physical injuries to Neil (as recently as one year prior to trial), as well as injuries to Thomasina.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\">Both the mother and the father have a history of substance abuse. The father had difficulty finding work that fit in with his drug treatment schedule; his life was unstable, and he failed to attend parenting classes. He has an adult criminal record<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> and was the subject of numerous restraining orders requested by the mother as well as by his own parents, in 1993, 1994, 1995, 2000, 2001, 2004, and most recently in 2005. The father has never acted as Thomasina\u2019s caretaker, and his mother \u201cacknowledge[d] that he would not be able to care for Thomasina by himself.\u201d The father sought to regain custody only of Thomasina, but his lack of parenting skills rendered him unfit to provide appropriate parenting for her.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">At the time of trial, Neil and Thomasina were doing well with the foster parents, though Neil \u201cstill require[d] constant supervision when he [was] not sleeping.\u201d The judge found that \u201cit is not in either [Thomasina\u2019s] or [Neil\u2019s] best interest to be separated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>for placement.\u201d See <em>Care &amp; Protection of Three Minors, </em>392 Mass. 704, 715 (1984) (\u201c[t]he courts of this Commonwealth have recognized the importance of siblings being raised together\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">The judge\u2019s findings regarding both parents\u2019 current failings have ample support in the record and are not clearly erroneous. See <em>Custody of Eleanor, </em>414 Mass. 795, 799 (1993). Together, the findings clearly and convincingly establish parental unfitness. See, e.g., <em>Adoption of Mary, </em>414 Mass. 705, 710-711 (1993); <em>Adoption of Quentin, </em>424 Mass. 882, 886 (1997). \u201cParental unfitness . . . means more than ineptitude, handicap, character flaw, conviction of a crime, unusual life style, or inability to do as good a job as the child\u2019s foster parent. Rather, the idea of \u2018parental unfitness\u2019 means \u2018grievous shortcomings or handicaps\u2019 that put the child\u2019s welfare \u2018much at hazard.\u2019 \u201d <em>Care &amp; Protection of Amalie, </em>69 Mass. App. Ct. 813, 817 (2007), quoting from <em>Adoption of Katharine, </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 25, 28 (1997). \u201cThe specialized needs of a particular child when combined with the deficiencies of a parent\u2019s character, temperament, capacity, or conduct may clearly establish parental unfitness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 818, quoting from <em>Petitions of the Dept. of Social Servs. to Dispense with Consent to Adoption, </em>18 Mass. App. Ct. 120, 125 (1984). In addition, \u201c[t]o the extent it bears on fitness, . . . evidence of prior convictions may properly be weighed in the balance.\u201d <em>Care &amp; Protection of Frank, </em>409 Mass. 492, 495 (1991). A parent\u2019s failure to participate in services offered or recommended by the department may properly be considered, along with other evidence such as lack of parenting skills, as probative of current parental unfitness. See <em>Custody of a Minor (No. </em>1), 377 Mass. 876, 883 (1979); <em>Care &amp; Protection of Inga, </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. 660, 665, 667 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">(c) <em>Visitation. </em>\u201cThe same standard of clear and convincing evidence controls the decision to terminate a parent\u2019s visitation rights as it does the decisions concerning parental unfitness in both care and protection and adoption proceedings.\u201d <em>Care &amp; Protection of Ian, </em>46 Mass. App. Ct. 615, 620 (1999). \u201cWhen the department obtains custody of a child, it also has the power to control visits to the child. G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 21. That power is modified, however, by G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 35, as appearing in St. 1954, c. 646, \u00a7 1, which gives the parents the right to visit their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>children if \u2018the welfare of the child and the public interest will not be injured.\u2019 \u201d <em>Custody of a Minor (No. </em>2), 392 Mass. 719, 725-726 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">With respect to visitation, the judge found: \u201c[Thomasina] knows . . . her father; and termination of the bond would not be in her best interest.\u201d The judge then concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-6\">\u201c[T]he Court will order visitation at least four times a year, with pictures and letters to be exchanged in addition. Visits should be supervised for both parents unless the guardians deem unsupervised visits to be in the Children\u2019s best interests. Needless to say, additional contact would be permitted in the discretion of the guardians, based upon the Children\u2019s individual best interests.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">The father claims on appeal that the evidence at trial \u201coverwhelmingly proved\u201d that Thomasina enjoyed and benefited from her twice monthly unsupervised visits with him and paternal relatives, and that the judge\u2019s decision to reduce visits was not in her best interests. The judge\u2019s reducing the number of visits between the father and Thomasina to four times a year, but not terminating visits, and leaving any increased visitation to the discretion of the guardians, was consistent with Thomasina\u2019s best interests. The judge did not abuse her discretion in ordering a minimum of four visits a year.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">(d) <em>Thomasina\u2019s placement. </em>The father claims that the judge failed fully to consider whether Thomasina\u2019s best interests would be served by nominating either paternal relative as her guardian. Assuming that the judge was required to consider the father\u2019s plan to place Thomasina with his paternal relatives, the judge was in any event not required to give artificial weight to those nominations. See <em>Adoption of Hugo, </em>428 Mass. 219, 226 (1998), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Hugo P. </em>v. <em>George P., </em>526 U.S. 1034 (1999) (plan proposed by parent not entitled to any artificial weight in determining best interests of child). Nothing in the record suggests that the judge gave the department\u2019s plan for guardianship with the foster parents presumptive or artificial weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-9\">In rejecting the father\u2019s proposed placement of Thomasina with her paternal aunt or paternal grandmother, the judge considered the alternatives and provided specific reasons for decid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>ing that the father\u2019s proposed placement was not in Thomasina\u2019s best interests. See <em>Adoption of Hugo, supra </em>at 225-228. The child had been living with her foster parents for an extended period of time, was doing well, had bonded with them, and would be able to remain with her half-brother. By contrast, the father \u201cwanted [Thomasina] to live with him and his parents, but he would not be able to provide a home for Neil, so the Children would be separated.\u201d As with the proposed placement with the paternal grandmother, the father\u2019s suggested placement with the paternal aunt required that Thomasina and her brother be separated. The judge concluded that the \u201c[cjhildren must remain together and that they need stabihty and structure.\u201d The findings support placement of the children together with the foster parents. Cf. G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 23(c), inserted by St. 2008, c. 176, \u00a7 83 (\u201cThe department shall also seek to identify any minor sibling or half-sibling of the child and attempt to place these children in the same foster family if, in the judgment of the department, that placement would be in the best interests of the children\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>The decree committing the children to the permanent custody of the department is affirmed. We remand for entry of orders as to parental visits with the children consistent with the judge\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b586-10\"> Subsequent changes to the statute do not affect our analysis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b586-11\"> Our references to \u201cthe mother\u201d are to the biological mother of Thomasina and Neil.

The docket further reflects that, prior to appeal, no attorney entered an appearance on behalf of the parents in the guardianship proceeding. This appears to be consistent with the department\u2019s view, as expressed in 110 Code Mass.
