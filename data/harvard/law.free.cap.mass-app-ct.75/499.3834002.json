L. c. 265, \u00a7 22.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> His principal arguments on appeal concern <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>alleged violations of the \u201cfirst complaint\u201d rule. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, </em>445 Mass. 217, 241-248 (2005), cert. denied, 546 U.S. 1216 (2006). Because we conclude that it was prejudicial error for the judge to allow the Commonwealth to substitute a police officer as the Commonwealth\u2019s designated first complaint witness, when he was not the person to whom the complainant first reported that she was raped, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\"><em>Background. </em>At the defendant\u2019s 2006 trial, the Commonwealth adduced evidence that, eighteen years earlier, the defendant pushed the complainant into his car, took her to a motel where he violently raped her, and then drove her back to the place where he had abducted her.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendant contended that the complainant, who by her own admission was a \u201ccrack\u201d cocaine addict at the time, invented the claim of rape because she regretted having participated willingly in a sordid episode involving drugs and sex.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">In a pretrial motion in limine, the Commonwealth argued that even though the complainant\u2019s neighbor was the first individual to whom she reported that she had been raped, another witness \u2014 the investigating officer who responded when the neighbor called the police \u2014 should be substituted as the Commonwealth\u2019s designated first complaint witness. Before deciding the motion, the judge heard from both the neighbor and the officer on voir dire. The neighbor testified that, on the night of the incident, she heard the complainant pounding on her door. When she opened it, she found the complainant huddled on the ground outside. The complainant told the neighbor that she had been raped, and the neighbor called the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">The officer testified that he responded to the call and spoke with the complainant for ten minutes, obtaining, among other things, her description of the defendant, his car, and how she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>came to be with him. Over the defendant\u2019s objection, the judge allowed the officer to testify as the designated first complaint witness, on the ground that the officer had spoken with the complainant only a short time after she spoke with her neighbor, and had heard more details of the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">During the trial, the judge overruled another first complaint rule objection made by the defendant, allowing the nurse who examined the complainant at the hospital on the evening of the incident to read from her interview notes and recount the complainant\u2019s detailed description of the rape. The rationale for the judge\u2019s ruling was that the complainant\u2019s statements were admissible as spontaneous utterances.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>Substitution of first complaint witness. </em>It was error to allow the officer to be substituted as the Commonwealth\u2019s designated first complaint witness. In unusual circumstances, a judge has discretion to designate a substitute witness \u2014 e.g., where the first person to hear the complaint is \u201cunavailable, incompetent, or too young to testify meaningfully,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, supra </em>at 243-244; \u201cwhen the encounter that the victim has with the first person does not constitute a complaint,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Murungu, </em>450 Mass. 441, 446 (2008)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>; or when the first complaint witness has \u201can obvious bias or motive to minimize or distort the victim\u2019s remarks.\" <em>Ibid. </em>The judge may not, however, replace the first complaint witness with a law enforcement official simply because the latter is the one \u201cwith the most complete memory, the one to whom the complainant related the most details, or the one who is likely to be the most effective witness.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, supra </em>at 243.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">The testimony of the complainant\u2019s neighbor was that the complainant reported having been sexually assaulted. This testimony plainly qualified as first complaint, and there was no evidence to suggest the neighbor was incompetent or biased. Indeed, her testimony closely matched what the complainant remembered telling her. The Commonwealth was not entitled to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>substitute a more detailed subsequent complaint merely because it strengthened the Commonwealth\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">Because the defendant preserved his rights, we apply the prejudicial error standard. An error is nonprejudicial only \u201cif we are sure that the error did not influence the jury, or had but very slight effect.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Graham, </em>431 Mass. 282, 288, cert. denied, 531 U.S. 1020 (2000), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flebotte, </em>417 Mass. 348, 353 (1994). Here, the testimony of the officer was substantially more detailed than that of the proper first complaint witness and may have been accepted more readily by the jury because of his position. We therefore are unable to conclude that the error was nonprejudicial and must reverse the conviction on this basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">2. <em>Admission of \u201cspontaneous utterance\u201d testimony. </em>Because the issue may arise on retrial, we address the defendant\u2019s claim that the admission of the nurse\u2019s testimony also violated the first complaint doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">We assume, in view of the foundation that was laid and the judge\u2019s preliminary findings,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> that the statements to which the nurse testified qualified as spontaneous utterances. We also assume that their status as such trumped the general principle that \u201ca patient\u2019s statement of how alleged injuries were suffered, or by whom inflicted, generally is not admissible in the Commonwealth,\u201d see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Arana, </em>453 Mass. 214, 231 (2009). Nevertheless, further analysis was required before the testimony properly could be admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">Even before the adoption of the first complaint rule, when multiple complaint testimony was permitted, this court expressed strong reservations about the necessity and propriety of admitting both spontaneous utterances concerning a sexual assault and \u201cfresh complaint\u201d evidence. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>54 Mass. App. Ct. 756, 764-765 (2002). As the court in <em>Davis </em>explained, where a victim makes vociferous and immediate complaints about what happened to her, and those statements are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>admitted without limitation as spontaneous utterances, \u201cthe rationale for receiving additional fresh complaint evidence is hard to justify. It [is] cumulative of evidence already admitted substantively but which also servefs] the function of rebutting the supposed negative inference of a failure to make hue and cry.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 765. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, </em>445 Mass. at 241 (observing that corroborative evidence is less likely to be necessary in cases where victims have made spontaneous complaints). The court in <em>Davis </em>also recognized that the trial judge has discretion, under general principles pertaining to the receipt of cumulative evidence, to limit the amount of spontaneous utterance testimony where it may unduly prejudice the defendant. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Davis, supra </em>at 763-764. Nevertheless, in the circumstances presented, the <em>Davis </em>court concluded that the admission of multiple spontaneous utterance testimony was not an abuse of discretion, and that the additional admission of multiple fresh complaint testimony, while error, did not warrant a new trial, because \u201cthe admission of even a fulsome number of fresh complaints does not inexorably lead to reversible error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 765.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">In the aftermath of the adoption of the first complaint doctrine, however, greater caution must be exercised in admitting testimony of both first complaint and spontaneous utterances that are in the nature of a complaint. Although the Supreme Judicial Court has recognized in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Arana, supra </em>at 229, that evidence of multiple complaints may be admissible in appropriate circumstances under a rubric other than first complaint, the existence of a potential alternative evidentiary basis for the admission of repetitive extrajudicial complaint evidence does not guarantee its admissibility. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Monteiro, ante </em>489, 494-495 (2009). \u201c[A] second or subsequent complaint is not admissible simply because a separate evidentiary rule applies (e.g., the statement is not hearsay, or it falls within an exception to the hearsay rule). The evidence also must serve a separate function, and must be of sufficient importance to a fair understanding of the Commonwealth\u2019s case that its probative value outweighs the incremental prejudice to the defendant inherent in the receipt of multiple complaint evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 495.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">Under our law of evidence, spontaneous utterance testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>serves a separate function from first complaint testimony, in that it is admissible as substantive proof of the truth of the facts asserted, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Snell, </em>428 Mass. 766, <em>777, </em>cert. denied, 527 U.S. 1010 (1999), while first complaint testimony serves the limited purpose of establishing the circumstances in which the complainant first reported the alleged offense and assisting the jury in their assessment of the credibility and reliability of the complainant\u2019s trial testimony. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, </em>445 Mass. at 247-248. Nevertheless, the receipt of repetitive first complaint and spontaneous utterance evidence, no less than the receipt of repetitive fresh complaint testimony, has the potential to \u201cunfairly enhance a complainant\u2019s credibility as well as prejudice the defendant by repeating for the jury the often horrific details of an alleged crime.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 243. For that reason, if spontaneous utterance evidence in the nature of a report of a sexual assault is to be admitted in addition to first complaint, that evidence must be carefully evaluated for probity and prejudice as described above. Otherwise, the policies that animate the first complaint rule will not be effectuated.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">In short, should the defendant be retried, the admission of other complaint evidence beyond the designated first complaint testimony is to be considered under the standards explained in <em>Arana </em>and <em>Monteiro, </em>whether or not that evidence is otherwise admissible as a spontaneous utterance.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">3. <em>Other issues. </em>There is no merit to the defendant\u2019s claim that it would be unconstitutional to apply retroactively to his case the 1996 amendment to G. L. c. 277, \u00a7 63, as amended by St. 1996, c. 26, extending the statute of limitations for the crime of rape. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bargeron, </em>402 Mass. 589, 591-594 (1988). The extent to which his prior convictions may be admitted under G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 21, may be revisited at any retrial. We need not comment on the remaining issues raised by the defendant, as they are not likely to arise again in the same form.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b521-15\"> The defendant was acquitted on an additional count of aggravated rape. A charge of kidnapping was dismissed before trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b522-8\"> The defendant was indicted in November, 2003. The delay between the rape and the indictment was due to the improvements in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) analysis. At the time of the rape, it was not possible to perform DNA analysis on small amounts of biological evidence. Therefore, the evidence in this matter was frozen. With the advent of polymerase chain reaction amplification, in 2001 the Boston police department began reviewing older cases to try to retrieve DNA profiles. If a DNA profile could be retrieved, it was compared to a database of known profiles. This process resulted in the identification of the defendant in August, 2003.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b523-8\"> Although the complainant spoke to the officer before she spoke to the nurse, the Commonwealth offered her statements to the officer only as first complaint and not for substantive purposes as spontaneous utterances.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b523-9\"> We note that the trial in this matter occurred prior to the Supreme Judicial Court\u2019s decision in <em>Murungu.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b524-9\"> The complainant\u2019s examination by the nurse took place on the evening of the events in question. The nurse described the complainant as distraught, crying, and curled in a fetal position. The judge therefore determined that the complainant remained under the influence of the exciting event and that her statements were spontaneous reactions to it. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Santiago, </em>437 Mass. 620, 623-625 (2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
