(Prestige), had a banting relationship with South Shore Bank (SSB). Using Prestige\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>funds, Wajahat Malick, Prestige\u2019s comptroller, fraudulently procured treasurer\u2019s checks from SSB and used them to pay personal loans he had obtained from South Weymouth Savings Bank (South Weymouth). After the fraud was discovered and related litigation began, Prestige and Helmut and Renate Schmidt<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (collectively, Prestige) impleaded South Weymouth and asserted claims for mishandling the SSB checks. Ultimately, a judge of the Superior Court granted South Weymouth\u2019s motion for summary judgment and dismissed the Prestige claims. Prestige appeals, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\"><em>Background. </em>Viewing the record in the requisite fashion, see, e.g., <em>New Habitat, Inc. </em>v. <em>Tax Collector of Cambridge, </em>451 Mass. 729, 731 (2008), it appears that Prestige, a Weymouth automobile dealership, financed its purchase of new vehicles with \u201cfloor plan\u201d financing from SSB. Under the plan, SSB provided Prestige with a revolving line of credit, advancing funds to pay for, and taking a security interest in, each vehicle the dealership acquired. Prestige paid monthly interest until the vehicle was sold and then paid SSB the balance due.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">In 1987, Prestige hired Malick as its comptroller. Malick\u2019s duties included depositing checks at SSB pursuant to a depositary agreement that was part of the financing plan. On nine occasions between February and October of 1990, however, Malick exchanged Prestige checks intended as payment on SSB loans for SSB treasurer\u2019s checks made payable to South Weymouth, which had no banking relationship with Prestige. All the Prestige checks Malick used in the scheme were made payable to SSB, and all were properly cosigned by Prestige owner Helmut Schmidt. A \u201cremitter\u201d line on the face of each SSB treasurer\u2019s check stated that the check had been \u201cpurchased by\u201d Prestige. The nine checks totaled $432,895.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-7\">Malick presented the nine checks to South Weymouth with instructions to deposit them into his personal account, where the proceeds were used, at least in part, to repay loans he had obtained from South Weymouth. The instructions were part of a fraudulent scheme through which Malick, during a two-year spree lasting from 1988 to 1990, embezzled over $1.5 million from Prestige.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>For Prestige, Malick\u2019s fraud was financially ruinous. Various lawsuits ensued, one of which was this action, in which Prestige alleged that South Weymouth was negligent in accepting the SSB treasurer\u2019s checks and in failing to investigate Malick\u2019s transactions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">On the basis of those facts, and others we shall explore at appropriate points in our discussion, South Weymouth eventually filed a motion for summary judgment, which a Superior Court judge denied. South Weymouth later renewed its summary judgment motion, claiming that (i) it was a holder in due course and its status as such barred Prestige\u2019s negligence claim; (ii) as a holder in due course, it could invoke the finality rule, see G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 3-418, inserted by St. 1957, c. 765, \u00a7 l,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to preclude recovery; (iii) it had no duty to review the remitter line because it was the payee of the checks; and (iv) a bank owes a duty only to its customers, not to third parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">A second Superior Court judge allowed the motion. She concluded that the summary judgment papers left no genuine issue of material fact as to South Weymouth\u2019s status as a holder in due course of the SSB checks and, as a consequence, saw no need to address the other grounds for summary judgment South Wey-mouth had asserted. Because the judge saw in the papers no real dispute as to South Weymouth\u2019s status as a holder for value of the relevant checks, she focused chiefly on the question whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>South Weymouth had notice of Prestige\u2019s claims. In that regard, she found that the papers filed by South Weymouth eliminated any genuine issue of material fact, see <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Massimiano, </em>414 Mass. 81, 85-86 (1993), and that Prestige had presented \u201cnothing more than conclusory assertions\u201d in an effort to rebut South Weymouth\u2019s showing. Further, she concluded that Prestige\u2019s name on the remitter line \u201c[did] not, as a matter of law, establish that South Weymouth was thereby placed on notice of a defense or claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">On appeal, Prestige claims that there is a genuine issue of material fact whether South Weymouth was a holder in due course and whether it negligently allowed Malick to deposit the treasurer\u2019s checks into his own account. It also claims that the second Superior Court judge abused her discretion in revisiting the first judge\u2019s denial of South Weymouth\u2019s summary judgment motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>Abuse of discretion. </em>The second Superior Court judge did not abuse her discretion by hearing and deciding South Weymouth\u2019s renewed motion for summary judgment. \u201cAlthough a judge should not lightly undo the work of another judge,\u201d a summary judgment decision is interlocutory, and a judge has the power to modify the decision until a final judgment enters. <em>Riley </em>v. <em>Presnell, </em>409 Mass. 239, 242 (1991). Accord <em>King </em>v. <em>Globe Newspaper Co., </em>400 Mass. 705, 707-708 (1987), cert. denied, 485 U.S. 940 and 485 U.S. 962 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b798-7\">Proceeding to trial on a case that, as a matter of law, cannot possibly succeed expends public and private resources in a manner that cannot be justified either by considerations of collegial deference or by a desire to prevent \u201cshopping\u201d for a judge more favorably inclined to the shopper\u2019s position. That is not to say that a judge is required to revisit another judge\u2019s denial of a summary judgment or any other motion. It is to say that, absent unusual circumstances of a type that this case does not present, revisiting another judge\u2019s interlocutory order does not amount to an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-8\">2. <em>Holder in due course. </em>Substantively, if South Weymouth is a \u201cholder in due course\u201d of the SSB checks, it is entitled to judgment on the claims Prestige has asserted, for the status of holder in due course not only cuts off defenses on the checks themselves but cuts off other remedies as well. See G. L. c. 106, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>\u00a7\u00a7 3-207(2) and 3-306(a); Official Comment 2 to Uniform Commercial Code \u00a7 3-306, 2A part 1 U.L.A. 504 (Master ed. 2004) (prior art. 3) (claims with respect to which holder in due course is immune include \u201cnot only claims of legal title [to the check], but all liens, equities, or other claims of right against the instrument or its proceeds. [The immunity extends to] claims to rescind a prior negotiation and to recover the instrument or its proceeds\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b799-4\">Although it is somewhat unusual, a payee like South Weymouth may be a holder in due course. See G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 3-302(2); Official Comment 2 to Uniform Commercial Code \u00a7 3-302, 2A part 1 U.L.A. 343, <em>supra. </em>See also <em>Boston Steel &amp; Iron Co. </em>v. <em>Steuer, </em>183 Mass. 140, 143 (1903); <em>New Bedford Inst. for Sav. </em>v. <em>Gildroy, </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. 647, 651 (1994).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The question whether a payee or any other person takes a check as a holder in due course turns on four subsidiary questions, i.e., whether the person is (a) a \u201cholder\u201d who takes the check (b) \u201cfor value\u201d and (c) \u201cin good faith\u201d and (d) \u201cwithout notice ... of any defense against or claim to it on the part of any person.\u201d G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 3-302(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">a. <em>Preliminaries. </em>There is little dispute as to three of the four subsidiary questions. First, the Uniform Commercial Code (Code) defines a \u201cholder\u201d as \u201ca person who is in possession of ... an instrument[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>] . . . drawn ... to him or his order.\u201d G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 1-201 (20).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u201cIt is inherent in the character of negotiable paper that any person in possession of an instrument <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>which by its terms runs to him is a holder, and that anyone may deal with him as a holder.\u201d Official Comment 2 to Uniform Commercial Code \u00a7 3-207, 2A part 1 U.L.A. 317 (Master ed. 2004) (prior art. 3). See <em>New Bedford Inst. for Sav. </em>v. <em>Gildroy, supra </em>at 652 (\u201cThe payee of an instrument in its possession is always a holder\u201d). South Weymouth therefore became the holder of the SSB checks when Malick delivered them for deposit to his account.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">Second, a holder takes an instrument for \u201cvalue\u201d when it takes \u201cthe instrument in payment of or as security for an antecedent claim against any person whether or not the claim is due.\u201d G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 <em>3-303(b). </em>A holder also takes the instrument for value \u201cto the extent that... he acquires a security interest in or a lien on the instrument otherwise than by legal process.\u201d G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 3-303(a). A bank acquires a security interest in an instrument \u201cdeposited in an account\u201d when credit the bank has given for the instrument has been \u201cwithdrawn or applied.\u201d G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 4-208(l)(a).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Therefore, to the extent that South Weymouth took the checks in payment of loans it had made to Malick, it gave value for them. To the extent that it did not, it gave value when Malick actually withdrew the proceeds. In either event, Prestige does not argue that South Weymouth failed to give value for the checks.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>Third, although Prestige claims that South Weymouth negligently handled the checks, it does not claim here, nor did it claim in the Superior Court, that South Weymouth dealt with the checks other than in \u201cgood faith,\u201d a subjective standard requiring \u201chonesty in fact.\u201d See G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 1-201(19); <em>Industrial Natl. Bank of R.I. </em>v. <em>Leo\u2019s Used Car Exch., Inc., </em>362 Mass. 797, 801 (1973) (\u201cNothing in the definition [of good faith] suggests that in addition to being honest, the holder must exercise due care\u201d). See generally <em>Demoulas </em>v. <em>Demoulas, </em>428 Mass. 555, 575 (1998) (\u201cThe term \u2018[g]ood faith\u2019 means \u2018honesty in fact in the conduct or transaction concerned.\u2019 ... A party must show that he or she had a subjective honest belief in the legitimacy of the transaction\u201d). \u201cThere is no element of due care in the concept of good faith. . . . Nor is there any requirement of commercial reasonableness in the Code\u2019s definition of \u2018good faith.\u2019 \u201d <em>McCarthy, Kenney &amp; Reidy, P.C. </em>v. <em>First Natl. Bank of Boston, </em>402 Mass. 630, 635 (1988). Whatever else South Weymouth may have done or failed to do, there is neither an allegation nor a suggestion in the record that it was a party to Malick\u2019s malefactions or otherwise dealt with the SSB checks dishonestly.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b801-4\">b. <em>Notice of claims or defenses. </em>On this record, then, the question of South Weymouth\u2019s status as a holder in due course reduces itself to whether there are genuine issues of material fact regarding whether South Weymouth had \u201cnotice\u201d that Malick was acting without authority or in some other improper fashion when he presented the SSB checks for deposit. \u201cNotice\u201d under the Code consists of actual knowledge of a fact, receipt of a notice or notification of the fact, or reason to know of the fact from all of the facts and circumstances known at a relevant time. See G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 1-201(25).</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>Because South Weymouth\u2019s claim to be a holder in due course is an affirmative defense to liability that might otherwise attach, South Weymouth ultimately has the burden of proof on the issue. See <em>Rockland Trust Co. </em>v. <em>South Shore Natl. Bank, 366 </em>Mass. 74, 79 (1974). At the summary judgment stage, though, the burden \u201c \u2018is a slight one\u2019 that may be satisfied by [an] affidavit disclaiming any knowledge of [any] . . . defense[s] when the [checks] were negotiated.\u201d <em>A.I. Trade Fin., Inc. </em>v. <em>Lamina-coniones de Lesaca, S.A., </em>41 F.3d 830, 836 (2d Cir. 1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">South Weymouth has filed affidavits and deposition testimony of the requisite type. In response, Prestige urges that genuine issues of material fact regarding South Weymouth\u2019s notice arise from the remitter statement on the face of each check indicating that it had been \u201cpurchased by\u201d Prestige and from South Wey-mouth\u2019s general knowledge of Malick\u2019s suspicious behavior, including the size and number of the checks Malick was presenting. We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">i. <em>The facial notations on the checks. </em>The \u201cpurchased by\u201d notation on the front of each SSB check was notice to South Weymouth, and to everyone else who handled the check, that Prestige was the check\u2019s \u201cremitter.\u201d The 1998 version of the Code defines the \u201cremitter\u201d as \u201ca person who purchases an instrument from its issuer if the instrument is payable to an identified person other than the purchaser.\u201d G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 3-103(11) (1998). Although that definition did not appear in the Code in force at the time the checks were negotiated, the term \u201cremitter\u201d did appear elsewhere in the Code, see, e.g., G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 3-102(l)(a) (\u201c \u2018Issue\u2019 means the first delivery of an instrument to a holder or a remitter\u201d), and the current definition is consistent with the common-law definition existing before the Code\u2019s adoption. See, e.g., <em>Boston Steel &amp; Iron Co. </em>v. <em>Steuer, </em>183 Mass. at 144.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-7\">A remitter\u2019s purchase of a treasurer\u2019s or cashier\u2019s check is typically designed to facilitate the purchase and sale of commercial goods. See, e.g., Official Comment 2 to Uniform Commercial Code \u00a7 3-201, 2 U.L.A. 102-103 (revised art. 3). However, even if the bank delivers the check to the purchasing remitter, the remitter is not a party to the instrument and he or she has neither a right to enforce it, see 1 Bailey &amp; Hagedorn, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>Brady on Bank Checks \u00a7 8.02, at 8-7 (rev. ed. 2009), nor a right to order the issuing bank to dishonor it for reasons arising out of the underlying commercial transaction. See, e.g., <em>Louis Falcigno Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. 92, 95 (1982) (\u201cthe policy in favor of reliability of bank checks requires a rule that the [issuing] bank be precluded from raising [most] contract defenses claimed here on behalf of its customer\u201d).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b803-4\">Notwithstanding the remitter\u2019s limited rights to and on a treasurer\u2019s check, Prestige asserts that the appearance of Prestige\u2019s name on the remitter line put South Weymouth on notice of Prestige\u2019s claims to the checks or, at least, imposed on South Weymouth an obligation to inquire of Prestige before following Malick\u2019s instructions regarding disposition of the proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">a. <em>Remitter\u2019s name as notice of the remitter\u2019s \u201cclaim\u201d to the check. </em>Prestige relies on <em>In re Nordic Village, Inc., </em>915 F.2d 1049 (6th Cir. 1990), for the proposition that the appearance of Prestige\u2019s name on the remitter line was alone sufficient to put a holder such as South Weymouth on notice of Prestige\u2019s claims when Malick, the possessor of the check, instructed South Wey-mouth (the transferee) to use the check and its proceeds for purposes other than those that appeared to be consistent with Prestige\u2019s interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\"><em>Nordic Village </em>is a case in which a Nordic Village officer used Nordic Village funds to purchase a cashier\u2019s check payable to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The officer then delivered the check to the IRS with instructions to apply it to the outstanding tax liabilities of a separate corporate venture with which he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>involved. <em>Id. </em>at 1050-1051. Nordic Village subsequently entered bankruptcy proceedings, and the bankruptcy trustee sought to recover the funds from the IRS under provisions of the Bankruptcy Code allowing recovery unless the IRS took the check \u201cfor value, in good faith and without knowledge of the voidable nature of the transfer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1055. The court held that the trustee could recover, reasoning that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b804-4\">\u201c[t]he IRS gave value for the check by crediting it against [the officer\u2019s] outstanding tax liability. However, because of the words \u2018REMITTER: SWISS HAUS, INC.,\u2019 it cannot be said that the IRS acted without knowledge of the voidability of the transfer. It is not an ordinary business practice for corporate entities to pay one another\u2019s taxes. This notation is sufficient to place a reasonable person on notice that the transfer was illegitimate, and by extension, that it was voidable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b804-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 1056.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\"><em>Nordic Village </em>was decided under the Bankruptcy Code, not under the Uniform Commercial Code. To the extent we are asked to apply its reasoning to the record before us, we decline to do so, for to expand the court\u2019s rationale to include any use of a treasurer\u2019s check that does not appear to be in the remitter\u2019s interests would destroy the check\u2019s commercial utility. \u201cIt is an assurance of negotiability tantamount to a cash transfer which a cashier\u2019s check represents. If we are to begin requiring parties to investigate, despite this representation of negotiability, we are subverting the purpose for which the cashier\u2019s check was proffered.\u201d <em>Wohlrabe </em>v. <em>Powned, </em>307 N.W.2d 478, 485 (Minn. 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b804-7\">Concerns about preserving the assurance of negotiability lie at the heart of decisions that have declined to find notice of a remitter\u2019s claim from the mere appearance of the remitter\u2019s name in the remitter line. Thus, in another bankruptcy case, the court said that \u201c[r]emitter notations on a cashier\u2019s check are \u2018information to the maker and not conditional or notice of the payee.\u2019. . . [F]illing in of the remitter line on a cashier\u2019s check is akin to filling in of the memo line on a personal check; helpful, but not required, and of no legal effect.\u201d <em>In re Spears Carpet </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number><em>Mills, Inc., </em>86 B.R. 985, 993 (W.D. Ark. 1987). See <em>Western Sur. Co. </em>v. <em>Friederichs, </em>241 Minn. 492, 497-498 (1954) (under negotiable instruments law, statement on face of cashier\u2019s check stating \u201cDist. No. 14, Remitter\u201d was insufficient to place payee on notice of school district\u2019s claim to check district\u2019s treasurer procured with district funds and used to pay personal debt).</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">b. <em>Remitter\u2019s name as a requirement for inquiry before disposition of proceeds. </em>Even if its name on the remitter line did not provide notice of its claim to the checks, Prestige argues, its name at least imposed on South Weymouth an obligation to inquire of Prestige as to the proper disposition of the funds. Here Prestige analogizes its position as a remitter to that of the drawer in other check fraud cases and premises its claim on the proposition that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b805-6\">\u201c[wjhere a check is drawn to the order of a bank to which the drawer is not indebted, the bank is authorized to pay the proceeds only to persons specified by the drawer; it takes the risk in treating such a check as payable to bearer and is placed on inquiry as to the authority of the drawer\u2019s agent to receive payment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b805-7\"><em>Govoni &amp; Sons Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>Mechanics Bank, </em>51 Mass. App. Ct. 35, 40 (2001), quoting from <em>Bank of S. Md. </em>v. <em>Robertson\u2019s Crab House, </em>39 Md. App. 707, 715 (Ct. Spec. App. 1978).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b805-8\"><em>Govoni </em>has been described by a leading commentator as \u201cperhaps as exhaustive a statement of reasoning as seen in any such case where a check made payable to a bank is diverted to improper use by an unauthorized agent or employee of the drawer.\u201d 1 Bailey &amp; Hagedom, Brady on Bank Checks, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 13.05, at 13-19 n.112). In that case, the Govoni companies employed an accountant whose responsibilities included payment of company taxes. The defendant was the companies\u2019 primary banking institution. From time to time, the accountant procured checks signed by company officers and, as pertinent here, made payable to the bank, ostensibly for tax payments. Instead, the accountant took the checks to the bank and deposited them in his own account. <em>Govoni, </em>51 Mass. App. Ct. at 36-37.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>When the fraud was discovered, the companies sued the bank and largely prevailed in the trial court. This court modified the judgment in the companies\u2019 favor and affirmed. <em>Id. </em>at 51-52. Citing the principle quoted above, the court premised the bank\u2019s liability on a violation of G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 4-401(1), which provides that \u201ca bank may charge against [a customer\u2019s] account any item which is otherwise properly payable from that account even though the charge creates an overdraft.\u201d The checks presented by the treasurer, the court held, \u201cwere not properly payable from the Govoni accounts absent inquiry by the bank into [the accountant\u2019s] authority to receive the proceeds.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 41.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">Although <em>Govoni </em>premised the inquiry rule on \u00a7 4-401(1) and the banking relationship between the Govoni companies and a bank that was both the payee and the drawee, other courts have fashioned a broader rule. In <em>Master Chem. Corp. </em>v. <em>Ink-rott, </em>55 Ohio St. 3d 23 (1990), for example, a majority of the Supreme Court of Ohio, after stating that \u00a7 4-103 of the Code referred to a collecting bank\u2019s obligation to exercise \u201cordinary care,\u201d stated the rule as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b806-6\">\u201cIn applying the common law, courts across the country have found uniformly that when a check is drawn to the order of a bank, the drawer has indicated his intention to place the funds in the bank\u2019s custody. . . . The bank is not entitled to treat the checks as bearer paper. . . . Once the payee bank accepts custody and control of the funds, it can justify dispensing the funds only in compliance with the instructions of the drawer. ...

App. 1988).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">In the present context, at least, the difference between the drawer and the remitter is fundamental, for, at bottom, a check is the drawer\u2019s order to pay money in a specified fashion from the drawer\u2019s account. See 1 Bailey &amp; Hagedom, Brady on Bank Checks \u00a7 1.09, at 1-13 (rev. ed. 2009). The drawer is a party to the instrument, has certain rights in the instrument, and knows how it intends the funds to flow. A remitter is in an entirely different position. As we noted earlier, the check is not drawn on the remitter\u2019s account; the remitter is not a party to the check, cannot enforce it, cannot order the drawee to dishonor it for reasons arising out of the underlying transaction, and is not in a position to direct disposition of the funds. See generally Maggs, Determining the Rights and Liabilities of the Remitter of a Negotiable Instrument: A Theory Applied to Some Unsettled Questions, 36 B.C. L. Rev. 619, 651-652 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">The differences between the rights of the drawer and those of the remitter undoubtedly account for the result reached in two of only three decisions of which we are aware that applied the inquiry rule to cashier\u2019s or treasurer\u2019s checks. In those two, liability turned on failure to inquire of the drawer bank, not of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>remitter. In the first of the two, <em>Kaiser-Georgetown Community Health Plan, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bankers Trust Co., </em>110 Misc. 2d 320 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1981), the remitter of a cashier\u2019s check claimed that the payee bank was liable for depositing the proceeds of the check in the personal account of a financial advisor without seeking instructions from itself or from the drawer bank. The court agreed that the payee bank had an obligation to seek instructions from the drawer bank but said nothing about seeking guidance from the remitter. In the second case, <em>City Natl. Bank </em>v. <em>Crocker Natl. Bank, </em>197 Cal. Rptr. 721 (Ct. App. 1983),<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> someone misappropriated cashier\u2019s checks and diverted the proceeds to a use the issuing bank had not intended. The issuing bank, which was the drawer as well as the drawee, of the relevant checks brought suit against the payee bank for failing to inquire before disposing of the proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">In the third case, <em>Allis Chalmers Leasing Servs. Corp. </em>v. <em>Byron Center State Bank, </em>129 Mich. App. 602 (1983), the court, quoting, like other courts, see note 12, <em>supra, </em>from Corpus Juris Se-cundum, said that, \u201c[w]here a check is drawn to the order of a bank to which the drawer is not indebted, the bank is authorized to pay the proceeds only to persons specified by the drawer,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 606, but then proceeded, without discussion or analysis, to apply the rule to a cashier\u2019s check the remitter had procured and delivered to a seller of motor vehicles for vehicles the seller never delivered. <em>Id. </em>at 605. The court did not specify how the re-mitter intended the seller to use the proceeds or how the seller had misdirected them and applied the rule even though the seller had used part of the proceeds to pay off a loan underlying a security interest the bank had in one of the vehicles. In reaching its result, the court relied on <em>Bank of S. Md. </em>v. <em>Robertson\u2019s Crab House, </em>39 Md. App. 707 (Ct. Spec. App. 1978), and <em>Sun \u2018n Sand, Inc. </em>v. <em>United Calif. Bank, </em>21 Cal. 3d 671 (1978), both of which involved corporate checks, not cashier\u2019s checks. <em>Allis Chalmers Leasing, supra </em>at 607-608. The court also relied on conversations between the remitter and bank officials about the motor vehicle purchase that occurred shortly before the seller presented the cashier\u2019s check to the bank and on a notation on the face of the check stating that it was in payment of an invoice for a lease <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>covering the specified vehicles, though the opinion described neither the invoice nor the lease. <em>Id. </em>at 609.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">The fundamental differences between the drawer and the re-mitter lead us to reject the analogy between the two that Prestige would have us draw, and that the court in <em>Allis Chalmers Leasing </em>may have drawn, although ambiguities in the opinion leave us in some doubt on that score. Here, SSB, not Prestige, was the drawer of the relevant checks, and SSB makes no claims against South Weymouth. Moreover, nothing in the record suggests that if South Weymouth had inquired of SSB before disposing of the checks in the fashion Malick directed, SSB would have given instructions different from Malick\u2019s. See <em>Steele </em>v. <em>Victory Sav. Bank, </em>295 S.C. at 295, discussing <em>Kaiser-Georgetown Community Health Plan, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bankers Trust Co., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">Under all of these circumstances, we think that <em>Cassello </em>v. <em>Allegiant Bank, </em>288 F.3d 339, 342 (8th Cir. 2002), a Federal case applying Missouri law, supplies a rule of decision that recognizes a remitter\u2019s limited rights and that is consistent with the interpretation we have heretofore given applicable Code provisions. In <em>Cassello, </em>the court stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-7\">\u201cRoyal[, the payee bank,] points out that while the plaintiffs were drawers of some of the checks in issue, they were re-mitters of the others (the cashier\u2019s checks). The UCC defines a remitter as \u2018a person who purchases an instrument from its issuer if the instrument is payable to an identified person other than the purchaser\u2019 [citing \u00a7 3-103(a)(ll) of the 1990 Code revisions]. Royal argues that as remitters the plaintiffs . . . have no claim against the depositary bank for breach of warranty. We agree. Missouri courts have held that a remitter may assert a contract claim against the selling bank when the [cashier\u2019s] check is paid to an improper party. . . . But a remitter lacks a cause of action under the UCC against the depositary bank, unless, of course, the depositary bank was also the issuing bank. The proper party to sue the depositary bank under the UCC is the drawee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-8\">\u201cThe remitter should instead bring his or her action, if any, against the bank that sold the remitter the cashier\u2019s check.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b811-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number><em>Cassello, </em>288 F.3d at 342. Under that rule, South Weymouth incurs no liability for failing to inquire of Prestige before applying the funds in the manner Malick directed.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">ii. <em>Fiduciary relationship and suspicious behavior. </em>Finally, Prestige argues that South Weymouth was on notice of Prestige\u2019s claims because South Weymouth had knowledge of Malick\u2019s fiduciary relationship to Prestige and of his generally suspicious behavior. Here, the Code\u2019s provisions as to \u201cnotice\u201d and \u201cknowledge\u201d are relevant. The Code provides that a \u201cpurchaser\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> of an instrument \u201chas notice of a claim against the instrument when he has knowledge that a fiduciary has negotiated the instrument in payment of or as security for his own debt or in any transaction for his own benefit or otherwise in breach of duty.\u201d G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 3-304(2). Under the Code, \u201cknowledge\u201d is a far more restrictive concept than \u201cnotice,\u201d for the Code provides that a person \u201chas \u2018knowledge\u2019 of a fact when he has actual knowledge of it.\u201d G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 1-201(25).</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">South Weymouth\u2019s affidavit states that it had no knowledge of a fiduciary relationship between Prestige and Malick. At most, the record suggests that, as of November 1, 1990, after the last treasurer\u2019s check had been negotiated, a South Weymouth security officer knew that Malick worked for Prestige.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> There is no suggestion that the security officer or any other employee of South Weymouth knew the capacity in which Malick was employed. As thus constituted, the record is not sufficient to raise a genuine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>issue of material fact as to South Weymouth\u2019s knowledge of a fiduciary relationship between Prestige and Malick.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">As for suspicious activities, it is true that the volume of Mal-ick\u2019s banking activity attracted the attention of South Wey-mouth officials as early as June of 1990, though the truly suspicious activities reflected in the record occurred after Malick negotiated the last of the SSB checks. In any event, general suspicions about an individual\u2019s conduct do not provide, without more, notice of a claim or defense to a particular instrument. See generally <em>In re Williams Bros. Asphalt Paving Co., </em>59 B.R. 71, 76-77 (W.D. Mich. 1986); <em>Wohlrabe </em>v. <em>Pownell, </em>307 N.W.2d 478, 485 (Minn. 1981); <em>Johnstown Mfg., Inc. </em>v. <em>Haynes, </em>53 Ohio App. 3d 42, 44-45 (1988). See also <em>Universal C.I.T. Credit Corp. </em>v. <em>Ingel, </em>347 Mass. 119, 125 (1964) (\u201cThe trial judge correctly excluded the evidence offered by the defendants [makers of the note] to show that the [payee and the plaintiff, its as-signee,] had worked together on various aspects of the financing and that the plaintiff was aware of complaints against [the payee] by previous customers. . . . [T]here was nothing in this evidence by which the plaintiff had \u2018reason to know\u2019 of any fraud. The letter . . . from the plaintiff to the defendant . . . was also properly excluded; it is immaterial that the plaintiff may have found out about [the payee\u2019s] alleged fraudulent representations after the note had been purchased\u201d).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\"><em>Conclusion. </em>In sum, we are of the opinion that summary judgment was properly entered in favor of South Weymouth. South Weymouth was a holder of the SSB treasurer\u2019s checks for value. On this record, the fact that Prestige\u2019s name appeared on the remitter line did not place South Weymouth on notice that Prestige had a claim or defense to the instruments. South Wey-mouth had no obligation to inquire of Prestige before using the check proceeds to pay debts it was owed by Malick or crediting those proceeds to Malick\u2019s accounts. Malick engaged in a sophisticated fraud with substantially adverse consequences to Prestige, but on this record South Weymouth is not required to restore the money Malick stole.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b796-8\"> Helmut was the president of Prestige Imports, and Renate was a guarantor, with Helmut, on the SSB loans.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b797-7\"> This case began as a third-party claim. When Prestige encountered financial difficulties, SSB sued it for various contractual breaches and other alleged wrongs. See our decision in <em>Bank of America, N.A. </em>v. <em>Prestige Imports, Inc., ante </em>741 (2009). Prestige counterclaimed and filed third-party claims against South Weymouth. After South Weymouth obtained summary judgment in its favor, a judge of the Superior Court ordered entry of final judgment pursuant to Mass.R.Civ.P. 54(b), 365 Mass. 821 (1974). Oral argument was initially held on July 1, 2002, but the appellate proceedings were then stayed pending resolution of the litigation between SSB and Prestige. When that litigation ended and appeals were taken, oral argument in this case was heard again.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b797-8\"> Because the transactions in question here took place in 1990, references to the Uniform Commercial Code (Code) are, unless otherwise noted, references to the version inserted by St. 1957, c. 765, \u00a7 1.
