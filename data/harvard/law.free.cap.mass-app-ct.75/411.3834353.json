Taylor (tenant) filed a complaint in the Northeast Division of the Housing Court Department to recover treble damages from his former landlord, J.P. Beaudry (landlord), for the landlord\u2019s failure to return a security deposit within thirty days as required by G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 15B(4), (6)(e). A judge of the Housing Court dismissed the complaint on the authority of <em>Cas-tenholz </em>v. <em>Caira, </em>21 Mass. App. Ct. 758 (1986), and the tenant appeals. We vacate the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-14\"><em>Background. </em>The tenant rented an apartment at 40 Fairfield Street in Lowell beginning in mid-November, 2003,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> apparently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>on written leases from month to month. When the tenancy began, the tenant paid the landlord a security deposit of $1,375. The last lease expired on August 31, 2007, and the tenant claims to have vacated the premises that day. The landlord claims that the tenant did not vacate until the following day, but that dispute is irrelevant to the outcome of our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">By mail postmarked October 1, 2007, the landlord sent to the tenant a check for $871.67, also dated October 1, together with an undated letter explaining that the check covered the security deposit plus accrued interest of $109.81, minus $613.14 for cleaning and repairs to the tenant\u2019s apartment. The landlord did not sign the damage list under the pains and penalties of perjury, nor did he provide with the letter any evidence, other than his own assertions, of the estimated or actual cost of repairing the damage. See G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 15B(4)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">Dissatisfied with the timing and the amount of the deposit return, the tenant filed a complaint on October 16, 2007 (see note 3, <em>infra), </em>claiming that the landlord had not returned the deposit within thirty days after the tenancy\u2019s end as required by G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 15B(6)(e), and that, having failed to follow the procedures set out in c. 186, \u00a7 15B(4)(iii), the landlord was not entitled to make any deductions from the deposit.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> See G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 15B(6)(\u00bf&gt;). Accordingly, the tenant sought a judgment for three times the total amount of the deposit, plus interest, costs, and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, pursuant to c. 186, \u00a7 15B(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">At some point shortly after receiving the complaint, the landlord returned to the tenant the balance of the security deposit. The record is not entirely clear when the return occurred,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> but even in the light most favorable to the landlord, the record is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>clear that he did not return the balance within thirty days following termination of the tenancy. After returning the balance, the landlord sought dismissal of the complaint under what he claimed was the authority of <em>Castenholz </em>v. <em>Caira, </em>21 Mass. App. Ct. 758 (1986). A hearing followed after which the judge agreed with the landlord and ordered the complaint dismissed, later denying the tenant\u2019s motion for reconsideration. The tenant appeals from the judgment of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>In dismissing the tenant\u2019s complaint, the judge relied on this court\u2019s statement in <em>Castenholz </em>that when a landlord \u201cacknowledges his error and returns the deposit, and the tenant is not forced to resort to litigation to vindicate his rights, the multiple damages and attorney\u2019s fees provisions of [G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 15B(7),] have no application.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> I<em>d. </em>at 763. That sentence does not reach as broadly as the landlord contends.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">The tenant in <em>Castenholz </em>sued his former landlords, claiming that their failure to place his security deposit in a separate escrow account within thirty days of receipt violated G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 15B(3)(a).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Under G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 15B(6)(a),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the landlords\u2019 violation of \u00a7 15B(3)(a) effected a forfeiture of their right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>retain any part of the security deposit. In turn, \u00a7 15B(7)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> provided that failure to comply with \u00a7 15B(6)(a) entitled the tenant to recover three times the amount of the security deposit.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">The issue the court addressed in <em>Castenholz </em>arose out of the loose fit between \u00a7 15B(6)(a) and \u00a7 15B(7). Section 15B(6)(a) simply says that a landlord forfeits the right to retain the security deposit if the landlord fails to deposit it as required by \u00a7 15B(3)(n). Section 15B(7) says that a landlord\u2019s failure \u201cto comply with\u201d \u00a7 15B(6)(a) entitles the tenant to treble damages. The problem was that \u00a7 15B(6)(o), by stating no time by which the forfeited funds had to be returned to the tenant, thus established no means for determining whether the landlord\u2019s \u201cnoncompliance\u201d triggered the treble damages provision of \u00a7 15B(7).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">To supply a mechanism for determining noncompliance, the <em>Castenholz </em>court construed \u00a7 15B(6)(a) as a provision containing two components. The first component was, quite obviously, the forfeiture provision. In the court\u2019s words, \u201c[s]ubsection (3)(a) establishes the duty to place the security deposit in an escrow account. Subsection <em>(6){a) </em>declares a forfeiture of the landlord\u2019s right to retain the security deposit if he has failed to comply with the specified duty imposed on him by subsection (3)(a).\u201d <em>Castenholz, </em>21 Mass. App. Ct. at 762. The second component focused on when the forfeiture became effective. There the court held that the tenant\u2019s demand for return of the deposit was the triggering event and that a \u201cviolation of subsection (6) (a) occurs if the landlord fails to return the deposit when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>requested.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Finally, the court held that the treble damage provision of \u00a7 15B(7) only came into play if the landlord violated \u00a7 15B(6)(\u00ab) by failing to respond to the tenant\u2019s demand for return of the deposit, thereby forcing the tenant to \u201cresort to litigation.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 763.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">To be sure, the opinion in <em>Castenholz </em>could be read to suggest that treble damages under \u00a7 15B(7) are unavailable anytime a landlord responds to a tenant\u2019s demand and returns a security deposit before \u201clitigation.\u201d But \u00a7 15B(7) covers three clauses of \u00a7 15B(6) that deal with conduct the Legislature considered \u201cparticularly reprehensible.\u201d <em>Hampshire Village Assocs. </em>v. <em>District Ct. of Hampshire, </em>381 Mass. 148, 153, cert. denied sub nom. <em>Ruhlander </em>v. <em>District Ct. of Hampshire, </em>449 U.S. 1062 (1980), quoting from <em>Lindsey </em>v. <em>Normet, </em>405 U.S. 56, 78 (1972). The first is \u00a7 15B(6)(a), the clause discussed in <em>Castenholz. </em>The second is G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 15B(6)(d), which declares a forfeiture if the landlord \u201cfails to transfer [the] security deposit to his successor in interest or to otherwise comply with the provisions of [G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 15B(5),] after he has succeeded to an interest in residential real property.\u201d The third clause is \u00a7 15B(6)(&lt;?), the provision at issue here, which provides that a forfeiture occurs when the landlord \u201cfails to return to the tenant the security deposit or balance thereof to which the tenant is entitled after deducting therefrom any sums in accordance with the provisions of this section, together with any interest thereon, <em>within thirty days after </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number><em>termination of the </em>tenancy\u201d (emphasis added). While smooth application of \u00a7 15B(7) to \u00a7 15B(6)(&lt;7) likely requires the framework the court used in <em>Castenholz, </em>application of \u00a7 15B(7) to \u00a7 15B(6)(&lt;?) does not, for the latter clause contains, clearly and visibly, its own compliance deadline: thirty days after termination of the tenancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">We think, then, that the <em>Castenholz </em>framework is inapplicable to a landlord\u2019s failure to return the tenant\u2019s security deposit within the specified thirty days. The statutory obligation to return the deposit is clear, as is the time within which the deposit must be returned. Equally unambiguous are the consequences of failing to comply with that deadline. No interpretive gloss is necessary for a smooth and certain application of the statutory principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">Our analysis means that the case must be remanded for further proceedings in the Housing Court. Before concluding, however, we pause briefly to note two other issues that may arise upon further proceedings. First, the landlord was entitled to deduct damage repair costs from the security deposit only if he complied with G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 15B(4)(iii), as appearing in St. 1978, c. 553, \u00a7 2,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> which requires the landlord to provide the tenant</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-6\">\u201cwithin . . . thirty days [after the tenancy\u2019s termination] an itemized list of damages, sworn to . . . under pains and penalties of perjury, itemizing in precise detail the nature of the damage and of the repairs necessary to correct such damage, and written evidence, such as estimates, bills, invoices or receipts, indicating the actual or estimated cost thereof.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">He did not do that<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and, consequently, was not entitled to retain any part of the deposit. See, e.g., <em>Mellor </em>v. <em>Berman, </em>390 Mass. 275, 276 n.4 (1983) (\u201cThe purpose of requiring specific itemization is to ensure \u2018that landlords do not make spurious and unfounded deductions for damage\u2019 \u201d), quoting from <em>McGrath </em>v. <em>Mishara, </em>386 Mass. 74, 80 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-8\">Second, the statute provides that the security deposit must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>returned within thirty days unless the landlord makes a valid deduction or has some other statutorily permissible reason for delay or partial return.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> See G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 15B(4).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In a case like this one which involves claimed property damage, failure to return the security deposit, less any amounts that \u00a7 15B(4)(iii) permits the landlord to retain, within that period subjects the landlord to \u201cdamages in an amount equal to three times the amount of such security deposit or balance thereof to which the tenant is entitled,\u201d plus interest from the date payment was due, and court costs and attorney\u2019s fees.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">No appellate court has expressly construed the phrase \u201cbalance thereof to which the tenant is entitled.\u201d Several constructions are possible. One is that the \u201cbalance\u201d to be trebled is the difference between the amount the landlord actually returned to the tenant before the judgment or rightfully retained and the amount the landlord should have returned. See M.J. Realty Trust II vs. Dinnocenzo, 2005 Mass. App. Div. 35, 36, 38, <em>S.C., </em>67 Mass. App. Ct. 1107 (2006). Another is that the balance to be trebled is the difference between the amount returned within thirty days and the total that should have been returned. Yet a third is that the balance calculus comes into play only when the landlord has the right to withhold some part of the security deposit, but is mistaken as to how much and timely returns the rest. In that case, the balance to be trebled would be the difference between the amount properly withheld and the amount actually withheld. If, however, the landlord has no right to retain any part of the deposit, then the amount to be trebled under this approach would be the entire amount of the deposit, and the amount actually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>returned would be deducted from the trebled amount. See Carter <em>vs. </em>Seto, 2005 Mass. App. Div. 62, 63-65, 67, <em>S.C., </em>66 Mass. App. Ct. 1114 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">The briefs the parties filed in this appeal do not discuss the manner in which the relevant phrase should be interpreted. Indeed, they do not raise the \u201cbalance\u201d issue at all. We raise the issue on our own because there is more than a slight possibility that it will arise on remand. Having raised the issue, however, we are reluctant to decide it without any input from the parties or others, for it is an issue of first impression that may have broad ramifications. Accordingly, we invite the parties and the judge to address the issue when and if it arises on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">The judgment of the Housing Court dismissing the complaint is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b433-15\"> The lease is not part of the record, but it appears that Kimberly Cole Taylor was a cotenant. The landlord does not contest the tenant\u2019s right to prosecute this action solely in his own name.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b434-7\"> At oral argument, both parties acknowledged that the tenant sent the landlord a demand letter before filing the complaint. The letter was not made part of the record of the case. Although the landlord claimed here that he returned the balance of the deposit after receiving the letter and before the tenant filed the complaint, the record contains no evidence to support that claim, and the judge found otherwise.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b434-8\"> The judge originally found that the tenant filed the complaint on October 7, 2007. The docket, prima facie evidence of the facts it recites, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>MacDonald, </em>435 Mass. 1005, 1007 (2001), says that the complaint was filed on October 16, 2007, and the judge appears to have allowed the landlord\u2019s postjudgment motion to amend the findings to reflect the October 16 filing date. The landlord\u2019s answer, in which he says that the deposit had been returned in full, is dated November 16, 2007, but does not appear on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>docket until November 19. The judge found that the landlord returned the balance of the security deposit \u201c[i]n mid-October 2007, after receiving the complaint.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b435-9\"> Explaining, the court reasoned, \u201cAny one of the violations of duty listed in [\u00a7 15B(6)j will entitle the tenant to immediate return of his entire deposit on request, regardless of whether the violation was innocent or wilful. <em>Mellor </em>v. <em>Berman, </em>390 Mass. [275, 281-283 (1983)]. If the landlord refuses to acknowledge his error and return the deposit, thus forcing the tenant to employ legal process to vindicate his rights, the landlord will be liable for treble damages, interest, costs, and attorney\u2019s fees. The purpose of subsection (7) is not to pillory the landlord, but to make resort to litigation feasible for the tenants.\u201d <em>Castenholz, </em>21 Mass.
