(Globe).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-13\">The complaint alleges that Curtis, while doing business as Curtis &amp; Associates, conceived an idea for advertising to be used by automobile dealerships and, as an original expression of that idea, designed and produced distinctive promotional materials. Curtis sold these materials to dealerships and provided, for a fee, marketing services such as direct mail campaigns. Specifically, Curtis designed, produced, and sold a particularly successful and distinctive advertisement that dealerships used as a direct mailer or newspaper insert. Curtis avoided using his promotional materials for competing dealerships in the same marketing area at the same time. This allowed his customers to distinguish themselves from one another and also insured the value of Curtis\u2019s promotional materials. Similarly, Curtis limited the frequency of use of his promotional materials to preserve their impact.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>During 2000, Curtis contracted with the Chambers defendants to provide marketing services using his promotional materials. In late 2000, Globe approached and solicited Curtis for printing business. Curtis declined to do business with Globe.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">Beginning in early 2001 and continuing at least until Curtis brought suit, Globe began printing and distributing promotional materials for the Chambers defendants. These promotional materials, which were substantially similar to those designed and produced by Curtis, were distributed by hand and through direct mailers and newspaper inserts. The Chambers defendants ceased doing business with Curtis.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">Globe\u2019s promotional materials, which appeared in the same marketing areas at the same times as Curtis\u2019s promotional materials, confused Curtis\u2019s other customers, namely competing dealerships. Customers of these dealerships were similarly confused, and Curtis\u2019s promotional materials lost their impact, and value, due to the frequency of use of Globe\u2019s promotional materials. The complaint alleges that the defendants knew or should have known that their conduct would interfere with and impair Curtis\u2019s business. Curtis demanded in writing that the defendants cease their conduct, but the defendants ignored this demand. Curtis consequently lost both his credibility and the ability to sell his promotional materials and marketing services to dealerships in the same marketing areas as the Chambers defendants, sustaining damages.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">Curtis first filed a complaint in late 2001 in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. That complaint contained two Federal and four State claims. The Federal claims alleged copyright infringement under the Federal Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 101 et seq. (1976), and violation of the Lanham Act, the Federal trade dress statute, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125 (1999). The State claims were for violation of common-law trade dress, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, interference with advantageous business relations, and unfair and deceptive trade practices in violation of G. L. c. 93A.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-8\">The Federal District Court granted summary judgment on the two Federal claims. The court found that Curtis had not registered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>a copyright for the advertisement materials at issue. Copyright registration is a condition precedent to bringing a Federal copyright claim. 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 411(a). The court also granted the defendants\u2019 motion with respect to the statutory trade dress claim because Curtis failed to introduce sufficient evidence that his product had acquired \u201csecondary meaning.\u201d See <em>Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. </em>v. <em>Samara Bros., Inc., </em>529 U.S. 205, 211 (2000). Trade dress develops \u201csecondary meaning\u201d when, although it is not inherently distinctive, it has acquired distinctiveness in that in the minds of the public it identifies the source of the product rather than the product itself. See <em>ibid. </em>The court concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to hear Curtis\u2019s remaining State claims and said, \u201cAccordingly, the Court will transfer this case to the Essex Superior Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">The Superior Court clerk subsequently opened a docket in the matter. The docket indicates that the case was \u201c[transferred from U.S. District Court of Massachusetts to Essex.\u201d The docket also indicates receipt of the first amended complaint in the Federal action, the defendants\u2019 answers to it, and an attested copy of the docket entries from the Federal District Court. Curtis did not file a new complaint, but he did pay the filing fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">The defendants moved to dismiss the State claims in the Superior Court on the basis that the Federal District Court lacked the authority to transfer a case originally filed in the Federal District Court to the Superior Court. The motion judge found that procedural defects indeed required dismissal and dismissed the case without prejudice. That first motion judge noted that \u201cMassachusetts law provides a procedure for the refiling of an action dismissed for any matter of form (if originally commenced within the applicable period of limitations) within one year after the dismissal.\u201d See G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">By this time Curtis had died, and the plaintiff, his wife, as executrix of his estate, filed the instant complaint in Superior Court. This complaint alleges four State claims: count I for violation of common-law trade dress; count II for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing; count IH for interference with advantageous business relations; and count TV for unfair and deceptive trade practices in violation of G. L. c. 93A. The defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss was allowed by a second judge of the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>ii.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">The defendants brought their motion to dismiss the present complaint under both Mass.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1), 365 Mass. 754 (1974), for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, and under Mass. R.Civ.R 12(b)(6), 365 Mass. 754 (1974), for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. We review the allowance of a motion to dismiss under rule 12(b)(6) de novo. <em>Okerman </em>v. <em>VA Software Corp., </em>69 Mass. App. Ct. 771, 774 (2007). See <em>Iannacchino </em>v. <em>Ford Motor Co., </em>451 Mass. 623, 635-636 (2008) (articulating the standard for reviewing the adequacy of complaints). We accept as true all the allegations in the complaint and draw every reasonable inference in favor of the plaintiff. <em>Warner-Lambert Co. </em>v. <em>Execuquest Corp., 427 </em>Mass. 46, 47 (1998). In reviewing the allowance of a motion to dismiss under rule 12(b)(1), we review questions of law de novo. See <em>id. </em>at 47-50. See also <em>Valentin </em>v. <em>Hospital Bella Vista, </em>254 F.3d 358, 365 (1st Cir. 2001). A judge must \u201cdispose[] of a Rule 12(b)(1) sufficiency challenge on the basis of the plaintiff\u2019s version of the relevant events, taking the well-pleaded facts as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the pleader.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(construing the parallel Federal rule). See <em>Callahan </em>v. <em>First Congregational Church of Haverhill, </em>441 Mass. 699, 709 (2004). While \u201ca judge may consider documents and other materials outside the pleadings,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 710, where no relevant fact is \u201cin issue, the court\u2019s determination engenders de novo review.\u201d <em>Valentin </em>v. <em>Hospital Bella Vista, supra </em>at 365. See <em>Wooten </em>v. <em>Crayton, </em>66 Mass. App. Ct. 187, 190 n.6 (2006) (addressing the treatment of disputed facts in a rule 12[b][l]) motion).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">As an initial matter, we address the defendants\u2019 argument that dismissal under rule 12(b)(6) was appropriate because the statute of limitations had run by the time the plaintiff filed the instant complaint in the Superior Court. Curtis originally brought suit in the Federal District Court within the statute of limitations. The Federal District Court did not purport to dismiss the State claims in that case, but rather to \u201ctransfer\u201d the \u201ccase\u201d to the Superior Court. The Superior Court concluded that the Federal District Court lacked the authority to transfer the State claims under these circumstances and dismissed those claims without prejudice. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>Within one year of that first Superior Court dismissal, the plaintiff filed the instant complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-4\">General Laws c. 260, \u00a7 32, provides in relevant part that \u201c[i]f an action duly commenced within the time limited in this chapter is dismissed ... for any matter of form, the plaintiff . . . may commence a new action for the same cause within one year after the dismissal ... of the original action.\u201d The defendants argue that the \u201coriginal action\u201d was the Federal action and that it was \u201cdismissed\u201d by the Federal District Court in the transfer order. They argue as a corollary to this that the first action dismissed by the Superior Court was not the \u201coriginal action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">The procedural steps taken in this case present an extremely unusual circumstance. The Federal District Court purported to \u201ctransfer\u201d the timely-filed Federal action, not to dismiss it. The \u201ctransferred\u201d action was placed on the Superior Court docket. We think that, in light of the Federal District Judge\u2019s explicit order that the case be \u201ctransferred\u201d to the Superior Court, the first Superior Court dismissal was a dismissal of the original action for a matter of form within the meaning of the statute. The filing of the instant complaint was, therefore, as the first Superior Court motion judge suggested, timely under G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 32.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">Turning to the merits, the defendants\u2019 primary argument is that all of the plaintiff\u2019s State claims are preempted under the Federal Copyright Act (Act), and that, consequently, the Superior Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction. See 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 301(a). The leading Massachusetts case in this area is <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Mt. Ivy Press, L.P., </em>63 Mass. App. Ct. 538 (2005) <em>(Lee). </em>We explained there that there is a two-prong test to determine whether a particular State claim is preempted under the Act. <em>Id. </em>at 548. \u201cFirst, the work in which rights are claimed must come within the subject matter of copyright as defined by the Act[, s]ee 17 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 102, 301(a), [and second, the] right asserted under State law must be equivalent to one or more of the \u2018exclusive rights\u2019 provided by \u00a7 106 of the Act.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Under \u00a7 106 of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>Act, a copyright owner has \u201cthe exclusive rights to do and to authorize any of the following: (1) to reproduce the copyrighted work . . . ; (2) to prepare derivative works . . . ; (3) to distribute copies ... of the copyrighted work to the public by sale or other transfer of ownership, or by rental, lease, or lending; (4) . . . to perform the copyrighted work publicly; [and] (5) . . . to display the copyrighted work publicly.\u201d We will assume for purposes of this opinion, without deciding, that the first prong of this test is met and that although Curtis did not prevail on his Federal copyright claim, his promotional materials are nonetheless within the subject matter of copyright.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">With respect to the second prong, because a State claim is not preempted under the Act unless the right asserted is equivalent to one of the foregoing rights, the preemption provision does not immunize all conduct otherwise unlawful under State law simply because it is effected through the reproduction of printed materials. As <em>Lee </em>explains, \u201cFederal courts have developed what is known as the \u2018extra element\u2019 test. . . : \u2018[Wjhen a state law violation is predicated upon an act incorporating elements beyond mere reproduction or the like, the rights involved are not equivalent and preemption will not occur.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 549, quoting from <em>Rubin </em>v. <em>Brooks/Cole Publishing Co., </em>836 F. Supp. 909, 923 (D. Mass. 1993), in turn quoting from <em>Harper &amp; Row, Publishers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Nation Enterprises, </em>723 F.2d 195, 200 (2d Cir. 1983), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 471 U.S. 539 (1985). As this court explained in <em>Lee, supra </em>at 549:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-7\">\u201cThe extra element inquiry is not accomplished merely by counting the elements of a claim. The fact that a State claim has more elements than a Federal claim will not necessarily save it from preemption. Rather, the disposi-tive factor is the nature of the claim asserted. Where the extra element renders the claim \u2018qualitatively different\u2019 from a Federal copyright claim, the State cause of action will survive a preemption challenge. In determining whether a State law claim is qualitatively different from a [Federal] copyright claim, courts look beyond the label and evaluate what right the plaintiff was seeking to protect or enforce and the theories on which the claim was brought.\u201d (Citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b691-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>A.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-4\">We turn first to the common-law trade dress claim. We need not determine whether this claim is preempted because we conclude that dismissal was required under rule 12(b)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">The plaintiff argues first that Curtis\u2019s promotional materials contained terms and images that had acquired \u201csecondary meaning.\u201d See <em>Professional Economics, Inc. </em>v. <em>Professional Economic Servs., Inc., </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 70, 74-75 (1981). However, the Federal District Court\u2019s determination that Curtis\u2019s promotional materials had not acquired secondary meaning precludes the plaintiff under the doctrine of collateral estoppel from seeking relief on this basis. See <em>Fireside Motors, Inc. </em>v. <em>Nissan Motor Corp. in U.S.A., </em>395 Mass. 366, 372-373 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">The plaintiff also argues cursorily in the alternative that, \u201c[a]t the very least, the images\u201d in Curtis\u2019s promotional materials \u201cwere fanciful and not utilitarian.\u201d A finding that trade dress is fanciful and thus inherently distinctive can provide an alternative avenue to protection for such materials under the Lanham Act, the Federal trade dress statute. See <em>Datacomm Interface, Inc. </em>v. <em>Computerworld, Inc., </em>396 Mass. 760, 771 n.9 (1986). The plaintiff is, however, also collaterally estopped from seeking relief on this basis. Curtis litigated the question whether his promotional materials were fanciful in the Federal action and lost. Under the Federal trade dress statute, protection for fanciful materials is not available where the claim involves product design. See <em>Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. </em>v. <em>Samara Bros., Inc., </em>529 U.S. at 212-216. Curtis has not argued that the rule is any different under the common law of Massachusetts. Cf. <em>U-Neek, Inc. </em>v. <em>Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., </em>147 F. Supp. 2d 158, 178 (S.D. N.Y. 2001) (holding that a New York common-law trade dress claim is analyzed in the same manner as a claim brought under the Lanham Act). The Federal District Court found that this case involved only product design, noting correctly that \u201c[t]o recover on a statutory trade dress claim involving product design, a plaintiff must prove that the product in question has acquired a secondary meaning.\u201d The determination that this case involved only product design was necessary to that court\u2019s decision. Having litigated and lost on this issue in the Federal action, and in the absence of any argument that the common-law rule regard<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>ing product design differs from that under the Lanham Act, the plaintiff is collaterally estopped from raising it here. Cf. <em>Patterson </em>v. <em>Hantzes, </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. 806, 807 (1977) (collateral estoppel prohibits relitigation of issues expressly or necessarily decided in prior litigation).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">The next count alleges breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. We begin by noting that this is a covenant implied in contracts. Since the plaintiff does not allege that Curtis ever had a contract with Globe, dismissal of this claim with respect to Globe was proper under rule 12(b)(6) regardless of the defendants\u2019 preemption argument. See <em>National Lumber Co. </em>v. <em>Canton Inst. for Sav., </em>56 Mass. App. Ct. 186, 187 n.3 (2002) (this court may affirm on any ground supporting the judgment below).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">The plaintiff does allege that the Chambers defendants had a contract with Curtis. We noted in <em>Lee, </em>63 Mass. App. Ct. at 550, that, \u201c[i]n general, private contract disputes belong in State court.\u201d While \u201ca breach of contract claim based solely upon a promise to refrain from taking one of the actions reserved exclusively to the copyright owner should be struck on preemption grounds,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 551, case law indicates that where contract claims allege breach of a promise to pay for the use of a work, they involve an extra element that is absent from a Federal copyright claim, which renders them qualitatively different from such a copyright claim. See <em>ibid:, Wrench LLC </em>v. <em>Taco Bell Corp., </em>256 F.3d 446, 457-459 (6th Cir. 2001), cert. denied, 534 U.S. 1114 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">The complaint alleges that \u201c[bjetween May of 2000 and November of 2000 Curtis contracted with and sold marketing services utilizing his distinctive and unique advertising materials to [some of the Chambers defendants]. . . . After some success, general management for the Chambers organization caused other Chambers dealerships outside Essex County to utilize the designs and services of Curtis.\u201d This amounts to an allegation that Curtis and the Chambers defendants had a contract under which the Chambers defendants promised to pay Curtis in exchange for which they were permitted to use his promotional materials. The defendants do not contend otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>The shape of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing necessarily depends upon the terms of the contract. See, e.g., <em>Hawthorne\u2019s, Inc. </em>v. <em>Warrenton Realty, Inc., </em>414 Mass. 200, 210-211 (1993). The plaintiff argues that the covenant of good faith and fair dealing implied in the contract here included a prohibition on the Chambers defendants\u2019 continued use of Curtis\u2019s promotional materials without paying for that use. The principal argument put forward by the defendants in support of their claim of preemption is that the only action complained of in the complaint is the act of copying.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The requirement that copyrighted materials not be used, by either reproduction or distribution, without permission of the copyright holder is one of the exclusive rights protected under the Act. 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 106.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\">A fair reading of the complaint indicates that it asserts not only that the materials were reproduced, but also that they were reproduced without compensation being paid to Curtis. Among the damages alleged are \u201cthe loss of the fair value for the use of [Curtis\u2019s] design by the Chambers Defendants.\u201d Although the reproduction of Curtis\u2019s promotional materials is a necessary component of the alleged breach, the claim for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing requires proof of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>additional element, the implied promise to pay for any subsequent use of Curtis\u2019s promotional materials, which makes the claim differ qualitatively from a Federal copyright claim in the same way that ordinary breach of contract claims do. It therefore is not preempted.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">The third count alleges that Globe intentionally interfered with advantageous business relations existing between Curtis and the Chambers defendants and that Globe and the Chambers defendants intentionally interfered with advantageous business relations existing between Curtis and other dealerships. This claim involves \u201cextra elements\u201d rendering it qualitatively different from a Federal copyright claim. It therefore is not preempted. To succeed on an interference with advantageous business relations claim, a plaintiff must show that he or she had a business relationship with a third party from which he or she derived economic benefit, that \u201cthe defendants knew of that relationship,\u201d that \u201cthe defendants interfered with that relationship through improper motive or means,\u201d and that \u201cthe plaintiff\u2019s loss of advantage resulted directly from the defendants\u2019 conduct.\u201d <em>Cavicchi </em>v. <em>Koski, </em>67 Mass. App. Ct. 654, 657 (2006). The rights involved in such a claim are not equivalent to any of the rights enumerated above that are protected under the Act. The fact that the alleged tortious conduct may have included reproduction of printed materials does not immunize the defendants from liability, nor does it render the two claims equivalent.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>D.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">Fourth, we turn to the claim under G. L. c. 93A. Our decision with respect to this claim is controlled by <em>Lee. </em>As that case makes clear, to the extent that the plaintiffs c. 93A claim is based on the same conduct as the interference with advantageous business relations claim, this claim, too, is qualitatively different from a Federal copyright claim and is thus not preempted. See <em>Lee, </em>63 Mass. App. Ct. at 553.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">The defendants make one further argument with respect to two of the claims, arguing that the interference with advantageous business relations claim and the claim for multiple damages under G. L. c. 93A do not survive Curtis\u2019s death. See <em>Pine </em>v. <em>Rust, </em>404 Mass. 411, 417-418 (1989).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b695-8\">As for the tortious interference with business relations claim, it suffices to note that the plaintiff alleges the loss of good will among the damages caused by the defendants. As the Supreme Judicial Court held over a century ago, \u201cgood will is property, and is a valuable asset in [an individual\u2019s] business.\u201d <em>George G. Fox Co. </em>v. <em>Glynn, </em>191 Mass. 344, 348 (1906). The tortious interference claim thus seeks a remedy for an injury to a property interest. Consequently, it does survive. See <em>Sheldone </em>v. <em>Marino, </em>398 Mass. 817, 819 (1986) (actions seeking redress for damage to property rights survive death).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-9\">As for the plaintiff\u2019s inclusion of a request for multiple damages as relief under G. L. c. 93A, the defendants characterize these as \u201cpunitive\u201d damages, cf., e.g., <em>Drywall Sys., Inc. </em>v. <em>ZVI Constr. Co., </em>435 Mass. 664, 670 n.4 (2002), and assert that their availability does not survive Curtis\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-10\">No decision of either the Supreme Judicial Court or this court has ever held that punitive damages that are provided for by statute are unavailable for a claim that has survived the death of the plaintiff.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Nonetheless, the defendants here are not the first</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>to argue that under Massachusetts law punitive damages claims do not survive death. See, e.g., <em>Gasior </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Gen. Hosp., </em>446 Mass. 645, 653-655 (2006). This argument appears to derive from language in the single case cited by the defendants in its support, <em>Harrison </em>v. <em>Loyal Protective Life Ins. Co., </em>379 Mass. 212, 216-217 (1979). There, the Supreme Judicial Court said, \u201c \u2018So long as the recovery of damages was regarded as a matter of personal vengeance and punishment as between the transgressor and his victim, death erased the purpose of a civil action between them. . . . [Wjhen the function of damages awards came to be recognized as compensatory rather than punitive, the reason for the rule ceased to exist.\u2019 Smedley, Wrongful Death \u2014 Bases of the Common Law Rules, 13 Vand. L. Rev. 605, 608-609 (1960). Clearly, the passage of the Massachusetts Survival Statute [G. L. c. 228, \u00a7 1,] in abrogation of the common law represents the Legislature\u2019s acceptance of this logic.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">This passage, however, purports to explain the reason for abandonment of the common-law rule that damages claims abated upon death. It does not necessarily imply that requests for relief in the form of authorized punitive damages are unavailable in a case in which the claim otherwise survives. Indeed, courts ordinarily ask whether a \u201cclaim\u201d survives death, not whether particular requests for relief do. In the only case we have found that addresses whether punitive damages are allowed on claims that at common law survived the death of the plaintiff, the court concluded that they are. See <em>Worrie </em>v. <em>Boze, </em>198 Va. 533, 537 (1956) (deciding the question); <em>Worrie </em>v. <em>Boze, </em>198 Va. 891, 892 (1957) (reaffirming earlier decision). And courts in most jurisdictions have concluded that when a claim survives an individual\u2019s death under the State\u2019s survival statute, his or her estate has available to it all of the damages that would have been available to the decedent had he or she lived, including punitive damages. See, e.g., <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>New York &amp; New Haven R.R. Co., </em>29 Conn. 496, 499 (1861); <em>Pennsylvania R.R. Co. </em>v. <em>McCloskey\u2019s Administrator, </em>23 Pa. 526, 530-531 (1854); <em>Earl </em>v. <em>Tupper, </em>45 Vt. 275, 288 (1873). See also 1 Schlueter, Punitive Damages \u00a7 9.9(B), at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>633 n.954 (5th ed. 2005) (collecting cases). Some States\u2019 survival statutes have been construed to prevent the survival of punitive damages, but where survival statutes are silent on the matter, as ours is, they have ordinarily been construed to allow all the damages that would have been available to the decedent if he or she were living. 1 Schlueter, <em>supra </em>at 631-632. See 1 Kircher &amp; Wiseman, Punitive Damages: Law &amp; Practice \u00a7 9:8, at 9-57 \u2014 9-58 (2009) (unless a jurisdiction\u2019s survival statute bars punitive damages, \u201cthe estate or representative of a decedent to whom wrong was done [may] recover punitive damages in a survival action against the person responsible for causing the wrong\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\">The Supreme Judicial Court has not squarely addressed the question whether punitive damages are always available when a claim survives. Nonetheless, it decided recently that punitive damages may be awarded to the estate of a decedent in a common-law tort action for injury done to that decedent. <em>Matsuyama </em>v. <em>Birnbaum, </em>452 Mass. 1, 37 n.61 (2008) <em>{Matsuyama).</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark><em> </em>There, the Supreme Judicial Court held that punitive damages are available in a claim for \u201closs of chance\u201d brought by a decedent\u2019s estate for harm done to the decedent in the form of his or her loss of chance of survival. Although ordinary wrongful death claims seek redress for injury done to a decedent\u2019s survivors, loss of chance claims seek redress for injury done to the person who died. Compare <em>id. </em>at 16 (\u201cWhen a physician\u2019s negligence diminishes or destroys a patient\u2019s chance of survival, the patient has suffered real injury\u201d), with <em>Thibert </em>v. <em>Milka, </em>419 Mass. 693, 695 (1995) (\u201cThe purpose of the wrongful death statute is to compensate a decedent\u2019s survivors for the loss of the decedent\u2019s life\u201d). Nonetheless, the Supreme Judicial Court held that punitive damages were available, despite the death of the injured party. Matsuyama, <em>supra </em>at 37 n.61. <em>Matsuyama </em>thus undermines the argument that under Massachusetts law statutorily authorized punitive damages may not always be sought where the claim for which they are authorized otherwise survives a plaintiff\u2019s death. Indeed, even if there is a principle that relief that is in some sense personal could not be sought on behalf of a decedent\u2019s estate, something that was assumed by the court in <em>Gasior </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number><em>Massachusetts Gen. Hosp., </em>446 Mass. at 654-655 <em>(Gasior), Matsuyama, supra </em>at 37 n.61, suggests, consistent with the modem understanding of the systemic deterrent effect wrought by the availability of punitive damages, that claims for such damages are not merely personal.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">In any event, in this case we need not determine definitively whether otherwise authorized punitive damages are always available under Massachusetts law when an action survives death. This is because regardless of the answer to that question, under the Supreme Judicial Court\u2019s decision in <em>Gasior, </em>the multiple damages provided for by statute in G. L. c. 93A do survive.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">The court in <em>Gasior </em>held, even before <em>Matsuyama, </em>that punitive damages provided for by the antidiscrimination statute, G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 9, survive death. See <em>Gasior, supra </em>at 653-655. The court concluded that the punitive damages called for by that statute did \u201cnot merely vindicate] personal rights, but compris[ed] part of a scheme to vindicate a \u2018broader public interest in eradicating systemic discrimination,\u2019 \u201d and that \u201cConsistent with the broad remedial purposes\u201d of the statute, \u201cto the extent a deceased plaintiff\u2019s . . . claim [under the statute] survives him, he should have available to him all of the remedies provided under the . . . statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 654, quoting from <em>Stonehill College </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Commn. Against Discrimination, </em>441 Mass. 549, 563 (2004). See <em>ibid. </em>(\u201cWe see no reason to distinguish as to statutory remedies between a plaintiff who has suffered the indignities of unlawful discrimination [if proved] and who survives, and a similarly aggrieved plaintiff who is deceased, simply because the exigencies of court scheduling may delay the granting of relief until after the plaintiff\u2019s death\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">Even assuming that in some circumstances a claim for punitive damages may abate under Massachusetts law upon the death of the plaintiff, a question we do not decide, in light of <em>Gasior </em>multiple damages under G. L. c. 93A \u2014 even if characterized as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>punitive in the sense that that word was used in <em>Harrison </em>v. <em>Loyal Protective Life Ins. Co., </em>379 Mass. at 216-217 \u2014 are available in this case despite the fact that the original plaintiff has died. The multiple damages provisions of c. 93A are part of a legislative scheme designed to serve a broad public interest in the eradication of unfair and deceptive practices in trade or commerce. Further, while the multiple damages provisions serve several purposes,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> a \u201cprime goal\u201d of their inclusion in the statute is to serve the public interest in \u201creasonable settlement.\u201d See <em>International Fid. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>387 Mass. 841, 857 (1983). Multiple damages are permitted under c. 93A in the commercial context only when the defendant either fails to tender with his answer a written offer for settlement, or the court finds that such a tendered offer was not reasonable. See G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11. In a c. 93A consumer action, damages may be multiplied only when the defendant has failed to respond to a demand letter with a reasonable offer for settlement. See G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">Multiple damages under c. 93A thus are necessary not only to vindicate the rights of the injured party, but also to serve these public interests. In these circumstances, even if punitive damages might sometimes be precluded by the death of the injured party in a case in which his or her claim otherwise survives, there is no reason to limit the statutory remedies available under G. L. c. 93A simply because relief is not granted until after the original plaintiff\u2019s death. Cf. <em>Gasior, </em>446 Mass. at 653-654.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">The judgment of dismissal is affirmed in part and reversed in part, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b686-9\"> Of course we voice no opinion whether any of these allegations are true.

They also argue, however, that the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing cannot survive after the explicit terms of the contract have been satisfied because \u201cthe fruits have been fully harvested.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">This argument is foreclosed by the Supreme Judicial Court\u2019s decision in <em>Druker, supra. </em>In that case, the plaintiff \u201cdeveloped a concept for a restaurant at the Colonnade Hotel in Boston,\u201d \u201cconceiv[ing] the distinctive name,\u201d Zachary\u2019s, and \u201cdesigning a unique logotype and historical legend, as well as the entire design format and theme.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 384. He entered into a contract with the defendant to provide decorating and consulting services for the hotel and restaurant. There was no allegation that the defendant had failed to comply with the express terms of its contract with the plaintiff. Nonetheless, the court held that the plaintiff\u2019s allegation that the defendant later revealed to others, for profit, the plaintiff\u2019s unique concept, design, logotype, legend, and theme, including the name of the restaurant, and used them in rendering interior design services for a hotel in Toronto, Canada, stated a claim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. <em>Id. </em>at 385.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b694-7\"> The defendants have not claimed, either here or in the court below, that because of the actual terms of the contract, the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing does not contain an implied promise to pay for any subsequent use of Curtis\u2019s promotional materials. Consequently, the plaintiff was not required to prove the precise terms of the contract (which are not spelled out in the complaint) in order to demonstrate that the Superior Court had subject matter jurisdiction. See <em>Callahan </em>v. <em>First Congregational Church of Haverhill, </em>441 Mass. at 710-711 (plaintiff may not rely on the allegations in the complaint but must prove jurisdictional facts when defendant raises a \u201cfactual challenge\u201d to those facts).
