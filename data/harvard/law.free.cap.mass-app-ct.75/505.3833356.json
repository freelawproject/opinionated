L. c. 265, \u00a7 23, as amended by St. 1974, c. 474, \u00a7 3, and assault and battery as a lesser included offense of assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon, pursuant to G. L. c. 265, \u00a7\u00a7 13A and 15A.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On appeal, the defendant argues that (1) evidence of the victim\u2019s out-of-court complaints was admitted in violation of the \u201cfirst complaint\u201d rule, (2) the trial judge erred in failing to grant the defendant\u2019s request for a mistrial, (3) the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument was improper, and (4) his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance. Because the allegedly erroneous testimony falls within a defined exception to the first complaint rule and because the remaining grounds asserted do not constitute reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\"><em>Background. </em>Based on the evidence presented at trial, the jury could have found the following facts. In 1999, the defendant, then thirty-six years old, began a relationship with the victim, who was fourteen. Almost immediately, they began to engage in sexual activity including, after a period of less than one year, sexual intercourse. They met frequently at the home of the defendant\u2019s mother and at various hotels. Soon thereafter, while the victim was still fourteen years old, she became pregnant with the defendant\u2019s child. At the defendant\u2019s urging, and in order to avoid impheating him in criminal activity, the victim obtained an abortion. The defendant also instructed her to tell others that another man was responsible for the pregnancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-8\">After the abortion, the relationship became abusive. Nevertheless, the victim continued to be involved with the defendant, eventually moving into an apartment that he shared with his ex-girlfriend and their two children. On one occasion, in December, 2001, when the victim and the defendant were passengers in a friend\u2019s car, the defendant accused the victim of sleeping with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>another man, grabbed her by her head, and pushed her face into the car window.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">At some point after the victim\u2019s sixteenth birthday she became pregnant again. She was seventeen when she gave birth to the defendant\u2019s daughter. Thereafter, the couple\u2019s relationship deteriorated. In November, 2003, when their daughter was approximately seven months old, the victim moved out of the apartment. The defendant was indicted in September, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">Prior to trial, and without objection from the defendant, the judge allowed the Commonwealth\u2019s motion in limine to present the designated \u201cfirst complaint\u201d testimony of the best friend of the victim at the time she became involved with the defendant. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, </em>445 Mass. 217, 237-249 (2005), cert. denied, 546 U.S. 1216 (2006). It was anticipated that this witness would state that the victim had told her that the defendant was the father of the child that the victim conceived at age fourteen.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">At trial, the defendant\u2019s position was that he did not engage in sexual relations with the complainant until after her sixteenth birthday and that she had fabricated her allegation of underage sexual activity because of animus that developed when their relationship ended. In support of this defense, the defendant endeavored to show, from the inception of the trial, that he was not the man responsible for the victim\u2019s first pregnancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">During his cross-examination of the victim, who was the first witness called by the Commonwealth, defense counsel extensively questioned her about statements that she had made to others when she became pregnant \u2014 eliciting testimony that, at the time, she initially identified the father as someone other than the defendant. He also extensively questioned the victim about the places where she claimed to have had sexual relations with the defendant while she was underage.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-9\">The second witness was the victim\u2019s father, John R., who testified on direct examination, and without objection from the defendant, that when he learned of his daughter\u2019s underage pregnancy and asked her who the father was, the victim was evasive but eventually identified the defendant. Thereafter, on cross-examination, the defendant extracted an admission from John R. that he had once informed a detective that his daughter had told him that the father was \u201ca boy down on the Cape.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b530-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>Deborah Batista, a police officer who interviewed the victim in January, 2004, was the third witness at trial. Over the defendant\u2019s objection, she was permitted to testify that the victim told her that the defendant was the father of the aborted fetus. She also was permitted to testify, over the defendant\u2019s objection, about statements made by the victim concerning the locations of her underage assignations with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">The Commonwealth\u2019s final witness was the designated first complaint witness, the victim\u2019s best friend at the time. As it turned out, however, she testified that she was unable to recall any conversations that she had with the victim regarding her relationship with the defendant.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">During the defendant\u2019s case, he called Detective David Shanks for the purpose of establishing that the police had done little to verify the victim\u2019s allegations concerning visits that she and the defendant made to various hotels while she was underage. Shanks defended his efforts by adverting to a portion of a January, 2000, report, where he wrote about interviewing a hotel desk clerk who recognized the victim\u2019s photograph. Because this portion of the report had not been produced by the Commonwealth during discovery, the defendant immediately requested a mistrial on the ground that he would not have called the witness and elicited the adverse testimony had it been turned over to him. After voir dire, the trial judge refused to grant a mistrial; however, she ordered Shanks\u2019s testimony struck from the record and twice instructed the jury to disregard it.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">The prosecutor gave a strongly worded closing argument, to which the defendant raised two objections. The judge responded by instructing the jury that the rhetoric used by counsel in final <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>arguments was just that, and that it was up to the jury to determine the facts, assess the credibility of the witnesses, and render a verdict. She also gave a standard instruction that the jury should not be swayed by sympathy or emotion.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>Complaint evidence. </em>The defendant contends that, in violation of the first complaint rule, multiple witnesses testified to out-of-court statements by the victim, corroborating her allegation that the defendant had engaged in sexual relations with her before she turned sixteen. The defendant points specifically to the testimony of John R. that the victim told him the defendant was the father of the child conceived when she was fourteen years old; to the testimony of Officer Batista to the same effect; and to Batista\u2019s additional testimony recounting what the victim told her concerning places where she and the defendant had engaged in sexual relations while she was still under the age of consent. In each instance, however, the testimony was properly received not as first complaint, but as a fair response to the defendant\u2019s cross-examination of the victim and his over-all defense strategy. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kebreau, </em>454 Mass. 287, 297-299 (2009). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Parreira, </em>72 Mass. App. Ct. 308, 318 (2008); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dargon, </em>74 Mass. App. Ct. 330, 337-338, <em>S.C., </em>457 Mass. 387 (2010).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">The first complaint doctrine was adopted to ameliorate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>strong likelihood of unfair prejudice to the defendant from the admission of multiple complaints. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, </em>445 Mass. at 243-245. However, the doctrine \u201cis not intended to be used as a shield to bar the jury from obtaining a fair and accurate picture of the Commonwealth\u2019s case-in-chief.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Arana, </em>453 Mass. 214, 228-229 (2009). Accordingly, the admission of multiple reports of a victim\u2019s allegations of rape is permissible where the evidence serves an independent purpose and is necessary to present a fair and accurate picture of the Commonwealth\u2019s case. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Monteiro, ante </em>489, 495 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">Here, by questioning the victim about statements that she had made indicating that the person responsible for her first pregnancy was someone else, the defendant \u201copened the door\u201d to the testimony of John R. and Batista that the victim had told them that the defendant was the father. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dar-gon, supra </em>at 337 (given the defense\u2019s strategy, the Commonwealth was \u201cpermitted, within reason, to admit, evidence of the victim\u2019s prior consistent statements\u201d). Likewise, by cross-examining the victim extensively on the subject of her conversations with police officers, including Batista, about the locations of her liaisons with the defendant, the defendant \u201copened the door\u201d to Batista\u2019s testimony recounting the victim\u2019s descriptions of these places. The evidence was received for the independent purpose of rebutting the inferences raised by the defendant\u2019s inquiries \u2014 inquiries designed to show recent fabrication on the part of the victim \u2014 and was necessary for a fair understanding of the Commonwealth\u2019s case. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">2. <em>Motion for mistrial. </em>The judge did not abuse her discretion when she addressed the Commonwealth\u2019s failure to provide discovery of a portion of Detective Shanks\u2019s report by striking the testimony rather than ordering a mistrial. See generally <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Steinmeyer, </em>43 Mass. App. Ct. 185, 190 (1997) (discussing relevant factors). There is no suggestion that the discovery lapse was anything but an inadvertent mistake,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>judge\u2019s instructions to disregard the evidence were emphatic,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and there was no further mention of Detective Shanks or the desk clerk in the evidence or in closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">3. <em>Closing argument. </em>Two of the remarks made by the prosecutor went beyond the scope of proper argument. One comment, which was the subject of specific objection, was the characterization of the defendant as \u201c[sjwooping down like a vulture\u201d to take advantage of the young victim.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Another comment, to which no objection was made, was the suggestion that the jurors \u201c[ejnter into the heart and mind of a fourteen year old child\u201d when considering discrepancies between the victim\u2019s testimony and her answers to questions asked of her at the abortion clinic.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">A prosecutor should not use extreme epithets to characterize the defendant. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rosario, </em>430 Mass. 505, 515-516 (1999); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mosley, </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. 451, 452-453 (1974). Nor should the prosecutor argue that the jury should put themselves in the victim\u2019s place. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Esteves, </em>46 Mass. App. Ct. 339, 343-344, <em>S.C., </em>429 Mass. 636 (1999). Particularly where the defendant is charged with a sex offense, the potential for prejudice from improper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>argument is strong. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vazquez, </em>65 Mass. App. Ct. 305, 312 (2005). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lorette, </em>37 Mass. App. Ct. 736, 742 (1994), <em>S.C., </em>422 Mass. 1014 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">Here, although the judge gave a general admonition about \u201cthe rhetoric used by counsel\u201d and a standard instruction that the jury should not be swayed by sympathy or emotion, a stronger and more pointed reaction was warranted. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>417 Mass. 266, 271 (1994) (curative instructions should be focused on the error); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>28 Mass. App. Ct. 292, 296-297 (1990) (to counteract a \u201cpoisonous effect,\u201d curative instructions must be directed against the improper comments). Nevertheless, after taking into account the limited focus of the defendant\u2019s objection at trial; the judge\u2019s cautionary instruction, such as it was; the strength of the evidence against the defendant; and the fact that the jury did not convict the defendant of all charges,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> we conclude that the offending portions of the argument were not prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">4. <em>Ineffective assistance. </em>The defendant contends that his trial counsel was ineffective because he brought out a significant amount of damaging testimony during his cross-examination of the victim. The Commonwealth responds that counsel\u2019s approach appears to have been a reasonable strategy designed to impeach the victim by showing her ongoing hostility and bias. Because the factual basis of the defendant\u2019s claim does not appear indisputably upon the trial record, we decline to reach the issue. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zinser, </em>446 Mass. 807, 811 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b528-9\"> The defendant was acquitted on a charge of drugging a person for the purpose of engaging in sexual intercourse, pursuant to G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b530-7\"> In anticipation of receiving comparable testimony from the victim\u2019s friend, the Commonwealth already had introduced testimony from the victim that, when she found out she was pregnant, she confided in her friend and told her that the defendant was the father. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, supra </em>at 245 &amp; n.24 (victim may testify as to what she told the first complaint witness, but only if the first complaint witness testifies regarding the complaint). Although the predicate for admission ultimately was not established, the defendant did not move to strike the victim\u2019s testimony, and he has not argued the point on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b530-8\"> Other evidence admitted during the Commonwealth\u2019s case-in-chief included a videotape of the defendant imploring the victim to get back together with him after she ended the relationship.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b531-6\"> The Commonwealth\u2019s brief, which was filed prior to the decisions on which we rely, offers another rationale for the contested evidence, i.e., that it was admissible as evidence of a prior out-of-court identification of the defendant. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cong Duc Le, </em>444 Mass. 431, 436-442 (2005); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bol Choeurn, </em>446 Mass. 510, 517 (2006). See also Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7 801(d)(1)(C) (2008-2009). Here, however, there was no contested issue of identification in the usual sense, since the victim and the defendant were intimately known to each other. The only question was whether the defendant had engaged in sexual relations with the victim before her sixteenth birthday \u2014 which turned on the relative credibility of the victim and the defendant, and not on the victim\u2019s ability to discern the defendant\u2019s identity. Were the hearsay exception for evidence of prior identification to be applied in these circumstances, the first complaint doctrine would be rendered all but meaningless. In all sexual assault cases (indeed in all criminal cases), determining that the defendant is the person guilty of the crimes charged is a necessary predicate for conviction. Thus, the logical consequence of the Commonwealth\u2019s approach would be that every extrajudicial accusation of the defendant by the victim could be offered not as complaint evidence but as a \u201cprior identification.\u201d Furthermore, even where an independent evidentiary rubric for admission exists, that is not the end of the analysis. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Monteiro, ante </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>489, 494-495 (2009). The evidence also must serve a separate function, and must be of sufficient importance to a fair understanding of the Commonwealth\u2019s case that its probative value outweighs the incremental prejudice to the defendant inherent in the receipt of multiple complaint evidence. <em>Ibid. </em>Here, where the defendant\u2019s identity was not an issue, this standard could not be met.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b532-11\"> Voir dire of Detective Shanks revealed that the prosecution was never <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>given his entire January, 2000, report; instead, some portions of it were incorporated into a January, 2004, final report, which was provided to both the prosecution and the defense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b533-10\"> Upon making her ruling the judge stated: \u201cI am telling you now that I am striking from this record all of the testimony of Officer Shanks. You are not to discuss it in any way. And if you took any notes from Officer Shanks, just erase those notes. And I will also reiterate this when I am instructing you when you go to deliberate the case. You are not to discuss Officer Shanks\u2019 testimony in any way or even to consider it.\u201d In the final charge she stated: \u201cAnything I struck from the record is not evidence. And that would include the testimony of Officer Shanks. You are to disregard anything I struck from the record. You are not to discuss it at all during the course of your deliberations.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b533-11\"> The defendant also objected to a statement that even though the victim may have felt that she was in love and in a relationship, \u201cthe Legislature knows better.\u201d There was no need to place the Legislature\u2019s imprimatur on the prosecution of this case. In context, however, we think the jury would have understood the remark as simply reiterating the prosecutor\u2019s previous statement that consent was not an element of the crime of statutory rape.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b533-12\"> In context, an additional statement cited by the defendant to which he did not object, i.e., that the defendant was \u201ca parent\u2019s worst nightmare and a teenage girl\u2019s worst reality,\u201d was comparable to argument that has been deemed \u201ctolerable hyperbole, as a reasonable jury would recognize.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Hartford, 425 Mass. 378, 381 (1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b534-8\"> The defendant was acquitted of a charge of drugging a person for sexual intercourse and convicted not of the charge of assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon, but of the lesser included offense of assault and battery.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
