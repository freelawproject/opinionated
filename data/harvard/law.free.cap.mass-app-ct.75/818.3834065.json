(Comets). The allegations contained in Burley\u2019s complaint,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> insofar as they pertain to the conduct claimed to be defamatory, may be summarized as follows. On numerous occasions prior to March, 2003, Burley had skated at the West Suburban Arena (WSA), an ice skating rink then operated by Comets.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On or about March 15, 2003, the manager of the arena, John Conway, sent Burley a no-trespass letter, copies of which he also directed to the Natick police department and the Natick Division of the District Court Department. The letter stated that Burley was prohibited from entering the building or grounds of the WSA as a result of several complaints from parents concerning inappropriate behavior on Burley\u2019s part. The letter also stated that, should Burley be found on the grounds of the WSA without the prior permission of the manager or his designee, the Natick police department would be notified, and Burley would be removed and possibly arrested.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Furthermore, the complaint alleged that \u201cagents, servants and/or employees of WSA have maliciously defamed Burley by publicly disclosing that Burley was \u2018banned\u2019 from the [a]rena for inappropriate behavior.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">Comets answered Burley\u2019s complaint, and for more than three years, the parties conducted discovery and prepared the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>case for trial. The parties filed a joint pretrial memorandum on August 30, 2006. Thereafter, the trial date was continued by order dated November 22, 2006. At the end of January, 2007, at about the same time that motions in limine were being filed in anticipation of the upcoming trial, Comets filed its special motion to dismiss. The motion was accompanied by a copy of a memorandum of decision and order dated August 12, 2005, in a Superior Court case in Norfolk County involving Burley (the lorio case),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the deposition of John Conway and exhibits thereto, and Burley\u2019s answers to interrogatories.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\">Burley opposed Comets\u2019 special motion to dismiss, arguing that simply transmitting copies of the no-trespass letter to the police and the court did not constitute protected petitioning activity because Comets did not \u201cseek redress\u201d from these authorities. In addition, he argued that his complaint asserted other defamatory conduct that was outside the scope of protected petitioning activity, i.e., the alleged statements by Comets\u2019 employees to other individuals that Burley had been banned from the WSA due to inappropriate conduct. In support of his opposition, Burley submitted several deposition excerpts: Conway\u2019s testimony that he showed a copy of the no-trespass letter to the arena\u2019s director of figure skating, Jennifer Baker; Baker\u2019s testimony that she, in turn, told others about the no-trespass letter; and testimony by Donna Rozon that Baker told her that Burley \u201chad a no trespass,\u201d \u201cit was all taken care of,\u201d \u201cthe kids didn\u2019t have \u2014\u2022 nobody had to worry; that they addressed the situation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">In an order dated May 14, 2007, a judge of the Superior Court allowed Comets\u2019 special motion to dismiss, concluding that the issues presented were \u201cvirtually identical\u201d to the ones presented in the lorio case. Thereafter, pursuant to the anti-SLAPP statute, the judge awarded costs and attorney\u2019s fees to Comets in the amount of $60,265.54.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number><em>Discussion. </em>We review an appeal from a judge\u2019s decision on a special motion to dismiss under the anti-SLAPP statute to determine whether there was an abuse of discretion or an error of law. See <em>Office One, Inc. </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>437 Mass. 113, 121 (2002); <em>MacDonald </em>v. <em>Paton, </em>57 Mass. App. Ct. 290, 292-293 (2003). To prevail on a special motion to dismiss, the moving party must make a threshold showing, based on the pleadings and affidavits, that the claims against him are based solely on protected petitioning activities and that the claims have no substantial basis other than, or in addition to, the petitioning activities. <em>Wenger </em>v. <em>Aceto, </em>451 Mass. 1, 5 (2008), citing <em>Duracraft Corp. </em>v. <em>Holmes Prods. Corp., </em>427 Mass. 156, 167-168 (1998). Once the moving party makes that showing, the burden shifts to the nonmoving party to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that \u201c(1) the moving party\u2019s exercise of its right to petition was devoid of any reasonable factual support or any arguable basis in law and (2) the moving party\u2019s acts caused actual injury to the responding party.\u201d <em>MacDonald </em>v. <em>Paton, supra </em>at 292, quoting from G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H. The nonmoving party\u2019s \u201cburden only arises after a defendant shows that the lawsuit, or a count the complaint contains, is aimed at petitioning activity alone. Until then, there is no reason to terminate the lawsuit quickly.\u201d <em>Ehrlich </em>v. <em>Stern, </em>74 Mass. App. Ct. 531, 537 (2009). \u201c[T]he anti-SLAPP inquiry produces an all or nothing result as to each count the complaint contains. Either the count survives the inquiry or it does not, and the statute does not create a process for parsing counts to segregate components that can proceed from those that cannot.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 536.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-4\">In the present case, if the only defamatory conduct alleged by Burley were the sending of copies of the no-trespass letter to the police and the court, we would agree with Comets that the complaint was subject to dismissal under the anti-SLAPP statute. Under the statute\u2019s broad definitions, petitioning activity \u201cincludes all \u2018statements made to influence, inform, or at the very least, reach governmental bodies \u2022\u2014 either directly or indirectly.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ehrlich </em>v. <em>Stern, supra </em>at 535, quoting from <em>North Am. Expositions Co., Ltd. Partnership </em>v. <em>Corcoran, </em>452 Mass. 852, 862 (2009). Thus, even though the sending of copies of the no-trespass letter to the governmental authorities was not a request for immediate action, the transmittal plainly was intended to inform these authori<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>ties of the notice that had been sent to Burley and to set the stage for any later request for assistance with enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">The difficulty here, however, is with the additional allegation in Burley\u2019s complaint that Comets\u2019 employees \u201cmaliciously defamed [him] by publicly disclosing that [he] was \u2018banned\u2019 from the Arena for inappropriate behavior.\u201d Comets\u2019 position is that this allegation makes no difference to the anti-SLAPP analysis because (1) discovery has revealed no support for the allegation; (2) any such disclosure was true, and hence not defamatory; and (3) any and all of the individuals who may have been told this information were other Comets\u2019 employees who \u201cwere the ones who would be calling the police\u201d if Burley appeared at the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">In order to assess Comets\u2019 position, we begin with some general observations. The anti-SLAPP statute contemplates that, ordinarily, a special motion to dismiss is to be brought within sixty days of the service of the complaint, based on the pleadings and affidavits authorized by G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H, and that once the motion is made, all discovery will be stayed until it is decided. See <em>Donovan </em>v. <em>Gardner, </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. 595, 601 (2000). Nevertheless, we have recognized that there may be exceptional cases where discovery may be required before the moving party is in a position to learn the facts that indicate that a special motion to dismiss is warranted. See <em>id. </em>at 602 n.12. In such a case, the judge may exercise his or her discretion to consider a late-filed anti-SLAPP motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-7\">When the judge does so, however, the relevant inquiry does not change. In assessing whether the moving party has met his or her threshold burden, the question for the judge remains only the nature of the conduct alleged by the plaintiff (is it, or is it not, protected petitioning activity) and not the merits of the case as it has developed during discovery. A special motion to dismiss under the anti-SLAPP statute is not intended to be a substitute for a motion for summary judgment; nor should it be used as a strategic vehicle for shifting the fees and costs incurred by the moving party during the course of discovery.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See <em>id. </em>at 602.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>That said, we conclude that there is no merit to Comets\u2019 arguments concerning Burley\u2019s additional allegation. Even if discovery material (and not simply the complaint) were to figure into the analysis, rather than revealing that the allegation is unsupported, discovery has corroborated it, as shown by the deposition excerpts presented by Burley in opposition to the special motion. Moreover, Comets\u2019 additional argument \u2022\u2014 that any such disclosure could not be found to be defamatory \u2014 goes to a substantive defense in the case and not to whether the conduct in question was protected petitioning activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">Finally, we consider the significance of Comets\u2019 assertion that the only individuals who appear to have been told that Bur-ley was banned for inappropriate behavior were other Comets\u2019 employees who would be expected to call the police if Burley violated the no-trespass letter. To the extent that Comets may be adverting to a conditional privilege defense, see generally Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7\u00a7 593 et seq. (1977), its argument again relates to the substantive merits of Burley\u2019s claims and not to whether conveying this information to them was protected petitioning activity. To the extent that Comets contends that the statements were \u201crelated\u201d to the protected petitioning activity of notifying the authorities, Comets has not made an adequate showing that the statements are entitled to protection under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H. It has not been made to appear that all such statements were essentially \u201cmirror images\u201d of those communicated to the police and the court. See <em>Wynne </em>v. <em>Creigle, </em>63 Mass. App. Ct. 246, 254 (2005). Nor has it been shown that all such statements were made in conjunction with its protected petitioning activity (for example, to facilitate further consideration and response by the police), as opposed to being \u201cincidental observations that were not tied to the petitioning activity in a direct way.\u201d <em>Global NAPS, Inc. </em>v. <em>Verizon New England, Inc., </em>63 Mass. App. Ct. 600, 606-607 (2005). We note in this regard that Comets\u2019 brief does not refer to, nor have we located, record support for its basic assertions concerning the employment status and potential enforcement responsibilities of all the persons to whom the ban apparently was communicated. See Mass.RA.R 16(a)(4), as amended, 367 Mass. 921 (1975). Accordingly, on this record, we are not in a position to conclude that the alleged disclosure by Comets\u2019 employees that Burley was banned from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>arena for inappropriate behavior is possessed of the characteristics of petitioning activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\"><em>Conclusion. </em>Because Comets has failed to meet its threshold burden of showing that Burley\u2019s defamation claim is based solely on protected petitioning activity, its special motion to dismiss should have been denied. We emphasize that our decision relates only to the issue presently before us \u2014 the question of relief under the anti-SLAPP statute. Comets remains free to avail itself of other procedural mechanisms to raise its various arguments as to the merits of Burley\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">The judgment is reversed, the award of costs and attorney\u2019s fees is vacated, and the case is remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b840-15\"> \u201cSLAPP\u201d is an acronym for \u201cstrategic litigation against public participation.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b841-6\"> The complaint contains two counts: Count I, asserting Burley\u2019s claim for defamation, and Count II, seeking a preliminary injunction to obtain prejudgment security.

In the lorio case, a judge of the Superior Court allowed the defendant\u2019s special motion to dismiss on the ground that sending copies of the no-trespass letter to the police and the court was protected petitioning activity because it was intended to provide \u201cencouragement to the public officials that the situation should be reviewed.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b844-8\"> Here, because we conclude that the special motion to dismiss should not have been allowed, we need not consider the propriety of the award to the defendant of attorney\u2019s fees and costs incurred over more than three years of litigation and amounting to more than $60,000.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
