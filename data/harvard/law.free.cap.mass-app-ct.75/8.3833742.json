Acting on the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for judgment on the pleadings, a judge in the Superior Court upheld the decision of an acting commissioner (commissioner) of the Department of Environmental Protection (department) affirming the grant of the permit to the town.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-12\">On appeal, the plaintiffs argue that the commissioner erred in granting the permit because (1) the permit does not provide a reasonable margin of safety to account for any lack of knowledge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>concerning the impact of the treatment facility\u2019s discharge on the quality of the groundwaters and on nearby residential homes served by private drinking water wells; (2) the permit does not contain monitoring requirements for known toxic pollutants that are found in residential sewage; (3) the town failed to meet its burden to prove that the discharge from the treatment facility would not harm downgradient drinking water wells; (4) the treatment facility\u2019s discharge would harm nearby wetlands; (5) the commissioner improperly rejected an alleged finding that the discharge from the treatment facility would degrade the groundwater; and (6) both the administrative magistrate and the commissioner failed to give due weight to the testimony of the plaintiffs\u2019 expert, who opined that discharge from the treatment facility would harm nearby wetlands. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">1. <em>Factual background. </em>The treatment facility is part of a plan developed by the town to address a public health emergency within the New Silver Beach area of Falmouth. The New Silver Beach area lies in an area of low elevation by the waters of Buzzards Bay. There is no public sewer in the New Silver Beach area; approximately 210 homes located in the area are served by private septic systems. Due, in part, to high groundwater, many of the private septic systems do not satisfy the regulatory standards governing on-site sewage treatment and disposal systems (Title 5 standards).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">The town plans to alleviate the problems in the New Silver Beach area by piping wastewater from New Silver Beach approximately 1.5 miles inland to the newly constructed treatment facility. The treatment facility will use sequencing batch reactor technology, a biological treatment system designed to remove nitrogen from wastewater. Treated wastewater, or \u201ceffluent,\u201d will be discharged into the ground through a leach field constructed to the rear of the site of the North Falmouth elementary school. Although the elementary school currently has a septic system that satisfies Title 5 standards, the town plans to treat wastewater from the elementary school at the treatment facility. The permit limits the treatment facility to a discharge of 60,000 gallons per day (gpd). All wastewater to be treated at the treatment facility will be residential wastewater or wastewater from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>the elementary school. The plaintiffs\u2019 homes, which are not within the New Silver Beach area, will not be connected to the new treatment facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-4\">2. <em>Regulatory background. </em>\u201cThe Massachusetts Clean Water Act (Act), G. L. c. 21, \u00a7\u00a7 26-53, is a comprehensive program for protection of the surface and groundwaters of the Commonwealth. General Laws c. 21, \u00a7 27 (6), vests authority in the department to adopt water quality standards and to prescribe effluent hmitation[s], permit programs, and procedures for management and disposal of pollutants.\u201d <em>Friends &amp; Fishers of the Edgartown Great Pond, Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Envtl. Protection, </em>446 Mass. 830, 837 (2006) <em>(Friends &amp; Fishers). </em>Under the Act, the department may grant a permit for the discharge of pollutants into the waters of the Commonwealth or for the construction of a wastewater treatment facility \u201conly if the discharge and the treatment [facility] . . . will, in [the department\u2019s] judgment, conform to effluent limitations specified in the permit, and will conform to regulations, receiving water standards and comprehensive plans adopted by the [department].\u201d G. L. c. 21, \u00a7 43(5), as amended through St. 1973, c. 546, \u00a7 9. \u201cThe statutory purpose of the Act, expressed through its text, makes it clear that the department has the discretion to create regulations that will best preserve and also restore the quality of our waters.\u201d <em>Friends &amp; Fishers, </em>446 Mass. at 838.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">The department regulates the discharge of pollutants into the groundwaters of the Commonwealth through its groundwater discharge permit program, 314 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 5.00 et seq. (1996). Under the program, the department is prohibited from issuing a groundwater discharge permit \u201cwhen the discharge will cause or contribute to a condition in contravention of\u201d the groundwater quality standards, 314 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 6.00 et seq. (1996),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> or the surface water quality standards, 314 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 4.00 et seq. (1996). See 314 Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>Mass. Regs. \u00a7 5.06 (1997). Permits issued pursuant to the groundwater discharge permit program contain general conditions, which are applicable to all permits, and may contain special conditions, which are established by the department on a case-by-case basis. 314 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 5.10 (1996). Each permit contains \u201cmonitoring requirements to assure compliance with permit limitations and conditions.\u201d 314 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 5.10(6) (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b34-4\">The groundwaters of the Commonwealth are grouped into three classifications: Class I, Class II, and Class III. See 314 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 6.03 (1996).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Section 6.06 of the groundwater quality standards provides limitations on various enumerated pollutants (or \u201cparameters\u201d) applicable to each groundwater class. 314 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 6.06 (1996). A groundwater discharge permit issued by the department must contain \u201csuch conditions as the Department may deem necessary to insure compliance with the standards established in [\u00a7] 6.06.\u201d 314 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 6.07(1) (1996). The treatment facility at issue here will discharge effluent into Class I groundwaters, \u201cfresh ground waters . . . designated as a source of potable water supply.\u201d 314 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 6.03(1) (1996). \u201cThe determination of compliance or non-compliance of . . . waste discharges with the requirements of [the groundwater quality standards] shall be made through tests or analytical determinations of ground water or effluent samples collected, transported and stored in such manner as is approved by the Department.\u201d 314 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 6.08(1) (1996). The plaintiffs argue that, in affirming the issuance of the permit to the town, the commissioner misapplied these regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">3. <em>Standard of review. </em>A party aggrieved by the commissioner\u2019s final decision may appeal to the Superior Court pursuant to G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14. Judicial review is confined to the administrative record. G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(5). The burden is on the appealing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>party to demonstrate the invalidity of the commissioner\u2019s decision. <em>Merisme </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals on Motor Vehicle Liab. Policies &amp; Bonds, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 470, 474 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">We review the commissioner\u2019s decision to determine whether it was \u201cunsupported by substantial evidence, arbitrary and capricious, or otherwise based on an error of law.\u201d <em>Friends &amp; Fish</em>ers, 446 Mass. at 836. \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 1(6). The applicable standard of review is \u201chighly deferential to the agency\u201d and requires the reviewing court to accord \u201cdue weight to the experience, technical competence, and specialized knowledge of the agency, as well as to the discretionary authority conferred upon it.\u201d <em>Friends &amp; Fishers, </em>446 Mass. at 836-837, quoting from <em>Flint </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Welfare, </em>412 Mass. 416, 420 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-9\">\u201cWe give deference to the decision of an agency interpreting its own regulations . . . [and] do not intrude lightly within the agency\u2019s area of expertise, as long as the regulations are interpreted with reference to their purpose and to the purpose and design of the controlling statute.\u201d <em>Friends &amp; Fishers, supra </em>at 837 (quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-10\">4. <em>Reasonable margin of safety. </em>The plaintiffs argue that the department has failed to provide a reasonable margin of safety to account for any lack of knowledge regarding the impact of the treatment facility\u2019s discharge on the quality of the ground-waters and on the plaintiffs\u2019 wells.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The minimum acceptable separation distance between private wells and the leaching facility of a small treatment plant with land disposal is one hundred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>feet. Department of Environmental Protection, Guidelines for the Design, Construction, Operation and Maintenance of Small Sewage Treatment Facilities with Land Disposal 42 (2d draft Jan. 1988).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The private well closest to the proposed leach field is more than 400 feet from the leach field; the commissioner thus concluded reasonably that the plaintiffs had not presented sufficient evidence to show that their wells would be polluted by the treatment facility\u2019s discharge. The department need not establish permit conditions based on the most pessimistic projection of pollution presented by the plaintiffs. See <em>Friends &amp; Fishers, </em>446 Mass. at 840-841.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">5. <em>Monitoring. </em>The plaintiffs also argue that the permit should not have been issued without a requirement that the town monitor the treatment facility\u2019s discharge for all applicable parameters listed within the regulations, and for toxic chemicals used in ordinary households. We disagree. The Legislature \u201chas chosen to put into the hands of an expert administrative agency the decision making regarding complex issues of environmental . . . science,\u201d <em>Friends &amp; Fishers, supra </em>at 838, quoting from <em>Brookline </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dept. of Envtl. Quality Engr., </em>398 Mass. 404, 413 (1986), and has allowed the agency considerable discretion in determining monitoring of applicable parameters in order to carry out its duty to insure that a waste discharge will conform to the requirements of the groundwater quality standards. See <em>Friends &amp; Fishers, supra. </em>The regulations do not explicitly require such monitoring. The commissioner\u2019s determination that \u201c[t]he regulations governing monitoring of ground water discharges at 314 C[ode] M[ass.] R[egs. \u00a7] 5.10(6) [1996] and 314 C[ode] M[ass.] R[egs. \u00a7] 6.08 [1996] do not require monitoring of each parameter\u201d is reasonable in light of the regulations\u2019 purpose and the purpose and design of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">Based on its determination of the parameters of concern for sanitary wastewater from residential uses and an elementary school, the department issued to the town a permit that includes conditions required to maintain the quality of the receiving groundwaters. In accordance with the regulations, the permit contains a total nitrogen discharge limit of ten milligrams per <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>liter (mg/1) and a nitrate-nitrogen discharge limit of 10 mg/1. It requires daily, monthly, or annual analysis, at the pump chamber to the leach field, of the effluent that is discharged into the ground, including monthly analysis of nitrogen content and annual analysis of volatile organic compounds. It also requires installation of monitoring wells (one upgradient and two downgradient) in order to monitor water quality, including quarterly analysis of nitrogen content and annual analysis of volatile organic compounds. The permit comports with the department\u2019s statutory mandate to protect the groundwaters of the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">The plaintiffs have raised the possibility that toxic household chemicals may enter the treatment facility\u2019s discharge, dismpt the facility\u2019s treatment system, and cause pollution of their wells, and on that basis argue that the department must require the town to monitor the treatment facility\u2019s discharge for toxic chemicals used in ordinary households. Based upon our review of the record, the commissioner reasonably could have determined that the plaintiffs failed to present sufficient evidence to show that such toxins were likely to be present in concentrations that pose a threat to the quality of the receiving groundwaters. The regulations do not require the department to establish permit conditions based on the plaintiffs\u2019 speculative concerns. See <em>Friends &amp; Fishers, </em>446 Mass. at 840 (plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the department must establish permit limitations based on the most pessimistic projection of pollution failed).</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">6. <em>Burden of proof </em>The plaintiffs argue that, contrary to the commissioner\u2019s determination, in the course of the agency proceedings, they raised a serious issue of risk that toxic chemicals used in ordinary households would enter the treatment facility\u2019s discharge and cause pollution of their wells, and that the town did not meet its burden to show that the treatment facility\u2019s discharge was safe. \u201c[Ojnce a serious issue of risk has been raised by an opponent [of a proposed facility], the applicant bears the burden of proving that the facility will be safe with regard to that issue.\u201d <em>Brookline </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dept. of Envtl. Quality Engr., </em>398 Mass. at 412. The commissioner reasonably concluded that the plaintiffs\u2019 evidence was insufficient to shift the burden of proof because the plaintiffs failed to offer sufficient evidence to show that toxic household chemicals were likely to be present in concentrations that pose a threat to the quality of the receiving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>groundwaters. The town was not required to respond to the plaintiffs\u2019 speculative and unsupported assertions. See <em>id. </em>at 412-413.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">7. <em>Surface water quality standards. </em>The plaintiffs next contend that the treatment facility\u2019s discharge \u201cwill cause or contribute to a condition in contravention of\u201d the surface water quality standards, thus violating the groundwater discharge permit regulations. See 314 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 5.06 (1997). They argue that the department did not adequately consider the water quality of the nearby vernal pool and marsh because it did not require the town to analyze the existing \u201cbackground levels\u201d of any pollutants in those surface waters. Substantial evidence in the record supports the commissioner\u2019s decision to uphold the issuance of the permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">Although the groundwater discharge permit program draws upon both the groundwater quality standards and the surface water quality standards in appropriate cases, most surface water quality standards do not apply to a permit for discharges into groundwater. <em>Friends &amp; Fishers, </em>446 Mass. at 842. Because the treatment facility will not discharge effluent directly into either the vernal pool or the marsh, \u201cthe only relevant surface water quality standards are those dealing with the nitrogen loading and eutrophication[<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>] of [surface waters] from nonpoint source discharges into groundwater, 314 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 4.05(5)(c) [1997], and, to some extent, the antidegradation provisions of the surface water quality standards, 314 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 4.04(5) [1997].\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">The commissioner\u2019s decision to grant the permit is supported by evidence in the record showing that the treatment facility will lower the risk of eutrophication in the vernal pool and marsh. Amy Lowell, the wastewater superintendent for the town, stated, in written testimony submitted to the department, that the elementary school and approximately 210 New Silver Beach homes are currently discharging untreated wastewater into the ground. The treatment facility would reduce the impact of waste-water upon surface waters because the wastewater from the elementary school and New Silver Beach homes would be subject <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>to nitrogen removal at the treatment facility before it is discharged into the ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-4\">In addition, the commissioner considered testimony from Brian Dudley, the department staff engineer who reviewed and signed the permit. He averred that the permit\u2019s 10 mg/1 limit on nitrogen loading into the ground is more stringent than the limit provided in the regulations for discharge into Class I ground-waters because the 10 mg/1 limit in the regulations is required only for wastewater flows in excess of 150,000 gpd,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> whereas the treatment facility\u2019s flow limit is 60,000 gpd.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">At the hearing before the administrative magistrate, the plaintiffs argued that, because of the direction of groundwater flow, nutrients from the treatment facility\u2019s discharge would flow towards and mix with the water in the vernal pool and marsh, and would degrade the quality of these surface waters. The administrative magistrate' and the commissioner could reasonably conclude that the plaintiffs failed to present sufficient evidence to support this claim. Thus, the department\u2019s decision to uphold the issuance of the permit to the town, without requiring the town to conduct analytical tests of the water within the vernal pool and marsh, is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">8. <em>Magistrate\u2019s findings. </em>The plaintiffs argue that the commissioner improperly rejected that part of the administrative magistrate\u2019s recommended decision implying that the discharge from the treatment facility would degrade the receiving groundwater from Class I to Class III. They argue that where there is doubt about the accuracy of the administrative magistrate\u2019s determination, the commissioner is required to remand the case to the administrative magistrate for additional findings or the taking of additional evidence. As we read the recommended decision, it contained no such implication, and in any event, there was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">\u201cRecommended decisions should include findings of fact, conclusions of law and recommendations on issues necessary to the decision.\u201d 310 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.01(14)(a) (2004). \u201cA final decision may adopt, modify, or reject a recommended decision, with a statement of reasons.\u201d 310 Code Mass. Regs. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>\u00a7 1.01(14)(b) (2004). In his recommended decision, the administrative magistrate concluded that the department could issue a groundwater discharge permit to the town for the treatment facility project even if the discharge from the treatment facility would degrade groundwater at the site. In the final decision, the commissioner stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-5\">\u201cWhile I concur with the Recommended Decision that the regulations allow the reclassification of ground water from Class I to Class III, the Town has not applied for, nor has the Department given any indication it would approve, a reclassification to accommodate [the treatment facility] project. ... In fact, the permit contains effluent limitations adequate to meet Class I standards .... I reject the implication that a Class III designation might be necessary to support the issuance of this permit.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">The commissioner\u2019s statement of reasons was sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">9. <em>Terry Bauer\u2019s testimony. </em>Finally, the plaintiffs argue that both the administrative magistrate and the commissioner failed to give due weight to the testimony of their expert, Terry Bauer,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> who opined that discharge from the treatment facility would harm nearby wetlands. At the agency hearing, Bauer stated that nitrogen and phosphorus from the treatment facility\u2019s discharge would cause eutrophication in the vernal pool and the marsh. There is no merit to the plaintiffs\u2019 contention that the administrative magistrate impermissibly excluded Bauer\u2019s testimony. Rather, the administrative magistrate considered Bauer\u2019s testimony<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and determined that it was not credible. Specifically, the administrative magistrate found that the plaintiffs \u201cdid not establish that Bauer\u2019s training as a geologist or his work experience qualify him to provide expert opinion on how the concen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>trations of nitrogen and phosphorus allowed by the discharge permit will affect the vernal pool and marsh. Accordingly, his testimony on this point is entitled to no weight.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">In assessing the credibility of Bauer\u2019s testimony, the administrative magistrate properly took into account Bauer\u2019s training and expertise. See <em>Letch </em>v. <em>Daniels, </em>401 Mass. 65, 69 (1987), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Schulze, </em>389 Mass. 735, 740 (1983) (the extent of the training and experience of an expert witness appropriately bears on the weight that should be accorded his testimony). The administrative magistrate\u2019s decision to give \u201cno weight\u201d to Bauer\u2019s testimony as to eutrophication was based on an explicit and objectively adequate reason. See <em>New Boston Garden Corp. </em>v. <em>Assessors of Boston, </em>383 Mass. 456, 470-471 (1981), quoting from Jaffe, Judicial Control of Administrative Action 598, 607 (1965) (\u201c[Ejvidence of a party having the burden of proof may not be disbelieved without an explicit and objectively adequate reason\u201d). Because the plaintiffs failed to meet their burden to prove that nutrients from the treatment facility\u2019s discharge would cause eutrophication in the vernal pool and marsh,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> the commissioner properly resolved the issue in favor of the defendants, even in the absence of affirmative evidence showing that the treatment facility\u2019s discharge would not cause eutrophication.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\"><em>Conclusion. </em>For the reasons stated above, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b31-13\"> In June, 2002, the conservation commission of Falmouth (commission) issued an order of conditions approving the town\u2019s plan to construct the new sewer system and treatment facility.
