Warren responded with a special motion to dismiss pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H, commonly referred to as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>\u201canti-SLAPP statute.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The judge concluded that Warren had satisfied his burden of demonstrating that his remarks were protected petitioning activity, while Dickey had failed to demonstrate that Warren\u2019s petitioning activity was \u201cdevoid of \u2018any reasonable factual support or any arguable basis in law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Fisher </em>v. <em>Lint, </em>69 Mass. App. Ct. 360, 363 (2007), quoting from <em>Donovan </em>v. <em>Gardner, </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. 595, 599 (2000). We agree and affirm the dismissal of Dickey\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">1. <em>The facts. </em>We set out the facts related in the judge\u2019s memorandum of decision as supported and supplemented by the parties\u2019 materials included in the record before us on Dickey\u2019s appeal. On December 15, 2002, Warren became a residential tenant in a three-family building owned by Dickey and situated at 97 Mount Ida Road in the Dorchester section of Boston. Several months later, in March or early April, 2003, Warren\u2019s roommate informed Dickey that there was a problem with the furnace for their apartment. According to Dickey, the furnace was repaired the night of the roommate\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">On August 25, 2003, the department granted Dickey a permit to repair and replace the siding on the building. Dickey began the permitted work on September 1, 2003. On September 16, while the permitted work was in progress, Edward Kennedy, an investigator with the department\u2019s division of investigation and regulatory enforcement, inspected the building and discovered many violations of the State Sanitary Code. See generally 105 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 410.831 et seq. (1997) (governing dwellings unfit for human habitation and condemnation and hearing process). Kennedy concluded that the entire building was unfit for human habitation and ordered that it be condemned and that its occupants vacate the premises \u201cforthwith,\u201d i.e., September 16, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">The department conducted a hearing on the condemnation on October 7, 2003.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As set out in the department\u2019s notice of decision, both Kennedy and Warren testified in support of the condemnation of the building. In an affidavit submitted to the Superior Court in connection with his special motion to dismiss, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>Warren stated that soon after moving into 97 Mount Ida Road he noticed a \u201csevere soot and rodent problem with the apartment\u201d and that he \u201ctestified against [Dickey]\u201d at the condemnation hearing and at a trial on his civil complaint against Dickey.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Warren further stated in his affidavit that \u201c[a]s a result of the conditions cited by the [department], I was ordered to vacate the apartment.\u201d The conditions cited by Kennedy, the department\u2019s inspector, which led to the condemnation of the building as unfit for human habitation, and the order to vacate the building immediately, were based on Kennedy\u2019s personal observations made during his inspection of the property on September 16, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">There is nothing in Warren\u2019s affidavit that describes or otherwise intimates the contents or substance of his testimony at the condemnation hearing. However, according to the memorandum of law submitted by his attorney in support of his special motion to dismiss, Warren \u201cindicated\u201d at the condemnation hearing that \u201che moved out of the third floor apartment because of a problem with the furnace.\u201d Warren\u2019s affidavit also recites that the testimony he gave at the hearing and at trial on his complaint against Dickey was, \u201cto the best of [his] knowledge, true.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">Dickey averred in his affidavit in opposition to the special motion to dismiss that he was informed by Warren\u2019s roommate in late March or early April, 2003, that there was a problem with the furnace for their apartment and that he repaired the problem that same day. He also related that in May or June of 2003, he asked Warren why he had not been informed earlier about Warren\u2019s complaint regarding the furnace. According to Dickey, Warren explained that he was able to block a heating vent in his bedroom and that \u201cas far as [Warren] was concerned ... it fixed the problem for him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">According to Dickey, Warren \u201cindicated\u201d at the condemnation hearing held on October 7, 2003, that \u201che moved out of [his] apartment because of problems with the apartment.\u201d Dickey further maintains that Warren later testified at the 2004 trial on his action against Dickey that he was living at 97 Mount Ida Road on September 16, 2003, when he was forced to vacate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>apartment <em>on that day </em>because the house was \u201cboarded-up by the City of Boston.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">2. <em>The pertinent provisions of G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H. </em>The first paragraph of G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H, as amended by St. 1996, c. 450, \u00a7 245, provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-5\">\u201cIn any case in which a party asserts that the civil claims . . . against said party are based on said party\u2019s exercise of its right of petition under the constitution of the United States or of the commonwealth, said party may bring a special motion to dismiss. . . . The court shall grant such special motion, unless the party against whom such special motion is made shows that: (1) the moving party\u2019s exercise of its right to petition was devoid of any reasonable factual support or any arguable basis in law <em>and </em>(2) the moving party\u2019s acts caused actual injury to the responding party. In making its determination, the court <em>shall </em>consider the pleadings and supporting and opposing affidavits stating the facts upon which the liability or defense is based\u201d (emphasis added).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">The final paragraph of \u00a7 59H, inserted by St. 1994, c. 283, \u00a7 1, provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-7\">\u201cAs used in this section, the words \u2018a party\u2019s exercise of its right of petition\u2019 shall mean any written or oral statement made before or submitted to a legislative, executive, or judicial body, <em>or any other governmental proceeding', </em>any written or oral statement made in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a legislative, executive, or judicial body, <em>or any other governmental proceeding', </em>any statement reasonably likely to encourage consideration or review of an issue by a legislative, executive, or judicial body or any other governmental proceeding ...\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-8\">3. <em>The judge\u2019s decision. </em>Dickey has not included a copy of his defamation complaint in the record appendix, but the motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>judge set out in his memorandum of decision the gist of that complaint and Dickey\u2019s argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-4\">\u201cDickey argues that, in light of Warren\u2019s testimony at [the trial on his complaint against Dickey], it is clear that his testimony at the condemnation hearing was untrue and defamatory. Specifically, Dickey highlights Warren\u2019s testimony that he moved out of his third floor apartment, <em>presumably </em>before the house was condemned, because of problems with the furnace. Dickey also points out that, at trial, Warren testified that he moved out of Dickey\u2019s house on the day it was boarded up by the City. As a result of Warren\u2019s testimony, Dickey alleges that he suffered significant damages.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">The judge further noted that Dickey\u2019s defamation complaint against Warren was based <em>\u201conly\u201d </em>on the statements Warren made at the condemnation hearing. The judge considered numerous appellate decisions involving G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and concluded that Warren had met his burden of demonstrating that Dickey\u2019s claims against him were based on his petitioning activities and had no substantial basis other than or in addition to those activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">Next, the judge took up the question whether Dickey had met his burden of demonstrating, by a preponderance of the evidence, that Warren\u2019s exercise of his right to petition \u201cwas devoid of any reasonable factual support or any arguable basis in law <em>and . . . </em>caused actual injury to [Dickey]\u201d (emphasis added). G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H. The judge concluded that Dickey had failed to meet his burden of proof on the first of the two requisite conditions, even assuming that any inaccurate statement made by Warren at the hearing caused Dickey actual harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">In short, the judge concluded that Warren had met his burden of proof while Dickey had not.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">4. <em>Discussion. </em>We take up Dickey\u2019s many and somewhat diffuse arguments to determine whether the judge\u2019s allowance of Warren\u2019s special motion to dismiss was based on an abuse of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>discretion or other error of law. See <em>Kobrin </em>v. <em>Gastfriend, </em>443 Mass. 327, 330-331 (2005). In so doing, we are mindful of the burden-shifting procedure most recently repeated in <em>Benoit </em>v. <em>Frederickson, </em>454 Mass. 148, 152-153 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">a. <em>Warren\u2019s burden of proof </em>Our analysis begins with the judge\u2019s determination that Warren met his burden of demonstrating that Dickey\u2019s claims against him were based on his \u201cpetitioning activities alone and have no substantial basis other than or in addition to the petitioning activities.\u201d <em>Benoit </em>v. <em>Frederickson, supra </em>at 152, quoting from <em>Wenger </em>v. <em>Aceto, </em>451 Mass. 1, 5 (2008). Based on the provisions of the final paragraph of G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H, see part 2, <em>supra, </em>and the materials before us, we see no error in the judge\u2019s conclusion that Warren\u2019s statements \u201cwere . . . , at a minimum, made at a \u2018governmental proceeding.\u2019 \u201d Dickey\u2019s argument to the contrary is refuted by the notice of decision from the Boston inspectional services department. It bears the seal of the city of Boston as well as the name of the mayor, and provides ample support for the conclusion that Warren\u2019s remarks were made during a \u201cgovernmental proceeding.\u201d See generally 105 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 410.831.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">Citing <em>Kobrin </em>v. <em>Gastfriend, </em>443 Mass. at 331-332, Dickey further argues that because Warren did not reside at 97 Mount Ida Road on October 7, 2003, the date of the hearing, his statements were not made for purposes of seeking redress and, therefore, were not protected petitioning activity. He contends that Warren \u201cwas acting only as a witness for the City of Boston.\u201d Dickey misreads <em>Kobrin.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">In <em>Kobrin, </em>the defendant had been retained as an expert by the Board of Registration in Medicine to assist in its investigation of the plaintiff\u2019s medical practices. The board ultimately dismissed the charges against the plaintiff, and he then sued the defendant based on statements the defendant had made in the form of an affidavit submitted to the board. When the defendant sought the shelter of G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H, the plaintiff argued that the defendant had not been \u201cpetitioning the government, but rather was providing paid assistance to the government in its case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 330. The court denied the defendant the protection afforded by \u00a7 59H and held that \u00a7 59H \u201cis designed to protect overtures to the government by parties petitioning in their status <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>as citizens. It is not intended to apply to those performing services for the government as contractors.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 332. Dickey\u2019s misguided reading of <em>Kobrin </em>would make every tenant of the building on September 16, 2003, a potential defendant in a defamation action had he or she chosen to testify at the condemnation hearing. Warren was a party affected by the condemnation order. See 105 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 410.851 (1997) (requiring that all \u201caffected parties\u201d be given notice of \u201cthe date, time and place of the hearing\u201d and providing that \u201caffected parties shall include the occupants of all affected premises\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">Warren was also required to demonstrate that Dickey\u2019s claims against him \u201chave no substantial basis other than or in addition to his petitioning activities,\u201d <em>Benoit </em>v. <em>Frederickson, </em>454 Mass. at 152, quoting from <em>Duracraft Corp. </em>v. <em>Holmes Prod. Corp., </em>427 Mass. 156, 167-168 (1998). The judge stated in his memorandum of decision that \u201cDickey\u2019s complaint makes clear that the sole basis for his defamation claim is Warren\u2019s alleged false testimony at the condemnation hearing,\u201d and although Dickey failed to include a copy of his defamation complaint in the record appendix, his claims are apparent from the materials that were included as well as from the arguments set out in his brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">We see no abuse of discretion or other error of law in the judge\u2019s conclusion that Warren met his burden of showing that Dickey\u2019s claims against him were based on his petitioning activity alone and had no substantial basis other than or in addition to that activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">b. <em>Dickey\u2019s burden of proof. </em>Once Warren satisfied his burden of proof, the burden shifted to Dickey to show by a preponderance of the evidence that Warren\u2019s \u201cpetitioning activities were devoid of any reasonable factual support or any arguable basis in law and that the petitioning activities caused [Dickey] actual harm.\u201d <em>Benoit </em>v. <em>Frederickson, supra </em>at 153. The judge concluded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>that because Dickey admitted that \u201cthere were problems with the furnace in Warren\u2019s apartment . . . regardless of Warren\u2019s alleged inaccurate statement on the timing of his move,\u201d Dickey failed to meet his burden of showing that Warren\u2019s testimony at the condemnation hearing was, as required by G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H, \u201cdevoid of any factual support or any arguable basis in law.\u201d The judge\u2019s conclusion is supported by statements made by Dickey in his affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">Although the judge assumed for purposes of decision that Warren\u2019s act caused Dickey actual injury, he noted that \u201c[i]t is unclear, from the record before this court, how crucial Warren\u2019s testimony was in upholding the condemnation.\u201d We agree and further conclude that Dickey also failed to meet his burden of proof of showing that Warren\u2019s acts caused him any \u201cactual injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">Dickey sets out in his affidavit the various expenses he incurred as a result of the department\u2019s condemnation order. However, as shown by the department\u2019s decision, the condemnation of Dickey\u2019s building was based on the numerous violations of the State Sanitary Code observed by Kennedy during his inspection of the building on September 16, 2003. None of the cited violations that resulted in the condemnation of the building concerned the furnace.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">On the state of the record before us, we see no error in the judge\u2019s conclusion that while Warren had satisfied his burden of proof, Dickey had failed to meet his and that, consequently, Warren was entitled to the dismissal of Dickey\u2019s action against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b608-8\"> SLAPP is an acronym for Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b608-9\"> Neither we nor the judge have had the benefit of a transcript of the condemnation hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b609-8\"> Warren brought an action against Dickey to recover damages based on the substandard condition of the apartment he had rented.
