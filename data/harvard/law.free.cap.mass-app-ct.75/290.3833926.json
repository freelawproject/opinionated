They create two controlled purchases from him. In the first, they monitor his travel directly <em>from </em>the site of the purchase to his apartment. In the second, they follow his travel from the apartment directly <em>to </em>the site of the purchase. In neither instance did he stop at any intermediate location. In both instances, the undercover buyer reported that the suspect was carrying additional packaged drugs on his person. Our issue is whether these events and observations furnish sufficient information within the \u201cfour comers\u201d of a police affidavit for issuance of a warrant to search the apartment of the suspect.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\"><em>Procedural history. </em>On August 16, 2006, a grand jury returned indictments charging each of the defendants with three counts of unlawful possession of firearms and ammunition (in violation of G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10[7z][l]), one count of improper storage of a firearm (in violation of G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 131L[a]), one count of trafficking in cocaine (in violation of G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32E[6][2]), and one count of trafficking in cocaine within a school zone (in violation of G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7\u00a7 32A[a], 32J). The defendants filed separate motions to suppress evidence seized pursuant to a search warrant. A Superior Court judge denied the motions to suppress. The defendants moved for reconsideration. The judge allowed the motions for reconsideration, vacated the denial, and allowed suppression of the evidence. He based the suppression order upon the failure of the affidavit in support of the search warrant application to establish a nexus between the items sought and the apartment searched.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\"><em>Factual background. </em>On June 19, 2006, a clerk-magistrate of the Worcester Division of the District Court Department issued two search warrants, one for the defendant Llavar F. Hind\u2019s vehicle and one for his apartment. The warrants authorized searches for cocaine, materials related to cocaine distribution, and any documents pertaining to occupancy of the apartment or the vehicle. Officers executed the warrants on the following day. Inside the apartment, they found and seized cocaine, $1,812 in currency, firearms, ammunition, three cellular telephones, materials related to cocaine distribution, and papers apparently belonging to each of the three defendants. The officers did not seize anything from Hind\u2019s vehicle, and the defendants\u2019 motions did not address the search of the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>Our examination of a search warrant application for probable cause \u201calways begins and ends with the \u2018four corners of the affidavit.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. O\u2019Day, 440 Mass. 296, 297 (2003), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Villella, </em>39 Mass. App. Ct. 426, 428 (1995). Worcester police Officer Michael Ryder signed the affidavit in support of the application. It contains the following information. Officer Ryder had been a police officer for nineteen years at the time of the application. For the preceding three years, he had worked in the vice unit in a plain-clothed investigative capacity. He had participated in numerous narcotics investigations and arrests and had experience in surveillance, undercover purchases of narcotics, and the execution of search warrants. He had also completed an eighty-hour course in drug enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">In the two weeks prior to the application for the warrant, Ryder had conversed with a confidential informant (Cl) about the sale of unlawful narcotics in Worcester. He had met Cl approximately two weeks prior to the application. He knew the true identity and home address of Cl, but he did not identify Cl in the affidavit. Approximately one month before the warrant application, Cl had provided information to Worcester police which resulted in issuance of a search warrant. Through execution of that warrant, police seized cocaine and materials related to cocaine distribution and arrested the target of the warrant. A charge of possession of a class B substance with intent to distribute was pending against the target of that warrant at the time of Officer Ryder\u2019s affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">Cl told Ryder that he<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> had purchased cocaine on numerous occasions from a man whom he knew as \u201cBig.\u201d Cl described Big as an approximately twenty-three year old African American male, six feet, two inches tall, with a large build and short, black hair. Cl stated that he had used a certain telephone number to reach Big, and gave the number to Officer Ryder. On numerous occasions, Cl and Big, through telephone conversations, had arranged to meet at a location where Cl had previously purchased cocaine from Big. Cl stated also that Big drove a red Ford Explorer vehicle. Cl provided the vehicle\u2019s registration number to Ryder. Through a search of records of the registry of motor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>vehicles, Officer Ryder learned that Hind was the registered owner of the vehicle. The registry listed Hind\u2019s address as 23 Shelby Street, apartment 2, in Worcester. Further searches of the registry\u2019s records and Worcester police department files revealed that Hind had an active Massachusetts driver\u2019s license bearing the same address, and that he was a twenty-three year old African American male, six feet, three inches tall and weighing 250 pounds.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">On or about June 9, 2006 (eleven days prior to execution of the warrant), Officer Ryder and Cl conducted a controlled purchase of cocaine from Big. Prior to the purchase, Ryder showed Cl a picture of Hind, and Cl identified Hind as Big. In Ryder\u2019s presence, Cl called the telephone number which he had previously provided to Ryder. Cl spoke to Big and arranged to meet him at a specified location. At that location, Ryder and other members of the vice unit observed a red Ford Explorer approach CL The Explorer\u2019s license plate matched the previously provided registration number. The Explorer drove away after a brief meeting with CI. Members of the vice unit followed the Explorer to 23 Shelby Street. They observed a large, African American male, approximately six feet, three inches tall, get out of the vehicle and enter 23 Shelby Street.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">After the purchase, Officer Ryder observed CI until they were able to reconvene at a prearranged location. CI gave a quantity of cocaine to the officer and stated that he had purchased the cocaine from Hind. Ryder intentionally withheld the quantity of cocaine purchased to protect Cl\u2019s identity. CI stated that Hind had on his person an additional amount of cocaine packaged for sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">Less than two days prior to the warrant application (and three days prior to execution of the warrant), Ryder and CI met again and conducted another controlled purchase of cocaine from Hind. CI followed the same procedure to arrange the purchase. In Officer Ryder\u2019s presence, he called Big. As CI called Big, a member of the vice unit, Officer Jon Kachadoorian, observed 23 Shelby Street. Shortly after Cl\u2019s call, Kachadoorian saw a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>man whose appearance matched that of Hind through the window of apartment 2 at 23 Shelby Street. He watched as this man left the building, entered the red Ford Explorer bearing the previously provided registration number, and drove away. Members of the vice unit followed the Explorer to the prearranged location, where the vehicle briefly met CL After the meeting, officers followed the Explorer for a short time until they lost it in traffic.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">Officer Ryder observed Cl\u2019s uninterrupted drive to the location of the purchase, his meeting with the Ford Explorer, and his drive from the site of the purchase to a predetermined meeting point. As before, Cl gave a quantity of cocaine to Officer Ryder and stated that he had purchased the cocaine from Hind. Also as before, Cl stated that Hind had on his person an additional amount of cocaine packaged for sale. Once again in his affidavit, Officer Ryder intentionally withheld the quantity of cocaine purchased.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>Neither the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution nor art. 14 of the Declaration of Rights of the Massachusetts Constitution defines \u201cprobable cause.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Day, </em>440 Mass. 296, 300 (2003). \u201cTo establish probable cause to obtain a search warrant, the affidavit must \u2018contain enough information for the issuing magistrate to determine that the items sought are related to the criminal activity under investigation, and that they may reasonably be expected to be located in the place to be searched.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid., </em>quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cefalo, </em>381 Mass. 319, 328 (1980). \u201cIn drag cases such as the present one, . . . \u2018[t]he affidavit need not convince the magistrate beyond a reasonable doubt, but must provide a substantial basis for concluding that [drugs or instrumentalities of the drug trade] will be found on the specified premises.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pina, </em>453 Mass. 438, 440 (2009), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Donahue, </em>430 Mass. 710, 712 (2000). \u201cThe affidavit should be read in an ordinary, common-sense manner, without hypertechnical analysis.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cruz, </em>430 Mass. 838, 840 (2000), citing <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ventresca, </em>380 U.S. 102, 109 (1965). Where the affiant relies on information from a confidential informant to provide probable cause, \u201cart. 14 requires that the affidavit apprise the magistrate of some facts and circumstances showing both (1) the basis of the informant\u2019s knowledge, and (2) the credibility of the informant or the reli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>ability of his information.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Day, supra </em>at 301, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Blake, </em>413 Mass. 823, 827 (1992). See <em>Aguilar </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>378 U.S. 108, 110-115 (1964); <em>Spinelli </em>v. <em>United States, </em>393 U.S. 410, 412-419 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">1. <em>Reliability of informant. </em>First, the defendants argue that Officer Ryder\u2019s affidavit did not supply probable cause to search Hind\u2019s apartment because it did not demonstrate sufficiently Cl\u2019s basis of knowledge or his credibility. Some of the information in the affidavit came from police observations. These facts include: (i) Cl\u2019s use of a specified telephone number to contact Big; (ii) Hind\u2019s status as the registered owner of the Explorer; (iii) Hind\u2019s height, weight, birth date, and address as revealed through record checks; (iv) the brief meetings between Cl and the Explorer; (iv) Cl\u2019s acquisition of cocaine from an occupant of the Explorer; (v) the Explorer\u2019s travels to and from the controlled purchases; and (vi) Hind\u2019s presence in his apartment and subsequent entry into the Explorer shortly after Cl\u2019s call for the second purchase. The use of these factual elements in the probable cause determination does not depend on Cl\u2019s basis of knowledge and credibility. However, other facts crucial to the probable cause determination depend on Cl\u2019s status as a reliable informant. These are: (i) a history of numerous cocaine purchases by Cl from Hind through the method described by Cl; (ii) CFs identification of Hind as Big; (iii) CFs statements that Hind sold him the cocaine during each controlled purchase; and (iv) Cl\u2019s statement that Hind possessed additional quantities of cocaine packaged for sale during each controlled purchase.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">We conclude that Officer Ryder\u2019s affidavit demonstrated sufficiently CFs basis of knowledge. CFs descriptions of Big\u2019s physical appearance, vehicle, and method of operation were detailed enough to be \u201cconsistent with personal observation, not mere recitation of a casual rumor.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Day, </em>440 Mass. at 301, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Alfonso A., </em>438 Mass. 372, 374 (2003). The magistrate could conclude that Cl acquired his knowledge of Big and his operation through previous interactions with Big and not \u201cthrough the grapevine.\u201d The affidavit indicates that Cl based the following on personal observations: (i) his identification of Hind, (ii) his statements that Hind had sold him cocaine during the controlled purchases, and (iii) his statements that Hind had possessed additional cocaine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>packaged for sale during the controlled purchases. Cl\u2019s statements and his identification of Hind have the support of a sufficient basis of knowledge because he based them on his own observations. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Montanez, </em>410 Mass. 290, 300 (1991) (basis of knowledge requirement satisfied because \u201cinformants\u2019 knowledge was based on personal observations\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>49 Mass. App. Ct. 664, 668 (2000) (\u201cIt is well established that an informant\u2019s basis of knowledge may be satisfied simply by his or her personal observation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">We consider separately, however, whether the information supplied by Cl was credible. Officer Ryder\u2019s knowledge of Cl\u2019s identity and address weighs in favor of Cl\u2019s credibility. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Alfonso A., supra </em>at 375-376 (confidential informants known to police are more reliable than truly anonymous sources). In addition, approximately one month prior to the search warrant application, Cl had provided information to Worcester police which resulted in an arrest and the seizure of cocaine. At the time of the application, the charge which resulted from the arrest was still pending. Officer Ryder did not provide the name of that defendant or the docket number of the pending case. His affidavit stated only that police had confiscated five grams of cocaine, a digital scale, and packaging material. Ryder did not indicate whether he purposefully withheld that defendant\u2019s name or the case\u2019s docket number.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Despite omission of some of the details, Cl\u2019s provision of the information resulting in the arrest and seizure just one month prior to Officer Ryder\u2019s affidavit, together with Officer Ryder\u2019s knowledge of Cl\u2019s identity and address, indicates that Cl was a reliable and credible source of information. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perez-Baez, </em>410 Mass. 43, 45-46 &amp; n.2 (1991) (veracity of confidential informant demonstrated by affiant\u2019s statement that informant had provided information leading to arrests of named defendants and seizures of cocaine); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mejia, </em>411 Mass. 108, 113 (1991) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>(discussing holding of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perez-Baez, supra, </em>and noting that affiant\u2019s \u201callegation regarding seizure of narcotics\u201d allowed the magistrate to infer that the informant had previously told officers that narcotics were at a particular location and that officers had confirmed the informant\u2019s tip). Therefore the magistrate could use the information supplied by Cl to determine whether Officer Ryder\u2019s affidavit provided probable cause to search Hind\u2019s apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">2. <em>Nexus. </em>The defendants argue that Officer Ryder\u2019s affidavit did not sufficiently establish the necessary connection between cocaine distribution and Hind\u2019s apartment. Where police seek to search a residence for evidence of drug distribution, \u201cthere must be specific information in the affidavit, and reasonable inferences a magistrate may draw, to provide \u2018a sufficient nexus between the defendant\u2019s drug-selling activity and his residence to establish probable cause to search the residence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pina, </em>453 Mass. at 440-441, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Day, </em>440 Mass. at 304. \u201cThe connection between the items to be seized and the place to be searched does not have to be based on direct observations; it may be found by looking at the type of crime, nature of the items, the suspect\u2019s opportunity to conceal items, and inferences as to where the items are likely to be hidden.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Olivares, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 596, 600 (1991), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cinelli, </em>389 Mass. 197, 213, cert. denied, 484 U.S. 860 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">In addition to cocaine, the officers sought \u201c[a]ll materials, products, and equipment of any kind . . . used or intended for use, in . . . delivering . . . [or] distribution . . . [of] cocaine. All books, records, and documents . . . used or intended for use in violation of [the drug laws]. . . [and] [a]ll money used or intended for use, in the procurement and/or illegal distribution of cocaine, and any documents pertaining to the occupancy of [Hind\u2019s apartment].\u201d We conclude that Officer Ryder\u2019s affidavit provided probable cause to believe that the items sought were within Hind\u2019s apartment. The two controlled purchases, the officers\u2019 collective observations of Hind, and Cl\u2019s statements established the \u201csubstantial basis\u201d necessary for a determination of probable cause. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pina, </em>453 Mass. at 440 (affidavit \u201cmust provide a substantial basis for\u201d conclusion that officers will find items sought in specified premises).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>The facts of this case bear a resemblance to those of both <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>57 Mass. App. Ct. 907 (2003), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pina, supra. </em>In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>57 Mass. App. Ct. at 908-909, we reversed the denial of a motion to suppress in circumstances in which police had observed the defendant drive from his home to a drug sale on one occasion and, on another occasion, return to his home from a drug sale. We concluded that \u201cthe observations by the police of the defendant driving, either to or from his home, without more, established no connection between his home and the controlled buys.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 908.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pina, </em>453 Mass.at 442-443, the Supreme Judicial Court affirmed the allowance of a motion to suppress in an instance in which police had applied for a search warrant three days after observing the defendant drive from his apartment to a controlled purchase. The court cited the analysis of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, supra, </em>and agreed with it. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pina, supra </em>at 441. It noted that \u201c[t]he only particularized information contained in the affidavit connecting the defendant\u2019s observed drug activity with the apartment in which he lived was a single observation of the defendant driving from the apartment to a location where he sold an unspecified quantity of cocaine to the informant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 441-442.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">The crucial factual elements distinguishing this case from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pina, supra, </em>and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, supra, </em>are Cl\u2019s two statements, made after each controlled purchase, that Hind had additional quantities of cocaine packaged for sale on his person. Cl\u2019s observation that Hind possessed more cocaine packaged for sale provided the additional evidence necessary to give the officers probable cause to believe that they would find cocaine in either Hind\u2019s Explorer or in his apartment. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hardy, </em>63 Mass. App. Ct. 210, 213 (2005) (\u201cAlthough the fact that an individual on one occasion drives directly from his residence to a drug transaction does not, by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>itself, establish probable cause to search his residence ... it may, <em>with additional evidence . . </em>. link a defendant\u2019s drug-selling activity to his residence\u201d) (emphasis supplied); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Luthy, </em>69 Mass. App. Ct. 102, 108 (2007) (affidavit established sufficient nexus between cocaine distribution and defendant\u2019s residence in circumstances in which defendant operated cocaine delivery service through use of cellular telephone, officers observed defendant leave residence prior to controlled purchase and return to it after, and affidavit contained informant\u2019s description of defendant\u2019s method of operation). Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chongarlides, </em>52 Mass. App. Ct. 366, 370 (2001) (where affidavit indicated defendant had used heroin three days earlier at another location, no probable cause to search for drugs at location that was allegedly defendant\u2019s residence); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Olivares, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. at 600-601 (no probable cause to search defendant\u2019s residence; affidavit described drag transaction at defendant\u2019s business).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">The presence of packaged inventory has multiple significance. Inventory requires storage. A residence is a far more secure storage site than an automobile. Packaged inventory also indicates enterprise. An enterprise requires instrumentalities and generates records. They are far more likely to be located in a residence than in an automobile. The value and readily fungible nature of cocaine packaged for sale make it unlikely that Hind would store his inventory in his vehicle. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Luthy, </em>69 Mass. App. Ct. at 107 (\u201cIt was a reasonable inference that the drugs were stored someplace other than the automobile, particularly given that [the defendant] was engaged in a drug distribution business, and the quantity of the drugs involved\u201d). Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Day, </em>440 Mass. at 303 (because defendant likely conducted frequent drug sales inside his home, \u201cit was unlikely that the defendant would keep so large a supply of drugs in the truck while at home\u201d). The lack of any observation of Hind carrying anything from the Explorer into his apartment, or vice versa, does not support a necessary inference that Hind left his inventory in the Explorer. The magistrate could have inferred that Hind kept the cocaine on his person. See <em>ibid, </em>(\u201cvaluable quantities of crack and powdered cocaine are transported and sold in small bags that can be concealed easily on one\u2019s person\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>The defendants\u2019 argument fails also because the affidavit provided probable cause to search Hind\u2019s apartment for the other items listed on the warrant application, in addition to cocaine. Officers were likely to find in Hind\u2019s apartment telephone records to tie Hind to the telephone number used by Cl and papers to substantiate Hind\u2019s ownership of the Explorer. The bills generated by Hind\u2019s use of his telephone would be valuable evidence because he used the telephone to arrange the cocaine sales. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Santiago, </em>66 Mass. App. Ct. 515, 522 n.16 (2006). There was also probable cause to believe that police would find records of Hind\u2019s cocaine distribution business. See <em>id. </em>at 522 (\u201cgiven the nature\u201d of the narcotics sales business, distributors surely keep records); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Luthy, </em>69 Mass. App. Ct. at 107 (where defendant received cellular telephone call at his residence to arrange narcotics sale, magistrate could have inferred that defendant kept records of his drug delivery business at his residence). Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>71 Mass. App. Ct. 665, 669 (2008) (where officers recorded serial numbers of money used in controlled purchases, magistrate had substantial basis to conclude \u201cmonies from the illegal sales were probably in the residence\u201d of the defendants). Here, the magistrate could infer that Hind kept business records and that the most likely storage place for them was his residence. The police observation of Hind\u2019s return to his residence after one of the controlled sales and the additional observation of his departure from his residence shortly after Cl placed an order for cocaine by telephone provided probable cause to search the residence for records of a cocaine distribution business.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\"><em>Conclusion. </em>For the foregoing reasons we conclude that Officer Ryder\u2019s affidavit in support of the search warrant applica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>tion provided probable cause to search Hind\u2019s apartment for cocaine and other evidence of a cocaine distribution business. Police observations and Cl\u2019s statements established a necessary linkage between cocaine distribution and the apartment. We reverse the order allowing the defendants\u2019 motions to suppress evidence and remand the case to the Superior Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b314-7\"> In his affidavit, Officer Ryder deliberately withholds Cl\u2019s gender. For ease of reference, we refer to Cl as \u201che.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b315-8\"> Worcester police department records indicated also that, approximately eight months before the warrant application, the police had received a call for a reported heroin overdose at Hind\u2019s address. Authorities found an unconscious person in the apartment\u2019s bathroom and transported her to a local hospital for treatment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b318-6\"> Ryder may have done so to protect Cl\u2019s identity. However, the omission of such information permits the magistrate to make a subtraction from the supporting information of the affidavit. If the circumstances do not threaten exposure of the confidential informant, the better practice is to include identification of the prior prosecution. If they do, the affidavit should explain the risk. In this instance, the subsequent observation of the controlled purchases superseded any deficit caused by the omission.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b320-6\"> The judge in this case first denied the defendants\u2019 motions to suppress. He conscientiously reconsidered that ruling in light of the <em>Smith </em>decision and allowed the motion. The <em>Smith </em>case presents a genetically similar surveillance of a suspect engaged in controlled purchases. On closer inspection of the present record (a task far easier by appellate review than by original ruling), an important distinction becomes visible: the present suspect\u2019s possession of inventory at the scenes of the controlled purchases.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b322-6\"> We note that \u201c[e]ven if the warrant were considered invalid as to the search for drags, ... it does not follow that the drugs and other items seized need be suppressed.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>71 Mass. App. Ct. at 670. If officers seized the items in \u201cplain view \u2018within the scope and intensity of the search permitted under the terms of the valid portions of the warrant,\u2019 . . . they need not be suppressed.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lett, </em>393 Mass. 141, 147 (1984). In other words, if the warrant were valid as to the noncocaine evidence of cocaine distribution, and if the officers found the cocaine in plain view while searching for the other evidence, suppression of the cocaine would not be required.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
