Because of the necessary layoffs, the sheriff informed the union that some remaining employees would be assigned to different shifts with attendant changes in scheduled days off and vacations. The union has consistently taken the position that these changes were subject to arbitration under the collective bargaining agreement (agreement). The sheriff, maintaining that the agreement precluded arbitration of shift changes and scheduled days off, brought a complaint in the Superior Court seeking a permanent stay of arbitration pursuant to G. L. c. 150C, \u00a7 <em>2(b).</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>Treating the union\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings as one for summary judgment, the judge ruled in favor of the sheriff, see Mass.R.Civ.P. 56(c), 365 Mass. 824 (1974), and issued a judgment ordering a stay of arbitration on the union\u2019s grievance. Based upon our reading of the agreement as a whole, we conclude that the relevant and controlling terms of the agreement fail to provide positive assurance that the sheriff did not agree to arbitrate the union\u2019s grievance. Consequently, we remand the matter to the Superior Court for entry of a judgment requiring arbitration on the union\u2019s grievance.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\">1. <em>The grievance. </em>As alleged by the union on the requisite grievance form, the sheriff violated \u201cArticle X, section 9(A), but not limited [thereto],\u201d of the agreement in that employees\u2019 \u201cdays off [were] changed without reason or regard to [the agreement].\u201d Article X is entitled \u201cHOURS OF WORK AND OVERTIME.\u201d Section 9 is labeled \u201cDays-off Selection,\u201d and subsection A provides that selections are to be made on the basis of an employee\u2019s \u201cseniority date with the Suffolk County Sheriff\u2019s Department.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">2. <em>The judge\u2019s decision. </em>In granting summary judgment to the sheriff, the judge concluded that there were no material facts in dispute and that the matter in controversy involved only a question of law. As identified in his detailed memorandum of decision, the question of law before him, and now before us on plenary review, see <em>Bank </em>v. <em>Thermo Elemental Inc., </em>451 Mass. 638, 648 (2008), is whether the union\u2019s grievance presents a question of substantive rather than procedural arbitrability. As the judge acknowledged, a question of substantive arbitrability addresses \u201cwhether the parties agreed to submit the subject matter of a claim to arbitration.\u201d See <em>Howsam </em>v. <em>Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., </em>537 U.S. 79, 84 (2002) (\u201ca disagreement about whether an arbitration clause in a concededly binding contract applies to a particular type of controversy is for the court\u201d). Judges determine arbitrability, not arbitrators whose role is to decide procedural issues and then to rule on the merits of a grievance determined to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>be arbitrable.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See <em>AT&amp;T Technologies, Inc. </em>v. <em>Communications Wkrs., </em>475 U.S. 643, 651 (1986); <em>Green Tree Financial Corp. </em>v. <em>Bazzle, </em>539 U.S. 444, 452 (2003); <em>Massachusetts Hy. Dept. </em>v. <em>Perini Corp., </em>444 Mass. 366, 374 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">In concluding that the union\u2019s grievance brought under article X, \u00a7 9, was not arbitrable, the judge relied upon article X, \u00a7 9G, of the agreement which provides in full:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-6\">\u201cThe Union agrees that disputes arising out of the <em>implementation </em>of this section are not subject to the grievance and arbitration procedure of the parties\u2019 collective bargaining agreement\u201d (emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">The judge concluded that as used in \u00a7 9G, the word \u201c \u2018implementation\u2019 . . . can be understood only to refer to ongoing acts of implementation.\u201d In reaching that conclusion, the judge focused on \u00a7 9F which speaks to the scheduling rights of those employees who \u201crequest a shift change, who transfer into the bargaining unit, or who (as in this case) are transferred \u2018to accommodate the operating needs of the institution.\u2019 \u201d He reasoned that \u201c[bjecause \u00a7 9(F) speaks to changing circumstances, it would make no sense if [the word] \u2018implementation\u2019 were understood to mean a one-time event.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">3. <em>Discussion. </em>The question before us, whether the union\u2019s grievance is arbitrable, turns on a matter of contract interpretation which\" is to be resolved by reading and construing the whole contract \u201cin a reasonable and practical way, consistent with its language, background, and purpose.\u201d <em>USM Corp. </em>v. <em>Arthur D. Little Sys., Inc., </em>28 Mass. App. Ct. 108, 116 (1989), and cases therein cited. See <em>Royal-Globe Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Craven, </em>411 Mass. 629, 632 (1992). In construing the parties\u2019 agreement, we also look to the four bedrock principles of Federal arbitration law accepted in this Commonwealth as applicable in disputes as to whether a grievance is arbitrable. See <em>AT&amp;T Technologies, Inc. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>v. <em>Communications Wkrs., </em>475 U.S. at 648; <em>Local No. 1710, Intl. Assn. of Fire Fighters </em>v. <em>Chicopee, </em>430 Mass. 417, 420-421 (1999); <em>Massachusetts Hy. Dept. </em>v. <em>Perini Corp., </em>444 Mass. at 374. Those principles are: (1) \u201ca party cannot be forced to submit to arbitration [a] dispute which he has not agreed so to submit\u201d; (2) whether an agreement presents a duty to arbitrate is a question to be resolved by a judge; (3) when determining whether the parties have agreed to submit a specific grievance to arbitration, a judge is not to rule on the merits of the grievance; and (4) there is a presumption of arbitrability, that is, \u201c[a]n order to arbitrate the particular grievance should not be denied unless it may be said with positive assurance that the arbitration clause is not susceptible of an interpretation that covers the asserted dispute.\u201d <em>Local No. 1710, Intl. Assn. of Fire Fighters </em>v. <em>Chicopee, supra </em>at 421, quoting from <em>AT&amp;T Technologies, Inc., </em>475 U.S. at 648, 650.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">Because the judge found \u201cpositive assurance\" in article X, \u00a7 9G, that the union and the sheriff did not intend to arbitrate the present grievance or any other grievance brought under \u00a7 9, he determined that the union was not entitled to the presumption of arbitrability. See <em>Local No. 1710, Intl. Assn. of Fire Fighters </em>v. <em>Chicopee, </em>430 Mass. at 421, quoting from <em>AT&amp;T Technologies, Inc. </em>v. <em>Communications Wkrs., </em>475 U.S. at 650. Our reading of the whole agreement, see <em>Massachusetts Mun. Wholesale Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>Springfield, </em>411 Mass. 39, 45-46 (1991); <em>Royal-Globe Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Craven, </em>411 Mass. at 632; <em>USM Corp. </em>v. <em>Arthur D. Little Sys., Inc., </em>28 Mass. App. Ct. at 116, leads us to conclude that the sheriff failed to overcome the presumption of arbitrability to which the union was entitled. As held in <em>AT&amp;T Technologies, Inc. </em>v. <em>Communications Wkrs., supra, </em>any doubts as to the question of substantive arbitrability are to be resolved in favor of allowing arbitration. Courts have held that \u201c[the] presumption is successfully rebutted only if the party resisting arbitration shows either (1) the existence of an express provision excluding the grievance from arbitration or (2) the \u2018most forceful evidence\u2019 of a purpose to exclude the claim from arbitration.\u201d <em>Paper, Allied-Industrial, Chem. &amp; Energy Wkrs. Intl. Union Local No. 4-2001 </em>v. <em>ExxonMobil Ref. &amp; Supply Co., </em>449 F.3d 616, 620 (5th Cir. 2006), quoting from <em>Communications Wkrs. of Am. </em>v. <em>Southwestern Bell Tel. Co., </em>415 F.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>35, 39 (1969). Article V, \u00a7 1, of the agreement provides the sheriff with broad managerial powers. That section reads in full:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-5\">\u201cSubject only to the express provisions of this Agreement, the [sheriff] shall not be deemed to be limited in any way by this Agreement in the performance of the regular and customary functions of municipal management and shall have complete authority and supervision of the Suffolk County House of Correction .... The [sheriff] reserves and retains all common law, statutory and inherent rights including, without limitation the exclusive right of the [s]heriff... to issue rules and regulations and from time to time change, alter and add to such rules, governing all department operations and the conduct of Suffolk County House of Correction employees.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">However, not every exercise of these broad managerial powers is exempt from arbitration. Article VII, entitled \u201cGRIEVANCE PROCEDURE,\u201d states in \u00a7 1 that \u201c[o]nly matters involving the question whether the [sheriff] is complying with the express provisions of this Agreement shall constitute [a] grievancef].\u201d As earlier related in part 1, <em>supra, </em>the union specified on the required grievance form, \u201cOfficers days off [were] changed without Reason or Regard to [article X, \u00a7 9A, of the agreement].\u201d That allegation was sufficient to trigger the grievance procedures set out in article VII, \u00a7\u00a7 2A-2C (steps one through three), with the sheriff successfully arguing at each level that the grievance was not arbitrable and refusing to proceed to article VII, \u00a7 26, step three, arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">Another example of a limitation on the sheriff\u2019s managerial powers is contained in article VI, entitled \u201cDISCIPLINE AND DISCHARGE.\u201d Sections 2 and 3 of that article allow for arbitration in the circumstance therein recited.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It is also apparent from the agreement that as used in article XXII, an article concerning \u201cDRUG TESTING,\u201d that the word \u201cimplementation\u201d is used in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>reference to what could be understood to mean a one-time only occurrence.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">On the other hand, article XXI, entitled \u201cPROBATION AND PROMOTION,\u201d provides clear demonstration that the parties to the agreement knew how to exclude a managerial decision from arbitration in clear and unequivocal terms. Section 9 of article XXI reads in full:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-6\">\u201cPromotional decisions <em>shall not </em>be subject to challenge under the grievance and arbitration procedure of the Agreement, except in those instances where the Sheriff has exercised his right to remove a person from the promotion list\u201d (emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">In considering the entire agreement rather than limiting our focus to article X, \u00a7 9, we found no \u201cpositive assurance\u201d because the agreement provides some support to the positions of the union and the sheriff. Consequently, we conclude that the union was entitled to the \u201cpresumption of arbitrability.\u201d See <em>AT&amp;T Technologies, Inc. </em>v. <em>Communications Wkrs., </em>475 U.S. at 650; <em>Paper, Allied-Industrial, Chem. &amp; Energy Wkrs. Intl. Union Local No. 4-2001 </em>v. <em>ExxonMobil Ref. &amp; Supply Co., </em>449 F.3d 620, and cases therein cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">4. <em>Conclusion. </em>It follows from what we have said that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>judgment of the Superior Court is reversed. The matter is remanded to the Superior Court for the entry of a new judgment granting the union\u2019s motion for summary judgment, vacating the order staying arbitration, and ordering that the matter be remanded to the arbitrator for resolution of the union\u2019s arbitrable grievance brought under article X, \u00a7 9A.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b362-14\"> The arbitrator retained jurisdiction of the union\u2019s grievance pending the outcome of the sheriffs complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b363-6\"> Article X, \u00a7 9.A., reads as follows: \u201cEmployees of each shift (6:45 AM to 3:15 PM, 2:45 PM to 11:15PM, and 10:45 PM to 7:15 AM) shall select their scheduled days-off based upon their seniority date with the Suffolk County Sheriff\u2019s Department as defined by this Agreement. These selections shall only be made after the shift selection process has concluded.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b364-9\"> Procedural arbitrability comprehends questions such as allegations of waiver, delay, failure to comply with time limits, notice, laches, estoppel, questions that the parties would likely expect an arbitrator to decide as a gateway matter. See <em>Massachusetts Hy. Dept. </em>v. <em>Perini Corp., </em>444 Mass. 366, 377 (2005). Only when arbitration clauses explicitly exclude such gateway procedural disputes will a judge decide those procedural issues. <em>Id. </em>at 373 n.10, 376 n.ll. Both parties now agree that the issue here is substantive.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b366-8\"> Article VI, \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3, pertain to an employee\u2019s right to arbitration on grievances concerning matters relating to an employee\u2019s discipline or discharge.

When an employee who is eligible to appeal his grievance under Chapter 135 of the Acts of 1960 [\u2018An Act Protecting Certain Officers and Employees in the Suffolk County Jail Against Arbitrary Removal\u2019] or otherwise under the preceding sentence [i.e., the retirement law or any other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>statutory appeal procedure] elects to proceed under the grievance and arbitration procedure with the Union\u2019s approval, such dispute may be processed under the contract grievance and arbitration procedure, in which case the contract grievance and arbitration procedure shall be the exclusive procedure for resolving such grievance in accordance with G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-12\">\u201cSection 3.
