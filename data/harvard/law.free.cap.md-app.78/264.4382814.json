The gravamen of all three actions, which were combined in one complaint, was that Mr. Matta took, tried to take, or communicated a desire to take certain sexual liberties with the complaining students. Each child sought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>compensatory damages of $250,000 and punitive damages of $500,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">Md.Educ.Code Ann. \u00a7 4-105 provides, in relevant part, that a county board of education \u201cshall carry comprehensive liability insurance to protect the board and its agents and employees\u201d and that a board may fulfill that obligation by becoming \u201cself-insured for at least $100,000 for each occurrence under the rules and regulations adopted by the State Insurance Commissioner____\u201d If a board elects to self-insure, it must file the \u201cterms and conditions of the self-insurance\u201d with the State Insurance Commissioner. Those terms and conditions \u201cshall conform with the terms and conditions of comprehensive liability insurance policies available in the private market\u201d and are subject to the Commissioner\u2019s approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">Section 4-104(d)(l) of the Education article further requires, in relevant part, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0q\">\u201c[i]n any suit ... brought against a principal, teacher ... or other agent or employee of a county board by a parent or other claimant with respect to an action taken by the agent or employee, the board shall provide counsel for that individual if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-8\">(i) The action was taken in the performance of his duties, within the scope of his employment, and without malice; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-9\">(ii) The board determines that he was acting within his authorized official capacity in the incident.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b314-10\">The Prince George's County Board of Education is self-insured. Although it undertook to defend itself, the superintendent, and the principal in the suit filed by the students, the board declined to defend Matta or to provide him with counsel, apparently on the theory that the conduct charged to him was intentional and malicious rather than merely negligent, and thus was unauthorized and beyond the scope of his employment. Matta thereupon filed this declaratory judgment action against the board, the superintendent, the principal, and the three plaintiff-students, seeking a declara<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>tion that Matta \u201cwas an insured covered by the policy of self-insurance issued by the [board of education]\u201d and that the board owes Matta a defense in the tort action. No particular relief was requested against any of the other parties. With the complaint was a motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\">The board, the superintendent, and the principal (to whom we shall henceforth collectively refer as the board) filed an answer to the complaint and, eventually, a cross-motion for summary judgment. There were no exhibits or affidavits attached to the motions. After a brief hearing, the court granted the board\u2019s cross-motion and entered a judgment declaring that the board was not obligated to provide either a defense or insurance coverage for Mr. Matta. From that order, Mr. Matta has appealed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">Matta\u2019s argument is based principally on the rules laid down in <em>Brohawn v. Transamerica Ins. Co., </em>276 Md. 396, 347 A.2d 842 (1975). In that case, as the result of an altercation in which Brohawn allegedly struck Shaffer and Friend, Brohawn was sued for both assault and negligence. Brohawn was insured by Transamerica; the policy obliged Transamerica to defend \u201cany suit\u201d against Brohawn alleging bodily injury, even if the allegations of the suit \u201care groundless, false or fraudulent,\u201d but it specifically excluded from coverage acts committed by Brohawn \u201cwith intent to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>cause injury....\u201d Based in part on the allegations in the lawsuit by Shaffer and Friend and in part on the fact that Brohawn had pled guilty to a charge of assault flowing from the incident, Transamerica denied coverage and filed an action, prior to resolution of the tort case, seeking a declaratory judgment that it was not obliged to defend or indemnify Brohawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">The Court of Appeals addressed two issues: (1) was a declaratory judgment action, in advance of a resolution of the tort case,, an appropriate way to resolve the coverage dispute and (2) was there coverage?</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">The answer to the first question, the Court held, depended on whether the coverage question was \u201cindependent and separable from the claims asserted in [the] pending suit\u201d by the injured party. 276 Md. at 405, 347 A.2d 842. Where, for example, the asserted lack of coverage arises from the insured\u2019s failure to pay premiums on the policy or \u201cto comply with contract provisions such as the cooperation or notification clause,\u201d a declaratory judgment prior to trial of the tort case \u201cwould ordinarily be appropriate and should be granted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>But where the coverage issue hinges on questions \u201cwhich would be fully decided in pending tort actions,\u201d such a proceeding is not appropriate. <em>Id. </em>at 405-06, 347 A.2d 842.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">As to the second question, the court opined, at 407-08, 347 A.2d 842:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-7\">\u201cThe obligation of an insurer to defend its insured under a contract provision such as here involved is determined by the allegations in the tort actions. If the plaintiffs in the tort suits allege a claim covered by the policy, the insurer has a duty to defend. Even if a tort plaintiff does not allege facts which clearly bring the claim within or without the policy coverage, the insurer still must defend if there is a <em>potentiality </em>that the claim could be covered by the policy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">(Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b316-9\">Because the tort action contained a claim of negligence and negligence was covered under the policy, the Court held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>that the insurer had a duty to defend, even if the negligence claim was \u201cgroundless, false or fraudulent,\u201d for that is what the contract provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">Matta seeks the same conclusion here. He urges that the tort action alleges negligence on his part and that there is at least a potentiality of coverage, even if the averment of negligence is \u201cgroundless, false or fraudulent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">There is a significant flaw in Matta\u2019s argument. In <em>Brohawn, </em>and in the line of cases following <em>Brohawn, </em>the Court was construing an insurance policy \u2014 a contract containing specific language delineating the insurer\u2019s obligations. Throughout the <em>Brohawn </em>Opinion, the Court made clear that the issue, in terms of coverage, arose from the insurer\u2019s \u201ccontractual obligation\u201d or the insured\u2019s \u201ccontractual right.\u201d <em>See also St. Paul Fire &amp; Mar. Ins. v. Pryseski, </em>292 Md. 187, 193, 438 A.2d 282 (1981); <em>cf. Continental Casualty v. Board of Educ., </em>302 Md. 516, 489 A.2d 536 (1985); <em>Allstate Ins. Co. v. Atwood, </em>71 Md.App. 107, 523 A.2d 1066, <em>cert. qranted </em>310 Md. 274, 528 A.2d 1286 (1987); <em>Harpy v. Nationwide Mutual Fire Ins., </em>76 Md.App. 474, 545 A.2d 718 (1988). There is no contract here. Whatever obligation the board has and, conversely, whatever right Matta has, must be drawn initially from the statute\u2014 \u00a7\u00a7 4-104 and 4-105 \u2014 and then from the terms of the self-insurance. Although the analytical framework of <em>Brohawn </em>remains applicable \u2014 i.e., an examination of the tort action complaint to see if there is a potentiality of coverage \u2014 that potentiality must be drawn from the terms of the self-insurance authorized by the statute, not from the <em>Brohawn </em>Court\u2019s construction of the Transamerica insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">We made this same point in <em>Washington Transit Authority v. Bullock, </em>68 Md.App. 20, 509 A.2d 1217, <em>cert. denied </em>308 Md. 237, 238 (1986). There too we were dealing with a public entity that, under statutory authorization, had self-insured. And there, as here, although the statute set forth certain standards for the self-insurance, the record was barren as to what exactly the entity undertook to insure. Because there was no evidence as to what coverage was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>afforded by the self-insurance, we concluded that the case could not properly be decided on that record. We have somewhat the same problem here.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">As we indicated earlier, \u00a7 4-105(c) requires self-insurance to be in a minimum of $100,000 \u201cunder the rules and regulations adopted by the Insurance Commissioner.\u201d The board must file with the Commissioner the \u201cterms and conditions of the self-insurance.\u201d Those terms and conditions are subject to the approval of the Commissioner and must \u201cconform with the terms and conditions of comprehensive liability insurance policies available in the private market.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">The record before the circuit court and before us does not contain (1) the rules and regulations of the Commissioner, (2) the terms and conditions of the self-insurance, (3) any indication of whether those terms and conditions were approved by the Commissioner, or (4) the terms and conditions of comprehensive liability policies available in the private market.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, as in <em>Bullock, </em>we have no idea, and we refuse to speculate, as to what conduct was covered or excluded by the board\u2019s self-insurance. We therefore cannot tell whether the conduct charged to Matta is, or is not, potentially covered. As the moving party, the board had the burden under Md. Rule 2-501 of showing that there was no genuine dispute of material fact and that it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. On this record, it cannot be said to have met that burden. Summary judgment in anyone\u2019s favor on the issue of coverage was clearly inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>The issue of providing counsel involves different considerations. That duty arises from \u00a7 4-104(d) and hinges on whether the alleged conduct on Matta\u2019s part \u201cwas taken in the performance of his duties, within the scope of his employment, and without malice\u201d and whether \u201che was acting within his authorized official capacity in the incident.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Those standards represent the analog to the contractual obligations considered in <em>Brohawn, </em>and the averments in the tort action complaint can be examined in their light. Unlike the matter of coverage, therefore, the record does permit a review of this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">The relevant pleading, for purposes of this case, is the student-plaintiffs\u2019 third amended complaint. The actions pled by the plaintiff Flanagan were contained in Counts 1 (Battery), 2 (Assault), 3 (Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress), and 6 (Negligence). In Count 1, Ms. Flanagan alleged that, during the course of Matta\u2019s employment with the board, he failed to conform his conduct to acceptable standards by \u201cintentionally placing his hands upon her body against her will and without her consent in an offensive manner.\u201d In Count 2, she claimed that, in his capacity as an employee of the board, Matta threatened or attempted to commit a battery \u201cby an unlawful and offensive touching of the body of Plaintiff\u201d and that, on an earlier occasion, he had suggested to Ms. Flanagan \u201cthat she engage in an intimate relationship\u201d with him. In Count 3, Ms. Flanagan alleged that Matta had caused her emotional distress by \u201ccommenting personally upon the attractiveness of her and commenting offensively about [her] body ... and further by suggested that [she] become the girlfriend of the said Defendant ... and further suggesting that she joint [sic] him in sexual bedside activities.\u201d These acts, she claimed, were performed during the course of his employment and during his \u201ctenure and active work hours____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b320-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>Count 6 is the critical count with respect to Ms. Flanagan; it is the one captioned \u201cNegligence.\u201d Ms. Flanagan begins by incorporating' the averments in Counts 1-5 (although Counts 4 and 5 pertain to another plaintiff). She asserts that Matta owed a duty of care to her which he breached \u201cby making obscene and lewd remarks of a sexual nature and placing or attempting to place his hands on the person of the said Plaintiff.\u201d These acts, she alleged, \u201cwere vicious and aimed personally at the Plaintiff ... without any justification or excuse and knowing said conduct would cause problems to the minor child of tender years.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> They were committed, she continued, during the course of Mat-ta's employment with the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">Ms. Marshall\u2019s case comprised Counts 4 (Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress) and 7 (Negligence). In Count 4, she repeated essentially what Ms. Flanagan charged in Count 3 \u2014 that, during the course of his employment, Matta acted in an unlawful and outrageous manner by suggesting that Ms. Marshall become his \u201cgirlfriend\u201d and \u201cjoin him in sexual bedside activities.\u201d She incorporated those averments by reference in Count 7, where she added that Matta had breached a duty of care to her by \u201cmaking obscene and lewd remarks of a sexual nature to the person of the Plaintiff,\u201d inviting her to his home \u201cto engage in the consumption of Baccardi Rum and coke,\u201d and, on one occasion, touching her buttocks and grabbing \u201cthe long tail of her costume.\u201d These acts, she claimed, were \u201cvicious and aimed personally at [her] without any justification or excuse and knowing said conduct would cause problems to the minor child of tender years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">Ms. Sisk also claimed an intentional infliction of emotional distress (Count 5) and negligence (Count 8). Count 5 was essentially an iteration of Count 4 \u2014 \u201ccommenting personal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>ly\u201d on Ms. Sisk\u2019s attractiveness, \u201ccommenting offensively\u201d about her body, suggesting that she become his \u201cgirlfriend\u201d and \u201cthat she join him in sexual bedside activities.\u201d Those averments were also incorporated by reference into Count 8, where she claimed that Matta breached a duty to her \u201cby making obscene and lewd remarks of a sexual nature.\u201d As did Ms. Flanagan and Ms. Marshall, Ms. Sisk averred that these acts were \u201cvicious and aimed personally at [her] without any justification or excuse and knowing said conduct would cause problems to the minor child of tender years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">As to all of this conduct \u2014 whether specifically stated or incorporated by reference in the \u201cnegligence\u201d counts\u2014 the plaintiffs do allege that it was committed during and within the scope of Matta\u2019s employment. But there are two reasons why, we think, even those averments would not suffice to require the board to provide counsel to Matta. First, unlike the alternative pleading attempted in <em>Brohawn, </em>where the same conduct was alleged to be either intentional or negligent, Counts 6, 7, and 8 here, though nominally captioned \u201cNegligence,\u201d very clearly and unmistakably characterize the conduct not only as intentional but \u201cvicious,\u201d \u201caimed personally\u201d at the plaintiffs, and \u201cwithout any justification or excuse.\u201d That is tantamount to a claim of malice and it pervades the entire cause of action. Nowhere is there any suggestion that the conduct was merely negligent, that it was non-malicious. <em>Cf. Harpy v. Nationwide Mutual Fire Ins., supra, </em>76 Md.App. 474, 545 A.2d 718. Under \u00a7 4-104(d)(i), to entitle Matta to board-provided counsel, the conduct must be \u201cwithout malice.\u201d There is certainly no allegation that Matta\u2019s conduct was without malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">More importantly, the second condition stated in \u00a7 4-104(d) is that the board determine that Matta was acting \u201cwithin his authorized official capacity in the incident.\u201d Obviously, the board made no such determination. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>Nor, under the averments in the complaint, could it reasonably make such a determination. Although the board, the superintendent, and the principal were all charged with failing to exercise proper control and supervision of Matta, there is no allegation that any of them authorized Matta to engage in the conduct charged to him. Nor, in our judgment,.is it even potentially possible for any court or reasonable jury to conclude that teachers are \u201cauthorized\u201d to sexually abuse or harass their students.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">For these reasons, we find no error in that part of the judgment declaring that the board has no duty to provide counsel to Mr. Matta. If the General Assembly wants to require county boards of education to provide counsel for teachers or other employees who are accused of engaging in the deliberate and vicious sexual abuse of their students, it will have to say so more clearly.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">The issue of coverage, as we indicated, will depend on what the terms and conditions of the self-insurance are. We see no reason, under <em>Brohawn, </em>why that cannot properly be developed in this declaratory judgment proceeding. Although it may turn out, ultimately, to hinge on how the trier of fact resolves the tort action, that is not so clear at this juncture. <em>See also </em>Md.Educ.Code Ann. \u00a7 4-105.1(b) allowing the issue of whether a board employee acted within the scope of employment to be \u201clitigated separately.\u201d We shall therefore remand that aspect of the case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED IN PART AND VACATED IN PART; CASE REMANDED TO CIRCUIT COURT FOR PRINCE GEORGE\u2019S COUNTY FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS; KELLI M. FLANAGAN, STEPHANIE A. MARSHALL, AND LAURA A. SISK TO PAY THE COST OF THEIR BRIEF; BALANCE OF THE COSTS TO BE PAID ONE-HALF BY APPELLANT MATTA AND ONE-HALF BY APPELLEES, BOARD OF EDUCATION, COL-GAN, AND MURPHY.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b315-6\">. As noted, the three student-plaintiffs were named as additional defendants in this case. Although they were apparently served through their counsel, they filed no answer or other pleading and took no part in the proceedings below. Their attorney was present at the hearing on the motions for summary judgment, but he represented to the court that he was \"not involved\u201d and merely wanted to \"have somebody here to hear what goes on.\u201d Nevertheless, the students regard themselves as parties to this appeal and have filed an <em>appellees\u2019 </em>brief in which they join with Matta in urging that the board <em>does </em>owe Matta a defense and coverage. We have some considerable doubt whether, under the circumstances, they have any right to complain about the judgment entered below; certainly, they cannot properly cast themselves as appellees if they are supporting the position of appellant Matta. Their brief is improper, and we shall therefore strike it, at their expense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b318-6\">. Matta has gratuitously, and improperly, included in his record extract a copy of an \"NEA Educators Employment Liability Policy\u201d underwritten by Horace Mann Insurance Company. There is no indication that that policy has anything to do with this case. More importantly, the policy is not in the record and for that reason alone should not have been placed in the record extract. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 8-501(c) \u2014 \"The record extract shall contain all parts <em>of the record </em>that are reasonably necessary____\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b319-5\">. Whether the board has assumed any duty in its self-insurance beyond that imposed by \u00a7 4-104(d) is not before us. Matta has not claimed any such voluntarily assumed duty.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b320-6\">. Ms. Flanagan does not allege her actual age \u2014 only that she was a high school student. The other student-plaintiffs made the same allegation in their negligence actions.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
