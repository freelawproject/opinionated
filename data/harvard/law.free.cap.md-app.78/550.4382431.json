The Sugarloaf Citizens Association, Lynn Lipp, and Beverly Thomas (hereinafter referred to collectively as \u201cSugarloaf\u201d), appellants, filed an amended complaint against the County Council of Montgomery County and Michael Gudis, an individual county council member, in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County. This case is before us as a result of an order by the circuit court granting appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss the amended complaint. We affirm, although we do not reach the substantive issues decided by the lower court.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-9\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b600-10\">Sugarloaf\u2019s complaint alleges that Montgomery County Council Resolution 11-382, promulgated to implement an earlier vote to site a resource recovery facility (RRF) near Potomac Electric Power Company (\u201cPEPCO\u201d) property at Dickerson in Montgomery County, should be rendered void under section 19A-22(b) of the Montgomery County Code. According to Sugarloaf, the preliminary vote in the County Council to choose between two possible sites for the facility resulted in a 4-3 vote in favor of the Dickerson site. Gudis, who voted in favor of the Dickerson site, owns stock in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>PEPCO. Sugarloaf contends that such a siting decision will result in the county\u2019s purchase or lease of PEPCO property, as well as require the use of PEPCO railroad facilities and electrical power generated by PEPCO. Sugarloaf argues that Gudis\u2019 vote violated section 19A-7 of the Montgomery County Code because of a conflict of interest between Gudis\u2019 stock ownership of PEPCO and his position as a county councilmember.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\">The appellees launched a multi-faceted attack on Sugar-loaf\u2019s complaint, alleging that Sugarloaf had no standing to sue under section 19A-22(b), that Gudis voted pursuant to a valid waiver under section 19A-6, that Sugarloaf had not exhausted its administrative remedies, and that Gudis\u2019 vote, even if invalid, had no effect on the adoption of the challenged resolution. The circuit court granted the County Council\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint on the basis that the waiver issued by the Montgomery County Ethics Commission was valid. On appeal, appellees further argue that the appeal should be dismissed because the point is now moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">MOOTNESS</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">Appellees argue that Sugarloaf\u2019s appeal should be dismissed pursuant to Maryland Rule 8-602(a)(10) because the County Council subsequently voted 5-2 to approve a notice of intent to proceed with construction forwarded to it by the Northeast Maryland Waste Disposal Authority (NEA). The thrust of appellees\u2019 argument is that the 5-2 vote reaffirmed Council Resolution 11-382, and because \u201cGudis\u2019 vote is clearly no longer necessary to support the Council\u2019s decision to site the RRF at Dickerson,\u201d the issue is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">Without examining the validity of appellees\u2019 premise that an individual\u2019s vote rendered invalid due to a conflict of interest will not void the action taken unless that person\u2019s vote was a necessary ingredient to the majority vote to take such action, <em>see Murach v. Planning &amp; Zoning Comm\u2019n, </em>196 Conn. 192, 491 A.2d 1058 (1985); <em>Waikiki Resort Hotel </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number><em>v. City of Honolulu, </em>63 Haw. 222, 624 P.2d 1353 (1981); <em>Anderson v. City of Parsons, </em>209 Kan. 337, 496 P.2d 1333 (1972); <em>Singewald v. Minneapolis Gas Co., </em>274 Minn. 556, 142 N.W.2d 739 (1966), we hold that the issue has not been rendered moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">A moot question has been defined as one where \u201cthere is no longer an existing controversy between the parties, so that there is no longer any effective remedy which the court can provide.\u201d <em>City of College Park v. Cotter, </em>309 Md. 573, 580, 525 A.2d 1059 (1987); <em>Attorney General v. Anne Arundel County School Bus Contractors Ass\u2019n, </em>286 Md. 324, 327, 407 A.2d 749 (1979). The primary flaw in appellees\u2019 reasoning is their failure to consider that the vote on the notice of intent to begin building would be rendered a nullity if this court were to rule in Sugarloaf\u2019s favor as to the validity of Resolution 11-382. The Council\u2019s notice of intent vote to allow NEA to proceed with construction at Dickerson is wholly dependent on the vote siting the proposed RRF at Dickerson and the subsequent resolution. Further, the purposes of the two votes are different. Unlike the siting vote, the notice of intent vote was not intended to determine or redetermine siting for the resource recovery facility. The vote was merely a necessary subsequent procedural step towards implementation of the Council\u2019s plan pursuant to Resolution 11-382 to build an RRF at Dickerson.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We will not presume that the Council would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>subsequently proceed in the same manner and reach the same conclusions by the same vote if we were to declare the siting vote and, consequently, Resolution 11-382, void. <em>See Hayman v. St. Martin\u2019s Evangelical Lutheran Church, </em>227 Md. 338, 343, 176 A.2d 772 (1962). Therefore, Sugar-loafs contentions are clearly not rendered moot by the subsequent notice of intent vote.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\">\n<em>Standing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">Examining Sugarloaf s complaint, it is clear to us that the genesis for its cause of action is the Montgomery County Ethics Law.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In its complaint, Sugarloaf cites to section 19A-l-2(b) as its authority in seeking to have the siting vote and Resolution 11-382 (in part incorporating the siting vote) rendered void because of the alleged conflict of interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">The current Montgomery County Public Ethics Law was enacted in 1983 pursuant to chapter 513 of the Maryland Public Ethics Law, which required the local counties to adopt \u201csimilar\u201d conflict of interest provisions. <em>See </em>Md.Ann. Code art. 40A, \u00a7 6-101(a), (b) (1986). The provision upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>which Sugarloaf\u2019s standing for the present suit rests is \u00a7 19A-22. In pertinent part, \u00a7 19A-22 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-4\">Petition for injunctive or other relief; cease and desist orders; voiding official actions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-5\">(a) Upon direction by the commission or at the initiative of the county attorney, the county attorney may file a petition for injunction or any other appropriate relief in the circuit court for Montgomery County, or in any other court having proper venue, for the purpose of requiring compliance with the provisions of this chapter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-6\">(b) <em>In addition, the court </em>may issue an order to cease and desist from the violation, and <em>can void an official action taken by an official or employee with a conflict of interest </em>prohibited by this chapter when the action arose from or concerned the subject matter of the conflict and the legal action was brought within ninety (90) days of the occurrence of the official action, if the court deems voiding the action to be in the best of interest of the public.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-7\"><em>Id., </em>\u00a7 19A-22(a), (b) (emphasis added). Subsection (a) provides that the county attorney may file a petition for injunctive relief. Subsection (b) sets forth the remedies available to the court in addition to granting an injunction; one possible remedy is voiding the \u201cofficial action taken.\u201d Neither subsection expressly provides for a private cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">The question then becomes whether the Montgomery County Public Ethics Law, specifically \u00a7 19A-22(b), gives rise to an implied right of private action. Although our examination of Maryland case law reveals a dearth of concrete analysis in this regard, the issue has repeatedly arisen in the Supreme Court under various federal statutes. The primary focus in resolving such a question is the legislative intent. <em>Daily Income Fund, Inc. v. Fox, </em>464 U.S. 523, 535-36,104 S.Ct. 831, 838, 78 L.Ed.2d 645; <em>Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith v. Curran, </em>456 U.S. 353, 378, 102 S.Ct. 1825, 1839, 72 L.Ed.2d 182 (1982); <em>Middlesex County Sewerage Auth. v. National Sea Clammers Ass\u2019n, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>453 U.S. 1, 13, 101 S.Ct. 2615, 2623, 69 L.Ed.2d 435 (1981). In determining legislative intent, various factors are examined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-4\">including the legislative history and purposes of the statute, the identity of the class for whose particular benefit the statute was passed, the existence of express statutory remedies to serve the legislative purpose, and the traditional role of the states in affording the relief claimed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"A4H\"><em>Daily Income Fund, Inc., supra, </em>464 U.S. at 536, 104 S.Ct. at 838. We set out to examine these factors to ascertain the legislative intent behind \u00a7 19A-22(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">\n<em>Legislative History</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">As may be expected, the legislative history behind this county enactment is sketchy. Our examination reveals that the only discussion of whether the ethics law should contain a private cause of action came up in the context of \u00a7 19A-24. (Legislative Session, 7-2-82, p. 4010-11). That section provides that a county taxpayer may initiate an action on behalf of the county to recover the value of anything received by a person for violating the county ethics laws, provided that written demand is made to the county and it fails to initiate suit within sixty days thereafter. The remainder of the legislative history is silent in regard to implied private rights of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">Where the legislative history does not indicate any discussion whatsoever as to whether a statute gives rise to such a right, the fact that the ordinance is silent would weigh heavily against an intent by the council to create a private cause of action. <em>See Touche Ross &amp; Co. v. Redington, </em>442 U.S. 560, 576, 99 S.Ct. 2479, 2489, 61 L.Ed.2d 82 (1979), where the court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-8\">[T]he legislative history of the 1934 Act simply does not speak to the issue of private remedies under \u00a7 17(a). At least in such a case as this, the inquiry ends there: The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>question whether Congress, either expressly or by implication, intended to create a private right of action, has been definitely answered in the negative.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">Given the vast differences in legislative record-keeping between Congress and a municipal or local government, we hesitate to place such great weight on the fact that the legislative history available to us is silent as to whether the Montgomery County Council intended to create an implied private right of action. Thus, we examine the remaining factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">\n<em>Purpose</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">The pertinent provisions of the Montgomery County Ethics Law are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-7\">Sec. 19A-2. Legislative findings and statement of policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-8\">(a) The county council of Montgomery County, recognizing that our system of representative government is dependent in part upon the people maintaining the highest trust in their public officials and employees, finds and declares that the people have a right to be assured that the impartiality and independent judgment of public officials and employees will be maintained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-9\">(b) It is evident that this confidence and trust is eroded when the conduct of the business of Montgomery County is subject to improper influence and even the appearance of improper influence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-10\">(c) For the purpose of guarding against improper influence, the county council enacts this public ethics law to require public officials and employees to disclose their financial affairs and to set minimum standards for the conduct of county business.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b606-11\">Montgomery County, Md., Code \u00a7 19A-2(a)-(c)- It is plain that the policy behind the Ethics Law is to maintain the trust of the people, as a whole, in their public officials and employees by guarding against improper influence. The statutory scheme was not designed to protect any subgroup of the public, or to preserve or create individual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>rights. The Court of Appeals of Maryland has distinguished between such statutes and those that \u201cwere designed only to confer a general benefit on the public at large,\u201d <em>see Widgeon v. Eastern Shore Hosp. Center, </em>300 Md. 520, 536, 479 A.2d 921 (1984) (referring to prior cases regarding local safety ordinances), when determining whether direct private action is appropriate under a given statute. A statute regulating the ethical conduct of public employees is clearly one of the latter types, enacted for the purpose of protecting society as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-4\">\n<em>Express Statutory Remedies</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Ajsr\">The county ethics law provides for criminal penalties, \u00a7 19A-23 (incorporating \u00a7 1-19), administrative punishment, \u00a7 19A-25, and allows the county attorney to petition for injunctive relief. \u00a7 19-22(a). In addition, it authorizes taxpayer suits, under limited circumstances, to recover the value of anything received in violation of said laws. \u00a7 19A-24. In <em>Transamerica Mortgage Advisors, Inc. v. Lewis, </em>444 U.S. 11, 100 S.Ct. 242, 62 L.Ed.2d 146 (1979), the Supreme Court examined a similar statutory scheme regulating the \u201cinvestment advisors industry.\u201d The law contained similar express remedies; however, appellants there argued that an implied private cause of action existed under the statute. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-5\">Yet it is an elemental canon of statutory construction that where a statute expressly provides a particular remedy or remedies, a court must be chary of reading others into it. \u201cWhen a statute limits a thing to be done in a particular mode, it includes the negative of any other mode.\u201d <em>Botany Mills v. United States, </em>278 U.S. 282, 289 [49 S.Ct. 129, 132, 73 L.Ed. 379 (1929) ]. <em>See Amtrak, </em>414 U.S. at 458 [94 S.Ct. at 693]; <em>Securities Investor Protection Corp. v. Barbour, </em>421 U.S. 412, 419 [95 S.Ct. 1733, 1738, 44 L.Ed.2d 263 (1975) ]; <em>T.I.M.E., Inc. v. United States, </em>359 U.S. 464, 471 [79 S.Ct. 904, 908, 3 L.Ed.2d 952 (1959)]. Congress expressly provided both judicial and administrative means for enforcing compliance with \u00a7 206. First, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>under \u00a7 217, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 80b-17, willful violations of the Act are criminal offenses, punishable by fine or imprisonment, or both. Second, \u00a7 209 authorizes the Commission to bring civil actions in federal courts to enjoin compliance with the Act, including, of course, \u00a7 206. Third, the Commission is authorized by \u00a7 203 to impose various administrative sanctions on persons who violate the Act, including \u00a7 206. In view of these express provisions for enforcing the duties imposed by \u00a7 206, it is highly improbable that \u201cCongress absentmindedly forgot to mention an intended private action.\u201d <em>Cannon v. University of Chicago, </em>[441 U.S. 677,] 742 [99 S.Ct. 1946, 1981, 60 L.Ed.2d 560] [(1979)] (Powell, J., dissenting).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b608-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 19-20, 100 S.Ct. at 247. <em>See also National R.R. Passenger Corp. v. National Ass\u2019n of R.R. Passengers, </em>414 U.S. 453, 458, 94 S.Ct. 690, 693, 38 L.Ed.2d 646 (1974) (\u201cA frequently stated principle of statutory construction is that when legislation expressly provides a remedy or remedies, courts should not expand the coverage of the statute to subsume other remedies.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">An examination of the above factors does not evidence any intent on behalf of the Montgomery County Council to allow a private cause of action under \u00a7 19A-22(b) to abrogate actions taken in violation of the County Ethics Law. We hold that no private right of action, implied or otherwise, exists under section 19A-22(b) of the Montgomery County Code.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">In their reply brief, appellants maintain that they possess standing to challenge Resolution 11-382 as taxpayers at common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>Assuming, arguendo, appellants possess common law standing as a taxpayer to abrogate Resolution 11-382, and even if such a common law action was not preempted by the county ethics law, appellants\u2019 disregard for the primary jurisdiction doctrine presents an alternative basis for affirming the trial court\u2019s order dismissing appellants\u2019 cause of action. Under the primary jurisdiction doctrine, a court should defer exercise of its concurrent jurisdiction until the Montgomery County Public Ethics Commission could hear, investigate, and render a decision on the same subject matter. As stated in <em>Maryland-Nat\u2019l Cap. Park &amp; Planning Comm\u2019n v. Washington Nat\u2019l Arena, </em>282 Md. 588, 601, 386 A.2d 1216 (1978), the primary jurisdiction doctrine \u201ccomes into play when a court and agency have concurrent jurisdiction over the same matter and there is no statutory provision to coordinate the work of the court with that of the agency.\u201d <em>See also Sweeney v. Hartz Mountain, </em>78 Md.App. 79, 552 A.2d 912 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-4\">The county ethics law created the Montgomery County Ethics Commission, <em>see </em>\u00a7 19A-5(a), which is empowered to issue advisory opinions to persons subject to the laws\u2019 application, <em>id., </em>\u00a7 19A-5(d), hear and decide complaints of alleged violations of the ethics laws, <em>id., </em>\u00a7 19A-5(e), to investigate any complaint, issue subpoenas, and swear witnesses, <em>id., </em>grant waivers from the application of the ethics laws, <em>id., </em>\u00a7 19A-6(a), and take action to enforce the ethics laws of the county. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 19A-5(e). The Ethics Commission was created specifically to administer the county ethics law, to determine if the law is being violated, and to promulgate rules to effectuate its purposes. As we stated in <em>McLean Contracting Co. v. Maryland Transp. Auth., </em>70 Md.App. 514, 522, 521 A.2d 1251 (1987):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-5\">The \u201cprincipal reason\u201d behind this doctrine is the recognition that the work of agencies and courts must be sensibly coordinated. Davis, <em>Administrative Law Text, </em>Ch. 19.01 at 374 (3rd ed., 1972). Therefore, courts generally will refuse to act on matters within an agency\u2019s particular expertise without the benefit of the agency\u2019s opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>Therefore, we hold that the Montgomery County Ethics Commission has primary jurisdiction to hear and investigate complaints of violations of the Montgomery County\u2019s Public Ethics Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">Appellants proffer two arguments in regard to the requirement that they file a complaint with the Ethics Commission.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> First, they argue that filing a complaint with the Ethics Commission would have been futile because the Commission had already given Gudis a waiver to vote. We disagree. Because such a procedure is very informal and perfunctory, and because the Commission necessarily bases its decision on information supplied for the most part by the petitioner, appellants cannot rely on the waiver decision to foreshadow the way the Commission would handle their complaint, especially where new information from sources other than the petitioning councilman could have been provided. As an example, appellants allege that siting a \u201cmass-burn facility\u201d at Dickerson \u2014 the ultimate result of the Council\u2019s vote \u2014 was not an alternative contemplated by the Commission when it issued the waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">Alternatively, appellants argue that a complaint was filed with the Commission by way of a letter to Gudis requesting that he withdraw his vote. Gudis then forwarded the letter to the Commission. For a proper consideration of appellants\u2019 contentions by the Commission, appellants were required to \u201cfile with the commission a complaint alleging a violation of any of the provision of this chapter. These complaints shall be written and under oath----\u201d \u00a7 19A-5(e). By not acting on the allegations in the letter, the Commission did not treat it as the filing of a complaint. Appellants cannot rely on the fact that the unsworn letter they sent to Gudis was subsequently forwarded to the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-8\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b602-5\">. Section 3-920 of the Natural Resources Article of the Maryland Code requires that the NEA provide a notice of intent to the County Council for its approval prior to actual construction. At this point in the process, the County Council could only prevent construction where:</p>\n<p id=\"ATW\">[I]t has found that, after a public hearing which has been advertised in a newspaper of general circulation in the affected county at least 14 days prior to such hearing and after considering the recommendations of the chief executive officer of the county and such other facts as it deemed relevant and material, such acquisition, construction, leasing, installation, or extension would be contrary to the best interests of the residents of such county because it would be contrary to the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of such county by reason of (i) the impact of such project on the environment, or (ii) a conflict of such project with the master plan of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>county, or (iii) such other facts concerning such project or effects of such project as such legislative body shall find would have an adverse effect on such health, safety and welfare. (1980, ch. 871).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b603-8\">. In this amended complaint, appellants state that \"[t]he plaintiffs herein are acting in the best interests of the public and the citizens of Montgomery County ... by seeking the remedy provided by Section 19A-22(b).\u201d Extensive quotation is taken from the Montgomery County Public Ethics Law and set forth in the complaint. The sole relief requested, other than a general request for \u2018\u2018such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper,\u201d is to void the action taken by the Council, consistent with the remedy provided by Section 19A-22(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-9\">In their reply brief, appellants now state that the basis for their complaint was their common law right as taxpayers to \"challenge legislative action that is procedurally or otherwise defective.\u201d This argument belies the clear language of appellant\u2019s amended complaint. The violation complained of and the relief requested are found within the ethics law provisions. Assuming arguendo that appellants <em>may </em>have otherwise possessed standing to invalidate alleged legislative action, their standing, as evidenced by their amended complaint, is based upon the Montgomery County Public Ethics Law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b605-9\">. This last factor is only relevant where federal legislation is being examined.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b608-7\">. At common law a taxpayer had standing to bring a declaratory judgment action for a judicial declaration that a statute was void due to a conflict of interest by one voting for its enactment. See <em>Beshore v. Town of Bel Air, </em>237 Md. 398, 206 A.2d 678 (1965). We need not decide whether the statute pre-empts any common law remedy that appellants may have possessed to attack Resolution 11-382. Appellants do not seek declaratory relief; they rely on the mechanism provided within \u00a7 19A-22(b) to render the resolution void. <em>See Ibid., supra, </em>n. 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b610-9\">. Neither party presented argument regarding the primary jurisdiction doctrine. Appellants\u2019 arguments were made in the context of the exhaustion of administrative remedies doctrine; however, we will address the arguments as if they had been properly focused.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
