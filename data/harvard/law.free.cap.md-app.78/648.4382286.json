We discern three issues from the appellant\u2019s brief. The first two of these issues are similar to those addressed by the Court of Appeals this term in <em>McCullough </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number><em>v. Wittner, </em>314 Md. 602, 552 A.2d 881 (1989) (holding that <em>\u201ca </em>Maryland prison inmate, seeking monetary damages for personal injuries resulting from a correctional officer\u2019s alleged tortious conduct, which occurs in one of the institutions covered by the Inmate Grievance Commission statute, must file a complaint with and exhaust his remedies before the Commission prior to bringing a common law tort action.\u201d). We rephrase Earle\u2019s first two issues in the terms used by the Court of Appeals in <em>McCullough:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">I. \u201c[Wjhether a Maryland prison inmate, seeking monetary damages [from the State] for personal injuries resulting from a correctional officer\u2019s alleged tortious conduct, which occurs in one of the institutions covered by the Inmate Grievance Commission statute, must file a complaint with and exhaust his remedies before the Commission prior to bringing a ... [claim under the Maryland Tort Claims Act].\u201d <em>McCullough, </em>314 Md. at 605, 606, 552 A.2d 881.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">II. \u201c[W]hether a Maryland prison inmate, seeking monetary damages for personal injuries resulting from a correctional officer\u2019s alleged tortious conduct, which occurs in one of the institutions covered by the Inmate Grievance Commission statute, must file a complaint with and exhaust his remedies before the Commission prior to bringing ... a [cause of action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983]\u201d. <em>McCullough, </em>314 Md. at 605, 606, 552 A.2d 881.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">III. Whether appellant alleged facts sufficient to raise a constitutional claim against appellee, Gunnell, under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-8\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b698-9\">On February 20, 1985, Earle, an inmate at the Maryland Correctional Institution in Hagerstown, was attacked in his cell and stabbed repeatedly by two fellow inmates. As a result of this incident, Earle filed a two-count complaint in the Circuit Court for Washington County. Count I was brought pursuant to Title 42, U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and alleged that Gunnell, in his capacity as a State correctional officer, had violated Earle\u2019s Fourteenth Amendment Due Process <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>Rights; Count II alleged a negligence claim against the State under the Maryland Tort Claims Act. The State and Gunnell responded to the complaint with a motion to dismiss both counts, or in the alternative, a motion for summary judgment on both counts. The circuit court granted the motion for summary judgment<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> on Count I on the ground that Earle\u2019s allegation against Gunnell stated, at most, a claim for mere negligence and, therefore, was insufficient as a matter of law to support a \u00a7 1983 action for deprivation of due process. The court also granted the motion to dismiss Count II for lack of subject matter jurisdiction due to Earle\u2019s failure to exhaust his administrative remedy provided by the Inmate Grievance Commission, Md.Ann. Code art. 41, \u00a7 4-102.1(7) (1986 &amp; Supp.1988) formerly \u00a7 4-1104(7 ).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We first dispose of Earle\u2019s complaints regarding the court\u2019s disposition of Count II.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">\n<em>Tort Claims Act</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A3Q\">(Count II)</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">Appellant\u2019s first issue was answered by the Court of Appeals this term in the case of <em>McCullough v. Wittner, </em>in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>which the Court held that a prison inmate, who had filed a common law tort action for monetary damages for personal injuries resulting from a correctional officer\u2019s alleged tortious conduct at the Maryland House of Correction, was required to first exhaust his administrative remedies provided under \u00a7 4-102.1. Although Earl\u2019s complaint was instituted under the Maryland Tort Claims Act rather than, as in <em>McCullough, </em>under the common law, this difference is irrelevant to the applicability of the Court\u2019s rationale. The holding in <em>McCullough </em>is based on the Court\u2019s conclusion that the Inmate Grievance Commission has statutory authority to consider \u201cany grievance or complaint [filed by an inmate] against any officials or employees of the Division of Corrections----\u201d \u00a7 4-102.1(d), and until that administrative remedy is exhausted, \u201cno court shall entertain ... [the] complaint----\u201d 4-102. l(i). Accordingly, we hold that a Maryland prison inmate, seeking monetary damages from the State for personal injuries resulting from a correctional officer\u2019s alleged tortious conduct, which occurs in one of the institutions covered by the Inmate Grievance Commission statute, must file a complaint and exhaust his remedies before the Commission, before proceeding with a claim under the Maryland Tort Claims Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-9\">The disposition of appellant\u2019s first issue does not end our discussion of the circuit court\u2019s dismissal of Count II of the complaint <em>sub judice. </em>As the Court held in <em>McCullough:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"A96\">Under circumstances like these, where a plaintiff has both an administrative remedy and an independent judicial action, and the administrative agency\u2019s jurisdiction is deemed primary, it is appropriate for the trial court to retain, for a reasonable period of time, jurisdiction over the independent judicial action pending invocation and exhaustion of the administrative procedures.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b700-11\"><em>McCullough v. Wittner, </em>at 612, 552 A.2d 881. Accordingly, that portion of the circuit court\u2019s ruling which dismissed Count II of the complaint is reversed in order that the trial court \u201cretain, for a reasonable period of time, jurisdiction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>over the independent judicial action pending ... exhaustion of the administrative procedures.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 613, 552 A.2d 881.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">\n<em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A6b\">(Count I)</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">The circuit court and the parties assumed, without having raised the issue, that exhaustion of the administrative remedy provided by \u00a7 4-102.1 is not a prerequisite to bringing an action under \u00a7 1983. Although this issue was not raised below, this Court is free to decide it <em>sua sponte </em>on appeal. <em>Bd. of Ed. for Dorchester Co. v. Hubbard, </em>305 Md. 774, 787, 506 A.2d 625 (1986).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-7\">While the failure to invoke and exhaust an administrative remedy does not ordinarily result in a trial court\u2019s being deprived of fundamental jurisdiction, nevertheless, because of the public policy involved, the matter is for some purposes treated <em>like </em>a jurisdictional question. Consequently, issues of primary jurisdiction and exhaustion of administrative remedies will be addressed by this Court sua sponte even though not raised by any party. <em>See, e.g., Comm\u2019n on Human Rel. v. Mass Transit, </em>294 Md. 225, 232, 449 A.2d 385 (1982); <em>Sec. Dep\u2019t of Human Res. v. Wilson, supra, </em>286 Md. [639] at 645, 409 A.2d 713 [1979].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b701-8\">The question as to whether state administrative remedies must be exhausted prior to proceeding with a \u00a7 1983 action was previously decided by this Court in <em>Md.-Nat\u2019l Cap. P. &amp; P. Comm\u2019n v. Crawford, </em>59 Md.App. 276, 475 A.2d 494 (1984), <em>aff'd </em>307 Md. 1, 511 A.2d 1079 (1986). We held in that case that \u201cCrawford was not required to exhaust the administrative remedies provided by the [Md. Nat\u2019l Cap. P. &amp; P.] Commission prior to instituting her \u00a7 1983 action in the Circuit Court____\u201d Judge Alpert explained for the Court that this holding was necessitated by a series of Supreme Court decisions which rejected the argument that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>a \u00a7 1983 action should be dismissed where the plaintiff has not exhausted State administrative remedies:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Abe\">In <em>Patsy v. Board of Regents of the State of Florida, </em>457 U.S. 496, 102 S.Ct. 2557, 73 L.Ed.2d 172 (1982), the Supreme Court expressly held that \u201cexhaustion of State remedies should not be required as a prerequisite to bringing an action pursuant to \u00a7 1983.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 516, 102 S.Ct. at 2568. The Court did not treat the issue as one of first impression. Rather, the <em>Patsy </em>decision was an affirmation of the principles set out in <em>McNeese v. Board of Education, </em>373 U.S. 668, 671-72, 83 S.Ct. 1433, 1435, 10 L.Ed.2d 622 (1963). Speaking through Justice Douglas, the <em>McNeese </em>Court stated that \u201crelief under [\u00a7 1983] may not be defeated because relief was not first sought under state law which provided a remedy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 671, 83 S.Ct. at 1435. This is so because \u201c[t]he federal remedy is supplementary to the state remedy, and the latter need not be first sought and refused before the federal one is invoked.\u201d <em>Id. (quoting Monroe v. Pape, </em>365 U.S. 167, 183, 81 S.Ct. 473, 482, 5 L.Ed.2d 492 (1961)).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b702-6\"><em>Id. </em>[59 Md.App.] at 290, 475 A.2d 494. <em>See also Marker v. Talley, </em>502 A.2d 972, 976, 977 (Del.Super.1985); <em>Bungs Bar &amp; Grille, Inc. v. Florence Tp., </em>206 N.J.Super. 432, 502 A.2d 1198, 1216 (1985); <em>O\u2019Connors v. Helfgott, </em>481 A.2d 388, 391 (R.I.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">The soundness of our reasoning in <em>Crawford </em>was brought into question by the discussions of the courts of several other states which considered this issue and concluded that the holding in <em>Patsy </em>does <em>not </em>affect actions brought in State courts. <em>E.g., Bartschi v. Chico Community Mem. Hosp., </em>137 Cal.App.3d 502, 508, 187 Cal.Rptr. 61 (1982); <em>State ex. rel. Basham v. Med. Licensing Bd., </em>451 N.E.2d 691, 694 (Ind.App.1983). These courts properly contend that \u201c[t]he <em>[Patsy </em>] decision rests heavily on the paramount role assigned by Congress to the <em>Federal courts </em>to protect the [constitutional] rights guaranteed by section 1983.\u201d <em>Bartschi, </em>137 Cal.App.3d at 508, 187 Cal.Rptr. 61 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>(emphasis in original). As the Supreme Court reasoned in <em>Patsy:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-4\">The 1871 Congress intended \u00a7 1 to throw open the doors of the United States courts to individuals who were threatened with, or who had suffered, the deprivation of constitutional rights ... and to provide these individuals immediate access to the <em>federal courts </em>notwithstanding any provision of state law to the contrary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">102 S.Ct. at 2561 (citations omitted, emphasis added); and also in <em>Steffel v. Thompson, </em>415 U.S. 452, 94 S.Ct. 1209, 1222, 39 L.Ed.2d 505 (1974):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-6\">When federal claims are premised on [\u00a7 1983] \u2014 as they are here \u2014 we have not required exhaustion of state judicial or administrative remedies, recognizing the paramount role Congress has assigned to the <em>federal courts </em>to protect constitutional rights.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-8\">Our own Court of Appeals, in reviewing <em>Crawford, </em>expressed some doubt that the holding in <em>Patsy </em>actually affects \u00a7 1983 actions which are brought in State courts. Judge Eldridge, speaking for the Court, commented in <em>dicta:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-9\">While <em>Patsy </em>involved a \u00a7 1983 action brought in a federal court, the majority of state court decisions since <em>Patsy </em>have taken the position that the <em>Patsy </em>holding is applicable to a state court \u00a7 1983 action. <em>See, e.g., Beitel v. Board of School Com\u2019rs of Mobile, </em>419 So.2d 242, 245 (Ala.App.1982); <em>Logan v. Southern Cal. Rapid Transit Dist., </em>136 Cal.App.3d 116, 124, 185 Cal.Rptr. 878 (1982); <em>Laurel Park, Inc. v. Pac, </em>194 Conn. 677, 690, 485 A.2d 1272, 1279 (1984); <em>Fetterman v. University of Conn., </em>192 Conn. 539, 549, 473 A.2d 1176 (1984);....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-10\">Of course, as we recently emphasized in <em>County Exec., Prince Geo\u2019s County v. Doe, </em>300 Md. 445, 454, 479 A.2d 352 (1984), \u201cwhen an action is brought in a state court to enforce rights or claims under federal law, the Suprema<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>cy Clause of the United States Constitution requires that federal law and policy be applied by the state court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-5\">Consequently, if Congress in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 intended that exhaustion of state administrative remedies should not be a prerequisite to bringing an action under that federal statute, <em>regardless of the judicial forum, </em>then the \u201cMaryland policy\u201d concerning invocation and exhaustion of administrative remedies would be immaterial, and the <em>Patsy </em>holding would be fully applicable to state court \u00a7 1983 actions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-6\">The defendants and amici argue, however, that the congressional intent in \u00a7 1983, that state administrative remedies need not be invoked or exhausted, was aimed solely at federal court actions, and that Congress did not have such intent with regard to state court \u00a7 1983 actions. They contend that the legislative history and reasoning relied on by the Supreme Court in the <em>Patsy </em>opinion related only to federal court suits under \u00a7 1983. In the present case, we need not and do not reach this argument because there was no violation of any applicable state law primary jurisdiction or exhaustion requirement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">307 Md. 12-15, 511 A.2d 1079.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-8\">Apparently, as this quoted language indicates, the Court was not thoroughly convinced by our reasoning in <em>Crawford </em>that Congress intended that exhaustion of state administrative remedies should not be a prerequisite to bringing an action under \u00a7 1983 in state courts. We believe that this issue may be resolved by reference to the second, independent leg of the <em>Patsy </em>holding which involves the congressional intent in the enactment of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-9\">Section 1997e, which is a component of the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997 <em>et seq. </em>provides a mechanism whereby \u201ccourts\u201d can stay a \u00a7 1983 action, filed by either a state or federal prisoner, for up to 90 days \u201cin order to require exhaustion of such plain, speedy, and effective administrative remedies as are avail<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>able,\u201d \u00a7 1997e(a)(l),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> but such a stay is available only if the administrative remedy meets certain specific minimum standards listed in \u00a7 1997e relating to time constraints, fairness, etc.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The legislative history of this section indicates that Congress hoped to employ their Fourteenth Amendment powers through \u00a7 1997e to remove unnecessary burdens on the life and liberty of <em>State </em>prisoners by encouraging the States to \u201cdevelop high quality grievance resolution systems ... [and thereby] encourage resolution of problems by the persons involved in the prison administration ... [in order to] develop a sensitivity that may have otherwise been lacking.\u201d S.Rep. No. 416, 96th Cong, <em>reprinted in </em>1980 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 787, 816.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\">The congressional intent to encourage State prison reforms is explicit and there can be little doubt that this policy would be hindered if the state courts were to require exhaustion of state administrative remedies which do not meet the minimum standards set by \u00a7 1997e. Therefore, in enacting \u00a7 1997e Congress must have intended that exhaus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>tion of State administrative procedures should not inhibit a \u00a7 1983 action, regardless of the forum (State or Federal), except where the administrative grievance procedure satisfies the strict \u00a7 1997e guidelines.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">Although this \u00a7 1983 action was brought in the State and not the Federal courts, we are required to enforce the congressional intent underlying \u00a7 1997e because \u201cwhen an action is brought in a state court to enforce rights or claims under federal law, the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution requires that federal law and <em>policy </em>be applied by the state court.\u201d <em>County Exec., Prince Geo\u2019s County v. Doe, </em>300 Md. 445, 454, 479 A.2d 352 (1984). Accordingly, we reaffirm our holding in <em>Crawford </em>that, regardless of the judicial forum, exhaustion of state administrative remedies is not a prerequisite to bringing an action under \u00a7 1983; the provisions of Art. 41 \u00a7 4-102.1(7) notwithstanding.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We qualify this holding by noting that exhaustion of the administrative procedures under a future version of Art. 41 \u00a7 4-102 might be required under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e if, at some point, that section is amended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>such that a court is able to conclude that the Maryland law complies with the minimum standards for inmate grievance procedures established by \u00a7 1997e.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">HI</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">\n<em>Constitutional Claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AQ5\">(Count I)</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">The circuit court judge ruled, by way of granting the appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> that Gunnell\u2019s conduct was insufficient to stand as the basis for a \u00a7 1983 suit. The court concluded that Gunnell\u2019s actions, as described in Earle\u2019s affidavit, amounted to mere negligence and, therefore, \u201cdid not approach the sort of abusive government conduct necessary to trigger the protection of the Due Process Clause.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>Maryland Rule 2-501(e), \u201cEntry of [Summary] Judgment,\u201d states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-5\">The court shall enter judgment in favor of or against the moving party if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, admissions, and affidavits show that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and that the party in whose favor judgment is entered is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">In reviewing the trial court\u2019s actions on such a motion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AhY\">[W]e are concerned with whether there was a dispute as to any material fact and if not, whether the moving party was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.

Potomac Edison Co., </em>303 Md. 619, 621, 495 A.2d 838 (1985). We apply this rule to the case <em>sub judice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b708-8\">(a) The Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b708-9\">The evidence, taken in a light most favorable to appellant, is reflected in his affidavit which accompanied his response to the motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-10\">On February 20, 1985, I was living in the locked-tier area at the Maryland Correctional Institute at Hagerstown. The locked-tier area consists of single and double cells only. I was located in a single cell for inmates who have requested either protective custody or administrative protective custody. Locked-tier inmates cannot work as sanitation workers in the locked-tier area. Inmate cells in the locked-tier area cannot be opened except at the request of the inmate actually living in the cell that is being opened. On February 20, 1985, contrary to the institution\u2019s rules and regulations, Lester T. Travers and Robert Sayers were working as sanitation workers in the locked-tier area where I was living and both were locked-tier inmates at that time. One of [the] two inmates told officer Robert Gunnell that they wanted to get a picture book <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>which was located in my cell. Gunnell, without asking me, opened my cell door and allowed Travers and Sayers to enter my cell. Travers and Sayers then rushed in and both stabbed me repeatedly.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b709-4\">Appellant also summarized what he alleges are the applicable prison regulations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-5\">[P]rison ... regulations require that when the locked tier area needs sanitation workers that they must be obtained from outside the locked tier area. In addition, the prison\u2019s regulations require, in a locked tier area, that no inmate\u2019s cell door may be opened except at the request of he inmate assigned to the cell.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">(b) The Law</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">In <em>Daniels v. Williams, </em>474 U.S. 327, 106 S.Ct. 662, 88 L.Ed.2d 662 (1986), the Supreme Court held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-8\">[T]he Due Process Clause<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> of the Fourteenth Amendment is not implicated by the lack of due care of an official causing unintended injury to life, liberty or property. In other words, where a government official is merely negligent in causing the injury, no procedure for compensation is constitutionally required.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b709-9\"><em>Davidson v. Cannon, </em>474 U.S. 344, 106 S.Ct. 668, 670, 88 L.Ed.2d 677 (1986) (footnote added). The Court explained that \u201c[w]e have previously rejected reasoning that \u2018would make of the Fourteenth Amendment a font of tort law to be superimposed upon whatever system may already be administered by the States.\u2019 \u201d 106 S.Ct. at 666 (citations omitted). The Court also quoted from Justice Stewart\u2019s concurring opinion in <em>Parratt v. Taylor, </em>451 U.S. 527, 101 S.Ct. 1908, 1917, 68 L.Ed.2d 420 (1981), to the effect that \u201c[t]o hold that this kind of [negligently inflicted] loss is a deprivation of [life, liberty or] property within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment seems not only to trivialize, but grossly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>to distort the meaning and intent of the Constitution.\u201d Finally, the Court noted that \u201cthis case affords us no occasion to consider whether something less than intentional conduct, such as recklessness or \u201cgross negligence,\u201d is enough to trigger the protection of the Due Process Clause.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> 106 S.Ct. at 667 n. 3. <em>But see Smith v. Wade, </em>461 U.S. 30, 103 S.Ct. 1625, 1640, 75 L.Ed.2d 632 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">Appellant argues that summary judgement was improper in this case as a matter of law because, he claims, Gunnell\u2019s conduct rose above ordinary negligence to \u201crecklessness\u201d, and recklessness, he contends, is sufficient to state a \u00a7 1983 claim. We need not entertain the question which the Supreme Court said it left open in <em>Daniels </em>(whether something less than an intentional act but greater than negligence is sufficient under \u00a7 1983) because we find that Gunnell\u2019s actions did not rise above ordinary negligence and Earle\u2019s claim was, therefore, barred by the rule in <em>Daniels.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">To explain our conclusion that Gunnell\u2019s actions did not rise above the level of \u201cnegligence\u201d discussed in <em>Daniels, </em>it is first necessary to define the level of fault required by that case: which we shall refer to as \u201cconstitutional negligence.\u201d The Supreme Court instructs us that the appropriate place to search for such a definition is within the common law of torts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-7\">Section 1983 is derived from \u00a7 1 of the Civil Rights Act of 1871, 17 Stat. 13. It was intended to create \u201ca species of tort liability\u201d in favor of persons deprived of federally secured right. <em>Carey v. Piphus, </em>435 U.S. 247, 253, 98 S.Ct. 1042, 1047, 55 L.Ed.2d 252 (1978);.... We noted in <em>Carey </em>that there was little in the section\u2019s legislative history concerning the damages recoverable for this tort liability, 435 U.S., at 255, 98 S.Ct., at 1048. In the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>absence of more specific guidance, we looked first to the common law of torts (both modern and as of 1871), with such modification or adaptation as might be necessary to carry out the purpose and policy of the statute. <em>Id., </em>435 U.S., at 253-264, 98 S.Ct., at 1046-1052.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">We turn then to Prosser and Keeton, <em>Law of Torts, </em>\u00a7 34 pp. 212-214 (5th ed. 1984) for a definition of \u201cnegligence\u201d as that concept is applied by the majority of the states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aoe\">Lying between intent to do harm, [ (which is sufficient to bring a \u00a7 1983 action) ] ... and the mere unreasonable risk of harm to another involved in ordinary negligence [ (which is insufficient to bring a \u00a7 1983 action) ], there is a penumbra of what has been called \u201cquasi-intent.\u201d To this area the words \u201cwillful,\u201d \u201cwanton,\u201d or \u201creckless,\u201d are customarily applied____ They have been grouped together as an aggravated form of negligence, differing in quality rather than in degree from ordinary lack of care____ They apply to conduct which is still, at essence, negligent, rather than actually intended to do harm, but which is so far from a proper state of mind that it is treated in many respects as if it were so intended.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-10\">The usual meaning assigned to \u201cwillful,\u201d \u201cwanton,\u201d or \u201creckless,\u201d according to taste as to the words used, is that the actor has intentionally done an act of an unreasonable character in <em>disregard of a known or obvious risk that was so great as to make it highly probable that harm would follow, </em>and which thus is usually accompanied by a conscious indifference to the consequences ____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-11\">The result is that \u201cwillful,\u201d \u201cwanton,\u201d or \u201creckless\u201d conduct tends to take on the aspect of highly unreasonable conduct, involving an extreme departure from ordinary care, in a situation where a high degree of danger is apparent____ It is at least clear, ... that such aggravated negligence must be more than any mere mistake resulting from inexperience, excitement, or confusion, and more than mere thoughtlessness or inadvertence, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>simple inattention, even perhaps to the extent of falling asleep at the wheel of an automobile, or <em>even of an intentional omission to perform a statutory duty, </em>except in those cases where a reasonable person in the actor\u2019s place would have been aware of great danger, and proceeding in the face of it is so entirely unreasonable as to amount to aggravated negligence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">(emphasis added). (We note that this definition is in accord with the law of this State which defines \u201cwillful or wanton\u201d conduct as that which is \u201cextraordinary and outrageous,\u201d <em>Smith v. Gray Concrete Pipe Co., </em>267 Md. 149, 165-6, 297 A.2d 721 (1972); <em>Medina v. Meilhammer, </em>62 Md.App. 239, 248-251, 489 A.2d 35 (1985) (quoting Prosser and Keeton, <em>Law of Torts), cert. denied, </em>303 Md. 683, 496 A.2d 683 (1985); <em>Mech v.

Faulkner, </em>179 Md. 598, 20 A.2d 485 (1941).)</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">There is no question that, under the definition of negligence provided by Prosser and Keeton, Gunnell was negligent in allowing Travers and Sayers to enter Earle\u2019s cell. However, there is no evidence that he did so with constitutional negligence \u2014 characterized by a \u201cquasi-intent,\u201d Prosser and Keeton, <em>Law of Torts, </em>at 212, in \u201cdisregard of a known or obvious risk that was so great as to make it highly probable that harm would follow,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 213 \u2014 and the mere allegations in Earle\u2019s complaint that Gunnell\u2019s actions were \u201cwillful\u201d and \u201cwanton\u201d are insufficient to satisfy this standard, <em>see Foor v. Juvenile Services, </em>78 Md.App. 151, 170, 552 A.2d 947 (1989). In constitutional terms, Gunnell\u2019s actions simply do not amount to an \u201carbitrary exercise of the power of the government,\u201d <em>Hurtado v. California, </em>110 U.S. 516, 4 S.Ct. 111, 116, 28 L.Ed. 232 (1884); <em>see also Wolff v. McDonnell, </em>418 U.S. 539, 94 S.Ct. 2963, 2975, 41 L.Ed.2d 935 (1974), which ought to incur the constitutional protection of the Fourteenth Amendment as enforced through \u00a7 1983. To hold otherwise would, as Justice Stewart warned, \u201ctrivialize ...

This section, in its present form, could not be used to stay a \u00a7 1983 proceeding in either state or federal courts pending state action under \u00a7 4-102.1(d). Section 1997e(b)(2) specifically requires that no continuance may be granted unless the court or the U.S. Attorney General makes a finding that administrative grievance procedures provide for \u201can advisory role for ... inmates ..\u00a7 4-102.1 makes no provision for such an advisory role.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b705-6\">.

Section 1997e was adopted as part of P.L. 96-247 which, according to the legislative discussions, was specifically intended to apply to actions filed in the federal courts. U.S.Code Cong, and Admin.News, pp. 787, 816. One might, therefore, erroneously conclude that \u00a7 1997e is intended to apply only to those \u00a7 1983 actions which are filed in federal courts. However, Congress\u2019s failure to specifically note during their debates the direct involvement of the state courts in the enforcement of P.L. 96-247 is understandable in light of the fact that the primary component of P.L. 96-247 is \u00a7 1997a which permits the U.S. Attorney General to institute proceedings in federal courts on behalf of institutionalized persons. \u00a7 1997a. Section 1997e, by contrast, specifically applies to actions filed under \u00a7 1983 by \"the party injured,\u201d which actions can be filed in either state or federal courts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b706-7\">. Our holding is not intended to conflict with the statement of the Court of Appeals in <em>Crawford, </em>307 Md. at 31, n. 14, 511 A.2d 1079, that:</p>\n<p id=\"b706-8\">... [Wjhere a plaintiff having an independent judicial remedy also elects to file a claim with the Commission on Human Relations, a court should require that the plaintiff exhaust his Commission remedies before the court addresses the merits of the independent action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b707-8\">. The circuit court judge actually concluded that \u201cCount I must be <em>dismissed </em>for failure to state a cause of action,\u201d however, we are compelled by Md. Rule 2-322 to treat the judge\u2019s ruling in this case as if it were one made upon a motion for summary judgment. Md. Rule 2-322 provides that:</p>\n<p id=\"b707-9\">If, on a motion to dismiss for failure of the pleading to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, matters outside the pleading are presented to and not excluded by the court, the motion shall be treated as one for summary judgment and disposed of as provided in Rule 2-501, and all parties shall be given reasonable opportunity to present all material made pertinent to such a motion by Rule 2-501.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-10\">Md. Rule 2-322(c). In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the Court concluded that: Although Plaintiffs complaint alleges \"willful and wanton violations of the prison\u2019s regulations,\u201d and \"reckless conduct\u201d by Defendant Gunnell, the facts indicate the officer was merely negligent in his conduct. Furthermore, when compared to the case of <em>Davidson v. Cannon, </em>the factual similarities of the cases make it clear that the behavior of Defendant Gunnell did not approach the sort of abusive government conduct necessary to trigger the protections of the Due Process Clause. <em>See Davidson </em>[v. <em>Cannon, </em>474 U.S. 344] 106 S.Ct. [668] at 670 [88 L.Ed.2d 677 (1986) ]. Therefore, Count I must be dismissed for failure to state a cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-11\">Because the record indicates that the circuit court did consider matters outside of the pleadings, such as Earle\u2019s affidavit filed in opposition to the motion for summary judgment, and otherwise considered this to have been a motion for summary judgment, we will review it as such, Rule 2-322, despite the court\u2019s insistence on referring to the matter as a motion to dismiss.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b709-10\">.
