(\u00a7 27-101(f)).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">On appeal, Beckwith asserts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-9\">I. That the court erred by denying his motion to suppress evidence; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-10\">II. That the court erred by convicting him of driving under the influence of alcohol where he was charged only with driving while intoxicated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-11\">We see no merit in these arguments and shall affirm the judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-12\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b408-13\">On 18 August 1985, Officer Karen Fabi of the Montgomery County Police Department, received a call on her police radio that <em>\u201ca </em>possible DWI had run another citizen off the road\u201d and had \u201cpulled into the Kernel Nuthouse parking lot.\u201d She was given a description of what she should find at that location. Upon arrival at the parking lot, she found a brown Nova, with Maryland temporary tags, and, as she shined her lights on the car, two people, the appellant and a female, both apparently nude, \u201cpopped up from the back <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>seat.\u201d The officer asked them to get dressed and step out of the vehicle. When they did so, she asked appellant for some identification, which he eventually provided.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After some conversation with him, during which the officer observed that appellant had a strong odor of alcohol on his breath and was unsteady on his feet, she told him \u201cnot to drive because he was clearly intoxicated.\u201d Sometime during this conversation, either Officer Fabi or Officer Brag-don, who had arrived on the scene, had determined via radio that appellant\u2019s license to drive had been revoked or suspended. Appellant and his lady friend started walking down the road and the officers left the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">A few minutes later, Officer Fabi saw the same vehicle go by her and followed it. She observed the vehicle cross a double-yellow center line on the highway. She stopped the vehicle and found appellant to be the driver. Among her observations of his condition at that time were his antagonistic behavior, watery and bloodshot eyes, unsteadiness on his feet, disheveled clothing, slurred speech, a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage on his breath, incoherency, and that he was unable to recite the alphabet. He was then charged with the offenses aforementioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">Appellant\u2019s first argument, as set forth in his brief, is: As the record makes clear, all the evidence against Appellant in this case was the direct result of the illegal demand by the officers that Appellant display his license to them when Appellant was not on a public highway. The State\u2019s evidence below was the illegal fruit of the poisonous tree.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>Citing Transportation Article \u00a7 16-112(c),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> appellant says that since the Kernel Nuthouse parking lot is not a \u201chighway,\u201d it was \u201cillegal\u201d for the officers to \u201cdemand\u201d that he display his license to them. We agree that the Kernel Nuthouse parking lot is not a \u201chighway.\u201d <em>Walmsley v. State, </em>35 Md.App. 148, 370 A.2d 107 (1977). We may, for the purposes of this discussion, agree that under these circumstances the officers had no right to <em>demand </em>to see a driver\u2019s license. As we have noted previously, however, there is absolutely no evidence in this case that they did so. The undisputed testimony is that the officers <em>asked </em>for <em>identification, </em>which, under the circumstances, we do not perceive as unreasonable. Because the factual predicate for his argument is absent, the argument must fail. Accordingly, we need not reach the question of whether an unauthorized \u201cdemand\u201d to see a driver\u2019s license would be a violation of federal constitutional law invoking the exclusionary rule of <em>Mapp v. Ohio, </em>367 U.S. 643, 81 S.Ct. 1684, 6 L.Ed.2d 1081 (1961).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We further observe that the officers had probable cause to arrest the appellant for driving while intoxicated. When they did so, it was inevitable that they would then discover, if they did not already know, that his driver\u2019s license was suspended or revoked. The trial court did not err in denying the motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">Transportation Article \u00a7 21-902 includes four violations of the traffic laws. Subsection (a) proscribes driving or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>attempting to drive while intoxicated. Subsection (b) prohibits driving or attempting to drive while under the influence of alcohol. Subsections (c) and (d) deal with driving or attempting to drive while under the influence of drugs, a combination of drugs and alcohol, or any controlled dangerous substances.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">The Maryland Uniform Complaint and Citation form, as applied to this charge, lists a series of possible violations. The arresting officer is instructed to circle the appropriate violation. Among the choices are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-6\">34. 21-902 Driving intoxicated &amp; under the influence</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-7\">35. 21-902(a) Driving intoxicated</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-8\">36. 21-902(b) Driving under influence of alcohol</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-9\">The citation issued to appellant shows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-10\">34. 21-902 Driving intoxicated &amp; under the influence</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-11\"><em>(35. </em>21-902(a)) Driving intoxicated</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-12\">36. 21-902(b) Driving under influence of alcohol</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-13\">Additionally, appellant was told specifically at the beginning of his trial that he was charged with \u201cdriving while intoxicated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b411-14\">Citing <em>Insley v. State, </em>32 Md.App. 46, 358 A.2d 246 (1976), appellant says it is apparent that the prosecution chose to proceed on an \u201call or nothing\u201d basis and thus is precluded from now falling back on the lesser charge. The State\u2019s response is (1) that Transportation Article \u00a7 26-405 authorizes the conviction of the lesser charge, or (2) that the conviction is proper because driving while under the influence of alcohol is a lesser included offense within driving while intoxicated. We think the State is correct, not because of the statute, which is inapposite under the facts of this case, but because of the law of lesser included offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-15\">In <em>Insley v. State, supra, </em>relied upon by appellant, the issue was whether a defendant charged specifically with violating then Article 66V2, \u00a7 ll-902(a) (driving in an intoxicated condition) was entitled to a jury instruction as to \u00a7 ll-902(b) (driving while ability impaired by the consumption of alcohol). The evidence, including results of a breath<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>alyzer test showing a blood alcohol content of .26, clearly was sufficient to prove intoxication, and the jury convicted him of driving while intoxicated. Appellant\u2019s complaint on appeal was that the jury should have been allowed the compromise alternative of finding him guilty of driving while his ability was impaired. This Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-5\">We hold that such a choice was not available to Insley. The State charged him with one offense, and only one offense. He was charged with driving a vehicle while he was in an intoxicated condition, specified as being the conduct proscribed by Art. 66V2, \u00a7 ll-902(a). The State\u2019s choice to proceed on an \u201call or nothing\u201d basis meant that the State forewent the right to drop down to a lesser charge, should its proof fail to result in a conviction of the greater charge. If this choice involved risk, the risk was on the State, not on the accused.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-6\"><em>Id., </em>32 Md.App. at 48, 358 A.2d at 247.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">The State attempts to distinguish <em>Insley </em>by reliance on Transportation Article \u00a7 26-405, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-8\">If a person is charged with a violation of \u00a7 21-901.1 of this article (\u201cReckless and negligent driving\u201d) or \u00a7 21-902 of this article (\u201cDriving while intoxicated, under the influence of alcohol, or under the influence of a drug, a combination of alcohol and a drug, or a controlled dangerous substance\u201d), the court may find him guilty of any lesser included offense under any subsection of the respective section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-9\">This section is not substantially different from \u00a7 16-104, in effect when <em>Insley </em>was decided.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> That section read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqR\">It shall be sufficient to charge any person with a violation of \u00a7 11-901 (reckless and negligent driving) and \u00a7 11-902 (driving while intoxicated, impaired or under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>influence of drugs) and the court is empowered to make a finding under any subsection of either \u00a7 11-901 or \u00a7 11-902.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">By virtue of the statute, there is no doubt that had the State elected to charge appellant with violating \u00a7 21-902, the court could have convicted him under any subsection thereof. <em>Swinson v. State, </em>71 Md.App. 661, 527 A.2d 56 (1987), <em>Crampton v. State, </em>71 Md.App. 375, 525 A.2d 1087 (1987), <em>aff'd sub nom. State v. Crampton, </em>314 Md. 265, 550 A.2d 693 (1988). The State, however, chose to charge appellant specifically with violating \u00a7 21-902(a), driving while intoxicated. The statute, therefore, specifically does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">Disregarding \u00a7 26-405, we look to the common law. In <em>Johnson v. State, </em>38 Md.App. 100, 379 A.2d 436 (1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>282 Md. 734 (1978), this Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-7\">The clear weight of authority is that conviction of a necessarily included lesser offense is permissible under a document charging a greater offense. The rule is thus stated in 2 Wharton\u2019s Criminal Procedure, \u00a7 292, at 127 (12th ed. Torc\u00eda 1975):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-8\">\u201c\u00a7 292. <em>Lesser and included offenses.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-9\">At common law and under typical statutes, when an indictment or information charges an offense which includes within it a lesser offense, or an offense of a lower degree of the same general class, the accused may be convicted of such lesser offense. An offense qualifies as a lesser-included offense only if the elements of the included offense are fewer in number than the elements of the greater offense, and only if the greater offense cannot be committed without also committing the lesser offense.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-10\"><em>Id. </em>38 Md.App. at 109, 379 A.2d at 440.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-11\">Applying this test, driving while under the influence of alcohol in violation of \u00a7 21-902(b) is a lesser included offense within driving while intoxicated, in violation of \u00a7 21-902(a). One cannot be intoxicated without also being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>under the influence of alcohol, but one can be under the influence' of alcohol without being intoxicated. On the other hand, violations of \u00a7 21-902(c) and (d) are not lesser included offenses within \u00a7 21-902(a). Subsections (c) and (d) involve drugs or other controlled dangerous substances, which are not elements of subsection (a), while subsection (a) requires that the person be intoxicated, not a necessary element of either subsection (c) or (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">In <em>Insley, </em>the evidence did not support an instruction on the lesser included offense, just as in <em>Battle v. State, </em>65 Md.App. 38, 499 A.2d 200 (1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>305 Md. 243, 503 A.2d 252 (1986), the evidence did not support an instruction on simple robbery <em>without </em>the use of a deadly weapon, where it was uncontradicted that what appeared to be a dangerous weapon was used. The Court noted, however, that \u201can accused may be convicted of common law robbery although he was charged only with \u2018armed robbery\u2019 under appropriate factual circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>65 Md.App. at 39, 499 A.2d at 203, n. 1. Similarly, while murder in the second degree and manslaughter are lesser included offenses in first degree murder, it is not necessary to instruct on those offenses if the evidence does not support such verdicts. <em>Blackwell v. State, </em>278 Md. 466, 365 A.2d 545 (1976). Yet it is well settled that under a charging document alleging first degree murder, the fact finder may return any one of several verdicts, including murder in the second degree and manslaughter. Gilbert &amp; Moylan, <em>Maryland Criminal Law, Practice and Procedure, </em>\u00a7 1.12 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">We hold, therefore, that when one is charged with violating \u00a7 21-902, that person may be convicted of violating subsections (a), (b), (c) or (d). This is by virtue of \u00a7 26-405. When one is charged with violating \u00a7 21-902(a), that person may be convicted of violating either subsection (a) or, if supported by the evidence, subsection (b), but may not be convicted of violating subsections (c) or (d). This is by virtue of the common law of lesser included offenses. Any language to the contrary in <em>Insley v. State, supra, </em>is disapproved. Of course, if one is charged only with violat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>ing subsection (b), that person can be convicted only of that charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\">JUDGMENTS AFFIRMED; APPELLANT TO PAY COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b408-14\">. Unless otherwise indicated, all statutory references are to the Transportation Article of the Maryland Annotated Code (1987 Repl.Vol., and where applicable, 1988 Supp.).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b409-8\">. It is important to note at this point that there was <em>no testimony, </em>either from the police officers or from the appellant, of a <em>demand </em>that he produce a driver\u2019s license. Officer Bragdon <em>assumed </em>that one of the officers <em>asked </em>appellant for his license, but did not recall doing so himself. Officer Fabi said she <em>asked </em>appellant for \"some identification.\u201d During his testimony, appellant did not mention the subject. Precisely what form of identification was produced is not clear from the record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b410-7\">. Section 16-112(c) provides: \"Each individual driving a motor vehicle on any highway in this State shall display the license to any uniformed police officer who demands it.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b410-8\">. <em>But see Byrd v. State, </em>13 Md.App. 288, 283 A.2d 9 (1971), <em>cert. denied, </em>264 Md. 746 (1972), where we said a request for a driver\u2019s license and a registration card is not a protected confrontation within the ambit of the federal Constitution, and <em>Howell v. State, </em>60 Md.App. 463, 466, 483 A.2d 780 (1984), where we said, \"The exclusionary rule of <em>Mapp, </em>by definition, can reach down to the states only when there is a violation of federal constitutional law.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b412-10\">. The State cites dicta in <em>Vonoppenfeld v. State, </em>53 Md.App. 462, 454 A.2d 402 (1983), as suggesting there is some substantive difference in \u00a7 26-405 and former \u00a7 16-104. The <em>holding </em>in <em>Vonoppenfeld </em>was simply that the District Court had <em>fundamental jurisdiction </em>to do what the trial judge did in this case, which is not an issue here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
