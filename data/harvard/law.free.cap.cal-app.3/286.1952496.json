J.</author>\n<p id=\"A9c\">This is an action to recover the value of certain eighteen tons of broom brush and for board furnished defendant and labor done. The court gave judgment for plaintiff in the sum of $612.33, with interest, and costs and disbursements, amounting to $273.45. The action was commenced in Glenn county, and summons was served in said county on October 3, 1904. Defendant appeared by demurrer, and at the same time served his demand in writing and notice of motion that the place of trial be changed to the city and county of San Francisco. The motion was made on the affidavit of defendant, the demand in writing and the papers and records on file in the action. The motion was heard on October 31, 1904, and at the hearing plaintiff\u2019s attorney filed an affidavit of plaintiff in reply to defendant\u2019s said affidavit. The court denied the motion of defendant, to which exception was duly taken. Thereafter, on November 10, 1904, defendant served and filed his motion to vacate and set aside the order of the court made October 31st, and to grant defendant leave to renew his said motion. This latter motion was made on the alleged grounds: 1. That said order was given and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>made through inadvertence and mistake. 2. That the court was not fully advised as to defendant\u2019s residence. 3. That the affidavit of plaintiff is false and untrue so far as it relates to defendant\u2019s residence. 4. That defendant was taken by surprise at the hearing of said motion to change the same and was given no opportunity to reply to plaintiff\u2019s said affidavit. 5. That there is no evidence before the court sufficient to justify said order.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">With defendant\u2019s said motion for leave to renew his former motion, defendant served and filed the affidavit of defendant and also the affidavit of Frank Moody, Esq., his attorney, appearing at the hearing of the first motion. It was stated in the motion that it would be heard upon the affidavits of defendant and said Moody \u2018\u2018 and upon all the papers on file in this cause, and upon such other evidence as may be introduced at the hearing of this motion.\u201d It was admitted that at the hearing of the first motion no objection was made by defendant to the introduction of plaintiff\u2019s affidavit, \u201cnor was any time asked by counsel for defendant to reply to said affidavit.\u201d The court denied defendant\u2019s motion to vacate said order of October 31, 1904, and denied the motion for leave to renew said motion to change the place of trial. \u201cThe court, in denying defendant\u2019s motion, said that the additional showing of defendant for a change of venue should have been made in the original affidavit of defendant.\u201d No exception appears to have been taken to the order or decision of the court denying defendant\u2019s motion to set aside the first order, and to permit defendant to serve his motion for a change of the place of trial. Respondent makes the point that the second order is not appealable under section 939, Code of Civil Procedure, and therefore, not having been excepted to, cannot be reviewed. (Citing Code Civ. Proc., sec. 647; <em>Grazidal </em>v. <em>Bastanchure, </em>47 Cal. 167.) It is not necessary to determine the point. At the hearing of the first motion defendant stated in his affidavit that at \u201cthe commencement of the action, and long prior thereto, he was, and ever since has been, a resident of the city and county of San Francisco, \u2019' and \u201cis not now, and never has been, a resident of Glenn county.\u201d The counter-affidavit of plaintiff stated that at the time of the commencement of the action, and at the time summons was served, defendant was a resident of Glenn <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>county and that for several months prior to the commencement of this action the said George F. McKenzie has resided in the county of Glenn and many times stated to plaintiff \u201cthat he intended to reside and make his home in the county of Glenn, and would vote in said county at the election this fall, and intended to register as a voter as such.\u201d The first motion was heard on these two affidavits without objection by defendant, and without asking time to file further affidavits or submit further evidence, and at that hearing defendant made no suggestion of surprise and made no complaint, as he now makes, that plaintiff\u2019s affidavit had not been served upon him prior to the hearing. If he was taken by surprise and desired further time to meet plaintiff\u2019s affidavit he should have made known his desire then and there. His attorney deposed, in support of the second motion, that if he had been given the opportunity to reply to plaintiff\u2019s affidavit he \u201cbelieves that the utter and entire falsity of plaintiff\u2019s affidavit could and would have been shown.\u201d We cannot see that he was deprived of this opportunity, for he did not ask that it be accorded to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">As to the fact of defendant\u2019s residence, Attorney Moody made no statement. Defendant in his second affidavit merely reiterates what he stated in his first affidavit, with the additional statements that he had registered as a voter in the city and county of San Francisco, in July, 1904, which is shown by a copy of his certificate of registration; that he had been a resident of San Francisco for over twenty years and that his business had led him to visit Colusa and Sutter counties in August, 1904, for the purpose of buying broom corn, and, being unable to secure all he required, he went to Glenn county for the same purpose and was there for that purpose alone. He denied making the statements deposed to by plaintiff in his affidavit. There is nothing in the record in support of defendant\u2019s claim of surprise or excusable neglect. No new facts were before the court except as above stated, which were facts tending to corroborate the facts stated in his first affidavit. Defendant may have registered as a voter in San Francisco in July, 1904, and later have changed his residence to Glenn county. His registration in San Francisco was not conclusive as to his residence when the action was brought. The second motion was made on the papers on file, including <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>plaintiff\u2019s affidavit. The question was within the discretion of the court, and we cannot say that there was such abuse of discretion as should compel a reversal of its orders. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">The appeal from the judgment is on the judgment-roll, and it is claimed that certain findings are not within the issues\u2014namely, the finding that there is due the sum of $37.50 for hire of a team, that there is due the sum of $22.50\u201c for the labor of plaintiff\u2019s son, and that there is due the sum of $2.25 for gasoline. The complaint was for \u201cboard' furnished, labor done, and the value of eighteen tons of broom brush.\u201d A demurrer to the complaint on the ground of' ambiguity and uncertainty was overruled, but defendant does not claim error in this regard. We do not think that plaintiff can have greater relief than he prayed for, or on issues not before the court, and hence there is no basis in the complaint for the items mentioned except the item for services of plaintiff\u2019s son. All intendments must be indulged in support of thd judgment. The father is entitled to the services and earnings of his minor son. (Civ. Code, sec. 197.) The evidence under the claim for labor performed may have shown that the son was a minor, and there is no claim that defendant paid the minor. (Civ. Code, sec. 212; <em>Commissioners </em>v. <em>Barnard, </em>98 Cal. 199, [32 Pac. 982]; <em>Rudel </em>v. <em>Los Angeles County, </em>118 Cal. 281, [50 Pac. 400].) We see no reason why the judgment for the other items mentioned in the complaint should not stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">The court found that defendant purchased the broom brush while the broom com was standing in the field and \u201cagreed to cut, harvest, and bale the said crop at his own cost and expense,\u201d and that the crop was to be harvested and baled and paid for at the agreed price on September 15, 1904, and that plaintiff delivered possession of the crop to defendant on or about August 1, 1904; and the court also found that defendant failed to perform the contract on his part in all these particulars. It is claimed that because the court also found that all the broom com was not harvested and baled at the commencement of the suit the cause of action had not accrued. But the court found that the failure of defendant to harvest and bale the crop \u201cwas due to the fault of the said defendant and not to any act or fault of the said plaintiff\u201d; and \u201cthat the plaintiff at the time of the commence<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>ment of this action had performed in every respect the terms of his agreement of sale of said crop.\u201d There is no merit in the claim that the action ivas prematurely commenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">The judgment is modified by deducting therefrom the sum of $39.75, and otherwise it is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">McLaughlin, J., and Buckles, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
