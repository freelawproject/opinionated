The deposition of the informer was not taken by the justice before issuing the warrant, nor do we think the written information verified by her shows the facts necessary to justify the issue of the warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>We are of the opinion, therefore, that the prisoner must be discharged; and it is so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">Gray, P.
