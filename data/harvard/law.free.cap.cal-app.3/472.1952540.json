Section 3 of the act requires that the petition shall contain a statement of the facts constituting such dependency and shall be verified. The fact that the child was without guardianship is only material under the act as applied to one found wandering. The statement that her home is an unfit place for such child is not supported by any other statement of neglect, cruelty or depravity on the part of the person in whose care it was. The petitioner\u2019s affidavit being insufficient to confer jurisdiction, the order of the court is no justification upon the part of the respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">The child, Nellie Mundell, is discharged from the custody of the probation officer, and those in whose charge she has been placed by the said order of the superior court are directed to release her.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">Smith, J., and Gray, P.
