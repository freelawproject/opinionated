The attached property remained in charge of the keeper thus employed until January 1, 1899, during which time, by the negligence or misconduct of the keeper, the property, or much of it, was lost, destroyed and otherwise damaged to the amount of $1,000. And thereafter, the attachment having been released, a suit was brought against the plaintiff by the assignee of Laing for damages on account of the loss, consumption and destruction of the property as aforesaid, and judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>ment recovered against him for the sum of $1,000 and costs, aggregating $1,069.30, which was paid by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">It appears from the evidence, though not alleged in the complaint, that -the defendant was notified of the pendency of that suit and undertook that his attorney should assist in the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">The court finds that all the allegations of the complaint are true; and this finding, we think\u2014though the contrary is contended by the appellant\u2014is fully sustained by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">The principal point urged by the appellant is, that the promise of the defendant\u2014which was admittedly oral\u2014was void under subdivision 2 of section 1624 of the Civil Code. But we are of the opinion that this contention cannot be sustained. The promise of the defendant was his own, made for his own benefit and upon a sufficient consideration moving to him, and he is therefore to be regarded as \u201cthe principal debtor.\u201d (Civ. Code, secs. 1605, 2794, subd. 2.)</p>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">Numerous other points are made by the appellant, but none of these, we think, are of any materiality.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-9\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-10\">Allen, J., and Gray, P. J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
