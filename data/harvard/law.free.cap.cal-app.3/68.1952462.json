(Code Civ. Proc., sec. 1968.) This, it is claimed by the defendant, it failed to do, and this contention, we think, must be sustained. The testimony relied upon for this purpose by the prosecution was that of Roberts, the two Valencias and one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>Hugh Wilson. Roberts testified that he thinks he saw Lopez on the 10th of November at the Smyrna camp, which was about five or six miles from the defendant\u2019s house. Ross Valencia testified that he saw Lopez at the camp between 3 and 4 o\u2019clock P. M., of the 10th, or about sundown, and that he did not see him afterward; but he also testified, in answer to a leading question, that he saw him \u201cafter dark that night.\u201d Abe Valencia testified that he saw Lopez at the camp about 3 or 4 o\u2019clock of that day. Each of these witnesses admits that Lopez could have left the Smyrna camp and not have come back until the next morning. Wilson testified that he met Lopez about a mile east of the Smyrna camp at about half-past 5 o \u2019clock on the morning of the 11th. But none of this testimony is inconsistent with the alleged false testimony of Smith, and it is therefore manifest that it has no tendency in itself \u201cto connect the defendant with the commission of the offense\u201d charged. (Pen. Code, sec. 1111.) It is, indeed, argued for the prosecution that the testimony of Ross Valencia and of Wilson tends to show the falsity of other testimony of the defendant upon the burglary trial. But this we do not think to be true of Valencia\u2019s testimony; and with regard to Wilson\u2019s, though it seems to be incompatible with certain testimony of the defendant on the burglary trial, in which he testified that Lopez left his ranch on the 11th about 10 o \u2019clock, yet the discrepancy is not of a very serious character, and assuming it to be otherwise, it cannot be regarded as corroborating the testimony of Lopez as to the statements of Smith constituting the alleged perjury. Nor could it be expected of the latter that he would come prepared to prove the truth of his testimony on a former trial in a matter not charged to be false.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">We are of the opinion, therefore, that the judgment and order appealed from must be reversed; and it is so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">Gray, P. J., and Allen, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
