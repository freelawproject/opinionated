Grugette was sentenced to five years\u2019 imprisonment, to be suspended with five years\u2019 supervised probation imposed. He was required to make restitution to the SBA in the amount of $50,000. On appeal, Grugette alleges a number of defects in the indictment, trial, and sentencing phases of the proceedings. Finding no reversible merit to Grugette\u2019s contentions, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">The basic offense charged results from the execution of a security agreement pledging the assets of Craine\u2019s Boutique, Inc. (\u201cBoutique\u201d), a requirement for the approval of an SBA-guaranteed loan.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After negotiation questioning the SBA\u2019s requirement<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that the Boutique assets be pledged in connection with an SBA-guaranteed $200,000 loan sought for a sister corporation (Craine\u2019s Lexington Corporation d/b/a Craine\u2019s <em>Furniture </em>Co. \u2014 \u201cFurniture\u201d),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Grugette executed the pledge agreement on behalf of Craine\u2019s Boutique, Inc. Grugette, who did not hold a majority interest in Boutique and who did not call a meeting of Boutique\u2019s board of directors to authorize the pledge, nevertheless executed the instrument under circumstances that a jury could reasonably believe constituted a false representation that he had authority to do so.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b639-13\">After Furniture defaulted on the loan, the SBA discovered that Grugette had not been authorized to pledge Boutique\u2019s assets. The SBA lost approximately $102,000 on the defaulted Furniture loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-14\">Grugette was charged with violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> by falsely representing in an application for an SBA guaranteed loan that he had the authority to pledge all of the assets of the Boutique.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Grugette was found guilty after a jury trial, and sentenced to five years\u2019 imprisonment, to be suspended with five years\u2019 probation. Gru-gette was also required to make restitution to the SBA in the amount of $50,000, a condition of his probation and suspension of sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>Grugette raises several issues on appeal. His claims of insufficiency of the evidence (that he \u201cknowingly and willfully\u201d made the false representation) and of prosecutorial misconduct (side bar remarks, an alleged misstatement, etc.) do not present reversible error on the record and under established jurisprudence of this court. We will discuss below the remaining issues, which relate to: (1) whether the conduct of making a false representation as to the Boutique pledge agreement issued in connection with the loan was included within the conduct described by the indictment that charged that the false representation occurred in an <em>\u201capplication </em>\u201d for an SBA guaranteed loan; (2) whether Grugette\u2019s restitution condition in his suspended sentence violated his equal protection rights; and (3) whether the trial court exceeded its statutory authority to require restitution only of \u201cactual damages or loss caused by the offense,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3651.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">1. <em>The Indictment \u201cApplication\u201d Issue</em></p>\n<p id=\"apy-dedup-0\">The indictment charged that Grugette willfully and knowingly made the false representation <em>\u201cin </em>an <em>application </em>for a business loan submitted to\u201d the SBA (emphasis supplied). Grugette argues that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction because, according to him, the only time that he pledged the Boutique assets was <em>after </em>the application was made and the loan was authorized, and hence not in the <em>application.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">Grugette\u2019s contention that the fraudulent pledge did not occur in his <em>\u201capplication </em>\u201d is also the basis of three other contentions made by him: (1) that there was a fatal variance between the indictment (which charged Grugette with making a false statement only in the loan \u201capplication\u201d), and the proof adduced at trial (which showed .that the allegedly false statement was made after the loan was approved); (2) that the indictment (false statement in an \u201capplication\u201d) should have been quashed for vagueness, in that it did not adequately inform Grugette of the offense charged; and (3) that the trial court erred in instructing the jury that Grugette could be found to violate the relevant statute by using a false \u201cdocument\u201d, when the indictment referred specifically only to an application.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">We find no merit to Grugette\u2019s pervasive technical claim that the allegedly false statement did not occur in an \u201capplication.\u201d The meaning of the term \u201capplication\u201d may reasonably include <em>any </em>document used in connection with the application to obtain approval of the loan, not just the initial document requesting its approval. The pledge of the Boutique assets occurred as a result of the requirement of such a pledge by the SBA as a <em>precondition </em>of its guaranty of the loan, and it could reasonably be considered a part of the application.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> No issue of surprise is involved, if only because from the time of the indictment (as re-enforced when the issue was raised pretrial by an overruled motion to dismiss it), Grugette was fully aware that the conduct charged consisted of his false representation that he had authority to pledge the assets of Boutique, as required for approval of the loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-9\">Accordingly, we find no merit to Gru-gette\u2019s arguments under the present circumstances, insofar as they depend on some technical distinction between Grugette\u2019s initial \u201capplication\u201d for an SBA-guaranteed loan, and the documents submitted to fulfill a precondition imposed by the SBA before its final approval of the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-10\">2. <em>Restitution and Equal Protection</em></p>\n<p id=\"b640-11\">Grugette next argues that the sentence imposed by the trial court violated equal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>protection guarantees, since restitution was required in lieu of imprisonment regardless of Grugette\u2019s ability to pay. Grugette relies on <em>United States v. Jimenez, </em>600 F.2d 1172 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 903, 100 S.Ct. 216, 62 L.Ed.2d 140 (1979). This decision held to be unconstitutional the requirement that the defendant Jiminez repay interpreter\u2019s and appointed counsel\u2019s costs to the government as a condition of his probation, in part because the repayment condition \u201cdoes not provide that repayment will be excused if Jiminez is unable to pay.\u201d 600 F.2d at 1175.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\"><em>Jimenez </em>was in this respect based upon this court\u2019s holding in <em>Barnett v. Hopper, </em>548 F.2d 550 (5th Cir. 1977), <em>vacated as moot, </em>439 U.S. 1041, 99 S.Ct. 714, 58 L.Ed.2d 701 (1978). <em>Barnett </em>held that a ten-year probated sentence conditioned on the payment of a $2,000 fine and court costs, was a denial of equal protection, when Barnett was in fact imprisoned because he could not find the funds to pay the fine: \u201c[T]o imprison an individual when in the same circumstances an individual of financial means would remain free constitutes a denial of equal protection of the laws.\u201d 548 F.2d at 554. <em>Barnett </em>was itself based on the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Tate v. Short, </em>401 U.S. 395, 91 S.Ct. 668, 28 L.Ed.2d 130 (1971) and <em>Williams v. Illinois, </em>399 U.S. 235, 90 S.Ct. 2018, 26 L.Ed.2d 586 (1970). These decisions literally held only that an indigent defendant was denied equal protection where, beyond any statutory provision or limit for imprisonment for the offense, he was required to be jailed solely because he could not find the funds to pay the fine or costs. <em>Barnett </em>viewed their rationale as implicating a denial of equal protection whenever an indigent was imprisoned because he was unable to pay a fine or costs imposed by the sentence, since those financially able to pay the fine selected by the sentencing judge as the appropriate penalty for the offense, or the costs, would be imprisoned, whereas those financially responsible could satisfy such monetary penalty imposed as otherwise appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">At the outset, we note that, unlike the issue in the cited decisions, the issue before us does not concern imprisonment because a convicted defendant is unable to pay a fine or costs because of indigency. The issue before us, rather, concerns whether, as a condition of probation, a convicted defendant may be \u201crequired to make restitution or reparation to aggrieved parties for actual damages or loss caused by the offense for which conviction was had,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3651, a sentencing alternative specifically authorized by the cited statute. It well may be that the use of this sentencing alternative, which in a sense affords a defendant an opportunity to replace an imprisonment punishment by instead making restitution to the victim, does not implicate the same equal protection values that arise when, solely because of indigency, a defendant is nevertheless imprisoned even though the sentencing court has determined that the appropriate penalty should be only a payment of fine or costs. Also, it occurs to us, the use of restitution instead of imprisonment might be effectively aborted as a sentencing alternative, if equal protection values inhibited the use of restitution because it is available only to financially able defendants or to those willing to commit their future energies and earnings to reparation of their victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-8\">Nevertheless, on the present appeal, we need not reach this issue. Even if equal protection values are implicated when restitution is imposed as a condition of probation, Grugette does not present us with an issue ripe for review. He satisfied the restitution requirement, and he has not been imprisoned, nor is he on the face of the present record presented with any threat of imprisonment, as a result of any inability to make the required restitution. In addition, the trial court had before it a presentence report that indicated to the court that Grugette had assets that he could sell to satisfy his immediate debts and that made the restitution requirement feasible for him.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b642-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>3. <em>Repayment of Actual Loss</em></p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">Finally, Grugette argues that the order of restitution exceeded the authority of the trial court in that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3651<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> provides that the court may order restitution only for <em>actual </em>loss under the charge for which the accused is convicted. According to Grugette, the court had no evidence before it on which to base the amount of actual loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">Our review of the record reveals that Grugette admitted that the SBA lost approximately $102,000 on the loan. The trial court required restitution in the amount of $50,000, apparently to reflect the fact that not all the loss was attributable to the assets of Craine\u2019s Boutique, which the jury found that Grugette wrongly pledged.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">We have examined each of Grugette\u2019s contentions and we find Grugette\u2019s contentions to be without reversible merit. Accordingly, we AFFIRM his conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b639-6\">. Grugette apparently owned 25 per cent of the stock of the Boutique, and had a contract with another owner to purchase an additional 25 per cent of the stock. See trial transcript at 361 \u25a0 63. Grugette testified that he owned 50 per cent of the stock in the Boutique. See <em>id. </em>at 503.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b639-7\">. After the initial application by Furniture for the loan, the SBA required the pledge of Boutique\u2019s assets also because they were physically located within the furniture store. Enforcement of a pledge against only Furniture\u2019s assets would obviously involve collection difficulties arising from the commingling and possible defenses that Boutique rather than Furniture assets were involved. In a statement of Boutique\u2019s assets admittedly personally prepared by Grugette in compliance with the SBA requirement that Boutique\u2019s assets be pledged as well as Furnitures\u2019s, Grugette valued Boutique\u2019s inventory as $120,199.53, and its fixtures as $4,434.12.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b639-8\">. Grugette owned an 87% interest in this corporation, which operated Furniture. With relevance to the knowing and willful nature of his conduct in failing to do the same for Boutique\u2019s pledge, his pledge of Furniture\u2019s assets was properly authorized by corporate resolution of the board of directors of Furniture.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b639-15\">. This unauthorized pledge of Boutique\u2019s assets was, of course, invalid. From the testimony of a Boutique stockholder and member of its board of directors, a reasonable inference is permissible that the non-family stockholders and directors of Boutique not only did not know of the pledge, but would not have approved it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b639-16\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-17\">Whoever, in any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the United States knowingly and willfully falsifies, conceals or covers up by any trick, scheme, or device a material fact, or makes any false, fictitious or fraudulent statements or representations, or makes or uses any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or entry, shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b639-18\">. Grugette was also indicted on two other counts of violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001. One count was dismissed before trial on the government\u2019s motion. A defense motion for judgment of acquittal was granted on the other count.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b640-6\">. Grugette is incorrect in implying that this condition was imposed as some sort of afterthought by the SBA <em>after </em>the loan was made. In response to a pre-loan objection by the lending bank made to the SBA\u2019s exaction of this condition the SBA stated <em>(prior </em>to ultimate approval of the guaranty, which approval was after Grugette\u2019s satisfaction of the Boutique-pledge condition), that it \u201cincluded this condition because Craine\u2019s Boutique, Inc., is located within the same facility [as Craine\u2019s Furniture Company] and is approximately 50% owned by Mr. Louie Grugette.\u201d (Gov. ex. no. 6).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b641-6\">. After a discussion among the court, Grugette, and the government, which focused on the pre-sentence report, the court stated that it was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>convinced that Grugette had no resources from which to satisfy the restitution requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-11\">For suggestions that, at least under some statutory provisions permitting the restitution alternative, the trial judge should inquire as to the defendant\u2019s ability to make restitution before it is imposed as a condition of probation, see Annot., 73 A.L.R.3d 1240 (1976 &amp; Supp. 1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b642-12\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3651 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-13\">While on probation and among the conditions thereof, the defendant\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-23\">May be required to make restitution or reparation to aggrieved parties for actual damages or loss caused by the offense for which conviction was had ....</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b642-24\">. <em>See </em>trial transcript 653-55.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-25\">The government argued that because the SBA claimed that the entire loan was contingent on Grugette\u2019s pledge of Boutique assets, restitution in excess of the assets of Craine\u2019s Boutique should be made. According to an unaudited balance sheet contained in the record as Gov. ex. 1-A, Craine\u2019s Boutique had assets of $153,200.61, liabilities of $127,584.90, and shareholders\u2019 equity of $25,615.71.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
