Empire Gas Corp., </em>547 F.2d 1147 (Em.App.1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>430 U.S. 915, 97 S.Ct. 1326, 51 L.Ed.2d 592 (1977), <em>United States v. Pasco Petroleum Co., </em>633 F.2d 956, 958-9 (Em.App.1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>450 U.S. 995, 101 S.Ct. 1698, 68 L.Ed.2d 195 (1981), <em>United States v. Fitch, </em>(Em.App.1982), 676 F.2d 673, <em>United States v. Pel-Star Energy, Inc., </em>(Em.App.1982), 670 F.2d 1032, 1033, <em>United States v. Wickland, </em>619 F.2d 75 (Em.App.1980), <em>United States v. First City National Bank of El Paso, </em>598 F.2d 594 (Em.App.1979), <em>United States v. Southwest National Bank, </em>598 F.2d 600 (Em.App.1979), <em>United States v. Bell, </em>564 F.2d 953 (Em.App.1977). The subpoenas in question are valid and were properly enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-25\">Moreover, the contentions of Appellants that the DOE audit policy statement barred the issuance and enforcement of the subpoenas in question overlooks the fact that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1082\">*1082</page-number>when read as a whole with the preamble <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> published contemporaneously therewith, 43 Fed.Reg. 27,777, the policy applies to resellers of <em>petroleum products </em>but for expressed reasons clearly excepts from its operation resellers of <em>crude oil, </em>which Appellants are.</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-4\">\u201cBasically, the power to compel the production of the records of any organization arises out of the inherent and necessary power of the federal and state governments to enforce their laws.. .. \u201d <em>United States v. White, </em>322 U.S. 694, at 701, 64 S.Ct. 1248, at 1252, 88 L.Ed. 1542 (1944), quoted in <em>United States v. Empire Gas Corp., supra, </em>at 1153. The learned district judge in <em>Empire Gas Corp. </em>correctly stated: \u201cIt is . . . significant that the applicability of the regulations to respondents cannot be determined until the information sought by subpoena is made available to the [DOE] investigators.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1120-5\">The orders and judgments of the District Court in the above-captioned appeals, Nos. 5-71/5-77 and 5-72, should be affirmed and these appeals dismissed. IT IS SO ORDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1120-15\"> <em>Wiggins Bros., Inc., et al. v.
