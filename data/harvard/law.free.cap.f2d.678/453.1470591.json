Pfeifer in a third-party negligence action under the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. The major question presented is whether the district court erred in applying the \u201ctotal offset method\u201d as a federal rule of damages, wherein the discount factor used to reduce future earnings to present worth is presumed offset by future inflation. We find no error and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-14\">Pfeifer was employed by appellant Jones &amp; Laughlin (J&amp;L) as a landing helper on its coal barges. On January 13, 1978, he slipped and fell because of ice and snow that had accumulated on the gunnel of a barge on which he was working. He struck a barge rail and landed on his tailbone, and a heavy electric motor that he was carrying fell in his lap. He has not returned to work since the accident. He has been examined by a number of physicians, several of whom testified at the trial, and he has undergone extensive physical therapy.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-15\">The district court found that appellant was negligent and that its negligence was the proximate cause of Pfeifer\u2019s accident and resulting injury. It determined further that Pfeifer was completely disabled from the date of the accident until July 1, 1979, and that thereafter he was capable of doing \u201clight work\u201d and lifting weights of up to twenty-five pounds, but that he could not work on the river. Appellant has not offered Pfeifer a job of any type since his injury, and the parties have not discussed the availability of a light duty position.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-16\">Relying on our decisions in <em>Griffith v. Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corp., </em>610 F.2d 116 (3d Cir. 1979), <em>vacated, </em>451 U.S. 965, 101 S.Ct. 2038, 68 L.Ed.2d 343 (1981), <em>reinstated on remand, </em>657 F.2d 25 (3d Cir. 1981), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>50 U.S.L.W. 3377 (1981) (No. 81-826); and in <em>Blair v. United States Steel Corp., </em>444 F.2d 1390 (3d Cir. 1971) (per curiam), <em>cert. denied, </em>404 U.S. 1018, 92 S.Ct. 681, 30 L.Ed.2d 666 (1972), the district court determined vhat as a vessel owner <em>pro hac vice, </em>appellant was liable for negligence under \u00a7 5(b) of the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (LHWCA), 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 905(b). In measuring damages, it declined to consider future wage increases or to discount the award to present value, citing <em>Kaczkowski v. Bolubasz, </em>491 Pa. 561,421 A.2d 1027 (1980). The court multiplied Pfeifer\u2019s 1978 annual wage by his work life expectancy, deducted the amount of compensation Pfeifer had received under LHWCA, and subtracted his projected earnings at minimum wage from July 1, 1979, until his sixty-fifth birthday, taking judicial notice that the federal minimum wage at the time of the accident was $2.90 per hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-17\">On appeal, J&amp;L does not challenge the district court\u2019s findings that it was negligent and that its negligence was the proximate cause of Pfeifer\u2019s injury, nor does it contend that it was not correctly found to be an owner <em>pro hac vice </em>under the standards set forth in <em>Biair, </em>444 F.2d at 1391. It argues, however, that because Pfeifer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>was its employee he does not have a cause of action for negligence under \u00a7 5(b) of LHWCA. It argues also that the district court erred in applying the Pennsylvania damages test of <em>Kaczkowski, </em>and further in factoring damages on the basis of the minimum wage rate instead of wages for light duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">We quickly dispose of appellant\u2019s argument that the district court erred in allowing Pfeifer to proceed in a negligence action against his own employer under \u00a7 5(b) of LHWCA. J&amp;L reads \u00a7 5(a) as an absolute limitation on a longshoreman\u2019s right to sue his employer under \u00a7 5(b): unless the employer has failed to secure payment of compensation as required by \u00a7 4 of LHWCA, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 904, it cannot be held liable as a third party under \u00a7 5(b). We carefully considered the identical argument in light of the 1972 LHWCA amendments in <em>Griffith v. Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corp., </em>521 F.2d 31, 38-44 (3d Cir. 1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>423 U.S. 1054, 96 S.Ct. 785, 46 L.Ed.2d 643 (1976) <em>(Griffith </em>I); and we concluded that we remain bound by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Reed </em>v. <em>The Yaka, </em>373 U.S. 410, 83 S.Ct. 1349, 10 L.Ed.2d 448 (1963), which held that \u00a7 5(a) (then \u00a7 5) does not bar a suit against an owner <em>pro hac vice </em>who also is an employer liable for compensation. <em>Griffith </em>I requires us to reject J&amp;L\u2019s argument in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">Appellant next argues that the district court erred in its calculation of damages by applying the rule announced in <em>Kaczkowski v. Bolubasz, </em>491 Pa. 561, 421 A.2d 1027 (1980). It contends that damages in an LHWCA case must be computed according to a uniform federal standard; and that federal law requires that a lump sum award for lost future earnings be reduced to present value, a practice effectively abolished in Pennsylvania by the decision in <em>Kaczkowski. </em>To meet this contention, we must explore the developing law of damages in state and federal decisions in light of controlling legal precepts and prevailing economic conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-10\">But first we must make the preliminary determination of what precise aspect of the damage issue has been preserved for appeal. Our examination of the record persuades us that appellant has not preserved for review its contention that the court erred in applying Pennsylvania law because it felt obliged to apply state law, rather than federal law. It was the plaintiff\u2019s position at trial that federal law controlled damages and that inflation was a valid consideration under federal law. Appellant did not seem to challenge this position except to suggest that evidence of inflation had to be introduced by expert testimony and that future earnings had to be reduced to present worth:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-11\">MR. MURDOCH: We\u2019re here today under a Federal statute under Federal law and I don\u2019t think that the finding of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in the recent case regarding not reducing damages to present worth is applicable in this particular case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-12\">THE COURT: We may have to have a little argument on that at some point.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-13\">MR. MURDOCH: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-14\">MR. LIBENSON: Under Federal law, you can add inflation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-15\">MR. MURDOCH: If we have expert testimony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-16\">THE COURT: That\u2019s -a little bit down the road and we\u2019ll wait on that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-17\">App. at 43a.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-18\">Standing alone, the court\u2019s damages discussion in its opinion, <em>id. </em>at 492 \u2014 93a, may be considered ambiguous; without more, it could be argued that the court was of the view that although this was a federal claim brought in a federal court in Pennsylvania it was required to apply the state law of damages. But when the opinion is read in conjunction with the earlier dialogue between the court and counsel, we are persuaded that the court applied federal law and that the dispute between the parties at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>trial was limited to the proper federal measure of damages. We conclude that appellant has preserved for review only the question of the proper elements in the federal law of damages under the circumstances of this case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It is to this analysis that we now turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">Our starting point is the recognition that Article III, \u00a7 2 of the Constitution, in extending the judicial power of the United States \u201cto all Cases of admiralty and maritime Jurisdiction,\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-6\">referred to a system of law coextensive with, and operating uniformly in, the whole country. It certainly could not have been intended to place the rules and limits of maritime law under the disposal and regulation of the several States, as that would have defeated the uniformity and consistency at which the Constitution aimed on all subjects of a commercial character affecting the intercourse of the States with each other or with foreign states.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-11\"><em>Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen, </em>244 U.S. 205, 215, 37 S.Ct. 524, 528, 6 L.Ed. 1086 (1917) (quoting <em>The Lottawanna, </em>88 U.S. (21 Wall.) 558, 575, 22 L.Ed. 654 (1875)).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We must, therefore, apply a uniform federal rule; and our decision is not controlled, as in diversity cases, by the law of the underlying state.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-12\">This recognition is not the end of the analysis, however, but only the beginning. It is not unusual for a federal court to borrow substantive state law and adopt it as federal law. As expressed by Justice Jackson, a federal court addressing a federal question that cannot be answered by reference to federal statutes alone is \u201cfree to apply the traditional common-law technique of decision and to draw upon all the sources of the common law.\u201d <em>D\u2019Oench, Duhme &amp; Co. v. F.D.I.C., </em>315 U.S. 447, 472, 62 S.Ct. 676, 686, 86 L.Ed. 956 (1942) (concurring opinion); <em>see id. </em>at 469, 62 S.Ct. at 684.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> No rule of state law applies of its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>own force to compel a particular decision; but we may resort to a rule derived from any source, state, federal, or foreign, if its intrinsic wisdom commends it to the case at hand. Once we have transplanted to federal soil a rule previously adopted by a state court, however, it takes on a new life of its own and grows independently of further modifications or refinements announced by the court which first gave it root. <em>See Textile Workers Union v. Lincoln Mills, </em>353 U.S. 448, 457, 77 S.Ct. 923, 1 L.Ed.2d 972 (1957); <em>D\u2019Oench, Duhme, </em>315 U.S. at 469, 62 S.Ct. at 684. (Jackson, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">Accordingly, we find no jurisprudential impediment to adoption of the state measure of damages. We now turn to prudential and consequential considerations, and we must respect the important concerns of consistency and coherence in the law of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">Prior to 1980, the Pennsylvania law of damages for torts did not take into account the pernicious presence of inflation. Thus in 1976 the Pennsylvania Superior Court was of the view that \u201cthe erratic behavior of the economy over the past half dozen years, plagued by war and other unusual circumstances, is not a sufficient demonstration that inflation at any predictable rate will continue for another twenty years.\u201d It thus dismissed consideration of inflation as \u201cspeculative.\u201d <em>Havens v. Ton-ner, </em>243 Pa.Super. 371, 378, 365 A.2d 1271, 1274 (1976). In 1980, however, Pennsylvania\u2019s highest court concluded, \u201cin light of clear scientific evidence of the fact that inflation ... [has] become an established part of our economy,\u201d that this factor must be considered in awarding damages for lost future earnings. <em>Kaczkowski, </em>491 Pa. at 566-67, 421 A.2d at 1030.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It held that continued judicial refusal to recognize the impact of inflation, while maintaining the practice of discounting lump sum awards to \u201calleged present value,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 570, 421 A.2d at 1032, would \u201cignore our responsibility to attempt to \u2018graduate the amount of the damage award exactly to the extent of the loss.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 571, 421 A.2d at 1032 (quoting <em>Forsyth v. Palmer, </em>14 Pa. 96, 97 (1850)).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-11\">In a most persuasive opinion, replete with relevant and credible economic data, <em>see, e.g., id. </em>at 572-74 nn. 11-15, 580-81, 421 A.2d at 1033 nn. 11-15, 1037, the court declared:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-12\">Despite the uninformed belief of the <em>[Havens </em>] court, inflation and productivity factors are not speculative and are capable of definition and prediction by economic experts. For decades, economists have been refining tools to forecast economic growth and have used these tools with proven accuracy. Sophisticated economic forecasts are relied upon by every major government agency, corporation, and financial institution. These forecasts are based upon all that is known in the American economy and despite small tolerances of error, these projections have been accurate in the past. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number><em>See, District of Columbia v. Barriteau, </em>D.C.App., 399 A.2d 563, 566 (1979). Thus, there exists a reasonable basis in fact for this court to consider the impact of inflation and productivity on lost future earnings. A court has a responsibility to the citizenry to keep abreast of changes in our society. In light of the recognized acceptance of the science of economics, the courts of this Commonwealth can no longer maintain their ostrich-like stance and deny the admissibility and relevancy of reliable economic data concerning the impact of productivity and inflation on lost future earnings. Indeed, to ignore economic realities and presume that there will be no changes in an individual\u2019s future earnings because of such factors is further removed from reality than any variance that may result from our efforts to predict these factors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b497-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 572, 421 A.2d at 1032-33.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">But the 1980 Pennsylvania decision was not without formidable precedent. In the post World War I inflationary period, over a half century ago, the Vermont Supreme Court cited extensive authority for considering inflation in awarding damages:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9Y\">The result sought by the law in assessing damages in [tort] cases is compensation \u2014 so far as a money payment can\u2014 the ascertainment of such a sum as will compensate the plaintiff for the injury. Necessarily, damages are to be expressed in terms of money. ... As a medium of exchange, its value appreciates or depreciates according to the rise and fall in commodity prices. So it is that, at least so far as those elements of damages properly classed as pecuniary losses \u2014 like loss of time, loss of earning power, expenses and the like \u2014 are concerned, it is proper for the jury to take into consideration the fact, known to everybody, that the purchasing power of money is at present seriously impaired.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b497-10\"><em>Halloran v. New England Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., </em>95 Vt. 273, 274, 115 A. 143, 144 (1921).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b497-11\">Moreover, state judges have not been alone in recognizing, in Justice Roberts\u2019 words, that \u201cthe orderly development of the law must be responsive to new conditions and to the persuasion of superior reasoning.\u201d <em>Griffith v. United Air Lines, Inc., </em>416 Pa. 1, 23, 203 A.2d 796, 806 (1964). Over 20 years ago, in a case under the Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act, Judge Friendly wrote that \u201cthere is little or no authority in favor of charging the jury to take future inflation into account,\u201d but he recognized that \u201cthere are few who do not regard some degree of continuing inflation as here to stay and would be willing to translate their own earning power into a fixed annuity.\u201d <em>McWeeney v. New York, N. H. &amp; H. R. R. Co., </em>282 F.2d 34, 38 (2d Cir.) (in banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>364 U.S. 870, 81 S.Ct. 115, 5 L.Ed.2d 93 (1960). Eleven years later, in a longshoreman\u2019s personal injury case, Judge Friendly noted that \u201cif inflation should continue at its present pace, courts may have to reconsider the propriety of the long recognized charge with respect to discount.\u201d <em>Yodice v. Koninklijke Nederlandsche Stoomboot Maatschappij, </em>443 F.2d 76, 79 (2d Cir. 1971) (citing <em>McWeeney).</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>More recently, in <em>Doca v. Marina Mercante Nicaraguense, S.A., </em>634 F.2d 30, 36 (2d Cir. 1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>451 U.S. 971,101 S.Ct. 2049, 68 L.Ed.2d 351 (1981), a second circuit panel in an LHWCA case surveyed the economic literature demonstrating the persistence of strong inflationary pressures and held that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>\u201cinflation should be considered in estimating the present value of lost future wages.\u201d <em>See also, e.g., Steckler v. United States, </em>549 F.2d 1372, 1375-78 (10th Cir. 1977) (Federal Tort Claims Act); <em>Freeport Sulphur Co. v. S/S Hermosa, </em>526 F.2d 300, 308-11 (5th Cir. 1976) (Wisdom, J., specially concurring) (admiralty); and <em>United States v. English, </em>521 F.2d 63, 72-76 (9th Cir. 1975) (Tort Claims Act). And the virulent influence of inflation was strikingly brought home to federal judges in <em>The Report of the Commission on Executive, Legislative, and Judicial Salaries </em>(December, 1980) at 7-9. The report disclosed the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-4\">* From 1969 to 1980, the Consumer price index rose by more than 130 per cent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-5\">* During the same period, the Hourly Earnings Index, which reflects wage rates in the private, non-farm economy, also rose by more than 130 per cent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-6\">* The 1980 $57,500 salary for U.S. Circuit Judges amounted to $24,400 in terms of 1969 dollars or a reduction of 43 per cent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">Notwithstanding the reticence of the courts in an earlier era, it cannot be argued effectively today that inflation has been only a temporary phenomenon on the American scene. If this reality of modern economic life can be considered in calculating damages without resorting to speculation, it should be conceded that when relevant, consideration of inflation qualifies under the criteria of \u201cjustice,\u201d \u201ccommon sense,\u201d and \u201cpublic policy\u201d generally used by the courts in evaluating the consequences of embracing a new and attractive rule of law \u2014 what legal philosophers are wont to describe as \u201cutilitarian\u201d in the Benthamite scale of supposedly measurable aggregates of pleasures and pains.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> If the spectre of \u201cspeculation\u201d is removed, a matter we shall address later, our immediate task is to determine whether the <em>Kaczkowski </em>formula is congruent with the federal law of damages in maritime cases. We believe it is.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-9\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-10\">The relevant federal law of damages is familiar and uncomplicated, and is not materially different from comparable state law. This court carefully surveyed the case law and delineated the permissible elements of recovery in <em>Downie v. United States Lines Co., </em>359 F.2d 344, 347-48 (3d Cir.) (in banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>385 U.S. 897, 87 S.Ct. 201, 17 L.Ed.2d 130 (1966). We adhered in that decision to the general rule that a seaman injured by the tortious conduct of his employer is entitled to an award of damages commensurate with the nature and extent of his injuries. He is entitled to reimbursement for his loss of earnings, past and prospective; for any impairment of his earning capacity; for medical expenses incurred and to be incurred; and for any other economic loss he may have sustained or is likely to sustain. He is also entitled to redress for his physical injury, including the effects thereof, such as pain, suffering, mental anguish, discomfort, and inconvenience. If the injuries are permanent and result in an impairment of earning capacity, he may recover damages for such impairment, including (but not limited to) his probable loss of future earnings. Damages resulting from the impairment of earning capacity and the probable loss of earnings must be measured on the basis of life expectancy at the time of injury. The award must be based upon the probable pecuniary loss reduced to its present net worth. The injured worker is also entitled to compensation, again based on life expectancy at the time of the injury, for the physical and mental effects of the injury on his ability to engage in those activities which normally contribute to the enjoyment of life, including, for example, his avocations. The specific elements of such an award necessarily depend upon the proofs. There are no precise criteria by which these elements may be evaluated, but they are measurable to the same extent as pain, suffering, and mental anguish.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-11\">Full compensation for lost prospective earnings is most difficult, if not impossible, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>to attain if the court is blind to the realities of the consumer price index and the recent historical decline of purchasing power. Thus if we recognize, as we must, that the injured worker is entitled to reimbursement for his loss of future earnings, an honest and accurate calculation must consider the stark reality of inflationary conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">What had troubled the courts for years was the speculative nature of predicting future inflationary trends. The Pennsylvania Court has not only recognized this problem but met it head on by adopting what is known as the \u201ctotal offset method,\u201d a variation of methods introduced by the federal district court in <em>Feldman v. Allegheny Airlines, Inc., </em>382 F.Supp. 1271 (D.Conn.1974), <em>aff\u2019d in pertinent part, </em>524 F.2d 384 (2d Cir. 1975), and the Alaska Supreme Court in <em>Beaulieu v. Elliott, </em>434 P.2d 665 (1967), and <em>State v. Guinn, </em>555 P.2d 530 (1976). The total offset method avoids the danger of speculating as to the future rate of inflation by making what we consider a very sensible accommodation: it assumes that in the long run the effects of future inflation and the discount rate will co-vary significantly with the other. <em>See </em>authorities cited in <em>Kaczkowski, </em>491 Pa. at 581, 421 A.2d at 1037. Moreover, we are impressed by the pragmatic considerations embraced by the Pennsylvania court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-7\">An additional virtue of the total offset method is its contribution to judicial efficiency. Litigators are freed from introducing and verifying complex economic data. Judge and juries are not burdened with complicated, time consuming economic testimony. Finally, by eliminating the variables of inflation and future interest rates from the damage calculation, the ultimate award is more predictable. <em>Id. </em>at 583, 421 A.2d at 1038.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">We are impressed by the \u201ctotal offset method\u201d because it both accommodates the reality of inflation and bids fealty to the concept of reducing future earnings to present worth. It makes a judgment\u2014 evaluative to be sure, but no better or no worse than the varying prognostications of expert witnesses \u2014 that the rate of future inflation will be equivalent to future interest rates. From a pragmatic viewpoint, lost future earnings need not be discounted to present value, although the formula calls for a theoretical reduction to present worth, because the inflation and discount rates are legally presumed to be equal and cancel one another.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-10\">We find the foregoing analysis coherent and consistent with the elements of damages discussed in previous case law. It does not contradict valid and binding rules of our court. The total offset formula embodies the continued requirement of reduction to present worth, <em>see Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Railway Co. v.

Indeed, by eliminating the discount factor from the jury\u2019s or the court\u2019s calculations, the total offset method will tend to eliminate the necessity for speculation, to introduce greater certainty into the parties\u2019 own calculations, and thereby perhaps to facilitate settlement of personal injury claims without the necessity of judicial intervention. We therefore hold that the district court did not err in computing damages for the loss of future earnings, because it is not necessary to go through the process of discounting lump sum awards to theoretical present value; the discount factor is presumed equal to and offset by the impact of inflation on the future economic value of the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-11\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-12\">Appellant\u2019s final contention is a challenge to the factual predicate of the court\u2019s computation of projected earnings. It argues that the court erred in using the minimum wage as a factor instead of the wage J&amp;L pays its light duty employees. At bottom this is a question of fact finding reviewed under the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard. Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a); <em>see Krasnov v. Dinan, </em>465 F.2d 1298, 1302-03 (3d Cir. 1972).

For a reviewing court to determine that there is reversible error, three critical prerequisites must be implicated in the judicial error-correcting process. It is necessary that there be (a) specific acts or omissions by the trial court constituting legal error, (b) properly suggested as error to the trial court, and (c) if uncorrected on that level, then properly presented for review to the appellate court. For there to be <em>reversible </em>error, it is mandatory for the appellant properly to identify the error to the trial court and to suggest a legally appropriate course of action. The reasons for this requirement go to the heart of the common law tradition and the adversary system. It affords an opportunity for correction and avoidance in the trial court in various ways: it gives the adversary the opportunity either to avoid the challenged action or to present a reasoned defense of the trial court\u2019s action; and it provides the trial court with the alternative of altering or modifying a decision or of ordering a more fully developed record for review. This philosophy is embodied in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Thus, Rule 46 requires a party to \u201cmak[e] known to the court the action which he desires the court to take or his objection to the action <em>and his grounds therefor.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b495-8\">. <em>See also Pope &amp; Talbot, Inc. v.

Inflation gains are measured in terms of what the average person refers to as \u201ccost of living increases.\u201d An example of inflation evidencing an increase in prices unrelated to an increase in intrinsic value is that the juice content of oranges has not increased in years, but their price continues to rise.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-14\">The presence of inflation plays two distinct roles in an award for prospective damages. The first role is determining the impact of inflation on the future earnings of the victim. The second place in which inflation plays a part is in determining the appropriate interest rate to discount the future damage award to its present value.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b496-15\">491 Pa. at 565 n.4, 421 A.2d at 1029 n.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b497-7\">.

Although it may be that economic conditions warrant this dramatic change in our system of calculating damages, the presence at this time of very high interest rates and substantially reduced inflation would suggest caution in adopting a rule that appears to be premised on some immutable relationship between interest and inflation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Even if the newly-adopted damages rule is appropriate under today\u2019s economic situation, institution of the rule is a matter of unusual importance that merits consideration by the full Court. Moreover, because the rule implicates interests and affects parties in a wide range of litigation settings, rehearing in banc would provide an opportunity for this Court to consider amicus briefs from other groups concerned with the damages rule.

Other Courts of Appeals have considered the problem of accounting for inflation in damage awards, and have arrived at outcomes that are somewhat at variance with the rule adopted here. The Second Circuit, for example, after reviewing economic literature in the field, ruled that damage awards should still be discounted to reflect a \u201creal\u201d interest rate, untainted by inflation, estimated at about one to two percent. <em>Doca v.
