The document evidencing the transaction provided that the amount financed was $1701.61, the finance charge was $458.39 and the total of payments was $2160.00. It also stated that the total of payments was the sum of the amount financed and the finance charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-9\">Under the heading \u201cSecurity Interest,\u201d the document gave Rainier:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-10\">\u201ca security interest under the Uniform Commercial Code in the property described below and in the proceeds thereof to secure the payment in cash of the Total of Payments <em>and all other amounts due or to become due hereunder </em>in accordance with .. . the Security Agreement set forth on the reverse side hereof which is incorporated herein by reference.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-11\">The security agreement referred to on the reverse side of the document provided that if Rainier insured the collateral on the Onadekos\u2019 behalf they would reimburse Rainier for the cost of the insurance. The document also required the Onadekos to pay any delinquency charges and collection costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-12\">Regulation Z requires the creditor to disclose:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-13\">\u201cA description or identification of the type of any security interest ... [it holds, retains, or acquires], and a clear identification of the property to which the security interest relates .... If after-acquired property will be subject to the security interest, or if other or future indebtedness is or may be secured by any such property, this fact shall be clearly set forth in conjunction with the description or identification of the type of security interest . .. . \u201d 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226.-8(b)(5).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-15\">Federal Reserve Board Official Staff Interpretation FC-0136 states that charges such as delinquency charges, collection costs, and costs of insuring or maintaining the collateral are not \u201cfuture indebtedness\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 226.8(b)(5). The FRB interpretation, however, requires the creditor to properly disclose that the customer\u2019s obligations are secured by adequately identified collateral. FRB Official Staff Interpretation FC-0136, Consumer Credit Guide (CCH) H 31,743 (November 22, 1977). Federal Reserve Board Official Staff Interpretations are dispositive if they are not irrational. <em>See Ford Motor Credit Co. v. Milhollin, </em>444 U.S. 555, 565-69, 100 S.Ct. 790, 796-98, 63 L.Ed.2d 22 (1980). The parties here do not argue that FC-0136 is irrational.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-16\">Federal Reserve Board Official Staff Interpretation FC-0136 requires a creditor to disclose in some form that charges other than the total of payments are also secured by the security interest. If, in fact, other charges that might be assessed are also secured, a creditor who discloses merely that the security interest secures the total of payments (i.e., principal plus interest) does not properly disclose that the customer\u2019s obligations are secured under FC-0136.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-17\">Rainier\u2019s particular phrase is sufficiently clear to comply with \u00a7 226.8(bX5). Because the document specifies the other charges that might arise, the phrase \u201cand all other amounts due or to become due <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>hereunder\u201d is not so confusing that a reasonable borrower would fail to understand it. <em>See Wilson v. Credithrift of America, Inc., No. S, </em>659 F.2d 122,124 (9th Cir. 1981). Nor was there evidence that the Onadekos were actually confused.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">The magistrate found Rainier\u2019s phrase confusing because it could be read as a cross-collateral clause. However, such a reading would be implausible. The document\u2019s use of the word \u201chereunder\u201d makes it clear that the collateral secures only indebtedness arising out of the current loan. The document also adequately specifies the collateral securing the Onadekos\u2019 indebtedness. It states that the security interest is \u201cin the property described below and in the proceeds thereof,\u201d and there are checks in the boxes for \u201chousehold goods, furniture and personal property\u201d and \u201cMotor Vehicle(s).\u201d Thus, Rainier\u2019s phrase constitutes proper disclosure that the Onadekos\u2019 obligations are secured and it complies with \u00a7 226.8(b)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
