MARTIN, Jr., Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b692-11\">Edgar Gibson appeals the denial of social security disability benefits. Gibson, aged fifty-nine, is a former truck driver and construction machinery operator. He alleges that he became disabled \u201cabout 1968\u201d from respiratory disease, high blood pressure, and psychological problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-12\">This case represents Gibson\u2019s second attempt to obtain disability benefits. The record reveals that he filed a previous application for benefits on September 3, 1971. That application was denied on June 8,1972 and was not appealed. Gibson\u2019s non-disability as of June 8,1972 is therefore established as a matter of res <em>judicata. Maddox v. Richardson, </em>464 F.2d 617 (6th Cir. 1972). Gibson last met the special earnings requirements of the Act on June 30, 1972. In order to prevail on the present claim, he must show that he became totally disabled between June 8, 1972 and June 30, 1972.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-14\">Our standard of review on appeal is whether there is substantial evidence in the record, viewed as a whole, to support the Secretary\u2019s determination. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g), section 205(g) of the original Act. In <em>Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 401, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 1427, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971), the Supreme Court elaborated on the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-15\">[W]e turn to the statutory standard of \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d prescribed by \u00a7 205(g). The Court has considered this very concept in other, yet similar, contexts. The National Labor Relations Act, \u00a7 10(e), in its original form, provided that the NLRB\u2019s findings of fact \u201cif supported by evidence, shall be conclusive.\u201d 49 Stat. 454. The Court said this meant \u201csupported by substantial evidence\u201d and that this was \u201cmore than a mere scintilla. It means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Consolidated Edison Co. v. NLRB, </em>305 U.S. 197, 229, [59 S.Ct. 206, 216, 83 L.Ed. 126, 140] (1938). The Court has adhered to that definition in varying statutory situations. See <em>NLRB v. Columbian Enameling &amp; Stamping Co., </em>306 U.S. 292, 300, [59 S.Ct. 501, 505, 83 L.Ed. 660, 665] (1939); <em>Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, </em>340 U.S. 474, 477-487, [71 S.Ct. 456, 459-63, 95 L.Ed. 456, 461-467] (1951); <em>Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, </em>383 U.S. 607, 619-620, [86 S.Ct. 1018, 1026, 16 L.Ed.2d 131, 140] (1966).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b692-16\">Of particular importance to Mr. Gibson\u2019s case is the requirement that he establish the onset of disability <em>prior to </em>the expiration of his insured status. <em>LeMaster v. Weinbur-ger, </em>533 F.2d 337 (6th Cir. 1976). We have reviewed the record below and conclude that there was substantial evidence to support the Secretary\u2019s finding that Gibson failed to carry this burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>The medical evidence establishes that the claimant suffers from respiratory disease. However, in weighing this evidence, the Secretary could reasonably have decided that Gibson was not disabled in 1972. The first report of Dr. Hobe, claimant\u2019s treating physician, indicates that as of 1971, Gibson\u2019s asthma was responding well to treatment and was under control. Four years later, in 1976, Dr. Hobe did characterize his patient\u2019s respiratory problem as \u201csevere,\u201d however, he appended to his report the comment \u201cI am not certain as to why [Gibson] quit work.\u201d The Secretary could logically have interpreted this observation to mean that Dr. Hobe did not consider his patient too ill to engage in some gainful employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">At the administrative hearing, a vocational expert testified that an individual with Gibson\u2019s personal characteristics and alleged impairments would be capable of sedentary work in a clean environment. The expert further indicated the availability of such jobs.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">Thus, although there is other medical evidence in the record which paints a gloomier picture of Mr. Gibson\u2019s health in 1972, we cannot find that the Secretary\u2019s conclusion was unsupported by \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">A similar situation obtains with respect to Mr. Gibson\u2019s alleged psychological impairment. The evidence does demonstrate that the claimant suffers from psychological problems; that evidence is not, however, so unequivocal that the Secretary was required, as a matter of law, to enter a finding of disability as of June, 1972.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-8\">Finally, we agree with the appellee that Gibson\u2019s participation in the S.S.I. program does not compel a reversal of the decision below. Claimant, who received Ohio State disability benefits, was \u201cgrandfathered\u201d into the S.S.I. program in 1973. This is not, however, conclusive of the issue of disability for purposes of the present matter, for the definition of \u201cdisability\u201d contained in the Social Security Act is more rigorous than its counterpart under the old Ohio State Plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-9\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
