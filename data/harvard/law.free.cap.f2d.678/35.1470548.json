Lamar Skelton brought this suit under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552, to compel disclosure of material deleted from documents furnished him in response to a FOIA request. The district court granted summary judgment for the defendant agency, the United States Postal Service. Still seeking disclosure of material deleted from a single document, plaintiff appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-20\">I. <em>Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b92-21\">Skelton is a former employee of the Fort Worth post office. He retired from the Service on disability pay after suffering a work-related injury. Since his retirement, he has spent much time representing other postal employees or former employees in pursuing various claims against the agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>On April 5, 1978, Skelton went to the Fort Worth post office with another former employee, Jerald Miller. The two wished to see employment records pertaining to a compensation claim that Miller was pursuing. Two employees in the personnel office, Slaten and Saul, gave Skelton and Miller all the records they requested except for medical records. Slaten and Saul told Skelton and Miller to go to the separate medical unit to obtain those records.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\">According to Skelton\u2019s account, he and Miller went to the medical unit and found it closed. They returned to the personnel office and asked a nurse, Goodson, to get the records for them. When she declined to do so, Skelton reminded her that he had made an appointment to view the records and said that he should not be kept waiting indefinitely. Lanier Luttrell, the director of personnel, intervened and told Skelton not to interfere with his workers. When Skelton attempted to persuade Luttrell to honor his scheduled appointment and initiate efforts to produce the records, Luttrell ordered Skelton and Miller to leave the personnel office.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">According to Luttrell\u2019s account, Skelton had ordered Goodson to stop what she was doing and immediately procure the records. When she failed to do so, Skelton \u201cbegan to talk down to her in a very loud voice and acted in a tyranical [sic] manner.\u201d His actions disrupted the business of the office and startled non-employees who were on the premises. Luttrell intervened and told Skelton that if he filled out a proper, written request for the records they would be retrieved. Skelton persisted in arguing and Luttrell told him to leave the office. Skel-ton remained and continued to argue until Luttrell indicated that he was about to phone for assistance to have Skelton removed by force.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">Two days later, Skelton wrote a letter to the agency\u2019s Consumer Advocate complaining about the incident and requesting that the agency take internal disciplinary action against Luttrell, Goodson, Slaten, and Saul. He charged each of the four with various violations of the code of conduct for postal employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">Because disciplinary matters are not handled by the Consumer Advocate\u2019s office, that office referred Skelton\u2019s letter to the agency\u2019s department of employee and labor relations. On May 25, 1978, Robert B. Gould, the Regional Director of Employee and Labor Relations for the Southern Region of the Postal Service, wrote to Skelton and informed him that \u201c[t]he matter has been thoroughly reviewed and <em>based on the report we received </em>no further action is deemed warranted in the matter\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-8\">Skelton then filed the FOIA request that is the subject of this lawsuit. He requested all records relating to his letter of complaint and the agency\u2019s decision not to take disciplinary action. Within two weeks, the agency produced the requested documents, but it deleted a section from a memorandum by Luttrell. While the parts of the Luttrell memorandum giving Luttrell\u2019s version of the incident were disclosed, the deleted section contained material which the agency accurately described in an interrogatory as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-9\">the opinions of Lanier Luttrell concerning: Plaintiff\u2019s activities representing present and former postal employees in various types of disputes with the Postal Service; of his motivations for assuming such representation; of Plaintiff\u2019s relations with the personnel at the Fort Worth Post Office; and of the administrative burden imposed on the Post Office by its obligation to respond to Plaintiff\u2019s Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and Privacy Act (P.A.) requests.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b93-11\">In its letter transmitting the documents, the agency claimed that the deleted material was exempt from disclosure under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-12\">After an unsuccessful administrative appeal, Skelton brought this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-13\">II. <em>Exemption 5</em></p>\n<p id=\"b93-14\">The district court upheld the agency\u2019s determination that the deleted material was exempt from disclosure under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(5) (\u201cExemption 5\u201d). That provi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>sion exempts from disclosure \u201cinter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters which would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency.\u201d The district court agreed with the agency\u2019s position that the deleted material would not be available in civil litigation because it is protected by the executive, or \u201cdeliberative process,\u201d privilege.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">In <em>NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>421 U.S. 132, 149-50, 95 S.Ct. 1504, 1515-16, 44 L.Ed.2d 29 (1975), the Supreme Court recognized that preservation of the deliberative process privilege was the central purpose of Exemption 5. The privilege protects predecisional materials \u201creflecting deliberative or policy-making processes,\u201d but not materials that are \u201cpurely factual.\u201d <em>EPA v. Mink, </em>410 U.S. 73, 87-89, 93 S.Ct. 827, 836-37, 35 L.Ed.2d 119 (1973). The purpose of the privilege is to protect the decision-making process from the inhibiting effect that disclosure of predecisional advisory opinions and recommendations might have on \u201cthe \u2018frank discussion of legal or policy matters\u2019 in writing.\u201d <em>Sears, </em>421 U.S. at 150, 95 S.Ct. at 1516 (quoting S.Rep.No. 813, 89th Cong., 1st Sess. 9 (1965)).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">The deleted material, which this court and the district court have reviewed <em>in camera, </em>comes within both the scope and purpose of the privilege.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Luttrell\u2019s opinions concerning plaintiff\u2019s activities, motivations, and strained relationships with the postal employees were clearly a part of the deliberative process by which the agency decided not to take internal disciplinary action against its employees. Moreover, the possibility of disclosure might well have inhibited Luttrell from advising his superiors in Washington of his view of the circumstances surrounding Skelton\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-10\">Skelton argues that because Luttrell\u2019s opinion was based on facts, it cannot be an opinion concerning \u201clegal or policy matters\u201d within the meaning of <em>Sears, </em>421 U.S. at 150, 95 S.Ct. at 1516. In distinguishing between \u201cpurely factual\u201d and \u201cdeliberative\u201d materials, <em>see EPA v. Mink, </em>410 U.S. at 89, 93 S.Ct. at 837, this court and others have recognized that analysis and evaluation of facts are as much a part of the deliberative process as analysis and evaluation of law. <em>See Cooper v. Department of the Navy, </em>558 F.2d 274, 278 (5th Cir. 1977), <em>modified on other grounds on rehearing, </em>594 F.2d 484 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 926, 100 S.Ct. 266, 62 L.Ed.2d 183 (1979); <em>Wu v. National Endowment for Humanities, </em>460 F.2d 1030, 1033 (5th Cir. 1972), <em>cert. denied, </em>410 U.S. 926, 93 S.Ct. 1352, 35 L.Ed.2d 586 (1973); <em>Lead Indus. Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. OSHA, </em>610 F.2d 70, 83, 85 (2d Cir. 1979); <em>Mead Data Central, Inc. v. United States Dep\u2019t of the Air Force, </em>575 F.2d 932, 934-35 (D.C.Cir.1978); <em>see also Hoover v. United States Dep\u2019t of the Interior, </em>611 F.2d 1132, 1143 (5th Cir. 1980) (alternative holding).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The rigid distinction between \u201cfactual opinions\u201d and \u201cpolicy opinions\u201d advocated by plaintiff does not and cannot exist \u2014 a policy must be based upon an evaluation of, or assumptions about, the \u201cfacts.\u201d <em>Cf. Cooper, </em>558 F.2d at 278 (\u201cto be of any use opinions must have something to be \u2018about\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-11\">We agree with Judge Thornberry\u2019s observation in <em>Wu </em>that there is no \u201cironclad\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>test by which to determine whether material is \u201cdeliberative\u201d or \u201cpredominantly, if not purely, factual.\u201d \u201cA careful case-by-case analysis of the material sought is thus necessary.\u201d <em>Wu, </em>460 F.2d at 1033; <em>accord, </em>1 K. Davis, Administrative Law Treatise \u00a7 5:37, at 419 (2d ed. 1978). As in <em>Wu, </em>the \u201cprimary purpose\u201d of Luttrell\u2019s deleted remarks was \u201cthe expression of an opinion to assist the agency in reaching a decision.\u201d 460 F.2d at 1033. While the deleted material contained some assertions of fact, the deleted material was an \u201c \u2018evaluation[ ] [of the facts] based on . .. the writer\u2019s own values.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mead Data Central, </em>575 F.2d at 935. Disclosure of the deleted material would serve only \u201cto reveal the \u2018evaluative\u2019 process by which [a] member[ ] of the decision-making chain arrived at [his] conclusions \u2014 and what those predecisional conclusions [we]re.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Such disclosure is precisely what Exemption 5 was intended to prevent. <em>See Sears, </em>421 U.S. at 150, 95 S.Ct. at 1516.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-4\">Skelton also argues that Luttrell\u2019s memorandum was simply the statement of a witness to the incident in the post office. While part of Luttrell\u2019s memorandum is Luttrell\u2019s factual version of the incident, that part has been fully disclosed to Skel-ton. In the deleted part of the memorandum, Luttrell was speaking not as a witness but as an administrator with an opinion concerning the proper disposition of Skel-ton\u2019s complaint. His opinion, therefore, was within the scope of Exemption 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">III. <em>The Exception to Exemption 5</em></p>\n<p id=\"AJ3\">In <em>Sears, </em>the Supreme Court held that \u201cif an agency chooses <em>expressly </em>to adopt or incorporate by reference an intraagency memorandum previously covered by Exemption 5 in what would otherwise be a final opinion, that memorandum may be withheld only on the ground that it falls within the coverage of some exemption other than Exemption 5.\u201d 421 U.S. at 161, 95 S.Ct. at 1521-22<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Skelton argues that the agency\u2019s letter informing him that it would not take internal disciplinary action was a \u201cfinal opinion,\u201d and that because the letter expressly said that this decision was \u201cbased on the report we received,\u201d Luttrell\u2019s memorandum was \u201cincorporated by reference\u201d into the agency\u2019s opinion. The district court agreed with Skelton that the letter was a \u201cfinal opinion,\u201d but concluded that it did not expressly incorporate the Luttrell memorandum.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Since we hold that the letter was not a \u201cfinal opinion\u201d within the meaning of Sears, we express no view on the question whether the letter made reference to the Luttrell memorandum.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-9\">The term \u201cfinal opinion\u201d is not defined in the section of the Sears opinion establishing the incorporation by reference exception. See 421 U.S. at 161, 95 S.Ct. at 1521-22. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>Prior to this section of the <em>Sears </em>opinion, however, the Court had consistently used the term \u201cfinal opinion\u201d with reference to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(2)(A), a provision of FOIA requiring that \u201cfinal opinions . . . made in the adjudication of cases\u201d be indexed and \u201cma[d]e available for public inspection.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Most importantly, the <em>Sears </em>Court had held that the very documents to which it applied the incorporation by reference exception were \u201cfinal opinions\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 552(a)(2)(A). <em>See </em>421 U.S. at 158-59, 95 5. Ct. at 1520.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">We conclude that <em>Sears </em>is not controlling because the letter to Skelton was not a \u201cfinal opinion[] . .. made in the adjudication of [a] case[]\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 552(a)(2)(A). The documents at issue in <em>Sears </em>were legal memoranda that explained the NLRB\u2019s reasons for dismissing an unfair labor charge filed by a private party. The private party was attempting to vindicate statutorily protected rights, <em>see </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a), (b), through a statutorily created procedure, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 160(b). <em>See Sears, </em>421 U.S. at 138, 95 S.Ct. at 1510. The statute also directed the agency to determine whether the charge should be pursued or dismissed. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 153(d), 160(b). If the charge were pursued, the charging party became a party to the proceeding before the agency. <em>See Sears, </em>421 U.S. at 156 n.22, 95 S.Ct. at 1519 n.22. In such a proceeding, the private party could be granted relief for the violation of his statutory rights. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(c). If the charge were dismissed, the charging party was entitled by regulation to a brief explanation of reasons and the right to appeal. <em>See Sears, </em>421 U.S. at 138-39, 95 S.Ct. at 1510-11. In this context, which the Court termed \u201c[cjrucial to the decision of this case,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 138, 95 S.Ct. at 1510, the Court held that the agency\u2019s decision to dismiss the charge was an \u201cadjudication\u201d of a \u201ccase\u201d against the charging party, <em>see id. </em>at 148, 95 S.Ct. at 1515, and thus that the legal memoranda explaining such decisions were \u201cfinal opinions\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 552(a)(2)(A), <em>see </em>421 U.S. at 158, 95 S.Ct. at 1520 (\u201cThe decision to dismiss a charge is a decision in a \u2018case\u2019 .... \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">By contrast, Skelton\u2019s original letter of complaint invoked no substantive statutory right and no statutory procedure for vindicating it. No statute directed the agency to make any determination concerning Skelton\u2019s letter. Skelton points to no statute or regulation that would make him a party to an internal disciplinary proceeding. He would not be entitled to personal relief in such a proceeding. The agency\u2019s letter responding to Skelton\u2019s complaint was thus not the adjudication of a \u201ccase\u201d that is at all similar to the \u201ccase\u201d at issue in <em>Sears.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b96-9\">Moreover, we think it extremely unlikely that Congress intended a letter sent in response to a citizen\u2019s letter of complaint to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>be a \u201cfinal opinion\u201d subject to the indexing requirement of \u00a7 552(a)(2). That requirement was designed to help the citizen find agency statements \u201chaving precedential significance\u201d when he becomes involved in \u201ca controversy with an agency.\u201d H.R.Rep. No.1497, 89th Cong., 2d Sess. 8, <em>reprinted in </em>[1966] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 2418, 2425. A letter like that sent to Skelton hardly has \u201cprecedential significance.\u201d We think that by referring to \u201cfinal opinions . . . made in the adjudication of <em>cases,\u201d </em>Congress was referring to explanations of decisions in proceedings, like that in <em>Sears, </em>in which a party has a right to set the agency decision-making process in motion and obtain a determination concerning the statute or other laws the agency is charged with interpreting and administering.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">Our conclusion that the agency\u2019s letter to Skelton was not a \u201cfinal opinion\u201d under \u00a7 552(a)(2)(A), however, does not end the matter. While the <em>Sears </em>Court applied the incorporation by reference exception to \u00a7 552(a)(2)(A) \u201cfinal opinions,\u201d the Court did not expressly limit the exception to such documents. Moreover, the purpose of the exception \u2014 to compel disclosure of \u201cthe reasons for a policy actually adopted,\u201d 421 U.S. at 161, 95 S.Ct. at 1521, and thus to forbid \u201csecret law,\u201d <em>see id. </em>at 153, 156, 161, 95 S.Ct. at 1518, 1519, 1521; 1 K. Davis, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 5:33, at 405 \u2014 would seem to apply to any agency statement of law or policy that expressly relies on an undisclosed document. <em>Cf. </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(2)(B), (C); 1 K. Davis, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 5:35, :36 (arguing that all statements of agency law, not just \u201cfinal opinions,\u201d should be excepted from Exemption 5).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-9\">Even if such an expanded scope for the exception were appropriate, however, it would have no application in the present case. The letter to Skelton was not a statement of agency law. Unlike the memoran-da at issue in <em>Sears, </em>the letter was not an interpretation of a law that the agency was charged with administering. The agency had no duty even to entertain Skelton\u2019s letter of complaint, much less render a \u201clegal\u201d decision on it. While the letter can be characterized as the adoption of a policy with regard to Skelton\u2019s complaint, it is hardly the type of general or uniform policy that necessitates public disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-10\">We do not think that every writing memorializing a \u201cdecision,\u201d no matter how insignificant or routine the \u201cdecision\u201d is, thereby becomes a \u201cfinal opinion\u201d subject to the incorporation by reference exception.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> To hold that the agency lost its privilege to withhold Luttrell\u2019s opinion because of the letter it sent to Skelton would at best teach the agency not to respond to citizens\u2019 complaints, or not to allude to any other documents when it does so.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> At <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>worst, such a holding would deter administrators from giving their opinions for fear that a routine response to a citizen\u2019s complaint will be deemed an adoption of those opinions. This last result is precisely what Exemption 5 was designed to prevent. <em>Sears, </em>421 U.S. at 150-51, 95 S.Ct. at 1516-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">Therefore, we hold that <em>Sears\u2019 </em>incorporation by reference exception does not apply to the agency\u2019s letter to Skelton, and thus that Luttrell\u2019s written opinions did not lose their Exemption 5 protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b94-6\">. The trend among the lower courts has been to use the term \u201cdeliberative process privilege,\u201d possibly to avoid confusion with the constitutional doctrine of executive privilege discussed in <em>United States v. Nixon, </em>418 U.S. 683, 703-16, 94 S.Ct. 3090, 3105-11, 41 L.Ed.2d 1039 (1974).

The test for determining whether the material is protected by the privilege is not whether the private party would be able to override the privilege in civil litigation by a showing of particularized need, but whether the material would \u201c \u2018routinely be disclosed\u2019 in private litigation.\u201d <em>Sears, </em>421 U.S. at 149 n.16, 95 S.Ct. at 1516 n.16 (quoting H.R.Rep.No.1497, 89th Cong., 2d Sess. 10, <em>reprinted in </em>[1966] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 2418, 2428); <em>see Hoover v.

The Court held that any \u201cfinal opinion\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 552(a)(2)(A) can never come within the scope of the deliberative process privilege because final opinions, by definition, are not \u201cpredecisional.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 148, 153-54, 95 S.Ct. at 1515, 1518. This holding has led plaintiff to argue that any post-decisional document \u2014here, the letter to Skelton \u2014 must be a \u201cfinal opinion.\u201d This proposition, however, is plainly a misreading of <em>Sears. </em>While \u00a7 552(a)(2)(A) \u201cfinal opinions\u201d are always outside the scope of the deliberative process privilege, the <em>Sears </em>Court made it clear that material outside the scope of the privilege is not always a \u201cfinal opinion.\u201d The Court held that certain documents in <em>Sears </em>were not protected by the privilege because they were not predecisional, see <em>id. </em>at 155, 95 S.Ct. at 1518-19; then the Court went on to hold separately that the documents were <em>also </em>\u00a7 552(a)(2)(A) \u201cfinal opinions\u201d because they were explanations made in the \u201cadjudication\u201d of a \u201ccase,\u201d <em>see id. </em>at 158-59, 95 S.Ct. at 1520. Similarly, the Court held that other documents in <em>Sears </em>were clearly not \u201cfinal opinions\u201d because they were not \u201cfinal\u201d; the court then indicated that these documents were nevertheless outside the scope of the deliberative process privilege, and it held them entitled to Exemption 5 protection \u201conly because\u201d of the \"attorney\u2019s work-product policies which Congress clearly incorporated into Exemption 5.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 160, 95 S.Ct. at 1521. Thus, <em>Sears </em>makes it clear that the question whether a document is a \u00a7 552(a)(2)(A) \u201cfinal opinion\u201d and the question whether a document falls outside the scope of the deliberative process privilege involve separate inquiries.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b97-6\">. Therefore, we decline to adopt the definition of \u201cfinal opinion\u201d contained in <em>Bristol Meyers [sic] Co. v. FTC, </em>598 F.2d 18 (D.C.Cir.1978): \u201ca written explanation\u201d that accompanies \u201caction taken by the responsible decisionmaker in an agency\u2019s decision-making process which has the practical effect of disposing of a matter before the agency.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 25. If the word \u201cmatter\u201d were given literal effect, this definition would transform a writing explaining any decision \u2014 no matter how insignificant \u2014 into a \u201cfinal opinion\u201d subject to the incorporation by reference exception. There has been some indication that the court that suggested this definition will not follow it literally. See <em>Common Cause v. IRS, </em>646 F.2d 656 (D.C.Cir.1981):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-7\">The position [that every post-decisional document explaining the reasons for a decision is a \u201cfinal opinion\u201d], if pushed to its logical limits, could virtually eliminate the governmental privilege. Every rejection of a proposal, no matter how infeasible or insignificant, would become a \u201cfinal decision\u201d of an agency. True, the rejection of a policy does embody a decision; but neither the language of Exemption 5 nor the holding in <em>Sears </em>demands that such a narrow interpretation of the governmental privilege be adopted in order to protect the public interest in disclosure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b97-12\"><em>Id. </em>at 660 (dictum).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b97-13\">. The district court rejected this argument, relying on the Court\u2019s statement in <em>Sears </em>that FOIA \u201crequires disclosure of certain documents which the law requires the agency to prepare or which the agency has decided for its own reasons to create.\u201d 421 U.S. at 162, 95 S.Ct. at 1522. We think that the district court read too much into this statement. In <em>Sears, </em>the agency was not required by law to write memoranda explaining its decisions; but it was required by law to \u201cadjudicate\u201d \u201ccases,\u201d and thus when it chose to explain its reasons for a decision that explanation became a \u201cfinal opinion,\u201d which \u00a7 552(a)(2)(A) required it to disclose. In this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>case, the agency was not required by law to \u201cadjudicate\u201d Skelton\u2019s letter of complaint, nor was its decision a statement of agency law.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
