We hold that the district court\u2019s finding that the United States was not negligent is supported by the evidence and is not clearly erroneous. Consequently, we affirm the judgment entered in favor of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>United States in the Federal Tort Claims action. We also hold that the district court did not have subject matter jurisdiction to decide the action removed from the Louisiana state court. We vacate this judgment and instruct the district court to remand this action to the Louisiana state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">The present appeal stems from a tragic accident early one morning in New Orleans. A bus operated by New Orleans Public Service, Inc. (\u201cNOPSI\u201d) struck and injured a young man, Gregory McKenzie, as he and his companion, Alex Bell, were walking across the St. Claude Avenue Bridge on their way to band practice at school.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">Two lawsuits resulted.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> One action<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> was brought by Gregory\u2019s father (\u201cMcKenzie\u201d) in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana against the United States<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> under the Federal Tort Claims Act.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This action sounded in negligence and claimed that Gregory was injured when he was chased by a dog kept by an employee of the United States Army Corps of Engineers (operators of the bridge) and was forced to flee into the path of the bus.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">McKenzie brought the other action<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> in the Civil District Court for the Parish of Orleans. This suit, also claiming negligence, named both NOPSI and the driver of the bus, Herman Dear, a NOPSI employee, as defendants. Over 2 years later, McKenzie removed this lawsuit from the Louisiana court to the United States district court where it was consolidated with the pending action against the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">At trial, NOPSI and Dear were dismissed at the close of the plaintiff\u2019s evidence, see Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(b), the district court finding no negligence on the part of the bus driver. The United States prevailed after a full trial. The district court found that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AVU\">[t]he dog in question was not being kept or harbored by any employee of the Corps in the facility immediately adjacent to the scene of the injury. ... At the time of the accident, it was against the express policy of the Corps to have dogs or pets at the Canal &amp; Lock. The dog was not observed by Corps personnel in the vicinity of the accident, either immediately prior to the accident or immediately subsequent thereto.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b611-11\">Additionally, the court observed that as \u201cthe animal shelter of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals ... is located near\u201d the bridge, employees of the Corps previously had experienced difficulty with dogs that either escaped from the shelter or were abandoned by their owners in front of the shelter. The district court noted, however, that \u201cCorps personnel . .. would alert the SPCA so that appropriate action could be taken.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b611-12\">After entry of final judgments, McKenzie brought this appeal. We consider each of the consolidated actions in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-13\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b611-14\">\n<em>79-10</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b611-15\">McKenzie\u2019s attack on the judgment entered against him in his action against the United States is premised on \u201cthe fact that [his son] was attacked and frightened by a dog ... [that] was with a man who was obviously an ... employee of the U.S. Corps of Engineers.\u201d McKenzie argues that \u201cthe dog ... was \u2018with\u2019 an employee of the Corps of Engineers\u201d and it follows that as the animal was \u201cbeing kept or harbored by such employee\u201d \u201cthis constitutes actionable negligence [of] ... the United States.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b612-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>Our difficulty with McKenzie\u2019s argument is that the district court specifically found to the contrary \u2014 that \u201c[t]he dog . . . was not being kept or harbored by any employee of the Corps.\u201d While there was evidence introduced that could have supported a finding by the court that the dog was the responsibility of a Government employee, there also was evidence to the contrary. It is the district court that is charged with sifting through the evidence and settling on the facts. We set aside a fact finding only if clearly erroneous, see Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a) \u2014 a standard met when \u201con the entire evidence [we are] left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>United States v. United States Gypsum Co., </em>333 U.S. 364, 395, 68 S.Ct. 525, 542, 92 L.Ed. 746 (1948).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">There is ample testimony in the record fully supporting not only the court\u2019s finding that the dog was not kept by a member of the Corps of Engineers but also the court\u2019s suggestion that the animal wandered off onto the bridge from the nearby animal shelter. Accordingly, the judgment entered against McKenzie in his action against the United States is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">\n<em>79-3140</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">Although only a defendant, never a plaintiff, may remove a civil action from state to federal court, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441(a); <em>Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Peoria Railroad Co. v. Stude, </em>346 U.S. 574, 580, 74 S.Ct. 290, 294, 98 L.Ed. 317 (1954); <em>Shamrock Oil &amp; Gas Corp. v. Sheets, </em>313 U.S. 100, 61 S.Ct. 868, 85 L.Ed. 1214 (1941), we find in the record no objection to the removal by McKenzie \u2014 the state court plaintiff \u2014 of his action to the United States district court. When an action is improperly removed, yet final judgment is entered on the merits by the district court without a motion to remand or other objection, our inquiry is \u201cnot whether the case was properly removed, but whether the federal district court would have had original jurisdiction of the case had it been filed in that court.\u201d <em>Grubbs v. General Electric Credit Corp., </em>405 U.S. 699, 702, 92 S.Ct. 1344, 1347, 31 L.Ed.2d 612 (1972); <em>Lockwood Corp. v. Black, </em>669 F.2d 324, 326 (5th Cir. 1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">When we pursue that inquiry in this case it is manifest that the district court never possessed subject matter jurisdiction to decide this action. First, as all parties \u2014 McKenzie, NOPSI and Dear \u2014 are citizens of Louisiana, there is no diversity of citizenship. Nor, in response to our request for supplemental briefs inquiring \u201cwhether the federal court would have had original jurisdiction of th[is] action had it been filed in that court,\u201d has counsel for NOPSI and Dear specified any other basis to support the district court\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction. At best, it is contended that consolidation with a pending federal action \u2014 McKenzie\u2019s companion suit against the United States under the Federal Tort Claims Act \u2014 cured any jurisdictional defect. But consolidation does not cause one civil action to emerge from two; the actions do not lose their separate identity; the parties to one action do not become parties to the other. <em>Alfred Dunhill, Inc. v. Republic of Cuba, </em>425 U.S. 682, 735, 96 S.Ct. 1854, 1880, 48 L.Ed.2d 301 (1976) (Marshall, J., dissenting); 9 C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 2382, at 255 (1971); 5 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice 142.02[3], at 42-27 to 42-29 (2d ed. 1982); <em>see Johnson v. Manhattan Railway Co., </em>289 U.S. 479, 496-97, 53 S.Ct. 721, 727-28, 77 L.Ed. 1331 (1933). As a consequence, the subsequent consolidation of McKenzie\u2019s two lawsuits did not give the district court subject matter jurisdiction to adjudicate his action against NOPSI and Dear. <em>See Appalachian Power Co. v. Region Properties, Inc., </em>364 F.Supp. 1273, 1277 (W.D.Va.1973); <em>see also Suburban Trust Co. v. National Bank, </em>211 F.Supp. 694, 699 (D.N.J.1962) (by implication). Because no basis existed to support the district court\u2019s exercise of subject matter jurisdiction, the judgment against McKenzie in his action against NOPSI and Dear must be vacated and the action remanded to the Louisiana state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b612-9\">The judgment entered against McKenzie in his action against the United States (No. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>79-10) is affirmed. The judgment entered against McKenzie in his action against New Orleans Public Service, Inc. and Herman Dear (No. 79-3140) is vacated and the district court is instructed to remand the action to the Civil District Court for the Parish of Orleans.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-4\">AFFIRMED in part; VACATED and REMANDED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b611-9\">. Because this is an appeal from two actions consolidated for trial in the district court, it is docketed under a single number in this court. Therefore, in order to differentiate between the two actions on appeal, we refer to them using the separate docket numbers assigned in the district court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b611-19\">.
