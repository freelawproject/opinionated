(Petitioner), petition for review of a National Labor Relations Board (Board) decision. The Board cross-applies for enforcement of its order.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-11\">The Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) concluded that Petitioner violated section 8(a)(1) of the National Labor Relations Act (Act), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(1), by interrogating employees, threatening economic reprisals, and promising benefits if the employees voted against the Union. The ALJ also found that Petitioner interfered with a representation election. The Board unanimously affirmed the ALJ\u2019s findings and conclusions. It also concluded that Petitioner violated section 8(a)(1) by confiscating union literature.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-12\">Petitioner contends that the Board\u2019s decision is invalid because it was not made by a properly constituted three-member panel. It also contends that the ALJ and the Board improperly construed the evidence and made numerous procedural errors. We enforce the Board\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-13\">PENELLO\u2019S RESIGNATION</p>\n<p id=\"b178-14\">Pursuant to section 3(b) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 153(b), a three-member panel of the Board heard this case. Before its decision was announced, one member of the panel, John Penello, submitted his resignation. The resignation became effective January 14, 1981. The decision on this case issued the same day.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-15\">Petitioner claims that Penello\u2019s resignation became effective at the first moment of January 14, 1981, and that Penello therefore was not a member of the Board when the Board\u2019s decision issued later that day. Accordingly, Petitioner maintains that the decision is unenforceable because it was not made by a properly constituted three-member panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-16\">Since all three panel members concurred in the decision, we need not determine whether Penello\u2019s resignation precluded his participation in the Board\u2019s decision. Even if Penello did not participate, a decision by two members of the panel would still be binding.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-17\">Section 3(b) of the Act states that the Board may \u201cdelegate to any group of three or more members any or all of the powers which it may itself exercise.\u201d For any group so designated, however, \u201ctwo members shall constitute a quorum.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b178-18\">No case directly defines the term \u201cquorum\u201d as used in section 3(b), but analogies can be drawn to the practices of federal Courts of Appeals. Federal statutes provide that appeals are to be heard by a panel of three judges, but that two judges will constitute a \u201cquorum.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 46. Courts have interpreted \u201cquorum\u201d to mean the \u201cnumber of the members of the court as may legally transact judicial business.\u201d <em>Tobin v. Ramey, </em>206 F.2d 505, 507 (5th Cir. 1953), <em>cert. denied sub nom Hughes Construction Co. v. Secretary of Labor, </em>346 U.S. 925, 74 S.Ct. 310, 98 L.Ed. 418 (1954). On numerous occasions, courts have issued decisions by a quorum of two judges when the third died or was ill. <em>See, e.g., TRW, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>654 F.2d 307 (5th Cir. 1981); <em>Minniefield </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>542 F.2d 947 (5th Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>1976); <em>Litton Systems, Inc. v. Southwestern Bell Telephone Co., </em>539 F.2d 418 (5th Cir. 1976), <em>ren\u2019g denied, </em>542 F.2d 1173 (1976); <em>Wirth Ltd. v. S/S Acadia Forest, </em>537 F.2d 1272 (5th Cir. 1976), <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>541 F.2d 282 (1976); <em>United States v. Allied Stevedoring Corp., </em>241 F.2d 925 (2d Cir. 1957), <em>cert. denied, </em>353 U.S. 984, 77 S.Ct. 1282, 1 L.Ed.2d 1143 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">Under the view that \u201cquorum\u201d means the number of members that may legally transact business, the Board\u2019s decision in this case is valid. Even if this court accepted Petitioner\u2019s argument that Penello did not participate in the Board\u2019s decision, the decision would nonetheless be valid because a \u201cquorum\u201d of two panel members supported the decision. Penello\u2019s resignation, therefore, did not invalidate the decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">ALJ\u2019S CREDIBILITY RESOLUTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">Petitioner also claims that the Board improperly relied on erroneous credibility resolutions made by the ALJ. It claims that on several occasions the ALJ gave greater weight to the testimony of the Board\u2019s witnesses than to the conflicting testimony presented by Photo-Sonic\u2019s witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">The courts have repeatedly recognized that it is the function of the ALJ, \u201cwho observes the witnesses and hears their testimony, to determine credibility.\u201d <em>NLRB </em>v. <em>Local Union No. 180, United Brotherhood of Carpenters, </em>462 F.2d 1321, 1324 (9th Cir. 1972), <em>quoted in Great Chinese American Sewing Co. v. NLRB, </em>578 F.2d 251, 254 (9th Cir. 1978). Accordingly, courts give great deference to ALJs\u2019 findings and uphold them unless they are \u201cinherently incredible or patently unreasonable.\u201d <em>NLRB v. Anthony Co., </em>557 F.2d 692, 695 (9th Cir. 1977), <em>quoted in NLRB v. Don Burgess Construction Corp., </em>596 F.2d 378, 383 (9th Cir. 1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 940, 100 S.Ct. 293, 62 L.Ed.2d 306 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-9\">After reviewing the record, we conclude that the ALJ\u2019s credibility resolutions were reasonable and therefore should be upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-10\">Petitioner also contends that the Board and the ALJ made numerous procedural errors. We find all of these claims to be meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-11\">Photo-Sonic\u2019s petition for review is DENIED. We enforce the Board\u2019s order.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
