RUBIN, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b81-25\">The owner of residential lots situated in a waterfront subdivision contends that a local regulation requiring property owners to install bulkheading on lots not already bulk-headed is (1) an unconstitutional exercise of the police power; (2) a taking of its property without just compensation; and (3) a denial of equal protection of the law. The district court held that these contentions are meritless. We agree and affirm its judgment dismissing the owner\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-26\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b81-27\">Hide-A-Way on the Gulf is a residential subdivision in Brazoria County, Texas, near the Gulf of Mexico. Its 290 lots front on canals suitable for navigation by boat, thus allowing lot owners to bring boats to their property. In late 1975 National Western Life Insurance Company (\u201cNational Western\u201d) acquired 133 lots, which it intended to sell. Few of these lots had bulkheads. There were then about thirty families who were full-time residents of the subdivision, and each of their lots had a bulkhead.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-28\">In April 1978 the Commodore Cove Improvement District (\u201cthe District\u201d), a water control and improvement district formed under Texas law,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> within whose jurisdiction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>Hide-A-Way by the Gulf lies, adopted Regulation 3, which prohibits the transfer of any lot that lacks a bulkhead.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The regulation states that its purpose is \u201cto protect the navigability of the State waters within [the] District.\u201d In compliance with the regulation and while this suit was pending, National Western installed bulkheads on each of its lots not yet so protected, at a cost of $408,000.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> By the time the suit was tried, National Western had sold about ninety lots on a contract basis. The buyers were in default on some of these contracts. Forty lots remained unsold. Approximately ten of the lots in Hide-A-Way on the Gulf now either lack bulkheads or have bulkheads insufficient to meet the requirements of Regulation 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">National Western sued the District under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, seeking a declaratory judgment that Regulation 3 is unconstitutional, a permanent injunction against enforcement of the regulation,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and damages allegedly suffered by National Western from being required to install bulkheads on its property.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">National Western contends that Regulation 3 violates the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This contention comprises two distinct arguments: (1) the regulation is an unreasonable means of achieving its stated end, and (2) the regulation effects a taking of National Western\u2019s property without just compensation. We discuss these arguments in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-16\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b82-17\">National Western argues that Regulation 3 impairs its \u201cfundamental right\u201d freely to alienate real property and that we, therefore, should apply the \u201cstrict scrutiny\u201d standard of review in evaluating its claim that Regulation 3 is unreasonable and thus violates due process. We reject this argument. The right freely to alienate real property is not a \u201cfundamental right\u201d that calls for application of strict scrutiny. <em>E.g., Seoane v. Ortho Pharmaceuticals, Inc., </em>660 F.2d 146, 149 n.6 (5th Cir. 1981).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b82-18\">National Western argues in the alternative that Regulation 3 nevertheless violates the due process clause because the regulation cannot withstand even the \u201crational basis\u201d standard of review. National Western contends that Regulation 3 is not rational in terms of the governmental objective sought, and thus is an improper exercise of the District\u2019s police power because the regulation arbitrarily and capriciously designates the happening of a purely random event \u2014 the transfer of title to unbulk-headed property \u2014 as a condition precedent for the installation of bulkheading.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-19\"> Our inquiry under the rational basis test is whether Regulation 3 is a reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>able means of achieving a legitimate governmental goal. <em>Seoane v. Ortho Pharmaceuticals, Inc., </em>660 F.2d at 151.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We presume, at the outset, that Regulation 3 is constitutional. <em>Usery v. Turner Elkhorn Mining Co., </em>428 U.S. 1, 15, 96 S.Ct. 2882, 2892, 49 L.Ed.2d 752, 766 (1976); Seoane v. <em>Ortho Pharmaceuticals, Inc., </em>660 F.2d at 151.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Thus National Western bears the burden of proving that Regulation 3 is unconstitutional. <em>Usery v. Turner Elkhorn Mining Co., </em>428 U.S. at 15, 96 S.Ct. at 2892, 49 L.Ed.2d at 766. Its burden, moreover, is a heavy one, for we give \u201c \u2018well-nigh conclusive effect\u2019 to [a] legislative determination of community needs and solutions.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> When exercising its \u201crich and flexible\u201d police power, the District is limited only by \u201cample and protean\u201d boundaries.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> National Western, therefore, must prove that Regulation 3 is \u201cwholly arbitrary and totally without value\u201d in furthering a legitimate governmental goal, and that the regulation has \u201cno meaningful relationship\u201d to achievement of that goal. <em>Kite v. Marshall, </em>661 F.2d 1027, 1030 (5th Cir. 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">The district court found that the District decided to require bulkheading at the time of transfer of the property because the cost of bulkheading could then be included as part of the price of the property. The district court also found that \u201cthe District had a legitimate expectation that the land would be sold and improved because of the almost certain development of the subdivision.\u201d National Western objects to these findings. It contends that Regulation 3 is irrational (1) because the regulation applies to many nonsale transfers of property, and thus a transfer of property will not necessarily produce cash with which to pay for bulkheading the property, and (2) because some properties might never be transferred, they therefore might never be bulkheaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-9\">These objections lack merit. The District could reasonably have concluded that Regulation 3 would cause properties to be bulkheaded and thus would facilitate the legitimate goal of aiding navigation. The regulation appears to have had exactly that effect: as the district court noted, all but ten of the 290 lots in Hide-A-Way on the Gulf now have adequate bulkheading, which led the district court to conclude that the regulation has substantially advanced its purpose. National Western\u2019s assertion that the regulation does not aim for a \u201cquick cure\u201d is irrelevant; so, too, is its assertion that the regulation should apply to a narrower class of property transfers. We will not invalidate a statute merely because the legislature could have drafted a wiser or more precise one. <em>Ferguson v. Skrupa, </em>372 U.S. 726, 731-32, 83 S.Ct. 1028, 1032, 10 L.Ed.2d 93, 98 (1963); <em>Williamson v. Lee Optical, Inc., </em>348 U.S. 483, 488, 75 S.Ct. 461, 464, 99 L.Ed. 563, 571 (1955); <em>Maher v. City of New Orleans, </em>516 F.2d 1051, 1067 (5th Cir. 1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>426 U.S. 905, 96 S.Ct. 2225, 48 L.Ed.2d 830 (1976). A statute need only meet the test of rationality. We conclude that Regulation 3 meets this test.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">We turn now to National Western\u2019s argument that Regulation 3 effects a \u201ctaking without compensation\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> in violation of the just compensation clause of the fifth amendment,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> which the fourteenth amendment applies to the states.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> National Western argues that Regulation 3 effects a taking by withdrawing, pending installation of bulkheading on its property, its right to alienate its property.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">National Western bears the burden of proof on this issue. <em>Maher v. City of New Orleans, </em>516 F.2d at 1965; <em>see Goldblatt v. Town of Hempstead, </em>369 U.S. 590, 594, 82 S.Ct. 987, 990, 8 L.Ed.2d 130, 133 (1962). The district court held that National Western failed to carry that burden. It found that Regulation 3 did not diminish the available use of National Western\u2019s property; indeed, the district court found that \u201cNational Western has used the property for the very purpose for which it was intended.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The district court also found that the installation of the bulkheading has in fact increased the value of National Western\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">We must credit these findings unless National Western proves that they are clearly erroneous. <em>Hill v. Texaco, Inc., </em>674 F.2d 447, 449 (5th Cir. 1982); Fed.R. Civ.P. 52(a). National Western has failed to do so. It has not shown that Regulation 3 is either \u201cconfiscatory\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> or \u201cinordinately burdensome,\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> or that Regulation 3 has denied it \u201ceconomically viable use\u201d of its property.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> National Western\u2019s argument, baldly stated, seems to be that Regulation 3 effects a taking regardless of the magnitude of the burden that it imposes on National Western\u2019s ability to transfer its property. That argument does not hold water.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> We, therefore, affirm the district court\u2019s holding that Regulation 3 does not effect a taking of National Western\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-12\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b84-13\">National Western also contends that Regulation 3 violates the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> by imposing the bulkheading requirement on one class of property owners \u2014 those who seek to transfer title to their property\u2014 while exempting all other property owners from the requirement. National Western argues that we must apply the strict scrutiny standard of review in evaluating its equal protection claim because, it asserts, Regulation 3 in effect classifies people in terms of their ability to exercise a fund\u00e1-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>mental right, the right to alienate property. We reject this argument, however, for as we noted earlier, slip op. p. 2764 <em>supra, </em>the right to alienate property is not a fundamental right that calls for application of strict scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">National Western also argues in the alternative that Regulation 3 fails even under the rational basis standard of review. It argues that the regulation contains an irrational classification because it distinguishes between property owners who transfer title to their property, and those who do not transfer title, and imposes the bulkheading requirement only on property owners who transfer title to their property. This argument, however, merely repeats one of the contentions that National Western advanced to support its due process claim, slip op. pp. 2764-2766 <em>supra; </em>and like that contention, this one also must fail. \u201cIn many cases ... it makes little difference which clause of the Fourteenth Amendment is used to test the statute in question. The question is whether the challenged statute is a rational means of advancing a valid state interest.\u201d <em>Thompson v. Gallagher, </em>489 F.2d 443, 447 (5th Cir. 1973). This is such a case. To establish a violation of the equal protection clause, National Western had the burden of proving that Regulation 3\u2019s \u201cclassification\u201d of property owners is \u201cwholly arbitrary or does not teleologically relate to a permissible government objective.\u201d <em>Kite v. Marshall, </em>661 F.2d at 1030.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The district court found that National Western had failed to carry its burden and, therefore, held that Regulation 3 does not violate the equal protection clause. We affirm the district court\u2019s holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b81-18\">. Tex.Const. art. 16, \u00a7 59. <em>See generally </em>60 Tex.Jur.2d <em>Waters </em>\u00a7 421 (2d ed. 1964).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b82-7\">. Regulation 3 makes it unlawful</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ahl\">to build on, convey, transfer, acquire, broker, or sell, excepting by tax sales, any waterfront lot in the District unless that lot has existing bulkheading in an adequate state of repair to prevent the banks from caving in or is bulk-headed according to the ... specifications [set forth in the Regulation].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b82-9\">The regulation further provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-10\">The penalty for each offence [sic] shall be a fine of not more than $200.00 or imprisonment for not more than thirty days or both such fine and imprisonment and each day such violation shall continue shall constitute a separate offense.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b82-11\">.
