It is from within this framework this Court now confronts a novel question of jurisdiction under Title VII. Elizabeth Anderson Hi-shon filed a Title VII action against King &amp; Spalding, a law firm, alleging that it discriminated against her on the basis of sex in its refusal to invite her into its partnership. After considering lengthy and detailed memoranda, Judge Newell Edenfield of the Northern District of Georgia, held Title VII inapplicable to partnership decisions, leaving the District Court without subject matter jurisdiction of the claim. Judge Eden-field dismissed the case under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The plaintiff appeals the District Court\u2019s ruling and provides us with a myriad of creative reasons why the particular partnership in issue here should be subject to the protection afforded \u201cemployees\u201d by Title VII. While the arguments are appealing and discrimination in any form must not be tolerated, we cannot overlook the essence of a partnership \u2014 voluntary association. We are therefore compelled to reject the corporate characterizations of King &amp; Spalding set forth by the plaintiff, and hold that Title VII does not apply to decisions regarding partnership. We affirm the District Court\u2019s dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-12\">In 1972, Elizabeth Hishon accepted a position as an associate with King &amp; Spalding. King &amp; Spalding is a large Atlanta law firm which operates as a general partnership. The partnership consists of approximately fifty active lawyers and employs approximately fifty additional lawyers as associates. At the time the plaintiff became an associate with the firm, consideration for partnership occurred at the end of an associate\u2019s sixth year. The firm also maintained an \u201cup or out\u201d policy. Under this policy, if the partnership did not invite an associate to become a partner after the requisite time, the associate was allowed to remain with the firm only for such reasonable period as necessary to secure other employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-13\">In May, 1978, the partnership considered Ms. Hishon, along with other associates hired at the same time, and decided not to invite her to join the partnership.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> She was promptly notified, and was extended the normal period of time to secure other employment. Eight months later, Ms. Hishon requested reconsideration for partnership. At the conclusion of the May, 1979, partnership meeting, the result was the same \u2014 Ms. Hishon was not invited into the partnership.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Again the partnership notified her of the outcome. Ms. Hishon left the firm on December 31, 1979.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-14\">Prior to her departure from the firm, Ms. Hishon filed a sex discrimination claim with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1025\">*1025</page-number>the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Within ten days the Commission issued a Notice of Right to Sue, and Ms. Hishon filed her complaint in District Court within the statutory 90-day period.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-5\">The complaint contained three counts. The first count, the only one considered by the District Court, alleged sex discrimination in the firm\u2019s decision not to make her a partner.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Count two alleged a violation of the Equal Pay Act, and count three alleged breach of contract.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1063-6\">Due to the particularly sensitive nature of the discovery (the contents of the firm\u2019s partnership agreement) and the unique legal issue presented in count one, the parties and the District Court mutually agreed to limit initial discovery to inform\u00e1tion needed to determine the jurisdictional issue of Title VII. King &amp; Spalding supplied an edited version of its partnership agreement in compliance with discovery requests as well as answers and objections to numerous interrogatories. All of this information and the briefs for this appeal were placed under seal to avoid any unnecessary disclosure.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In ruling on King &amp; Spalding\u2019s motion to dismiss, the District Court also ruled against the plaintiff\u2019s request for additional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1026\">*1026</page-number>discovery. Amidst the three-count complaint, sensitive discovery, the unique legal issue posed, and the professional courtesy extended by all involved, this Court is confronted with but a single narrow issue: whether Title VII applies to a law firm\u2019s decisions regarding its partners?</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-4\">A dismissal under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1) is proper only when \u201cit appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of [her] claim, which would entitle [her] to relief.\u201d <em>McLain v. Real Estate Board of New Orleans, Inc., </em>444 U.S. 232, 246, 100 S.Ct. 502, 511, 62 L.Ed.2d 441 (1980) (quoting <em>Conley v. Gibson, </em>355 U.S. 41, 45-46, 78 S.Ct. 99, 101-102, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957). Appellant suggests that Title VII must be given the \u201cbroadest possible interpretation\u201d in order to effectuate its purpose \u2014 to remedy acts of discrimination within the employment context. <em>Rogers v. EEOC, </em>454 F.2d 234, 238 (5th Cir. 1971), <em>cert. denied, </em>406 U.S. 957, 92 S.Ct. 2058, 32 L.Ed.2d 343 (1972). Under such a broad reading and in conjunction with her altered characterizations of King &amp; Spalding, she hopes to persuade us of Title VII\u2019s application to partnership decisions. Even under the most liberal reading we cannot find the requisite congressional intent to permit Title VII\u2019s intervention into matters of voluntary association. We can conceive no set of facts which would entitle her to relief under Title VII with respect to partnership decisions. This renders the dismissal of her claim proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-5\">Appellant proposes three bases upon which to find jurisdiction under Title VII: (1) partners at King &amp; Spalding are equivalent to \u201cemployees\u201d of a corporation thereby establishing the employment context for Title VII\u2019s application; (2) elevation to partnership is an \u201cemployment opportunity\u201d or a \u201cterm, condition or privilege of employment\u201d protected by Title VII; and (3) termination of employment as a result of failure to make partner falls within the ambit of an unlawful discharge prohibited by Title VII. Despite the alluring quality of her arguments, we are unpersuaded. An examination of her attempts to recharacterize the law firm partnership as a corporation reveals their transparent nature.</p>\n<p id=\"AVS3\">\n<em>Partnership or Corporation?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-10\">The appellant argues the size and complexion of King &amp; Spalding\u2019s partnership is more akin to a corporation possessing a separate and distinct identity and that its partners are more like employees than owners.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We are well aware that large law partnerships possess many attributes common to corporate forms of business. As appellant correctly points out, the United States Supreme Court has held that partnerships have \u201can established institutional identity independent of its individual partners.\u201d Bel<em>lis v. United States, </em>417 U.S. 85, 95, 94 S.Ct. 2179, 2187, 40 L.Ed.2d 678 (1974) (individual partner\u2019s fifth amendment privilege held inapplicable to prevent production of partnership records). For many purposes, such as the fifth amendment\u2019s protection, this \u201cseparate identity\u201d will yield results similar to those for corporations, but not for Title VII purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-11\">Next the appellant contends that because King &amp; Spalding has a written partnership agreement, the firm has expressly altered its existence from a traditional common law partnership to the skeletal structure of a corporation. This argument is another attempt to equate partners of a large firm with employees of a corporation. We have reviewed the appellant\u2019s list of alleged alterations and find they do nothing more than clarify the internal structure of the firm. Under Georgia law \u201c[a] partnership may be created either by written or parol contract.\u201d Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 75-101 (1981). King &amp; Spalding has reduced its partnership structure to writing; there is no merit to the contention that in doing so, it has unbeknownst to itself incorporated its partnership.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1027\">*1027</page-number>Additionally, the appellant points out that the United States Supreme Court and the former Fifth Circuit<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> have held that part ownership of a business does not preclude a person\u2019s classification as an employee subject to federal employment legislation. <em>Goldberg v. Whitaker House Cooperative, Inc., </em>366 U.S. 28, 81 S.Ct. 933, 6 L.Ed.2d 100 (1961); <em>Pettway v. American Cast Iron Pipe Co., </em>494 F.2d 211 (5th Cir.), <em>rehearing en banc denied, </em>494 F.2d 1296 (5th Cir. 1974). It would be unrealistic to assume a person cannot maintain a proprietary interest and simultaneously work in the business. Mutual exclusivity neither exists nor is required in a law firm in order for the firm to maintain its desired partnership structure. This lack of exclusivity, however, does not render the term \u201cpartner\u201d equivalent to the term \u201cemployee\u201d for purposes of Title VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-5\">\n<em>Partner or Employee?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-6\">The status of \u201can employee under Title VII is a question of federal . .. law; it is to be ascertained through consideration of the statutory language of the Act, its legislative history, existing federal case law, and the particular circumstances of the case at hand.\u201d <em>Calderon v. Martin County, </em>639 F.2d 271, 272-73 (5th Cir. 1981). Neither the statutory language nor the legislative history of Title VII greatly illuminate this otherwise gray area. First, Title VII merely defines an employee as \u201can individual employed by an employer.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e(f) (1976). Second, the legislative history reveals but a single remark. During the Senate Debate Senator Clark stated that the term \u201cemployer\u201d was \u201cintended to have its common dictionary meaning, except as expressly qualified by the Act.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> 110 Cong.Rec. 7216 (Apr. 8, 1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-11\">Third, existing federal case law includes analysis under the \u201ceconomic realities\u201d test, traditional agency and partnership principles, and the four-part test set forth in Calderon.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., Lutcher v. Musicians Union Local 47, </em>633 F.2d 880 (9th Cir. 1980) (Title VII); <em>Spirides v. Reinhardt, </em>613 F.2d 826 (D.C.Cir.1979) (Title VII); <em>Burke v. Friedman, </em>556 F.2d 867 (7th Cir. 1977) (Title VII); <em>Donovan v. Tehco, Inc., </em>642 F.2d 141 (5th Cir. 1981) (Fair Labor Standards Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-12\">The Seventh Circuit provides a most enlightening discussion of whether Title VII applies to an accounting firm operating as a partnership in <em>Burke v. Friedman. </em>Citing Fifth Circuit precedent in recognition that \u201cTitle VII\u2019s definition of \u201cemployee\u201d is not restrictive,\u2019 \u201d the court applied traditional partnership principles and held that partners were not employees. <em>Id. </em>at 869 (quoting <em>McClure v. Salvation Army, </em>460 F.2d 553 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>409 U.S. 896, 93 S.Ct. 132, 34 L.Ed.2d 153 (1972)). In <em>Burke, </em>a female employee filed a sex discrimination action for wrongful discharge. Without counting the accounting firm\u2019s partners as employees, the partnership did not qualify as an \u201cemployer\u201d since it employed less <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1028\">*1028</page-number>than fifteen \u201cemployees.\u201d While the precise issue varies from the issue before us, the Seventh Circuit has announced its hesitation to equate partners with employees. We have the same reluctance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-4\">Fourth, the particular circumstances of this case are clear. King &amp; Spalding operates as a partnership under the laws of Georgia. It files tax returns as a partnership. It is comprised of fifty active partners and employs approximately fifty associates along with other support personnel. It has a lengthy partnership agreement with detailed provisions as to profits, losses, withdrawal, dissolution, etc. But it is clearly a voluntary association of lawyers for the purpose of practicing law as joint venturers. The partnership is the appellant\u2019s employer; the partners own the partnership; they are not its \u201cemployees\u201d under Title VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-5\">We find a clear distinction between employees of a corporation and partners of a law firm. In making this distinction, we do not presume to exalt form over substance. In this instance, however, the form <em>is </em>the substance, and we are unwilling to dictate partnership decisions under the guise of employee promotions protected by Title VII. The very essence of a partnership is the voluntary joinder of all partners with each other.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-6\">\n<em>\u201cBut You Promised\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-7\">Appellant\u2019s second point concerns King &amp; Spalding\u2019s alleged representations to her that in return for satisfactory work as an associate for a designated number of years, an invitation to partnership would be forthcoming. She asserts this \u201cpromise\u201d is a \u201cterm, condition or privilege of employment\u201d protected by section 703(a)(1) and/or an \u201cemployment opportunity\u201d protected by section 703(a)(2).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> She suggests that as an associate/employee, she was \u201centitled\u201d to the \u201cpromotion\u201d to partnership upon satisfactory fulfillment of her duties and denial of partnership is a denial of an \u201cemployment opportunity.\u201d Relying on <em>Golden State Bottling Co., Inc. v. NLRB, </em>414 U.S. 168, 94 S.Ct. 414, 38 L.Ed.2d 388 (1973) and <em>NLRB v. Bell Aircraft Corp., </em>206 F.2d 235 (2d Cir. 1953), she advises us that should we decline to equate partners with employees, we may still find the \u201copportunity\u201d for promotion within the statute\u2019s purview.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-12\">We have no quarrel with the premise that an \u201copportunity\u201d can include promotion to a position beyond that of an \u201cemployee\u201d covered by Title VII. But, once again, we decline to extend the meaning of \u201cemployment opportunities\u201d beyond its intended context by encroaching upon individuals\u2019 decisions to voluntarily associate in a business partnership.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-13\">In <em>Pettway v. American Cast Iron Pipe Co., </em>494 F.2d 211 (5th Cir.), <em>rehearing en banc denied, </em>494 F.2d 1296 (5th Cir. 1974), the former Fifth Circuit held that election to a Board of Operatives had been appropriately labeled by the District Court as \u201ca valuable term, condition, or privilege of employment.\u201d The case is unique, however, due to the manufacturing company\u2019s organizational structure. The company\u2019s owner had devised an unusual management plan which set up a Board of Management and a Board of Operatives. The Board of Operatives served as a conduit between the employees and the management board. Employees working in nonsupervisory positions were eligible for election to the Board of Operatives. Upon his death the owner bequeathed all outstanding common stock to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1029\">*1029</page-number>the boards as trustees for the employees. Prior to the case, blacks had been intentionally excluded from eligibility for election to the Board of Operatives. Because the court found election to the Board of Operatives to be \u201ca valuable term, condition, or privilege of employment,\u201d it ordered the discrimination terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-5\">The appellant submits that <em>Pettway </em>demonstrates the former Fifth Circuit\u2019s willingness to mandate nondiscriminatory elections to positions of ownership from an employee status. The decision in <em>Pettway </em>does not possess such elasticity. The employees remained employees even while serving on the board and never actually \u201cowned\u201d the company in their individual capacities, but acted \u201cin trust\u201d for all present and future employees. Furthermore, the owner\u2019s elaborate management structure caused election to the board to become a \u201cvaluable term, condition, or privilege of employment.\u201d We do not find <em>Pettway </em>controlling in the issue now before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-6\">We are also cognizant of <em>Lucido v. Cra-vath, Swaine &amp; Moore, </em>425 F.Supp. 123 (S.D.N.Y.1977). In <em>Lucido, </em>the District Court denied a motion to dismiss a complaint alleging an unlawful discharge of an associate on the basis of his national origin and religion. Many of the allegations in the appellant\u2019s complaint mirror allegations described in <em>Lucido. </em>Among them was a denial of partnership. \u201cIn [that] court\u2019s view, ... the opportunity to become a partner at Cravath was a \u2018term, condition or privilege of employment\u2019 and an \u2018employment opportunity.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 127. This statement could be classified as dicta since the court had already determined that the allegation of an unlawful discharge stated a claim for relief under Title VII. In any event, we respectfully disagree with that court\u2019s statement.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Decisions as to who will be partners are not within the protection of Title VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-9\">We do have serious concerns about any representations made to the appellant regarding her future consideration for partnership. We are well aware of the significance given a firm\u2019s partnership policy by a prospective associate in determining the proper career choice. If in fact these representations were deceptively made, then perhaps an action in breach of contract or misrepresentation may provide a more appropriate vehicle for the appellant to drive toward a legal remedy.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ATt\">\n<em>In Through The Back Door</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-10\">In her third attempt to establish a cause of action under Title VII, the appellant has attempted entry through the proverbial back door. She contends that regardless of our decision on the partnership issue she has been denied \u201cemployment opportunities\u201d in the firm\u2019s implementation of its \u201cup or out\u201d policy. In essence, she asserts the effect of the denial of partnership, subsequent termination of employment, deprived her of employment opportunities (frozen salary) and adversely affected her status as an employee (termination). 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e \u2014 2(a)(2) (1976). While discriminatory termination alone may have stated a cause of action under Title VII for an unlawful discharge, <em>Lucido v. Cravath, Swaine &amp; Moore, </em>when the termination is a result of the partnership decision, it loses its separate identity and must fall prey to the same ill-fate as her original attempt to apply Title VII to partnership decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-11\">Prospective associates are apprised not only of their potential for partnership, but also of the consequences to be suffered following an unfavorable decision. Just as she accepted a representation made to her concerning partnership consideration, appellant likewise assumed the risk that an unfavorable decision would set in motion the termi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1030\">*1030</page-number>nation procedure under the firm\u2019s \u201cup or out\u201d policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-4\">\n<em>The End</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-5\">Appellant creatively designed a new jurisdictional adventure for this Court to undertake. We have explored the new and intriguing trails, but find that each trail comes to a dead end. Title VII does not apply to those decisions dealing with the formation of partnerships. The dismissal is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1062-8\">. In rendering his decision, the trial judge additionally dealt with the plaintiff\u2019s motion to compel discovery. In view of his decision to dismiss the case, the request for further discovery was denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1062-9\">. It is significant to note that the partnership made the same decision with respect to two male associates, while other male associates within the group were invited to join the partnership.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1062-10\">. The parties vigorously dispute the nature of the May, 1979, decision. King &amp; Spalding claims the partnership voted not to reconsider Ms. Hishon for partnership and that the decision not to invite her was made in 1978. Ms. Hishon claims, however, that King &amp; Spalding reconsidered and revoted on the partnership issue at its May, 1979, meeting. In its motion to dismiss, King &amp; Spalding argued that since the partnership decision had been made in May, 1978, Ms. Hishon had exceeded the 180-day filing deadline for employment discrimination suits. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(e) (1976); <em>Bickham v. Miller, </em>584 F.2d 736 (5th Cir. 1978). Because we find Title VII inapplicable, the argument no longer retains its vitality and the disputed issue is of little consequence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1063-7\">. The complaint contained numerous instances of alleged sex discrimination within the plaintiffs seven and one half years of association with the firm. During oral argument the panel questioned whether the plaintiff intended to pursue individual claims of discrimination under Title VII regardless of the outcome of this appeal. Subsequent correspondence from plaintiffs counsel relieves this Court of its initial concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-8\">In a letter dated January 18, 1982, counsel for King &amp; Spalding informed this Court that all parties had expressly agreed with the District Court to limit its ruling to the threshold jurisdictional issue now presented on appeal. The suggestion, in fact, had been made originally by Ms. Hishon\u2019s counsel in an earlier letter:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1063-9\">If King &amp; Spalding were to prevail on this threshold question, discovery on the merits aimed at establishing that it has in fact discriminated against women and other minorities in its employment, promotion and compensation decisions, as well as discovery into matters of partner compensation for the purpose of establishing damages under Title VII, would be moot.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1063-10\">Letter from Emmet J. Bondurant to Judge Ne-well Edenfield (March 31, 1980); Record at 82-84.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-11\">A subsequent letter from Ms. Hishon\u2019s counsel, dated January 25, 1982, confirms the limited area of inquiry and the plaintiffs intention to focus on the partnership question alone.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aps\">Appellant did not intend to assert separate claims based on each individual episode of sex discrimination practiced against her as an employee that is alleged in the complaint. If the case is reversed and remanded for trial under one or more of the three legal theories referred to above, plaintiff does intend, however, to prove the acts of discrimination practiced against her as an associate as evidence of the existence of a continuing pattern and practice of discrimination on the part of King &amp; Spalding, as evidence that she had diminished opportunities to demonstrate that she was partnership material as compared to her male counterparts who were more favorably treated, and as evidence that King &amp; Spald-ing\u2019s ultimate decision to deny her admission to partnership was based on sex and not a legitimate evaluation of her professional capabilities.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1063-14\">If the Court should conclude (contrary to appellant\u2019s arguments) that Title VII does not apply to the three \u201cpartnership\u201d claims asserted by plaintiff under any of the three legal theories which she has advanced, <em>plaintiff does not desire a remand of the court below in order to afford plaintiff an opportunity to try any other Title VII claims based on individual episodes of sex discrimination that may have been practiced against her while she was an associate of King &amp; Spalding.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Afn\">Letter from Emmet J. Bondurant to Judges Tjoflat, Fay and Young (January 25, 1982) (emphasis supplied). In light of this correspondence, we find no jurisdictional barrier to our rendering a decision on the Title VII count limited solely to partnership decisions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1063-15\">. We do not find any additional obstacle posed by the original existence of two other counts. According to the plaintiffs brief; \u201cCounts Two and Three of the complaint, which alleged violations of the Equal Pay Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 206(d)(1), and a contract claim, have been informally withdrawn and dismissed by plaintiff without prejudice.\u201d Brief for Appellant at 2 n.l. <em>See also </em>Letter from Hamilton Lokey to Judges Tjoflat, Fay and Young (January 18, 1982) and Letter from Emmet J.

The appellant urges this Court to adopt an \u201ceconomic reality\u201d test for determining whether the partners at King &amp; Spalding are \u201cemployees.\u201d The test is derived from the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>NLRB v. Hearst Publications Co., </em>322 U.S. 111, 64 S.Ct. 851, 88 L.Ed. 1170 (1944), in which the Court applied the term \u201cemployee\u201d as found within the National Labor Relations Act. The Court defined the term according to \u201cthe purpose of the Act and the facts involved in the economic relationship.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 129, 64 S.Ct. at 859. The former Fifth Circuit recently employed this test in deciding whether an individual was an \u201cemployee\u201d for purposes of the Fair Labor Standards Act. <em>Donovan v. Tehco, Inc., </em>642 F.2d 141 (5th Cir. 1981). Other courts have considered this approach under Title VII. The ap-pellee, however, contends the term should be given its common dictionary meaning as suggested by Senator Clark in reference to the term employer. We find the <em>Calderon </em>test provides a more comprehensive standard by evaluating all relevant criteria.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1065-14\">. We are aware that <em>Calderon </em>dealt with the classification of \u201cemployee\u201d for purposes of establishing whether the plaintiff qualified in order to maintain an action under Title VII, whereas we are faced with whether the individual members of the defendant partnership may be considered employees. Each question is jurisdictional in origin, however, and we find <em>Calderon\u2019s </em>test especially appropriate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1066-8\">. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(l) &amp; (2) (1976) provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1066-9\">(a) It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1066-10\">(1) to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual\u2019s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1066-14\">(2) to limit, segregate, or classify his employees or applicants for employment in any way which would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his status as an employee, because of such individual\u2019s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1066-15\">For our purposes, we will simply refer to both sections as covering \u201cemployment opportunities.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1067-7\">.

The appellant alleges King &amp; Spalding also deprived her of employment opportunities by giving her less responsible work assignments, which prevented her from proving her value to the firm. <em>See Satz v. ITT Financial Corp., </em>619 F.2d 738 (8th Cir. 1980). Because she has elected to refrain from litigating these individual instances as violations of Title VII, we go no further.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1068-6\">TJOFLAT, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"axz-dedup-0\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-7\">In 1972, Elizabeth Hishon accepted a position as an associate with King &amp; Spalding, a large Atlanta law firm which operates as a general partnership. The partnership consists of approximately fifty active lawyers and employs approximately fifty additional lawyers as associates. At the time Hishon joined the firm, an associate was subject to discharge at the end of her sixth year. The firm also maintained an \u201cout or up\u201d policy whereby an associate who was not discharged at the end of the sixth year was invited to become a partner in the firm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-8\">In May 1978, the partnership evaluated Hishon, along with other associates hired in 1972, and decided to discharge her from the firm; this of course rendered Hishon ineligible for partnership. She was promptly notified, and was granted the usual period of time to secure other employment. Eight months later, Hishon requested reconsideration of her discharge. At the conclusion of the May 1979 associate review meeting, the result was the same \u2014 Hishon\u2019s discharge was confirmed. She left the firm on December 31, 1979.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-9\">This account of the process culminating in Elizabeth Hishon\u2019s departure from King &amp; Spalding differs from the majority\u2019s only verbally. See <em>ante </em>majority opinion at 1024. The majority says that King &amp; Spalding decided not to invite Hishon to become a partner, and that by operation of the firm\u2019s uniformly applied \u201cup or out\u201d policy, Hishon incidentally had to leave the firm. The alternative account says that King &amp; Spalding decided to fire Hishon, and that she was consequently not eligible for partnership.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-13\">The alternative is offered <em>not </em>to insinuate that the partners conspired to get rid of Hishon under the guise of denying her partnership. Rather, it is offered to suggest that in reviewing the district court\u2019s dismissal of Hishon\u2019s complaint, we should be concerned with the reality of the events alleged, and not with the conventional verbal garb in which those events are cloaked.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-14\">What \u201cactually happened\u201d is neither what the majority says happened nor what the alternative says happened. So far as we should be concerned, what happened is that the King &amp; Spalding partnership, having reviewed and evaluated Hishon\u2019s performance,- made a decision which they communicated to her. The <em>direct </em>consequence of this decision, mediated neither by Hi-shon\u2019s will nor by any cause other than the partnership itself, was to deny Hishon membership and to terminate her employment. Regardless the words by which we know the decision, the decision was, undeniably, to discharge Hishon.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-15\">Hishon alleges, and we must assume, that King &amp; Spalding discriminated against her on account of her sex by its decision to deny her partnership and to terminate her employment. The majority holds that \u201c. . . when the termination is a result of the partnership decision, it loses its separate identity and must fall prey to the same ill-fate as her original attempt to apply Title VII to partnership decisions.\u201d This is too glib for me. While I agree that Title VII would not apply to the discrete decision whether to take on a new partner,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> when the partnership decision inextricably and inevitably <em>is </em>a decision whether to terminate employment, I would hold that Title VII applies. Since this is such a case, I would reverse the district court\u2019s dismissal of Hishon\u2019s complaint and remand for further proceedings. I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1068-10\">. For example, Title VII would not apply to the partnership\u2019s invitations to lawyers who were not associates in the firm.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
