(\u201cCheckrite\u201d) except in accordance with the PMPA and awarding Checkrite attorney\u2019s fees. Because we find that the PMPA does not apply to the relationship between Amoco and Checkrite, we reverse.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b62-13\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b62-14\">On March 31, 1976, Amoco and Checkrite entered into a contract covering the five-year period ending May 30, 1981. The agreement, which was drafted by Amoco, designated Checkrite a \u201cbroker.\u201d Under the terms of the contract, Checkrite agreed to \u201ccause\u201d retail gasoline dealers listed in an attached Schedule \u201cA\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AW\">to execute and deliver to Amoco Dealer Sales Agreements on Amoco\u2019s standard form being offered to Amoco in the Metropolitan New York City area whereby such dealers contract to purchase from Amoco, petroleum products for resale at said service stations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b62-15\">App. at 18. As consideration for Check-rite\u2019s efforts, Amoco agreed to pay Check-rite a commission of 1.9 cents on each gallon of gasoline and ten percent on the dollar volume of motor oil sold by Amoco to the dealers listed on Schedule \u201cA\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-16\">Amoco entered into contracts directly with these retail dealers under which Amoco agreed to sell and to deliver gasoline and diesel fuel to the dealers at its standard prices. The dealer agreements also provided for the dealers\u2019 use of Amoco\u2019s trademark.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-17\">Amoco informed Checkrite by letter dated November 25,1980 that it did not intend to renew or extend its agreement with Checkrite after the May 30,1981 expiration date. Checkrite then instituted this suit, claiming that it maintained a \u201cfranchise relationship\u201d with Amoco and was therefore protected against termination under the PMPA. The complaint sought actual damages, exemplary damages, injunctive and declaratory relief, attorney\u2019s and expert witness\u2019 fees, costs and disbursements.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-18\">The district court ruled that while Check-rite would not be entitled to protection under a \u201cnarrow reading\u201d of the statute,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>Checkrite fits within the purpose of the PMPA as an independent entrepreneur whom Congress thought worthy of protection against unjustified termination; therefore Checkrite is a franchisee within the purpose of the statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b63-4\">App. at 86. Accordingly, the court granted summary judgment for Checkrite.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">The purpose of the PMPA is to establish \u201cminimum Federal standards governing the termination and nonrenewal of franchise relationships for the sale of motor fuel by the franchisor or supplier of such fuel.\u201d S.Rep.No.95-731, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 15, <em>reprinted in </em>[1978] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News 873, 873. Section 102 of the PMPA, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2802, prohibits a franchisor from terminating or failing to renew a franchise without satisfying certain notice provisions and without stating a reason for termination sanctioned by the act. It is undisputed that Amoco did not satisfy the PMPA termination requirements in its dealings with Checkrite. The issue in this case is whether Checkrite is a \u201cfranchisee\u201d within the meaning of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">\u201c[I]n any case concerning the interpretation of a statute the \u2018starting point\u2019 must be the language of the statute itself.\u201d <em>Lewis v. United States, </em>445 U.S. 55, 60, 100 S.Ct. 915, 918, 63 L.Ed.2d 198 (1980). \u201cAbsent a clearly expressed legislative intention to the contrary, that language must ordinarily be regarded as conclusive.\u201d <em>Consumer Products Safety Commission v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., </em>447 U.S. 102,108, 100 S.Ct. 2051, 2056, 64 L.Ed.2d 766 (1980); <em>Russo v. New York, </em>672 F.2d 1014, 1022 (2d Cir. 1982). The PMPA contains the following relevant definitions:</p>\n<p id=\"b63-9\">As used in this subchapter:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-10\">(1)(A) The term \u201cfranchise\u201d means any contract\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-11\">(i) between a refiner and a distributor,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-12\">(ii) between a refiner and a retailer,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-13\">(iii) between a distributor and another distributor, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-16\">(iv) between a distributor and a retailer,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b63-17\">under which a refiner or distributor (as the case may be) authorizes or permits a retailer or distributor to use, in connection with the sale, consignment, or distribution of motor fuel, a trademark which is owned or controlled by such refiner or by a refiner which supplies motor fuel to the distributor which authorizes or permits such use.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-18\">(2) The term \u201cfranchise relationship\u201d means the respective motor fuel marketing or distribution obligations and responsibilities of a franchisor and a franchisee which result from the marketing of motor fuel under a franchise.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-19\">(4) The term \u201cfranchisee\u201d means a retailer or distributor (as the case may be) who is authorized or permitted, under a franchise, to use a trademark in connection with the sale, consignment, or distribution of motor fuel.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-20\">(5) The term \u201crefiner\u201d means any person engaged in the refining of crude oil to produce motor fuel, and includes any affiliate of such person.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-21\">(6) The term \u201cdistributor\u201d means any person, including any affiliate of such person, who\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-22\">(A) purchases motor fuel for sale, consignment, or distribution to another; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-23\">(B) receives motor fuel on consignment for consignment or distribution to his own motor fuel accounts or to accounts of his supplier, but shall not include a person who is an employee of, or merely serves as a common carrier providing transportation service for, such supplier.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b63-24\">(7) The term \u201cretailer\u201d means any person who purchases motor fuel for sale to the general public for ultimate consumption.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>(15) The term \u201caffiliate\u201d means any person who (other than by means of a franchise) controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with, any other person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2801.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">Checkrite neither purchases motor fuel nor receives it on consignment from Amoco. Therefore, Checkrite is neither a \u201cdistributor\u201d nor a \u201cretailer\u201d within the plain wording of the PMPA.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Because only retailers and distributors fall within the statute\u2019s definition of \u201cfranchisee,\u201d Check-rite is not within the PMPA\u2019s plain terms. It is a well-established rule that \u201cwhen words are free from doubt they must be taken as the final expression of the legislative intent, and are not to be added to or subtracted from by considerations drawn . . . from any extraneous source.\u201d <em>Caminetti v. United States, </em>242 U.S. 470, 490, 37 S.Ct. 192,196, 61 L.Ed. 442 (1917); <em>Board of Education v. Harris, </em>622 F.2d 599, 609 (2d Cir. 1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 1124, 101 S.Ct. 940, 67 L.Ed.2d 110 (1981). Strict construction is particularly appropriate where, as here, the statute in question is in derogation of common law rights. <em>See, e.g., In re Liberatore, </em>574 F.2d 78, 85 (2d Cir. 1978); <em>United States v. Mead, </em>426 F.2d 118, 123 &amp; n.5 (9th Cir. 1970); <em>Bauers v. Heisel, </em>361 F.2d 581, 587 (3d Cir. 1966), <em>cert. denied, </em>386 U.S. 1021, 87 S.Ct. 1367, 18 L.Ed.2d 457 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">Despite these well-known canons of statutory construction, and notwithstanding its failure to satisfy the unambiguous statutory definition of \u201cfranchisee,\u201d Checkrite argues, and the district court found, that the legislative history of the PMPA indicates that Congress intended to \u201caccord broad protection to persons \u2018marketing\u2019 branded fuels.\u201d App. at 80. The court held, therefore, that Checkrite was within the intended scope of PMPA protection. Even if it were necessary in this case to search beyond the statutory language for an expression of legislative intent, we would disagree with the district court\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-9\">The district court relied principally on two passages of legislative history in concluding that Checkrite is a \u201cfranchisee.\u201d First, the court cited the Senate Report on the PMPA, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-10\">The committee also sought to resolve a problem raised by the definition of \u201cdistributor\u201d in title I. Under H.R. 130 as presented to the committee a distributor includes a person or his affiliate \u201cwho receives motor fuel on consignment for consignment or distribution <em>to his own motor fuel accounts.\u201d </em>(emphasis added) The question arises of distinguishing a consignee\u2019s accounts from those of his supplier. The committee was concerned that a consignee might be treated as a distributor under H.R. 130 with respect to some accounts but not with respect to others. Rather than attempt to delineate a means of making this distinction as to ownership or control of the accounts, the committee chose to treat a consignee as a distributor regardless of whether the account is that of the consignee or of the supplier.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-11\">However, the committee included a proviso that the definition of distributor does not include employees of the supplier, nor a person who merely serves as a common carrier who provides transportation services for the supplier. With this proviso the committee retained the distinction that independent entrepreneurs are to be included as distributors while employees of the supplier or those common carriers who merely supply transportation as would a common carrier are not distributors under this definition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AkL\">S.Rep.No. 95-731, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 27, <em>reprinted in </em>[1978] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News 873, 885.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-12\">The relevance of this passage to the issue in this case is dubious. In any event, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>passage provides no support for Checkrite\u2019s position. The passage specifically addresses particular problems of the definition of \u201cdistributor\u201d as it relates to consignees. Because consignees are covered by the PMPA\u2019s definition of \u201cdistributor\u201d the Senate Report suggests no congressional intent beyond that expressed by the statute\u2019s plain terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\">The district court also relied heavily on the remarks of Representative Dingell during the House debates on the PMPA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-5\">It was our intention to cover a consignee or commission agent where he in fact provides the functions and services of a jobber. It was not intended that a consignee would be covered if, in fact, he is an employee. This is a question of fact resolution of which lies in the hands of the courts whose job it will be to see that fairness is accorded to all parties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-6\">Let me read from the report. The report states:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-7\">\u2018[I]t is intended that the provisions of the title would apply to a consignee who acts generally like a jobber.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-8\">What I am saying is that where a person has the characteristics of an employee, although he in fact does handle the product, he is not covered. It is not our intention to expand the rights of employees. Where a consignee functions, however, as a jobber and does everything that a jobber would do, save taking title to the motor fuel \u2014 or most of what a jobber does \u2014 he would then have the protections afforded by the legislation. We have tried to draw that very narrow distinction. It is not our goal to create problems for either side in this controversy but to leave this as a fact question which will be properly and prudently decided by the court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b65-9\">123 Cong.Rec. 10386 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-10\">We do not think that these remarks constitute \u201ca clearly expressed legislative intent\u201d, <em>Consumer Products Safety Commission v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., </em>447 U.S. at 108, 100 S.Ct. at 2056, to cover parties not within the terms of the statute. Representative Dingell was addressing the distinction between an employee of a refiner who is technically a consignee and an independent consignee. Like the references to \u201cconsignee\u201d in the Senate Report discussed above, Representative Dingell\u2019s remarks do not contradict or go beyond that which is expressed in the plain words of the PMPA. The single reference to \u201ccommission agent\u201d is, at most, ambiguous and hardly constitutes a sufficient ground for ignoring the statutory language.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-13\">The district court\u2019s reliance on Representative Dingell\u2019s reference to jobbers and on the claimed similarities between Checkrite and a typical jobber is also misplaced. The term \u201cjobber,\u201d which is not defined in the PMPA, is generally taken to mean \u201c[o]ne who buys and sells goods for others[,]\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 970 (4th ed. 1968), or \u201cwholesaler[,j\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 1217 (1971). Thus, a typical branded fuel jobber would fit squarely within the PMPA definition of \u201cdistributor.\u201d Because Checkrite does not buy and sell motor fuel, it is not a typical jobber; hence Checkrite is not a distributor; and therefore Checkrite is not a franchisee entitled to protection under the PMPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-14\">Checkrite\u2019s final argument, adopted by the district court, is that termination of its contract with Amoco will have the same effect on the dealers covered by the contract as direct termination of the dealers by Amoco. Checkrite, claiming that it has the power to order dealers to sell or not to sell any brand of gasoline it chooses, reasons that if it is terminated by Amoco, it will in turn cause the dealers to terminate their agreements with Amoco. Thus, Checkrite appears to argue that if Amoco can terminate it with impunity, it can circumvent the protections that the PMPA provides against unfair termination of dealers.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-15\">This \u201clogic\u201d is wholly unpersuasive. The PMPA is aimed at preventing unfair and discriminatory termination of franchisees by franchisors. Amoco readily concedes that its relationships with the retail dealers involved in the Amoco-Checkrite contract are governed by the PMPA and that it cannot terminate those relationships with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>out complying with the statute\u2019s provisions. The dealers are threatened only by Check-rite. That Checkrite might take action detrimental to dealers certainly does not provide Checkrite with rights against Amoco under the PMPA.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">In summary, we hold that the plain terms of the PMPA do not provide Checkrite any protection against termination by Amoco, and that the legislative history of the act expresses no congressional intent to go beyond these plain terms. Therefore, we reverse the judgment of the district court and remand this case with directions to dismiss the complaint and to vacate the award of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">So ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b62-12\">. Because Checkrite\u2019s agreement with Amoco expired under its terms before the district court issued the injunction in this case, the injunction should, technically, have prohibited Amoco from failing to renew the agreement under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2802(a)(2), rather than from terminating the agreement under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2802(a)(1). For clarity, we adhere to the district court\u2019s terminology which apparently has not confused the parties in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b62-20\">. Checkrite cross-appeals from the district court\u2019s denial of its request for damages. Because we hold that Checkrite is entitled to no relief under the PMPA, we affirm the denial of a damage award.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b63-14\">. The district court enjoined Amoco from terminating its agreement with Checkrite without complying with PMPA requirements and awarded Checkrite attorney\u2019s fees. The court denied Checkrite\u2019s pleas for other relief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b64-7\">. Checkrite persists in the argument, rejected by the district court, that it is an affiliate of Amoco and is therefore a \u201cdistributor\u201d under the PMPA. Since there is no basis in the record to support a finding that Checkrite \u201ccontrols, is controlled by, or is under common control with\u201d Amoco, we need not pass on the rest of Checkrite\u2019s reasoning on this point.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b66-15\">. As an alternative ground for reversal Amoco asserts that Checkrite is not a \u201cfranchisee\u201d because the Amoco-Checkrite agreement does not authorize Checkrite to use Amoco\u2019s trademark as required by 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2801(1)(A) &amp; (2). Because we find that Checkrite does not meet the threshold requirement of being a \u201cretailer\u201d or \u201cdistributor\u201d within the meaning of the PMPA, we need not determine whether Checkrite also fails to meet the requirement of being \u201cauthorized or permitted\u201d to use Amoco\u2019s trademark.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
