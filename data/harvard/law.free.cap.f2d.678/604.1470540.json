Ramirez was convicted in state court of unlawful sale of heroin and then exhausted the available state remedies. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-23\">In seeking habeas corpus relief, Ramirez argues that the state denied him due process by deliberately concealing a material witness, Jimmy Levine. <em>See Hernandez v. Estelle, </em>674 F.2d 313 (5th Cir., 1981). The state replies that Ramirez waived review of his constitutional contention under <em>Wainwright v. Sykes, </em>433 U.S. 72, 97 S.Ct. 2497, 53 L.Ed.2d 594 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-24\">Although the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals in its opinion in Ramirez\u2019 direct appeal does not specify the state procedural rule violated by Ramirez, from the opinion\u2019s language we understand the rule to be Tex. Code Crim.P.Ann. art. 29.06 (Vernon 1966), which requires a defendant to move for a continuance in the event of a missing witness. A proper motion for continuance can provide a basis for a new trial. <em>Id. </em>While the record reflects that Ramirez wanted Levine as a witness,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the failure by Ramirez to move for a continuance precluded review by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals of Ramirez\u2019 due process claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-25\">In <em>Sykes, </em>the Supreme Court stated that a state procedural waiver \u2014 there, failure to follow a contemporaneous-objec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>tion rule \u2014 bars federal habeas corpus review in the absence of a showing of both the cause for the failure to comply and the prejudice resulting from the waiver. 433 U.S. at 87, 97 S.Ct. at 2506-07. As the rationale for the rule in <em>Sykes </em>applies equally to a waiver based upon a failure to move for a continuance, we view art. 29.06 as a type of state procedural rule to which the <em>Sykes </em>Court intended federal courts to defer. <em>But cf. Freeman v. Georgia, </em>599 F.2d 65, 71 (5th Cir. 1979) (dictum), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 1013, 100 S.Ct. 661, 62 L.Ed.2d 641 (1980). Like the contemporaneous objection, a motion for continuance is of fundamental fact finding importance, contributes to finality, can guide federal habeas review and encourages prosecutorial deliberation. <em>See Sykes, </em>433 U.S. at 88-90, 97 S.Ct. at 2507-08. We are particularly concerned with \u201csandbagging\u201d on the part of the defense lawyers. A habeas corpus petition provides collateral review only: it is a secondary proceeding. The defendant\u2019s belief that a particular witness\u2019 testimony is crucial to his case should be brought out at the state trial, giving the state trial court the opportunity to determine the importance of the missing witness. \u201cIf a criminal defendant thinks that an action of the state trial court is about to deprive him of a federal constitutional right there is every reason for his following state procedure . . . . \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 90, 97 S.Ct. at 2508. Consequently, Ramirez\u2019 failure to file an art. 29.-06 motion for continuance precludes habeas corpus relief unless there is good cause for the waiver and prejudice results.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-28\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>THE COURT: For Jimmy Levine or for the Records?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b644-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>In the instant case, the district court found that the absence of Levine\u2019s testimony did not prejudice Ramirez. After reviewing the record, we are not left with a definite and firm conviction that the district court\u2019s finding was erroneous. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a); <em>United States v. United States Gypsum Co., </em>333 U.S. 364, 395, 68 S.Ct. 525, 542, 92 L.Ed. 746 (1948). Ramirez\u2019 trial testimony attempted to raise the defense of entrapment. Ramirez says Levine would have repeated Ramirez\u2019 own testimony. The state court, however, denied Ramirez\u2019 requested entrapment instruction, although Ramirez\u2019 counsel argued entrapment to the jury. Ramirez never challenged the state court\u2019s denial of the entrapment instruction. Thus, even if Levine\u2019s testimony would be identical to Ramirez\u2019 testimony, without the entrapment instruction Levine\u2019s testimony would not have exculpated Ramirez. Accordingly, as Ramirez was not prejudiced by the waiver, we need not consider the other prong\u2014 cause for the waiver \u2014 of the <em>Sykes </em>test. Ramirez waived his constitutional objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b643-13\">.
