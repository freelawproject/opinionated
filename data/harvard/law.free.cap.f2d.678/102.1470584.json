Jones, who was present at the scene of the crime but who did not fire the fatal shot, was convicted after a jury trial of aiding and abetting the violation of both 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a), the general bank robbery statute, and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(e), which provides greater punishment for commission of a robbery in which a killing or kidnapping occurs. He was sentenced to life imprisonment in accordance with the enhancement provisions of \u00a7 2113(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-20\">Jones\u2019s principal argument on appeal is that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(e) is applicable only to the perpetrator of a killing or kidnapping and cannot provide a foundation for accomplice liability. Although we cannot agree with such a restrictive reading, we agree that the jury was improperly instructed on the elements on the \u00a7 2113(e) offense. Accordingly, we reverse the \u00a7 2113(e) conviction. We remand to the district court for resentencing under \u00a7 2113(a), or, if the government so elects, for retrial of the entire case. <em>United States v. Short, </em>500 F.2d 676, 677 (9th Cir.), <em>modifying </em>493 F.2d 1170, <em>cert, denied, </em>419 U.S. 1000, 95 S.Ct. 317, 42 L.Ed.2d 275 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-21\">Section 2113,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> entitled \u201cBank robbery and incidental crimes,\u201d defines the federal offense of bank robbery and speci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>fies the applicable criminal sanctions. Because \u00a7 2113 defines a crime against the United States, any person who aids or abets such an offense is punishable as a principal under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2(a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">The interaction of the subsections of \u00a7 2113 is critical to this appeal. Subsection (a) proscribes the taking of anything of value by \u201cforce, violence, or intimidation\u201d from a covered banking institution. Violations carry a fine of $5,000, imprisonment of not more than twenty years, or both. Subsection (d) proscribes the same conduct prohibited under (a), but provides a fine of $10,000, imprisonment of not more than twenty-five years, or both, when, during the course of the robbery, the perpetrator \u201cassaults any person, or puts in jeopardy the life of any person by the use of a dangerous weapon or device . .. . \u201d Finally, subsection (e) relates to robberies in which a killing or kidnapping occurs. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-12\">Whoever, in committing any offense defined in this section or in avoiding or attempting to avoid apprehension for the commission of such offense, or in freeing himself or attempting to free himself from arrest or confinement for such offense, kills any person, or forces any person to accompany him without the consent of such person, shall be imprisoned not less than ten years or punished by death if the verdict of the jury shall so direct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-13\">Subsection (e), like subsection (d), provides enhanced punishment for bank robberies in which there is \u201caggravating\u201d conduct in addition to the basic \u00a7 2113(a) of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>fense. <em>United States v. Faleafine, </em>492 F.2d 18, 25 (9th Cir. 1974) (en banc). The applicability of enhanced punishment depends, of course, on whether the actor\u2019s conduct fits within the precise language of the enhancement subsections.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">In this case, Jones was charged with aiding and abetting the violation of \u00a7 2113. He argues that the aiding and abetting provision of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2 cannot apply to \u00a7 2113(e). The aiding and abetting provision of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2, however, is applicable to the entire criminal code. <em>United States v. May, </em>625 F.2d 186,194 (8th Cir. 1980); <em>Breeze v. United States, </em>398 F.2d 178, 192 (10th Cir. 1968). Jones points to no suggestion in the legislative histories of either \u00a7 2 or \u00a7 2113 that Congress intended to carve out an exception in \u00a7 2113 cases. We therefore reject the argument that \u00a7 2113(e) is applicable only to the perpetrator of a killing or kidnapping in the course of a robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">We also reject Jones\u2019s argument that the evidence in this case could not support a finding by the jury that he aided and abetted the principal in the killing. Witnesses testified that Jones was near the guard when he was shot, and that Jones may have struggled with the guard immediately before.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">Jones\u2019s challenge to the instructions given to the jury, however, has merit. Cases arising under \u00a7 2113(d) hold that the government must show that the defendant aided and abetted the principal in every \u201cessential element\u201d of the offense. Under a \u00a7 2113(d) charge the government must therefore show that the defendant aided and abetted the principal both in the act of bank robbery and in the principal\u2019s use of \u201ca dangerous weapon or device\u201d during the act. <em>United States v. Short, </em>493 F.2d 1170, 1172 (9th Cir.), <em>modified, </em>500 F.2d 676, <em>cert, denied, </em>419 U.S. 1000, 95 S.Ct. 317, 42 L.Ed.2d 275 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">In <em>Short </em>the defendant acted as the principal\u2019s \u201cget-away\u201d driver. The trial court instructed the jury that Short could be convicted under \u00a7 2113(d) if the evidence showed that he knew the principal was going to attempt a bank robbery and that he \u201cdid some affirmative act to attempt to help.\u201d This court reversed because the trial court failed to instruct the jury on aiding and abetting the use of the weapon, an \u201cessential element\u201d of the crime of armed bank robbery. The court summarized: \u201cAn essential element of armed bank robbery as charged here is that the principal was armed and used the weapon to jeopardize the life of the teller. It is this conduct that Short must be shown to have aided and abetted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1172.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-9\">Similarly, in <em>United States v. Jones, </em>592 F.2d 1038 (9th Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>441 U.S. 951, 99 S.Ct. 2179, 60 L.Ed.2d 1056 (1979), the defendant, a \u201cget-away\u201d driver, was convicted of aiding and abetting under \u00a7\u00a7 2113(a) and (d). This court, following the analysis of <em>Short, </em>found the evidence insufficient to sustain the charge that the defendant had aided and abetted the principal in conduct proscribed by subsection (d). Because, however, the evidence was sufficient to show that the defendant had aided in the actual robbery, the case was remanded for resentencing under \u00a7 2113(a) alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-10\"><em>Short </em>and <em>Jones </em>hold that an accomplice charged under \u00a7 2113(d) must aid and abet the principal in both the bank robbery and the use of the dangerous weapon or device in order for the enhanced penalties of that provision to apply. Subsections (d) and (e) are parallel provisions. <em>United States v. Faleafine, </em>492 F.2d at 23, 25. We hold that this court\u2019s analysis of accomplice liability under subsection (d) is equally applicable to subsection (e). The \u201cessential elements\u201d of subsection (e) are the commission of a robbery and the killing or kidnapping in connection with it. The accomplice must aid and abet each of these essential elements. As the Fifth Circuit stated in similar circumstances, \u201c[w]here a defendant is charged with aiding and abetting a crime involving an element which enhances or aggravates the offense, there must be proof that the defendant associated herself with and participated in both elements of the crime.\u201d <em>United States v. Longoria, </em>569 F.2d 422, 425 (5th Cir. 1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>In this case the jury was not instructed to consider whether Jones aided and abetted in the killing. The court informed the jury that it must find three elements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-4\">First: that on or about the date alleged [the alleged principal] willfully took from the presence or person of another money belonging to or in the care, custody, control, management or possession of a bank as charged, by force, violence or by means of intimidation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-5\">Second: that defendant Chippy Jones willfully aided and abetted [the principal] in committing said robbery;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-6\">Third: that a person was killed during the commission of the robbery, as charged in the indictment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">The trial court should, in addition, have instructed the jury to determine whether the defendant aided and abetted the killing by the principal. <em>See </em>1 E. Devitt &amp; C. Blackmar, <em>Federal Jury Practice and Instructions </em>\u00a7 12.03 (3d ed. 1977). It is not enough for the jury to find that the defendant aided and abetted a bank robbery in which a killing occurred. This error was not harmless and we must reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">Appellant Jones raises two additional arguments with which we deal briefly. Jones claims that certain pre-trial statements of jail inmates with whom he was held should have been suppressed. The evidence does not show that these inmates were acting as informants for the government within the meaning of <em>United States v. Henry, </em>474 U.S. 264, 100 S.Ct. 2183, 65 L.Ed.2d 115 (1980). Finally, Jones did not challenge at trial the photographic identification procedure used by investigators. We have reviewed the record and can find no plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-9\">On remand the trial court may resentence Jones under \u00a7 2113(a), or, if the government elects, may retry the entire case. <em>United States v. Short, </em>500 F.2d 676, 677 (9th Cir.), <em>modifying </em>493 F.2d 1170, <em>cert, denied, </em>419 U.S. 1000, 95 S.Ct. 317, 42 L.Ed.2d 275 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-10\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b159-15\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-16\">(a) Whoever, by force and violence, or by intimidation, takes, or attempts to take, from the person or presence of another any property or money or any other thing of value belonging to, or in the care, custody, control, management, or possession of, any bank, credit union, or any savings and loan association;

I do interpret the opinion to hold that there must be more than an intent to commit a bank robbery. In this posture of the case, if there is a retrial, the district court must devise an appropriate instruction. I am somewhat uncomfortable about our failure to give further guidance, but I suppose there is ample justification in the failure of counsel for either party thoroughly to brief the issue.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
