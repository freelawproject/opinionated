The trial court granted summary judgment for the defendants, holding that as a matter of law their wall panel did not infringe appellant\u2019s patent. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-27\">(I) Infringement is ordinarily a question of fact. <em>Studiengesellschaft Kohle mbH </em>v. <em>Eastman Kodak Co., </em>616 F.2d 1315, 1322 (5th Cir. 1980). When there is no dispute as to the construction of the patented device and the accused device, however, the question of infringement becomes one of law. <em>Hansen v. Colliver, </em>282 F.2d 66, 69 (9th Cir. 1960); <em>Del Francia v. Stanthony Corp., </em>278 F.2d 745, 748 n.5 (9th Cir. 1960). The district court in the instant case treated the infringement question as one of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-28\">Appellant contends that the district court erred because there was a dispute as to the construction of the accused device, appel-lees\u2019 wall panels. Appellant says the dispute concerned \u201cthe significance, function and effect of certain of the elements\u201d of those panels, the \u201coutside wires.\u201d This alleged dispute, however, does not really concern the <em>structure </em>of the accused product at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>all. Rather, it goes to the question of whether the outside wires in appellees\u2019 panel act as the equivalents of the bonding agent described in appellant\u2019s patent. That is a matter not of the \u201cconstruction\u201d of appellees\u2019 panel, but of the legal characterization of that construction. Therefore, we reject appellant\u2019s contention that the district court erred in treating the infringement issue here as a question of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">(II) The patent that appellant contends was infringed is U.S. Patent No. 3,879,908 (\u201cthe \u2019908 patent\u201d). Both parties have agreed that only claim 3 of that patent need be considered, since it is the broadest of the patent claims. Claim 3 describes a prefabricated wall panel in which insulative material, in the form of plastic strips, is inserted into the spaces defined by a wire lattice and then held in place by a \u201cbonding agent.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">Appellees manufacture a wall panel of their own, which they assemble by stacking up plastic insulation strips and wire trusses, compressing the stack so as to embed the trusses in the insulation strips, and then welding \u201coutside wires\u201d to the trusses to complete the wire lattice. Thus, no separate, adhesive substance need be employed as a bonding agent to hold appellees\u2019 panel together. Appellant, however, asserts that the term \u201cbonding agent,\u201d as used in the \u2019908 patent, is not limited to a <em>separate </em>substance used as such an agent, and that appellees\u2019 panel does contain a bonding agent. For this reason, appellant maintains, appellees\u2019 wall panel literally infringes claim 3 of the \u2019908 patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-10\">The wording of claim 3 seems to indicate that the \u201cbonding agent\u201d spoken of there is meant to be a separate substance \u2014 it is said to be \u201cdisposed between the insulative elements and the adjacent lattice elements.\u201d <em>See </em>emphasized language in note 1 <em>supra. </em>Appellant insists, however, that the words \u201cbonding agent\u201d apply to any mechanism or force that causes one thing to be held in place relative to something else. Since <em>something </em>in appellees\u2019 panel holds the insulation strips in place relative to the wire lattice, appellant argues, that panel must contain a bonding agent.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b175-11\">We disagree. Appellant defends its position by relying on isolated dictionary definitions of \u201cbond\u201d and \u201cagent,\u201d but this reasoning totally ignores the context in which the term \u201cbonding agent\u201d is used. It would also lead to absurd conclusions \u2014 for example, that the bars on a prison cell constitute a \u201cbonding mechanism\u201d because they are a mechanism which \u201cbonds,\u201d in the dictionary sense of \u201crestraining from liberty.\u201d Appellant\u2019s approach, indeed, would compel the conclusion that <em>any </em>modular building panel containing individual strips of insulation inside a wire lattice will be covered by the \u2019908 patent, even one that embodies a completely new and revolutionary technique for holding the insulation in place.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>Appellant also contends the trial court erred in focusing on the language of the patent specifications, which it says merely detailed the preferred practice of the invention. But the Supreme Court, although emphasizing that the claims of a patent define its scope, has said: \u201c[I]t is fundamental that claims are to be construed in the light of the specifications and both are to be read with a view to ascertaining the invention.\u201d <em>United States v. Adams, </em>383 U.S. 39, 49, 86 S.Ct. 708, 713, 15 L.Ed.2d 572 (1966) (citations omitted). Hence \u201cit is permissible to examine the specifications to understand properly the scope of a patent claim,\u201d especially if a term used in the claim is capable of two interpretations. <em>Del Mar Engineering Laboratories v. Physio-Tronics, Inc., </em>642 F.2d 1167, 1172 (9th Cir. 1981).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">We conclude that appellees\u2019 panel does not literally infringe Claim 3 of the \u2019908 patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">(Ill) Even a device whose structure does not correspond precisely to the claims of a patent may be found to infringe the patent under the \u201cdoctrine of equivalents.\u201d The trial court, though, found that appellees\u2019 product was not the equivalent of appellant\u2019s because it contained no element equivalent to the \u201cbonding agent\u201d of appellant\u2019s \u2019908 patent. Appellant disputes the finding that no element in appellees\u2019 panel is equivalent to its \u201cbonding agent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">An accused device will be found to be the equivalent of a patented invention \u201c \u2018if it performs substantially the same function <em>in substantially the same way </em>to obtain the same result.\u2019 \u201d <em>Graver Tank &amp; Manufacturing Co. v. Linde Air Products Co., </em>339 U.S. 605, 608, 70 S.Ct. 854, 556, 94 L.Ed. 1097 (1950), <em>quoting Sanitary Refrigerator Co. v. Winters, </em>280 U.S. 30, 42, 50 S.Ct. 9, 13, 74 L.Ed. 147 (1929) (emphasis added). The emphasized language is vital, because the mere fact that the accused device performs the same function or accomplishes the same result as the patented device will <em>not </em>establish infringement. <em>Mobil Oil Corp. v. Filtrol Corp., </em>501 F.2d 282, 292 (9th Cir. 1974). Here, however, appellant\u2019s arguments, designed to show that either the \u201ccompressive forces\u201d in appellees\u2019 panel or the \u201coutside wires\u201d welded on to the wire trusses therein are the equivalent of appellant\u2019s \u201cbonding agent,\u201d run afoul of this principle.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-9\">Appellant\u2019s argument boils down to this: the \u201ccompressive forces\u201d and the \u201coutside wires\u201d hold appellees\u2019 panel together, and thus perform the same function that the \u201cbonding agent\u201d performs in the invention described in the \u2019908 patent; hence, the \u201ccompressive forces\u201d and the \u201coutside wires\u201d must be equivalent to the \u201cbonding agent.\u201d Plainly, this argument reads the emphasized language out of the <em>Graver Tank </em>equivalence test, violating our holding in <em>Mobil Oil Corp., supra. </em>In fact, appel-lees\u2019 panel dispenses with the need for a separate bonding agent \u2014 which, as discussed above, is what the \u2019908 patent called for \u2014 and thus achieves the same result as appellant\u2019s patent but by a different method. Hence, appellees\u2019 device is not equivalent to the invention covered by the \u2019908 patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-10\">(IV) Appellant\u2019s other contentions merit only brief replies.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-11\">(1) The district court\u2019s alleged failure to properly consider the Weismann and Wagner declarations does not constitute failure to take account of the state of the prior art, since neither of these declarations contains relevant information about the state of the prior art.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-12\">(2) In concluding that equivalency was a legal issue in this case because the \u201cmethod of constructing\u201d the rival devices was not disputed, the district court did not contra-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>diet its assertion that the \u2019908 patent covered a product, rather than a process. \u201cMethod of construction\u201d can mean either the process by which a device is put together or the structure of the resulting device, and the district court\u2019s remarks, taken in context, make it clear that the court was using that term in the latter sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">(3) The district court asserted that the \u2019908 patent was a \u201cpaper patent\u201d and an \u201cimprovement patent,\u201d and that both sorts of patents are entitled to only a small range of equivalents. We are not convinced that either assertion played any role in the judgment, but in any case both assertions are quite correct. First, appellants can hardly deny that the \u2019908 patent is an improvement patent \u2014 the patent itself states that \u201c[t]he invention pertains to <em>improvements </em>in modular building panels,\u201d and goes on to describe how the new invention incorporates the principal features of previously-patented panels while adding some new, improved features. Second, contrary to what appellants claim, \u201cpaper patents\u201d \u2014 those, like the \u2019908 patent, that have not been put into commercial production\u2014 do receive only a narrow range of equivalents. <em>See, e.g., Lockwood </em>v. <em>Langendorf United Bakeries, Inc., </em>324 F.2d 82, 88 (9th Cir. 1963); <em>Richard Irvin &amp; Co. v. Westinghouse Air Brake Co., </em>121 F.2d 429, 430 (2d Cir. 1941) (per curiam); <em>Dillon Co. v. Continental Supply Co., </em>98 F.2d 581, 587 (10th Cir. 1938).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">For the reasons stated above, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b175-7\">. Claim 3 reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-8\">A prefabricated modular building panel as an article of manufacture comprising a three-dimensional lattice fabricated of a plurality of slender elongated metal elements arranged to define a pair of substantially parallel spaced major lattice surfaces, side and end lattice edge surfaces, and a plurality of strut members traversing the interior of the lattice and interconnecting the major surfaces thereof to define a plurality of passages within the lattice open at at least one end thereof to one of the edge surfaces, and thermal insulating filler material disposed within the lattice to extend from side to side and from end to end of the lattice, the filler material being held in position within the lattice by the elements defining the lattice, the filler material being comprised of a plurality of insulative elements defined by a rigid cellular foam material positioned in the passages through the' open ends of the passages to be disposed wholly within the lattice, <em>and a bonding agent disposed between the insulative elements and the adjacent lattice elements for fixing the insulative elements in position within the lattice.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b175-13\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b175-14\">. Appellant has difficulty pinpointing just what it believes the \u201cbonding agent\u201d present in ap-pellees\u2019 panel is. In its opening brief, appellant pointed to the \u201ccompressive forces\u201d resulting from the compression of the insulation strips and wire trusses; in its reply brief, appellant instead singles out the \u201coutside wires\u201d welded on to the trusses after the compression has taken place.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b176-7\">. Moreover, even the language of Claim 3 itself, without reference to the specifications, is naturally interpreted as referring to a separate element as \u201cbonding agent.\u201d One simply would not, in ordinary discourse, speak of the \u201ccompressive forces\u201d appellant finds in appellees\u2019 panel as \u201cdisposed between the insulative elements and the adjacent lattice elements\u201d: these forces are internal to the lattice and the insulation. Nor are the \u201coutside wires\u201d in ap-pellees\u2019 panel located <em>between </em>the insulation and the lattice \u2014 they form part of the lattice itself.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b177-8\">. <em>Continental Paper Bag Co. v. Eastern Paper Bag Co., </em>210 U.S. 405, 28 S.Ct. 748, 52 L.Ed. 1122 (1908), on which appellant relies, merely held that \u201cpaper patents\u201d are entitled to equitable protection against infringement \u2014 it did <em>not </em>hold that such patents are to be accorded as broad a range of equivalents as patents that have been put into production.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
