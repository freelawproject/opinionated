The answers of the principal defendants, Corydon and his wife, after denying the principal allegations of the bill, set up that the real estate in controversy constituted the homestead of the said Corydon and family, and that it was of less value than $1,000 at the time of the conveyances, and claiming that in such case the said Cory-don had the right to convey it to whom he pleased, if done in good faith which they averred, regardless of the fact that he was in debt, and upon this point arises the only controversy in this court or the courts below.</summary><summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b194-8\" pgmap=\"194\">Upon hearing, the court below dismissed the bill and Boyd sued out this writ of error.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b194-9\" pgmap=\"194\">Mr. R.

Injury is an essential element of fraud, and where injury is wanting there can be no fraud. Leupold v. Krause, 95 Ill. 440. This was a case involving a homestead. A similar rule prevails in reference to personal property. Vaughan v. Thompson, 17 Ill. 78; Cole v. Green, 21 Ill. 104; Washburn v. Goodheart, 88 Ill. 229. See, also, Dreutzell v.

Ho judgment that he may recover can in any manner affect it. It is taken by the statute out of the available assets of the debtor for the payment of his debts, as effectually as if he had never owned or possessed it.</p> <p id=\"b196-9\" pgmap=\"196\">Ho creditor, therefore, can be said to be injured because the debtor retains it in defiance of him. '</p> <p id=\"b196-10\" pgmap=\"196\">The creditor can not legally be said to be injured because the homestead is pffaced beyond his reach, for he has no right to look to it at all for the satisfaction of his claims against the debtor whatever form they may assume.</p> <p id=\"b196-11\" pgmap=\"196(66) 197(32)\">In fact, it is placed beyond their reach to all intents and purposes, except by the voluntary action of the husband and his wife, if he have one, in the manner provided by the same act that creates it. The clause of the sixth section, quoted above, invests the grantee of the homestead with all the rights, exemptions and immunities attaching to it in the hands of the grantor. The grantee holds it as free from all claims of the creditors of the debtor grantor, under this statute, as he himself could have held it if not conveyed.</p> <p id=\"b197-4\" pgmap=\"197\">From these provisions, then, the creditor can not claim to be injured if the homestead be sold and possession be surrendered under the deed. He is placed in no worse position because of this action of the debtor. He had no right to subject the homestead to the payment of his debt in the hands of his debtor, and his inability to follow it is continued after the sale.</p> <p id=\"b197-5\" pgmap=\"197\">His rights are, therefore, not in the least affected, impaired nor denied. Even if we had found that the sale to Despain and from him to the wife of said Cory don, were made with intent to defraud the complainant as alleged in the bill, still the conveyance would be good, as the property did not exceed 81,000 in value, under the case of Leupold v. Krause, 95 Ill. 440, and if this be so, then a mere gift of the property made in go.od faith ought to be held valid for much weightier reasons. Folding, as we do, that this conveyance was made for a provision to the wife and family, and of property upon which the complainant below did not have and could have no lien or right, he is in no position to question it.</p> <p id=\"b197-6\" pgmap=\"197\">No error was committed bv the court below in dismissing the bill and its decree will be affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b197-7\" pgmap=\"197\">Decree affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
