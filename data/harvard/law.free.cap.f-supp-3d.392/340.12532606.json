The Court further concludes that the findings, reasoning, and legal support for the recommendations made in the Report are consistent with applicable law as set forth in the cases and statutes relied upon therein, and are thus warranted. Accordingly, for substantially the reasons set forth in Magistrate Judge Cott's thorough and detailed Report, the Court adopts in their entirety the Report's factual and legal analyses and determinations, as well as its substantive recommendations, as the Court's ruling on Defendants' Motions to Dismiss (Dkt. Nos. 54, 58) and Plaintiffs' Motion to Amend (Dkt. No. 92).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n    <em>\n     ORDER\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   For the reasons discussed above, it is hereby\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that the Report and Recommendation of Magistrate Judge James Cott dated April 11, 2019 (Dkt.

Plaintiffs' claims arise from defendants' legal representation of them and similarly situated entities and individuals in separate lawsuits related to the liquidation of Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Defendants have each moved to dismiss this action, arguing that the Court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction over this case. Plaintiffs oppose defendants' motions, asserting that the Court has jurisdiction over this matter under the Class Action Fairness Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d). They contend that the jurisdictional requirements of the Act--minimal diversity, 100 or more class members, and an amount in controversy of at least $5,000,000--have been satisfied and defendants' motions should be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Before the Court is also plaintiffs' motion for leave to amend the First Amended Complaint. Plaintiffs argue that there is good cause to further amend the complaint to add Helen Davis Chaitman, Esq., former Becker and Poliakoff, LLP attorney and currently Chaitman LLP's principal attorney, as a defendant to this lawsuit. They assert that the amendment would cure any alleged jurisdictional deficiencies. Both defendants oppose plaintiffs' motion, arguing that plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate good cause to amend and that their proposed amendment is a futile attempt to cure the jurisdictional defects of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   For the reasons discussed below, the Court has jurisdiction over this lawsuit pursuant to the Class Action Fairness Act. Thus, I recommend that defendants' motions to dismiss be denied. In addition, plaintiffs have established good cause to further amend their complaint. Therefore, I recommend that if necessary plaintiffs' motion for leave to amend the First Amended Complaint be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

It is evident that Helen Chaitman \"is the focal point of this action\" because she was \"the principal attorney for plaintiffs and proposed class members at both [B&amp;P and Chaitman LLP].\" Pls. Mem. at 8-9. She has been identified in all parties' Rule 26(a) initial disclosures and has been the focus of plaintiffs' allegations and discovery.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9. Helen Chaitman has been the managing partner of Chaitman LLP since it was formed in September 2015. Chaitman Decl. \u00b6 2.

Here, there is no dispute that defendants are limited liability partnership law firms and the FAC sufficiently alleges facts with respect to Helen Chaitman's representation of plaintiffs and the putative class. In light of plaintiffs' allegations and her positions at each defendant law firm, Helen Chaitman's purported misconduct exposes her to liability in this lawsuit under New York's partnership laws.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   For the most part, defendants argue that plaintiffs' proposed amendment is a futile attempt to cure jurisdictional defects, but in those same arguments they acknowledge Helen Chaitman's potential liability in this lawsuit. Chaitman LLP observes that plaintiffs \"could ... allege that [Helen] Chaitman is jointly and severally liable with Chaitman LLP (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   after September 2015, during her tenure as a partner of [Chaitman LLP] ) and/or that she is jointly and severally liable with [B&amp;P] (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   before September 2015, during her tenure as a partner of [B&amp;P] ).\" Chaitman Opp. Mem. at 16. B&amp;P also recognizes that under New York's partnership laws, it \"would be jointly liable with [Helen] Chaitman for the alleged wrongful acts she committed on behalf of [B&amp;P] within the reasonable scope of the firm's business\" from February 2010 through September 2015. B&amp;P Opp. Mem. at 5; B&amp;P Reply Mem. at 9-10. B&amp;P further suggests that \"[Helen] Chaitman may be individually liable for the approximately $2.7 million in fees her current firm [ (Chaitman LLP) ] collected in the matters giving rise to this suit, since those fees were generated as a result of the acts she committed on behalf of Chaitman LLP.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Partnership%20Law%20%C2%A7%2026\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Partnership%20Law%20%C2%A7%2026\">\n    at 5-6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Indeed, plaintiffs failed to comply with proper motion practice in that regard. Moreover, Chaitman LLP's point is well-taken-\"[p]laintiffs were well aware of the extent of [Helen] Chaitman's involvement in the underlying representation,\" Chaitman Opp. Mem. at 10, and should have acted more expeditiously to name her as a defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   But this case is still relatively in its early stages and the parties have not taken any depositions to date due to the stay imposed by the Court. Procedural deficiencies and delay alone are insufficient reasons to prohibit plaintiffs' proposed amendment, especially in the absence of any arguments relating to bad faith or undue prejudice (which defendants do not assert).\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hinds Cty., Miss. v.

Therefore, I recommend that defendants' motions to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction be denied. In addition, plaintiffs have established good cause to amend the First Amended Complaint to add Helen Chaitman as defendant should it be necessary to do so for jurisdictional purposes.

Under New York law, \"[p]unitive damages are available in cases of breach of fiduciary duty, so long as a very high degree of moral culpability is exhibited.\"\n    <em>\n     Schweizer v. Mulvehill\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11524869\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/93/376/#p400\">\n     93 F. Supp. 2d 376\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 400 (S.D.N.Y. 2000) ;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Amusement Industry, Inc. v. Stern\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4016341\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/693/301/#p317\">\n     693 F. Supp. 2d 301\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 317-18 (S.D.N.Y. 2010) (punitive damages for breach of fiduciary duty may be sought against attorneys).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-114\">\n    On the record presented, however, plaintiffs have not provided any amounts to be considered when assessing punitive damages. Thus, in these circumstances, \"[u]sing [punitive damages] to calculate the amount in controversy would [ ] require [the Court] to engage in unguided speculation,\" which it cannot do.\n    <em>\n     Porter v. MetroPCS Comm. Inc.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4345190\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/592/780/#p784\">\n     592 F. App'x 780\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 784 (11th Cir. 2014). Therefore, in the absence of an ascertainable value, punitive damages should not be included in the amount-in-controversy calculation. Similarly, plaintiffs' claim for attorneys' fees is not sufficiently developed to be accounted for on this issue at this time.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
