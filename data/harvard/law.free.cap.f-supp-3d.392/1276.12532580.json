When evaluating the statutory alternatives, Commerce found that subsection (i) was unavailable because other steel products produced by SeAH were not in the same general category of products as oil country tubular goods.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 54.

Commerce did not address the constructed value profit issue as it pertained to NEXTEEL in the\n   <em>\n    Final Results\n   </em>\n   because it resorted to total adverse facts available and \"because [Commerce was] applying total AFA to NEXTEEL for these results, [its] determination of which CV profit rate and selling expenses to use applies only to SeAH.\" Final IDM at 53.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   NEXTEEL contends that the use of SeAH's data from the previous administrative review is inappropriate because (1) the data is not contemporaneous and there are important differences in the market place between the two periods and (2) SeAH's Canadian market sales are subject to a Canadian antidumping case with respect to the subject merchandise. NEXTEEL's Br. 38. NEXTEEL's first contention is incorrect. Using subsection (iii) to calculate constructed value, Commerce is free to use \"any reasonable method\" to determine plaintiff's constructed value.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   19 U.S.C \u00a7 1677b(e)(2)(B)(iii). Commerce explained that \"[w]hile the financial data from SeAH are less contemporaneous to the POR than are the other alternative financial data sources, we continue to find that the specificity of the SeAH financial data outweighs concerns over contemporaneity\" because \"it represents profit from [oil country tubular goods] produced by a Korean producer in Korea\" and therefore \"eliminates some of the inherent flaws that occur using surrogate financial statements (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , profits reflecting products that are not in the same general category of products as [oil country tubular goods] ).\" Final IDM at 55-56. Commerce concluded that there were no important differences in the market between 2015 and 2016 because \"producers faced a decline in oil and gas prices\n   throughout 2015 and 2016; the first eight months of 2015 overlapped with the first review\" and two producers had improved financial performance.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 60. The court concludes that Commerce's use of SeAH's prior review data is supported by substantial evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   NEXTEEL contends further that Commerce's use of SeAH's data is inappropriate because of an existing antidumping duty case in Canada regarding oil country tubular goods from Korea.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   NEXTEEL Br. 38.

Commerce attempted to make adjustments for possible distortions and to utilize the best available information on the record to calculate NEXTEEL's constructed value profit. The court finds that Commerce's use of SeAH's Canadian market sales was reasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   SeAH contends that Commerce's calculation of constructed value profit is not consistent with the statute because Commerce did not apply a \"profit cap\" based on the financial statements of global oil country tubular goods producers. SeAH's Br. 6. Specifically, SeAH argues that Commerce's \"use of the same figures to determine both the profit rate and the 'profit cap' means that no 'profit cap' was actually applied,\" and that Commerce erred in not applying a profit cap based upon the profit earned on all home-market sales of merchandise in the same general category of merchandise.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29-30.

NEXTEEL contends that its proposed calculation was not new factual information because it was a calculation based on record information.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   NEXTEEL's Br. 43.

Differential Pricing Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Commerce ordinarily uses an average-to-average comparison (\"A-to-A\") of normal values to export prices for comparable merchandise in an investigation when calculating a dumping margin.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677f-1(d)(1)(A) ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20351.414\">\n    19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.414\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1). Commerce can depart from using the A-to-A methodology and instead compare the weighted average of normal values to the export prices of individual transactions for comparable merchandise (\"A-to-T\") when (1) Commerce finds a pattern of export prices for comparable merchandise that differ significantly among purchasers, regions, or periods of time and (2) Commerce explains why such differences cannot be taken into account using the A-to-A methodology.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   19 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1677f-1(d)(1)(B)(i)-(ii).

Commerce applied differential pricing analysis in this case when applying its A-to-T methodology.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Final IDM at 65.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Commerce determines whether a pattern of significant price differences exists among purchasers, regions, or periods of time with its two-stage differential pricing analysis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Prelim. IDM at 8-9. First, Commerce applies what it refers to as the \"Cohen's d test\" that measures the degree of price disparity between two groups of sales.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 9. Commerce calculates the number of standard deviations by which the weighted-average net prices of U.S. sales for a particular purchaser, region, or time period (the \"test group\") differ from the weighted-average net prices of all other U.S. sales of comparable merchandise (the \"comparison group\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   The result of this calculation is a coefficient.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   The Cohen's d coefficient is used to evaluate the extent to which the net prices to a particular purchaser, region, or time period differ significantly from the net prices of all other sales of comparable merchandise.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   A group of sales with a coefficient equal to or greater than 0.8 \"passes\" the test and signifies to Commerce that a significant pattern of price differences exists within that group of sales.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-10. Commerce then applies the \"ratio test\" to measure the extent of significant price differences.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 10. If the value of sales that pass the Cohen's d test account for 66 percent or more of the value of total sales, that indicates to Commerce that the pattern of significant price differences warrants application of the A-to-T method to all sales.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   If the value of sales that pass the Cohen's d test is more than 33 percent and less than 66 percent of the value of all sales, Commerce takes a hybrid approach, applying the A-to-T method to the sales that passed its Cohen's d test and applying the A-to-A method to all other sales.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Commerce will apply the A-to-A method to all sales if 33 percent or less of a respondent's total sales pass its Cohen's d test.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   If both the Cohen's d test and ratio test demonstrate that the A-to-T methodology should be considered, Commerce applies its \"meaningful difference\" test, pursuant to which Commerce evaluates whether the difference between the weighted-average dumping margins calculated by the A-to-A method is meaningfully different than the weighted-average\n   dumping margins calculated by the A-to-T method.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    A.
