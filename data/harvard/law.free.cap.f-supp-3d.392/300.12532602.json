Entry (Dkt. 11).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Shipp now seeks to suppress evidence uncovered from the Facebook account because, he contends, the warrant was overbroad and not sufficiently particular.

For this reason, Facebook is less like other areas of the \"digital realm, where the size or other outwardly visible characteristics of a file may disclose nothing about its content,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Galpin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4058617\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/720/436/#p445\">\n    720 F.3d at 447\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and more akin to a physical location, in which \"the physical dimensions of the evidence sought will naturally impose limitations on where an officer may pry: an officer could not properly look for a stolen flat-screen television by rummaging through the suspect's medicine cabinet, nor search for false tax documents by viewing the suspect's home video collection,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4058617\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/720/436/#p445\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The concerns present in the search of a hard drive or email account-that evidence sought could be located almost anywhere-and which necessitate broad digital search protocols do not, therefore, exist in the Facebook context. For example, there is no possibility that a user could have filed an incriminating photo as a \"poke,\" and there is no chance that an incriminating message will be stored as a third-party password or a rejected friend request. As the Eleventh Circuit has observed:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   The means of hiding evidence on a hard drive-obscure folders, misnamed files, encrypted data-are not currently possible in the context of a Facebook account. Hard drive searches require time-consuming electronic forensic investigation with special equipment, and conducting that kind of search in the defendant's home would be impractical, if not impossible. By contrast, when it comes to Facebook account searches, the government need only send a request with the specific data sought and Facebook will respond with precisely that data. That procedure does not appear to be impractical for Facebook or for the government. Facebook produced data in response to over 9500 search warrants in the six-month period between July and December 2015.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <em>\n    United States v.
