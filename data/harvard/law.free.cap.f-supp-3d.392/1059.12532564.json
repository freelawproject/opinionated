BREYER, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Consumers and auto dealers have filed two related consolidated class actions against the five leading German car manufacturers-Audi AG, BMW AG, Daimler AG, Porsche AG, and Volkswagen AG (\"VW AG\")-and their American subsidiaries. Plaintiffs allege that since the mid-1990s, Defendants have colluded to restrain trade in ways that constitute per se violations of the Sherman Act and that violate various state laws. Defendants have moved to dismiss the claims. Finding the allegations currently insufficient to state a claim, the Court GRANTS Defendants' joint motion to dismiss, with leave to amend. The Court DENIES the German Defendants' separate motions to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   As alleged, U.S. consumers and auto dealers have been overpaying for Audi, BMW, Mercedes, Porsche, and Volkswagen cars for over twenty years. They have paid premiums for \"German engineering,\" a phrase that is synonymous with innovation and exceptional performance, but they have received something less.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiffs claim that in the mid-1990s, Defendants started intentionally slowing down the pace of innovation. (IPP \u00b6\u00b6 123, 139, 183; DPP \u00b6\u00b6 2, 76.) Doing so resulted in their cars having \"fewer features and reduced performance.\" (IPP \u00b6 5.) Defendants took this approach, Plaintiffs maintain, in order to \"reduce production costs\" and \"avoid[ ] price and technology wars.\" (DPP \u00b6\u00b6 76, 81;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   IPP \u00b6 92.) All the while they continued to charge premiums for cutting edge technology and engineering. (IPP \u00b6\u00b6 6, 92; DPP \u00b6\u00b6 68-69, 76.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   At least 200 employees are alleged to have participated in the agreement to reduce innovation, meeting for decades in dozens of working groups and at trade association events. (IPP \u00b6\u00b6 123, 129, 196; DPP \u00b6\u00b6 77-79.) Since 2011 alone, at least 1,000 meetings in furtherance of the agreement have purportedly taken place. (IPP \u00b6 123; DPP \u00b6 77.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   All sorts of vehicle components are claimed to have been covered by the agreement (e.g, brake controls, chassis, electronics, gas and diesel engines, clutches, transmissions, exhaust systems, and drivetrains (IPP \u00b6\u00b6 123, 131; DPP \u00b6 86)), although only two examples are explained in any detail in the complaints.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    Soft-top convertibles.\n   </em>\n   Minutes from a meeting in Bad Kissingen, Germany document that Defendants discussed the cost, safety, weight, and technical risks of soft-top convertibles and then collectively agreed that their soft-top convertible roofs should only be allowed to open and close at vehicle speeds below 50 kilometers (or 31 miles) per hour. (IPP \u00b6 138.) In memorializing this agreement, Defendants allegedly noted that there should be \"[n]o arms race when it comes to speeds for [soft-top convertibles].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (alterations in complaint).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    AdBlue tanks.\n   </em>\n   As explained in the complaints, AdBlue is a substance that is used to breakdown emissions from diesel engines into less harmful compounds. (IPP \u00b6 145; DPP \u00b6 102.) It became popular in the early 2000s when Defendants started marketing their diesel cars as fuel-efficient alternatives to electric and hybrid cars. (IPP \u00b6\u00b6 144-45.) With the use of AdBlue burgeoning, Defendants reportedly determined that they could save up to \u20ac80 per car by agreeing on a standard tank size. (IPP \u00b6 150.) They first agreed, in or around 2006, to only use AdBlue tanks that were between 17 and 23 liters. (IPP \u00b6\u00b6 149, 151.) Several years later they shifted to smaller, 8-liter tanks after their marketing departments touted the cost savings of smaller tanks and the benefits of having more space in the cars for passengers, cargo, and equipment. (IPP \u00b6\u00b6 148, 152.) Eight-liter tanks were then ditched in favor of 16-liter tanks after Defendants learned in 2010 that new U.S. regulations would soon require tanks to contain enough AdBlue to last for 10,000 miles before needing to be refilled. (IPP \u00b6\u00b6 153-55.) Even the 16-liter tanks were not large enough to meet U.S. standards, according to the IPP complaint. (IPP \u00b6 153.) But Plaintiffs maintain that Defendants agreed to use 16-liter tanks despite knowing this.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Documents purportedly reflect that VW AG encouraged the others to stick with the 16-liter tanks despite regulatory concerns (IPP \u00b6 159) and Audi AG cautioned against a potential \"arms race with regard to tank sizes,\" which \"we should continue to avoid at all costs\" (IPP \u00b6 160).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    The European investigation.\n   </em>\n   The above allegations, like most others in the complaints, are based largely on articles that were published in the German news magazine\n   <em>\n    Der Spiegel.\n   </em>\n   In the summer of 2017,\n   <em>\n    Der Spiegel\n   </em>\n   reported that the European Commission's competition department (\"ECC\") and Germany's Federal Cartel Office were investigating \"allegations of an antitrust cartel among the Defendants.\" (IPP \u00b6\u00b6 119-20.) As Plaintiffs note, ECC investigations only proceed when there are \"reasonable indications of a likely infringement\" of competition laws. (IPP \u00b6 112 (quoting Antitrust Manual of Procedures, EUROPA.EU, 102-109 (March 2012),\n   <em>\n    Opening of Proceedings, Conditions for Opening of Proceedings\n   </em>\n   ).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   VW AG and Daimler AG reportedly submitted proffers to the ECC as part of the agency's leniency program. (IPP \u00b6\u00b6 113-14, 121; DPP \u00b6\u00b6 111-12.) In VW AG's proffer, it admitted (1) that \"Daimler, BMW, Volkswagen, Audi and Porsche made agreements 'for many years, at least since the 1990s, up to today' about the development of their vehicles, costs, suppliers and markets;\" (2) that Defendants \"discussed vehicle development, brakes, petrol and diesel engines, clutches and transmissions as well as exhaust treatment systems;\" (3) that there had been an \"exchange of internal, competitively sensitive technical data;\" (4) that Defendants had jointly established \"technical standards\" and agreed to use \"only certain technical solutions\" in new cars; and (5) that \"behavior in violation of cartel law\" may have occurred. (IPP \u00b6 124.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiffs assert that by seeking leniency from the ECC, VW AG and Daimler AG effectively \"admitted the existence of a secret cartel.\" (IPP \u00b6 118;\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 115 (\"Leniency is not available for lesser anti-competitive infringements, nor is it available to a company that claims it did not participate in a cartel.\" (citing\n   <em>\n    Commission Notice on Immunity from Fines and Reduction of Fines in Cartel Cases\n   </em>\n   , OFFICIAL JOURNAL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION (Aug. 12, 2006), Introduction \u00b6 1)).) In October 2017, following VW AG's and Daimler AG's proffers and in connection with the ECC's investigation, the ECC conducted \"dawn raids\" in Germany at several of Defendants' headquarters, including the headquarters of BMW AG, Daimler AG, and VW AG. (IPP \u00b6 120;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   DPP \u00b6 114.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    The investigation is narrowed.\n   </em>\n   In September 2018, after Plaintiffs had filed their complaints in this action, the ECC announced in a press release that the scope of its investigation was changing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The ECC explained in the press release that its investigation had not unearthed a vehicle-wide conspiracy to restrain technological development, but that it would be opening an in-depth investigation into one issue: whether Defendants \"colluded, in breach of EU antitrust rules, to avoid competition on the development and roll-out of technology to clean the emissions of petrol and diesel passenger cars.\" (Dkt. No. 377-3 at 2 (emphasis omitted).) The ECC announced\n   that specifically it would be examining whether Defendants colluded to limit the development and roll-out (i) of \"selective catalytic reduction ('SCR') systems to reduce harmful nitrogen oxides emissions from passenger cars with diesel engines,\" and (ii) of \"Otto particulate filters ('OPF') to reduce harmful particulate matter emissions from passenger cars with petrol engines.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis omitted).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In its press release, the ECC emphasized that its formal investigation would concern \"solely the emissions control systems\" just identified. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Referring to Defendants as the \"circle of five,\" the Commission explained that although Defendants had also exchanged other technical information and had cooperated on other areas of vehicle development, there was no reason to believe that those exchanges were unlawful:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   [In addition to emissions control systems,] [n]umerous other technical topics were discussed, including common quality requirements for car parts, common quality testing procedures or exchanges concerning their own car models that were already on the market. The \"circle of five\" also had discussions on the maximum speed at which the roofs of convertible cars can open or close, and at which the cruise control will work. Cooperation also extended to the area of crash tests and crash test dummies where the car companies pooled technical expertise and development efforts to improve testing procedures for car safety.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   At this stage the Commission does not have sufficient indications that these discussions between the \"circle of five\" constituted anti-competitive conduct that would merit further investigation. EU antitrust rules leave room for technical cooperation aimed at improving product quality. The Commission's indepth investigation in this case concerns specific cooperation that is suspected to have aimed at limiting the technical development or preventing the roll-out of technical devices.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    Other agreements.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs allege that Defendants reached other anticompetitive agreements in addition to their agreement to reduce innovation.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   \u2022\n   <em>\n    Price fixing.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs claim that Defendants agreed to \"artificially fix, raise, stabilize, and control prices\" for their cars in the United States. (\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , IPP \u00b6 261.) No specifics on this agreement are offered.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   \u2022\n   <em>\n    Agreements on suppliers.\n   </em>\n   Defendants allegedly agreed to use the same suppliers for certain vehicle components. Three concrete examples are offered in the complaints. In or around 2006, Defendants agreed that, if possible, AdBlue tanks should be produced by only two manufactures. (IPP \u00b6 156.) In 2011, one of Defendant's managers explained to a working group that Defendants needed to select the same supplier for diesel-motor sensors. (IPP \u00b6 142.) And in 2013, one of Defendants' working groups reviewed and criticized the performance of a shared supplier of suspension equipment. (IPP \u00b6 141.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   \u2022\n   <em>\n    Agreement on steel purchases.\n   </em>\n   Starting in the 1990s, Plaintiffs contend that Defendants and German steel manufacturers began using a shared pricing formula for steel purchases. (IPP \u00b6 169.) The formula set a fixed long-term price for raw steel and a variable price, based on a selected price index, for scrap steel, precious metals and alloys-three materials that are combined with raw steel to build cars. (IPP \u00b6\u00b6 166, 169; DPP\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 91.) The formula helped bridge a divide between Defendants and the steel manufacturers: Defendants wanted long-term contracts with fixed, predictable costs to effectively set car model prices, while steel manufacturers wanted short-term contracts that could be adjusted to account for fluctuations in the markets for these materials. (IPP \u00b6\u00b6 167-68; DPP \u00b6 90.) Defendants apparently stopped using the variable index in 2015, after European officials began investigating anticompetitive conduct in the German steel industry. (IPP \u00b6 175.) But soon after that decision, Plaintiffs submit that Defendants started communicating about setting up a replacement index. (IPP \u00b6\u00b6 175-76.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   \u2022\n   <em>\n    Agreement to fund scientific studies.\n   </em>\n   As alleged, Defendants sponsored now-debunked scientific studies that were aimed at promoting their diesel vehicles. (IPP \u00b6 178.) Plaintiffs claim that the studies were flawed because they purported to show that new German-made diesel cars had low emissions, but at least some of those cars used emissions cheating software and were not in fact clean or safe for human health. (IPP \u00b6\u00b6 178-82.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Both the IPPs and DPPs assert that through the conduct described above Defendants have violated \u00a7 1 of the Sherman Act. The IPPs also assert that Defendants have violated various state antitrust, unfair competition, consumer protection, and unfair trade practices laws, and have triggered certain state unjust enrichment and disgorgement statutes. The IPPs and DPPs seek to bring class actions respectively on behalf of all persons and U.S.-based car dealers that, since the mid-1990s, bought or leased in the United States one or more new passenger cars manufactured or sold by Defendants. (IPP \u00b6\u00b6 4, 10, 245; DPP \u00b6 129.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   After the complaints were filed, Defendants filed a joint motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed.

Agreement to Reduce Innovation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The complaints identify two instances in which Defendants reached consensus on vehicle specifications. As alleged, they agreed not to manufacture convertibles with roofs that opened when the cars were traveling above a particular speed, and they agreed to use the same sized AdBlue tanks in their diesel-engine cars.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Neither of these is a compelling example of an agreement \"to make a product of inferior quality.\" Areeda &amp; Hovenkamp \u00b6 1901d. The complaints do not suggest that consumers even want convertibles with roofs that open at speeds above 31 miles per hour, the chosen limit; and common sense suggests that there are safety reasons for why consumers would\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   want that feature. It's also not clear if the selected 16-liter AdBlue tanks were inferior to larger tanks. Larger tanks would have needed to be refilled less often, but they also would have taken up more space in the cars, as Defendants recognized. (IPP \u00b6\u00b6 148, 152.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Even assuming, though, that the convertible and AdBlue tank agreements reduced innovation and resulted in inferior cars, those two examples are not enough to support a \"\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   whole car conspiracy\" to reduce innovation. The two examples relate to niche vehicle features that are only found in a small subset of Defendants' cars. Only two of 37 named IPPs allege that they purchased a convertible (IPP \u00b6\u00b6 34, 44), and only one alleges that he\n   purchased a diesel-engine car (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26).

Defendants jointly established \"technical standards\" and agreed to use \"only certain technical solutions\" in new vehicles; and that\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   5. \"behavior in violation of cartel law\" may have occurred.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   (IPP \u00b6 124.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   These admissions may seem significant at first glance, but it is hard to make much of them when they are examined more closely. The first admission is vague. That Defendants made agreements for many years \"about the development of their vehicles, costs, suppliers and markets\" says little about the scope of those agreements, and says nothing about the alleged agreement to reduce innovation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The second admission is similar. VW AG admitted that Defendants \"discussed vehicle development,\" but there is no indication of what those discussions entailed. More detail is needed because a discussion among competing auto manufacturers about brakes, or about any of the other identified car parts, need not be anticompetitive.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Princo Corp. v. Int'l Trade Comm'n\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3767994\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/616/1318/#p1335\">\n    616 F.3d 1318\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1335 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (explaining that collaboration among competitors can \"reduce costs, facilitate innovation, eliminate duplication of efforts and assets, and share risks that no individual member would be willing to undertake alone\"); FTC &amp; Dep't of Justice,\n   <em>\n    Antitrust Guidelines for Collaborations Among Competitors\n   </em>\n   1 (2000) (noting that \"to compete in modern markets, competitors sometimes need to collaborate,\" and that collaboration may \"not only [be] benign but procompetitive\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The third, fourth, and fifth admissions do a bit more for Plaintiffs. An \"exchange of internal, competitively sensitive technical data\" among Defendants may have been anticompetitive and, as VW AG appears to have acknowledged, may have violated European cartel law. Defendants' agreement to use \" 'only certain technical solutions' in new vehicles\" also sounds similar to an agreement to reduce innovation. Yet even these allegations lack important specificity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   For one thing, European and American antitrust laws are not uniform, so Defendants' possible violation of European cartel law does not necessarily mean that they violated the Sherman Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D. Daniel Sokol,\n   <em>\n    Troubled Waters Between U.S. and European Antitrust\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=115%20Mich.%20L.%20Rev.%20955\">\n    115 Mich. L. Rev. 955\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 970 (2017) (explaining that \"European case law and enforcement on information sharing [among competitors] is more aggressive than the United States\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Even more importantly, an agreement to only use certain technical solutions is not the same as an agreement to reduce\n   product quality. The former may be equivalent to \"standard setting,\" which \"serves many useful ends, such as protecting consumers from inferior goods, increasing compatibility among products that must be interchangeable with the products of other manufacturers, or focusing customer comparison on essential rather than nonessential differences.\" Areeda &amp; Hovenkamp \u00b6 2136a. For these reasons, \"most instances of standard setting ... are lawful.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=115%20Mich.%20L.%20Rev.%20955\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   It is not appropriate to infer that Defendants reached a per se illegal agreement to reduce product quality, which is what Plaintiffs allege, simply because they agreed to exchange \"competitively sensitive technical data\" and to use \"only certain technical solutions.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Also of significance, VW AG's admissions do not identify the specific types of competitively sensitive technical data that Defendants exchanged, or the technical solutions to which Defendants agreed. Maybe those exchanges and technical solutions touched on many different areas of vehicle development, as Plaintiffs allege. But it is also possible that the exchanges were more limited in scope. Indeed, perhaps the exchanges and technical solutions related only to the speed at which soft-top convertibles open and the size of AdBlue tanks, the two examples that Plaintiffs have identified in their complaints.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   VW AG's admissions to European antitrust authorities, in short, are too general and too vague to plausibly support the broad agreement to reduce innovation that Plaintiffs allege.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Other allegations require even more speculation. For example, putting aside VW AG's admissions, Plaintiffs argue it is significant that the ECC is investigating Defendants' coordinated activities. But courts in this district have explained that government antitrust investigations ordinarily carry \"no weight in pleading an antitrust conspiracy,\" for it is \"unknown whether the investigation[s] will result in indictments or nothing at all.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Graphics Processing Units Antitrust Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4062238\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/527/1011/#p1024\">\n    527 F.

Supp. 3d 1051\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1064 (N.D. Cal. 2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The ECC investigation at issue proves why this skepticism is well founded. Since Plaintiffs filed their complaints, the scope of that investigation has narrowed significantly. The ECC was initially investigating whether Defendants had unlawfully colluded on numerous areas of vehicle development. But having determined from its initial investigation that Defendants' collaboration was mostly akin to standard setting, the ECC is now only looking into whether Defendants colluded on the development of certain emissions technologies. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 377-3 at 2.) That targeted investigation into one area of vehicle development does little to support a \"whole car conspiracy\" to reduce innovation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Some allegations in the complaints do support the expansive agreement to reduce innovation that is claimed, but these allegations are not well pled. For example, Plaintiffs allege that the innovation-reducing agreement covered \"almost all areas of automotive development.\" (DPP \u00b6 86 (emphasis omitted);\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   IPP \u00b6 131.) Absent are evidentiary facts supporting this allegation. It is a conclusory factual statement and will not be accepted as true.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p677\">\n    556 U.S. at 678-79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p677\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Allegations about how Defendants used working groups and trade associations to further their \"whole car conspiracy\" also lack sufficient detail. Although the IPPs spend more than a dozen pages of their complaint discussing these working groups and trade associations, they almost never identify what was agreed to in these meetings and instead only vaguely refer to\n   \"clandestine agreements to limit technological innovation.\" (IPP \u00b6 129.) More facts are needed to plausibly support that Defendants used working groups and trade associations to reach the broad anticompetitive agreement that is alleged.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Musical Instruments\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4331544\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/798/1186/#p1194\">\n    798 F.3d at 1196\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[M]ere participation in trade-organization meetings where information is exchanged and strategies are advocated does not suggest an illegal agreement.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   As the Supreme Court noted in\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   , antitrust discovery can be \"sprawling, costly, and hugely time-consuming,\" and can \"push cost-conscious defendants to settle even anemic cases.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p554\">\n    550 U.S. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   559 &amp; n.6,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p554\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1955\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . These concerns are at play here. Plaintiffs propose two class actions that would include almost every purchaser and dealer of German cars in the United States over the past 20 years. Discovery would require Defendants to search through decades of information; and because Plaintiffs allege that Defendants' agreement covered most (if not all) areas of vehicle development, discovery would reach into almost every nook and cranny at five giant automakers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   With the potential for such a massive and expensive factual investigation, the Court \"retain[s] the power to insist upon some specificity in pleading.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p554\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p554\">\n    at 558\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p554\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1955\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted). Before Plaintiffs are allowed to pursue such a broad antitrust claim, they must do more than point to a European antitrust investigation (the scope of which is now much narrower than Plaintiffs' claims), two examples of agreements by Defendants to use certain technical standards, and Defendants participation in working groups and trade associations. Even when viewed together, these allegations do not plausibly support that Defendants reached a \"\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   whole car conspiracy\" to reduce innovation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Other Agreements\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   While the principal focus of the complaints is on the asserted agreement to restrain innovation, Plaintiffs also allege that Defendants violated \u00a7 1 by (i) fixing prices, (ii) agreeing to only use certain part suppliers, (iii) using a shared pricing formula for steel purchases, and (iv) jointly funding now-debunked scientific studies that were aimed at promoting their diesel cars. The allegations do not support these claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   No factual allegations support price fixing. Plaintiffs simply state in the Claims for Relief sections of their complaints that Defendants \"agree[d] to fix, increase, maintain and/or stabilize prices of German Automobiles sold in the United States.\" (DPP \u00b6 153;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   IPP \u00b6 261 (Defendants \"entered into a continuing agreement ... to artificially fix, raise, stabilize, and control prices for new German Passenger Vehicles in the United States\"). These are conclusory statements and will not be accepted as true.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p677\">\n    556 U.S. at 678\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p677\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   For the other three agreements, even if they were reached it is unclear how Plaintiffs were injured by them. If, as is alleged, the five leading German car makers agreed to coordinate their purchases of car parts and steel, the prices they paid for those inputs would presumably have\n   dropped.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Thomas A. Piraino, Jr.,\n   <em>\n    A Proposed Antitrust Approach to Collaborations Among Competitors\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=86%20Iowa%20L.%20Rev.%201137\">\n    86 Iowa L.

Lower input prices would likely have benefited car purchasers, not harmed them.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   John B. Kirkwood,\n   <em>\n    Powerful Buyers and Merger Enforcement\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=92%20B.U.%20L.%20Rev.%201485\">\n    92 B.U.

(\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , DPP \u00b6 87 (alleging that with respect to the steel-purchasing agreement, \"Defendants pocketed the cost savings and did not pass along a single cent to the Dealer Plaintiffs\").) That result would have been odd, as \"[a] firm will normally pass on some portion of its cost-per-unit savings to consumers even if it is a profit-maximizing monopolist.\"\n   <em>\n    Freeman v. San Diego Ass'n of Realtors\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9372497\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/322/1133/\">\n    322 F.3d 1133\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1145 n.11 (9th Cir. 2003). But in any event, Plaintiffs do not explain why Defendants were required to pass on their cost savings. If Defendants had collectively agreed that none of them would share cost savings with consumers, then perhaps that agreement would have unreasonably restrained trade and harmed consumers. But the complaints do not include any factual allegations supporting such an agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   As for Defendants funding of now-debunked studies on diesel emissions, Plaintiffs do not explain how they were injured or how trade was restrained by this conduct. They do not allege that these scientific studies affected the price of their cars or that they relied on these studies in purchasing their cars; nor do they dispute that the principal study discussed in the IPP complaint was never published. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Joint Mot., Dkt. No. 321 at 41 n. 17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   To support a Sherman Act claim, a private plaintiff must \"allege some credible injury caused by the [challenged] conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    Am.

The nonconclusory, evidentiary facts in the complaints do not support a credible injury to Plaintiffs resulting from Defendants' agreements regarding part suppliers, steel purchases, and scientific studies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The well-pled allegations do not plausibly support any of the anticompetitive agreements that are alleged. The Court accordingly GRANTS Defendants' joint motion to dismiss Plaintiffs' Sherman Act claims. Having reached that conclusion, the Court need not consider other arguments for dismissal of the Sherman Act claims that Defendants have raised.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <strong>\n    V. STATE LAW CLAIMS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   In addition to their Sherman Act claims, the IPPs also assert that Defendants violated various state laws. The factual bases and theories of injury for these claims are the same as those for the Sherman Act claims. Like the Sherman Act claims, then, the state law claims are not well pled. Having reached that conclusion, the Court will not consider additional claim-specific arguments that Defendants have made for dismissal of the state law claims. Their\n   joint motion to dismiss the state law claims is GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <strong>\n    VI.
