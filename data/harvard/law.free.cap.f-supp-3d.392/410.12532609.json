(\"the Campaign\"); Donald J. Trump, Jr. (\"Trump Jr.\"); Paul J. Manafort, Jr.; Jared C. Kushner; George Papadopoulos; and Richard W. Gates, III (collectively, the \"campaign defendants\"); Roger J.

While there are no plausible allegations that the remaining defendants participated in the unlawful hacking or in the dissemination of the materials by WikiLeaks, the DNC alleges that the dissemination of those materials furthered the prospects of the Trump Campaign and that the remaining defendants \"welcomed\" the assistance in various ways.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In the Second Amended Complaint, the DNC asserts claims under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201030\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1030\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201962\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"RICO\"); Wiretap Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202510\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2510\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 22 ; Stored Communications Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202701\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 12 ; Digital Millennium Copyright Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201201\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 1201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   ; Defend Trade Secrets Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201831\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1831\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   ; Washington, D.C.

The DNC also asserts claims under Washington, D.C. common law for trespass and conversion and claims under Virginia common law for conversion, trespass to chattels, and conspiracy to commit trespass to chattels.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The primary wrongdoer in this alleged criminal enterprise is undoubtably the Russian Federation, the first named defendant in the case and the entity that surreptitiously and illegally hacked into the DNC's computers and thereafter disseminated the results of its theft. But, as explained below, under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201602\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1602\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (\"FSIA\"), the Russian Federation cannot be sued in the courts of the United States for governmental actions, subject to certain limited exceptions not present in this case, just as the United States government generally cannot be sued in courts abroad for its actions. The remedies for hostile actions by foreign governments are state actions, including sanctions imposed by the executive and legislative branches of government.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The DNC seeks to hold the second-level participants in this alleged activity -- the Campaign, the Campaign defendants, WikiLeaks, Assange, the Agalarovs, Mifsud, and Stone -- liable for dissemination of the stolen materials. But, as also explained below, the First Amendment prevents such liability in the same way it would preclude liability for press outlets that publish materials of public interest despite defects in the way the materials were obtained so long as the disseminator did not participate in any wrongdoing in obtaining the materials in the first place. The plausible allegations against the remaining defendants are insufficient to hold them liable for the illegality that occurred in obtaining the materials from the DNC. Therefore, for the reasons explained below, the defendants' motion to dismiss the Second Amended Complaint is\n   <strong>\n    granted\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Additionally, the Campaign has moved for sanctions against the DNC and its attorneys pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11. For the reasons explained below, the Campaign's motion is\n   <strong>\n    denied.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In deciding a motion to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), the allegations in the complaint are accepted as true, and all reasonable inferences must be drawn in the plaintiff's favor.\n   <em>\n    McCarthy v.

(SAC \u00b6 1.) The DNC claims that the Trump Campaign welcomed the Russian Federation's help and was prepared to use the stolen information with the intent of hurting Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign and helping Donald Trump win the presidency. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 1-2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Over a year before the 2016 United States presidential election, on June 16, 2015, Donald Trump announced his candidacy for President of the United States. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 84.) Soon after, in July of 2015, a Russian intelligence agent -- codenamed \"Cozy Bear\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   -- used stolen credentials to access the DNC's computer systems in Washington, D.C. and Virginia (the \"2015 hack\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 81, 115.) Once in the system, Cozy Bear focused on collecting information from the DNC systems that were used primarily for communications, such as the systems providing email, email support, backup servers, voiceover internet protocol, and chat. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 116.) Cozy Bear maintained access in the DNC system for almost a year. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 81.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On April 18, 2016, members of Russia's military intelligence agency, the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation (\"GRU\"), engaged another cyberattack on the DNC's Washington, D.C. and Virginia computer servers (the \"April 2016 hack\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 101.) The agents that participated in the hack were part of two GRU units, Units 26165 and 74455, based in Moscow. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48.) At least ten GRU agents from Units 26165 and 74455 prepared for or participated in the hack. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 49.) The DNC alleges that these agents were acting pursuant to military orders. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 49, 101.) To prepare for the hack, the GRU agents developed a malware --\n   \"software that damages, disables, or spies upon computer systems\" -- called \"X-Agent.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 49.) X-Agent allowed the GRU agents to monitor target computers in real time -- meaning they could see the screens and keystrokes of target computers as they were being used. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 103.) On April 18, 2016, GRU agents accessed the DNC system and installed X-Agent onto the computer network. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 101, 103.) Once X-Agent was installed on the DNC's computers, it was always on; the software captured the contents of communications going to and from the affected computers as they were being sent. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 129.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Four days after the hack, on April 22, 2016, GRU agents prepared several gigabytes of DNC data for exfiltration. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 104.) The GRU used another malware that it had developed, called \"X-Tunnel,\" to transfer the data through encrypted channels to a GRU-leased computer in Illinois. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 104, 121.) The Russian GRU agents remained in the DNC system for over a month, stealing documents and data until at least June 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 81, 105.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Between May 25 and June 1, 2016, the GRU gained access to the DNC's email server and stole thousands of emails from the accounts of DNC employees. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 123.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   During the April 2016 hack, GRU agents gained access to at least thirty-three of the DNC's computers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 105.) The GRU agents also accessed the DNC's \"Voice-over Internet Protocol\" transfers, which allowed the hackers to monitor voice-based communications, such as phone calls and voicemail, in real time. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 128.) By June\n   2016, the Russian operatives had stolen thousands of documents from the DNC, including documents containing donor information, financial and economic information, proprietary opposition research compiled from multiple sources, information regarding planned political activities, and emails. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 105.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The DNC discovered that it had been hacked on April 28, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 109.) Thereafter, the DNC hired a cybersecurity technology firm called CrowdStrike to investigate the attack, assess the damage done to the DNC's computers and servers, assist the DNC in its remediation efforts, set up a system for monitoring the current cyberattack, and alert the DNC to future attacks. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 110, 112.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On June 10, 2016, GRU agents launched a third -- but unsuccessful -- attack on the DNC's computers. This time, the GRU unsuccessfully attempted to hack the DNC's backup server -- nicknamed, \"Raider\" -- located in Virginia. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 143-44.) The GRU placed X-Agent onto the backup server but the DNC discovered the intrusion before the agents were able to steal any information. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 144.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   A fourth attack came in September 2016 (the \"September 2016 hack\"). On September 20, 2016, CrowdStrike discovered that GRU agents had gained access to the DNC's cloud-computing service. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 180.) The Russian operatives exfiltrated a large amount of the DNC's data from the DNC's cloud to their own cloud-based account on the same service. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) During this hack, the GRU accessed and stole confidential information from servers housing voter contact information, DNC email lists, proprietary data such as the number of times internet users click on DNC advertisements, the number of times internet users click on links embedded in DNC emails, and volunteer information. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 182.) The GRU also stole computer code created by DNC computer engineers, including Vertica and Tableau queries. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 180, 182-86, 189.) The Second Amended Complaint does not allege that any materials from the September 2016 hack were disseminated to the public and counsel for the DNC acknowledged at the argument of the current motions that there is no such allegation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The DNC does not allege that any of the non-Russian Federation defendants actually participated in any of the hacks on the DNC's computer systems. Rather, the DNC argues that the Campaign, the Campaign defendants, Stone, the Agalarovs, Mifsud, Assange, and WikiLeaks actively supported and approved the Russian operation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 82.) The DNC points to various meetings between the defendants and individuals alleged to be connected to the Russian Federation and argues that the meetings are circumstantial evidence that the defendants conspired with the Russian Federation to steal the DNC's materials and publish them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Before the April 2016 hack, in March 2016, Papadopoulos was notified that he would become a foreign policy adviser to the Campaign. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 92.) Soon thereafter, Papadopoulos began meeting with Joseph Mifsud, a London-based Maltese academic who the DNC alleges acted as an unofficial agent of the Russian government. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 93.) On March 14, Papadopoulos met with Mifsud in Italy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 94.) On March 24, Papadopoulos met with Mifsud and \"a Russian national who was introduced as a relative of Putin.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The DNC does not offer any allegation about what was discussed at these meetings. On April 18, 2016, the day that the GRU agents hacked into the DNC's computers, Mifsud introduced Papadopoulos to an individual who Mifsud said had connections to the Russian\n   Ministry of Foreign Affairs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On April 26, 2016, four days after the GRU exfiltrated documents from the DNC system, Papadopoulos met Mifsud in London. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13.) Mifsud informed Papadopoulos that the Russians \"have dirt\" on Hillary Clinton in the form of \"thousands of emails.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Papadopoulos reported back to superiors at the Campaign, stating that there were \"interesting messages coming in from Moscow.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On May 26, 2016, Donald Trump clinched the Republican presidential nomination. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 132.) A week later, on June 3, 2016, Aras and Emin Agalarov contacted Donald Trump's son and political advisor, Trump Jr., through the Agalarovs' publicist, Rob Goldstone. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 133 &amp; n.96, 137.) Aras Agalarov is an Azeri-born oligarch who is a Russian real estate mogul and \"close ally\" of Russian president Vladimir Putin. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 50.) Emin Agalarov is a pop singer and executive at the Agalarov's real estate company. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 51.) In an email to Trump Jr. on June 3, Goldstone stated that Emin Agalarov offered to provide damaging information about Hillary Clinton as \"part of Russia and its government's support for Mr. Trump.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 14, 133.) Seventeen minutes later, Trump Jr. responded to Goldstone's email, stating, \"if it's what you say I love it especially later in the summer.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 14, 134 (emphasis omitted).) On June 6 and 7, 2016, Trump Jr. and Emin Agalarov spoke on the phone several times and began planning an in-person meeting. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 135.) In a June 7, 2016 email to Goldstone, Trump Jr. confirmed plans for a meeting, stating, \"It will likely be Paul Manafort (campaign boss) my brother in law [Kushner] and me.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 136 &amp; n.100.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On June 9, 2016, the meeting that Emin Agalarov and Trump Jr. had been planning took place in Trump Tower in New York City. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14.) Trump Jr., Manafort, and Kushner met with Goldstone, Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, Agalarov business associate Irakyl Kaveladze, lobbyist Rinat Akhmestshin, and a translator. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 15, 137.) Manafort was the Trump Campaign's convention manager from March to May 2016 and the Campaign's chairman from May 2016 to August 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 57.) Kushner is Donald Trump's son-in-law and was a senior advisor to the Trump Campaign. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 59.) Veselnitskaya is alleged to have been \"closely connected to the Kremlin\" and to have had \"a history of acting as an agent of the Russian government.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 138.) The DNC does not allege what specifically was discussed at the Trump Tower meeting but reiterates that the Russians had offered \"damaging information about the Democratic presidential nominee\" to the Campaign.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 145.) WikiLeaks is an international news organization of \"unknown structure\" that operates a website, WikiLeaks.org, on which it publishes leaked or stolen confidential and classified information.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 146.) The next day, June 15, Russian intelligence agents began releasing stolen DNC documents to the public. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16.) The DNC alleges that these documents were released systematically from June through October 2016 at times that were\n   favorable to the Trump Campaign. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 160.) Documents were first disseminated through \"Guccifer 2.0,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   a fictitious online persona created by Russian intelligence agents.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17.) In that communication, WikiLeaks noted that Donald Trump's chances of winning the presidency might improve if WikiLeaks were allowed to disseminate some of the stolen documents. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On July 14, 2016, Guccifer 2.0 sent WikiLeaks an email with instructions on how to access stolen DNC documents in an online depository. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 154.) Between July 14 and 18, 2016, GRU agents transmitted to WikiLeaks documents that were stolen in the April 2016 hack. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 19, 126.) WikiLeaks promised to release the documents ahead of the Democratic National Convention with the intention of creating conflict among the potential Democratic nominees for president. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 17, 19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   As promised, on July 22, 2016, three days before the start of the Democratic Convention, WikiLeaks began publishing stolen DNC documents to the public. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20.) WikiLeaks released over 20,000 emails and other documents that had been stolen from the DNC. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 156.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   On July 25, 2016, Roger Stone, a \"long-time confidant\" of Donald Trump's who served as an \"informal advisor\" during the presidential campaign, directed his associate, Jerome Corsi\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   -- who is described only as an associate of Stone's -- to connect with Assange and WikiLeaks to gather information about what kind of documents WikiLeaks possessed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 58, 162.) Corsi reported back to Stone in August that WikiLeaks planned to publish more documents in October 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 162.) However, it appears that many or all of the documents about which Stone communicated with WikiLeaks (through Corsi) were documents that had not been stolen from the DNC's servers. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 161, 164-65.)

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 161.) On August 17, 2016, a GRU operative sent Stone a private message on Twitter, stating, \"please tell me if i can help u anyhow. it would be a great pleasure to me.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 167.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The DNC alleges that throughout the summer and fall of 2016, Trump's associates continued to communicate secretly with Russian agents and WikiLeaks who disseminated strategically the stolen DNC information. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The DNC asserts\n   that some of Stone's public statements show that he must have been communicating with Russian operatives, WikiLeaks, or both, because he had access to nonpublic information. For example, on August 21, 2016, Stone tweeted that \"it will soon [be] the Podesta's time in the barrel\" -- referring to John Podesta, chairman of the 2016 Hillary Clinton presidential campaign. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22.) Weeks later, WikiLeaks began releasing Podesta's emails. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Podesta's emails had been stolen in a different cyberattack -- there is no allegation that they were taken from the DNC's servers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 161.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In mid-September 2016, Stone said that he expected \"Julian Assange and the WikiLeaks people to drop a payload of new documents on Hillary [Clinton] on a weekly basis fairly soon.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22.) Beginning on October 7, 2016, WikiLeaks began releasing \"stolen emails\" at least once a week, although the Second Amended Complaint does not say whether these emails were Clinton's emails or if they were stolen from the DNC. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In or around September 2016, Trump Jr. was also in communication with WikiLeaks. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24.) WikiLeaks provided Trump Jr. with a password to an anti-Trump website, and in exchange WikiLeaks asked that Donald Trump retweet a link to the website where WikiLeaks had posted the stolen DNC emails. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Fifteen minutes later, Donald Trump sent out a tweet noting the media's lack of attention to WikiLeaks. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   On November 6, 2016, days before the presidential election, WikiLeaks released additional hacked DNC emails. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 203.) Donald Trump was elected President of the United States in the election held on Tuesday, November 8, 2016.

In March 2017, he told CNN, \"Did I meet with people that were Russian? I'm sure, I'm sure I did. But none that were set up. None that I can think of at the moment. And certainly none that I was representing the campaign in any way, shape or form.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 216 &amp; n.196.) Trump Jr. also allegedly lied about the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting, stating in July 2017 to the media that the meeting was primarily about the adoption of Russian children. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 217.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   On November 26, 2018, Special Counsel Robert Mueller, III, submitted a status report to the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, explaining that Manafort had breached Manafort's plea agreement with the Government by \"lying to the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Special Counsel's Office on a variety of subject matters.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 231.)

The parties do not dispute that the stolen DNC documents concern public issues. However, the parties disagree over whether the DNC has alleged plausibly that the defendants, other than the Russian Federation, participated in the theft of the documents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   The DNC has plainly alleged that the Russian Federation hacked the DNC's computers and stole its information. The Second Amended Complaint alleges that\n   Russian GRU agents hacked into the DNC's computer system on April 18, 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   Then, from April 22 to early June, GRU agents stole emails, alleged trade secrets, and other information from the DNC's computer system. On June 10, 2016, GRU agents unsuccessfully tried to hack the DNC's backup server. And in September 2016, GRU agents hacked into the DNC's cloud-computing service and copied information onto their own cloud-based server. The DNC has also alleged that the Russian Federation disclosed the stolen materials, although it has not alleged that the Russian Federation disclosed the materials stolen in the September 2016 hack. The Second Amended Complaint alleges that GRU agents posted stolen emails and other documents on the internet via Guccifer 2.0.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   However, the DNC has not alleged that any defendant other than the Russian Federation participated in the hack of the DNC's computers or theft of the DNC's documents. The DNC argues that the various meetings and conversations between the defendants in this case and with persons connected to the Russian government during the time that Russian GRU agents were stealing the DNC's information show that the defendants conspired with the Russian Federation to steal and disseminate the DNC's materials. (DNC Opp'n at 34, 37.) That argument is entirely divorced from the facts actually alleged in the Second Amended Complaint. While the Court is required to accept the factual allegations in the Second Amended Complaint, it is not required to accept conclusory allegations asserted as facts.\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    556 U.S. at 678\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   For example, the DNC argues in its opposition to the current motions that the conspiracy between the Russian Federation and the other defendants to hack the DNC's computers and steal its electronic information began in March 2016. (DNC Opp'n at 101 n.29.) However, the only events alleged to have taken place in March 2016 are that Manafort was hired as the Campaign's convention manager, Papadopoulos was hired as a foreign policy advisor, and Papadopoulos met with Mifsud on March 14 and 24. The entirety of the DNC's allegations regarding the March meetings between Mifsud and Papadopoulos are that \"[o]n March 14, 2016, Mifsud met with Papadopoulos in Italy,\" and \"[o]n March 24, 2016, Mifsud met again with Papadopoulos, this time bringing along a Russian national who was introduced as a relative of Putin.\" (SAC \u00b6 94.) Papadopoulos reported back to the Campaign that \"his conversation was to arrange a meeting between us and the Russian leadership to discuss U.S.-Russia ties under President Trump.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 96 (quotation marks omitted).) These vague references to meetings between Papadopoulos, a foreign policy advisor to the Campaign, and Mifsud, a London-based academic not officially affiliated with the\n   Russian Federation, do not raise a plausible inference that the defendants agreed to participate with the Russian Federation in hacking the DNC's computers and stealing its documents.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p570\">\n    550 U.S. at 556-57\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p570\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1955\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    In re Interest Rate Swaps Antitrust Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267299\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/261/430/#p471\">\n    261 F.

To the contrary, Mifsud is alleged to have told Papadopoulos about emails harmful to the Hillary Clinton campaign only after the Russian Federation had hacked the DNC and had those emails in its possession. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAC \u00b6 94(d) (stating that at the April 26 meeting -- eight days after the April 2016 hack began -- \"Mifsud told Papadopoulos that the Russians had 'thousands of emails' that could harm Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign\").)\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The DNC also repeatedly argues in its brief that WikiLeaks participated in the theft of the DNC documents. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , DNC Opp'n at 3 (\"The Complaint presents clear evidence that all Defendants -- including WikiLeaks -- participated in a criminal conspiracy to steal the DNC's information and use it to support Russia's preferred presidential candidate.\").) But in the Second Amended Complaint the DNC alleges that WikiLeaks first requested stolen DNC materials from Guccifer 2.0 only after the Russian Federation had already stolen them and after Russian agents began disseminating them through Guccifer 2.0. (SAC \u00b6\u00b6 16-17.) The Second Amended Complaint does not allege that WikiLeaks agreed to participate in the theft or that it had any advance knowledge that the Russian Federation was planning to hack the DNC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The DNC argues in opposition to the current motions that Trump Jr.'s communications with the Agalarovs and the meeting at Trump Tower are evidence that Trump Jr., Manafort, Kushner, and the Agalarovs participated in the theft of the DNC's documents. But those communications and that meeting took place after the Russian Federation had already hacked the DNC's computer systems and, in any event, there is no allegation that the parties to those discussions talked about stealing the DNC's information, or indeed about information that had been obtained from hacking the DNC's computers or any information to be obtained from future hacking. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Similarly, Stone is alleged to have contacted WikiLeaks through Corsi for the first time on July 25, 2016 and spoke to GRU officers in August 2016 -- months after the April 2016 hack. Stone is not alleged to have discussed stealing the DNC's documents in any of these communications, or to have been aware of the hacks until after they took place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   The allegations against Gates are even more threadbare: he is only alleged to have spoken with Kilimnik -- Manafort's aide -- during the campaign and to have helped prepare for the Trump Tower meeting. It is not alleged that he knew about or participated in the hacks on the DNC's computers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   In short, the DNC raises a number of connections and communications between the defendants and with people loosely connected to the Russian Federation, but at no point does the DNC allege any facts in the Second Amended Complaint to show that any of the defendants -- other than the Russian Federation -- participated in the theft of the DNC's information. Nor\n   does the DNC allege that the defendants ever agreed to help the Russian Federation steal the DNC's documents. Indeed, the DNC does not raise a factual allegation that suggests that any of the defendants were even aware that the Russian Federation was planning to hack the DNC's computers until after it had already done so. At most, the DNC has alleged that after the Russian Federation stole the DNC's documents, Mifsud and the Agalarovs told campaign members about the stolen documents (although it is unclear whether the communications were about stolen DNC documents or generally about documents harmful to Hillary Clinton), WikiLeaks requested the stolen documents and published them, and some of the other defendants welcomed the publication of the documents at times helpful to the Campaign.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   The DNC has alleged that the Russian Federation hacked into its computer systems and stole its materials. However, the DNC has failed to allege plausibly that any of the other defendants participated in the hack or theft.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   The defendants argue that because they are not alleged to have participated in the theft of the DNC's documents, under Bartnicki they cannot be held liable for publishing those documents or encouraging such publication. The DNC argues that Bartnicki is distinguishable and that Bartnicki's holding does not apply to the DNC's claims for trade secret misappropriation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   The DNC's argument for liability is strongest against WikiLeaks because it is the only defendant -- other than the Russian Federation -- that is alleged to have published the stolen information. The DNC alleges that WikiLeaks solicited stolen documents from the GRU and then coordinated with the GRU and the Campaign defendants to publish the stolen documents at times helpful to the Trump Campaign. Like the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Bartnicki\n   </em>\n   , WikiLeaks did not play any role in the theft of the documents and it is undisputed that the stolen materials involve matters of public concern. However, the DNC argues that this case is distinguishable from Bartnicki because WikiLeaks solicited the documents from the GRU knowing that they were stolen and coordinated with the GRU and the Campaign to disseminate the documents at times favorable to the Trump Campaign. The DNC argues that WikiLeaks should be considered an after-the-fact coconspirator for the theft based on its coordination to obtain and distribute the stolen materials. As an initial matter, it is constitutionally insignificant that WikiLeaks knew the Russian Federation had stolen the documents when it published them. Indeed, in\n   <em>\n    Bartnicki\n   </em>\n   the Supreme Court noted that the radio host either did know, or at least had reason to know, that the communication at issue was unlawfully intercepted.\n   <em>\n    Bartnicki\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9301565\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/514/#p525\">\n    532 U.S. at 517-18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9301565\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/514/#p525\">\n    121 S.Ct. 1753\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Boehner v.

Accordingly, certain acts alleged in the Second Amended Complaint cannot serve as predicate acts to sustain the DNC's RICO and RICO conspiracy claims, namely the Russian Federation's hack of the DNC's computers in 2015 and April 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   The DNC alleges that the Russian Federation extracted documents from the\n   DNC's email server between May 25 and June 1, 2016 and in September 2016. The DNC argues that these thefts and the subsequent publication of the documents can serve as predicate RICO acts. However, the documents alleged to have been stolen between May 25 and June 1 were from the DNC's email server and are not alleged to have contained any trade secrets. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAC \u00b6\u00b6 123-31.) Moreover, the Russian Federation is the only defendant who is alleged to have participated in any of the thefts of the DNC's information, and the Russian Federation and WikiLeaks are the only defendants who are alleged to have possessed or published the stolen information. Indeed, the Agalarovs, Mifsud, Stone, the Campaign, and the Campaign defendants are not alleged to have stolen, possessed, or published any of the DNC's stolen information. The DNC does not provide any plausible factual allegations that any of these defendants knew that there were trade secrets among the stolen documents. Mifsud is alleged to have told Papadopoulos about emails that could be damaging to Hillary Clinton; the Agalarovs are alleged to have told Trump Jr., Manafort, and Kushner about \"derogatory information on candidate Clinton from Russian sources,\" (SAC \u00b6 219); WikiLeaks is alleged to have provided Trump Jr. with the password to an anti-Trump website which is not alleged to be owned by the DNC; Stone is alleged to have communicated with the GRU and with WikiLeaks through Corsi.
