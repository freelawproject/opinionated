(Doc. 1). Federal Defendants\n   have moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6). (Doc. 18). Federal Defendants argue also that Wildearth lacks standing under Article III to bring its claim. (Doc. 19 at 21).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The MLA requires that \"[p]eriodically, but at least once a year, the Secretary of the Department of Transportation\n   <em>\n    shall\n   </em>\n   cause the examination of all pipelines and associated facilities on Federal lands and\n   <em>\n    shall\n   </em>\n   cause the prompt reporting of any potential leaks or safety problems.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20185\">\n    30 U.S.C. \u00a7 185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (w)(3) (emphasis added). Congress later enacted the Pipeline Safety Act of 1979 (\"PSA\").\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2060101\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 60101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    et seq\n   </em>\n   . The PSA gives the Secretary of Transportation regulatory and enforcement authority to take actions to protect the public against risks to life and property posed by pipeline transportation and pipeline facilities. Congress specifically declined to remove from DOT the duty to cause the annual inspection of pipelines that cross federal lands when it amended the MLA, despite DOT's requests. (Doc. 23, at 2-3). The legislative history notes that \"the committee struck out th[e] provision that would have removed what is now 185(w)(3).\" (Doc. 23 at 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   DOT subsequently delegated this non-discretionary duty to cause the examination of all pipelines on federal lands to PHMSA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201.97\">\n    49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.97\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1). Wildearth asserts that PHMSA has failed to comply for at least six years with what the MLA requires - action causing the annual examination of all pipelines on federal lands. (Docs. 1 at \u00b6 3; 23 at 17). The MLA expressly compels PHMSA, pursuant to DOT's delegation, to cause the inspection of\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   oil and gas pipelines on federal lands.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20185\">\n    30 U.S.C. \u00a7 185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (w)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Wildearth alleges that PHMSA's existing inspection regulations allegedly do not appear to encompass all oil and gas pipelines that cross federal lands.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2060101\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 60101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(21)-(22) ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20192.3\">\n    49 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 192.3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 195.2. For example, the annual inspection requirements do not seem to include non-regulated rural gas gathering lines, some rural regulated gas gathering lines, oil flow lines, and certain oil gathering and transmission lines outside of high consequence areas.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20192.8\">\n    49 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 192.8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 192.9, 192.705, 192.706, 195.1(b), 195.11, 195.12. Wildearth asserts that PHMSA's failure to cause the inspection of these pipelines constitutes agency inaction. Wildearth brings this action pursuant to the APA's \"failure to act\" provision set forth at\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Federal Defendants dispute the notion that Wildearth's claim challenges PHMSA's inaction. Federal Defendants contend that Wildearth's complaint actually challenges PHMSA's current PSA regulations for being out-of-compliance with the MLA. Federal Defendants argue that the court of appeals possesses exclusive jurisdiction over Wildearth's suit. Congress provided that a person who seeks to challenge a regulation prescribed under the PSA, or an order issued under the PSA, \"may apply for review of the regulation or order by filing a petition for review\" in a court of appeals.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2060119\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 60119\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) ; (Doc. 19 at 18-19). Federal Defendants further contend that the eighty-nine-day time limit for seeking a review of a PHMSA regulation or order bars Wildearth's complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Court will address first whether Wildearth has standing under Article III to bring its claim. The Court next will address whether Wildearth presents a valid \"failure to act\" claim pursuant to the APA. The Court finally will analyze Federal\n   Defendants' argument that the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction to hear Wildearth's claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Standing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Court must assume at this stage that all allegations in Wildearth's complaint are true and draw reasonable inferences in its favor.\n   <em>\n    Wolfe v.

(Doc. 19 at 29-30). Federal Defendants characterize Wildearth's injury as simply aesthetic.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29. Federal Defendants assert that Wildearth must associate an alleged injury complaining of certain \"sights, sounds, and smells\" with particular leaking or rusted pipelines.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 30-31. Federal Defendants argue that Wildearth must allege that at least one pipeline causing the particular \"sights, sounds, and smells\" must be a \"flow, gathering, or transmission pipeline\" and prove \"PHMSA's regulations do not require annual examinations for that pipeline.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Wildearth alleges that its members can see, hear, and smell leaking pipelines while recreating on public lands.

First, the agency orders at issue arose from common factual backgrounds. Second, the agency order had to address a common question of law. And finally, the agency order had to rely on dual statutory bases that gave rise to two paths to review. These courts of appeal opted to exercise discretionary jurisdiction and displace the district court's role in reviewing an agency decision only where they possessed a fully developed administrative record.\n   <em>\n    Ruud\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9052623\" index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/347/1086/\">\n    347 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1090 ;\n   <em>\n    Shell Oil Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3617209,7413444\" index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/47/1186/\">\n    47 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1195 ;\n   <em>\n    Sutton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1852496\" index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/38/621/#p625\">\n    38 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   625-26 ;\n   <em>\n    Int'l Bhd. of Teamsters\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3818986,1830260\" index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/17/1478/\">\n    17 F.3d at 1478\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This approach would not apply here because dual statutory bases do not give rise to two paths to review. This case presents a situation where dual authority does not exist because only one path to review proves available.

The Ninth Circuit emphasized also the practical consequences of allowing plaintiffs to circumvent appellate jurisdiction.
