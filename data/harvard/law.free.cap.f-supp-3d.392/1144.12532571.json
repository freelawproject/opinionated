Mot. at 11; 8 U.S.C. 1232(b)(1) (setting out standards for the care and custody of unaccompanied children \"[c]onsistent with section 462 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=6%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20279\">\n    6 U.S.C. \u00a7 279\n   </extracted-citation>\n   )\"). The Court agrees. The savings provisions expressly preserve the effect of existing \"completed administration actions.\" The\n   <em>\n    Flores\n   </em>\n   Agreement falls under this category-it is an agreement or contract.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=6%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    6 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2). Indeed, Defendants \"do not dispute that the savings clause maintained the [\n   <em>\n    Flores\n   </em>\n   ] Agreement in effect as a consent decree (for example, in creating a hierarchy for release to certain sponsors).\" Opp. at 15 n.11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The next question then becomes whether Congress amended, modified, superseded, terminated, set aside, or revoked Paragraph 24A of the\n   <em>\n    Flores\n   </em>\n   Agreement by operation of law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=6%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    6 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1). As discussed below, the Court finds that it did not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    B\n   </strong>\n   .\n   <strong>\n    Plain Language of Homeland Security Act and TVPRA\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Defendants argue that the savings clause \"applies only to the extent it was not superseded or in conflict with subsequent laws\" and \"should not be viewed as rigidly freezing in place provisions aimed at the now defunct INS, or as creating free-standing authority for actions Congress did not authorize in either [the Homeland Security Act or the TVPRA].\" Opp. at 15 n.11. In essence, Defendants contend that because the TVPRA created an entirely new immigration framework for unaccompanied children-by, among other things, giving HHS the authority to evaluate custodial adults before releasing minors to them-it superseded Paragraph 24A, such that unaccompanied children in HHS/ORR custody need not be provided with bonding hearings.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=6%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (describing the \"different, child-welfare related function\" served by HHS that is \"not a part of the immigration enforcement scheme\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The problem with Defendants' argument is that the TVPRA (as well as the Homeland Security Act) is silent on the subject of bond hearings or whether the safety and placement provisions replace bond hearing requirements. This silence is in stark contrast to federal immigration laws and regulations, which explicitly reference bond hearings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201226\">\n    8 USC \u00a7 1226\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2) (immigrant detainee may be released on \"bond of at least $1,500 with security approved by, and containing conditions prescribed by, the Attorney General\"); 8 C.F.R. 1003.19 (describing applications for an \"initial bond redetermination\" and \"for the exercise of authority to review bond determinations\"); 8 C.F.R. 1236.1(d)(1) (\"After an initial custody determination by the district director, including the setting of a bond, the respondent may ... request amelioration of the conditions under which he or she may be released.\").
