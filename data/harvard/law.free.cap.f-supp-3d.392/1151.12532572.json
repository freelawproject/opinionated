(\"AAPS\") and Dr. Eileen Natuzzi (\"Dr. Natuzzi\") seek declaratory and injunctive relief against Shelley Rouillard, in her official capacity as the Director of the California Department of Managed Health Care, (\"Defendant\") on the basis that Assembly Bill No. 72 (\"the Act\" or \"AB 72\"), which passed into law on September 23, 2016, violates multiple constitutional rights of AAPS members and Dr. Natuzzi. Pls.' First Am. Compl., \u00b6\u00b6 1-6 (ECF No. 33). More specifically, Plaintiffs allege causes of action for violations of the Due Process, Takings, and Supremacy Clauses of the United States Constitution.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Presently before the Court is Defendant's Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint (\"FAC\") for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Def.'s Mot. To Dismiss (ECF No. 34). For the following reasons, Defendant's Motion is GRANTED with one (1) final leave to amend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Out-of-network physicians, who are called \"noncontracting\" physicians by AB 72, do not have the benefits or obligations of being contractually bound with insurance companies. There are both advantages and disadvantages to patients and physicians resulting from an out-of-network status. Some physicians are out-of-network not by choice, but because insurance companies increased their profits by excluding them for reasons other than quality of care. Out-of-network physicians often lack the referral volume of physicians who are within the networks of insurance companies, and, as a result, out-of-network physicians tend to provide more charity care than in-network physicians do. To remain in business, out-of-network physicians may charge more for certain services than the in-network insurance reimbursement rates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Insured patients, in many cases, obtain policies that require their insurance companies to pay charges submitted by out-of-network physicians, or at least a substantial percentage of those charges. The only meaningful leverage that a physician or hospital has in negotiating a contract with an insurance company is the option of the physician or hospital to go out-of-network and not accept the insurance company rates. AB 72 denies the right of a physician to go out-of-network with an insurance company and charge out-of-network\n   rates. Signed into law by the Defendant Governor of California on September 23, 2016, AB 72 adds several new sections to the Health and Safety Code and the Insurance Code to limit the rights of reimbursement for out-of-network physicians. Specifically, the Act requires the following for out-of-network physicians, effective July 1, 2017:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   [U]nless otherwise agreed to by the noncontracting individual health professional and the plan, the plan shall reimburse the greater of the average contracted rate or 125 percent of the amount Medicare reimburses on a fee-for-service basis for the same or similar services in the general geographic region in which the services were rendered. For the purposes of this section, \"average contracted rate\" means the average of the contracted commercial rates paid by the health plan or delegated entity for the same or similar services in the geographic region. This subdivision does not apply to subdivision (c) of Section 1371.9 or subdivision (b) of this section.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   AB 72, \u00a7 2 (adding Section 1371.31 to the Health and Safety Code ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   According to Plaintiff, the Act prohibits an out-of-network physician from recovering fully on his or her claims for services lawfully rendered. Specifically, the Act establishes that, beginning with health plans issued on or after July 1, 2017:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   An enrollee shall not owe the noncontracting individual health professional more than the in-network cost-sharing amount for services subject to this section ... A noncontracting individual health professional shall not bill or collect any amount from the enrollee for services subject to this section except for the in-network cost-sharing amount.... If the noncontracting individual health professional has received more than the in-network cost-sharing amount from the enrollee for services subject to this section, the noncontracting individual health professional shall refund any overpayment to the enrollee within 30 calendar days after receiving payment from the enrollee.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   AB 72, \u00a7 3 (adding Section 1371.9 to the Health and Safety Code ). This ban in the Act on collecting from enrollees purportedly has the effect of preventing out-of-network physicians from recovering their fees from the insurance carriers that cover the enrollees for services rendered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In addition, the Act requires the Department, by September 1, 2017, to \"establish an independent dispute resolution process for the purpose of processing and resolving a claim dispute between a health care service plan and a noncontracting individual health professional for services\" rendered. AB 72 \u00a7 1 (adding Section 1371.30 to the Health and Safety Code ). Out-of-network physicians are thereby required to participate in this alternative dispute resolution on their claims, rather than immediately pursue their remedies in court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In its instant Motion, Defendant emphasizes, however, that a health care service plan and out-of-network provider are permitted to \"agree on a reimbursement rate.\" ECF No. 34 at 5. Only if no agreement is reached does AB 72 require plans to reimburse relevant providers at no less than the statutory default rate. Moreover, to calculate that rate,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   AB 72 requires each health plan, and its delegated entities, to provide to DMHC all of the following information for the 2015 calendar year: (1) data listing average contracted rate for services most frequently provided in or resulting from services provided in contracted facilities by out-of-network providers in each geographic region in which the services are rendered; (2) its methodology for determining these rates, including the highest and lowest contracted rates; and (3) its\n   policies and procedures used to determine the average contracted rates.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Defendant further stresses, as to the dispute resolution procedures, that if dissatisfied with the results of arbitration, \"either party may pursue any right, remedy, or penalty established under any other applicable law.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8 (quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%201371.30\">\n    Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code \u00a7 1371.30\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d) ). Despite the foregoing procedures, Plaintiffs allege that Dr. Natuzzi is pursuing claims, at least in part, \"based on losses she has already suffered due to the implementation of AB 72, in the form of a loss of 25% of her revenue in 2018 due to reduced reimbursement by health plans.\" ECF No. 33 at \u00b6 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In light of the above facts, Plaintiffs allege Defendant's implementation of the Act violates the Due Process, Takings, and Supremacy Clauses of the Constitution. Defendant has now moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim, arguing that Plaintiffs have once again failed to allege they have standing to bring their claims and that those causes of action fail on the merits in any event.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARDS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), all allegations of material fact must be accepted as true and construed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Cahill v.

Plaintiffs contend that the Act \"compel[s] physicians to accept underpayments for the services they render,\" depriving members of a portion of their property.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20688\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In response, Defendant contends the Act cannot be found confiscatory under the Due Process Clause because it does not compel Plaintiffs to accept any particular rate. Def.'s Reply Supp. Mot. Dismiss, 4-5 (ECF No. 37). \"[N]o one is arguing that providers must accept whatever amount of\n   reimbursement a health plan offers for services rendered.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The viability of Plaintiffs' Due Process claim hinges on the Court accepting Plaintiffs' interpretation of how the Act will affect out-of-network physicians. The problem with Plaintiffs' argument, however, is that, as stated above, while Plaintiffs' assertions may eventually be proven correct once the Act is actually applied to certain physicians, it does not, by its terms, impose a mandatory rate that this Court can determine is confiscatory as applied here. To the contrary, a plain reading of the statute indicates the Act merely imposes a floor, or a minimum rate physicians can expect to recover, for services subject to the Act. If a noncontracting physician is not satisfied with the minimum payments, he or she has an opportunity to resolve the dispute with the plan. If the physician fails to obtain reasonable rates through the dispute resolution process, he or she also has the option to bring a claim in state court to recover the reasonable value of his or her services. Plaintiffs' FAC, however, contains no facts showing Dr. Natuzzi or any AAPS members sought reimbursement through the Act's dispute resolution mechanisms. Consequently, without any facts showing Plaintiffs were denied reasonable compensation for rendered services, the Court cannot conclude the Act deprived Plaintiffs of a constitutionally protected property interest. Plaintiffs' Due Process claim is therefore DISMISSED on this basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Moreover, even if Plaintiffs have adequately pleaded a property interest deprivation, they still failed to allege facts alleging that the IDRP provisions of the Act themselves deny them due process. According to Plaintiffs, the IDRP is prohibitively burdensome in violation of the Due Process Clause because it \"requires that physicians first participate in a cumbersome, futile internal review process with the health plan, and then be subjected to a dispute-resolution fee with [the IDRP] which is often larger than the amount in dispute.\" ECF No. 33 at \u00b6 24.

According to Plaintiffs, Defendant violated the Takings Clause by denying Plaintiffs \"their right to quantum meruit for those services and instead [subjected] them to a cost-prohibitive dispute resolution,\" which effectively \"[transferred] property-the fair market value for services rendered-from out-of-network physicians to health plans that would otherwise be required to pay in full for the services rendered by the physicians.\" ECF No. 36 at 13-14.

Accordingly, the Court must determine whether Plaintiffs have pleaded sufficient facts showing Defendant implemented the Act in a way that deprived them of fair and reasonable reimbursement rates without just compensation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The primary hurdle to Plaintiffs' instant cause of action is that the finality requirement for ripeness of a Takings Clause challenge demands Plaintiffs show the implementing agency has arrived at a final and definitive conclusion \"regarding the application of the regulations to the property at issue.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Williamson County Regional Planning Com'n v.

As stated above, Plaintiffs' FAC lacks sufficiently particularized facts demonstrating AAPS members and Dr. Natuzzi were ever denied just compensation under the Act. Merely stating that Dr. Natuzzi has experienced a 25 percent decrease in revenue is far too generalized for this Court to find a regulatory taking claim. Consequently, Plaintiffs' Takings Clause claims are DISMISSED with leave to amend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Preemption\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Finally, \"Plaintiffs assert a cause of action for violation of the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution, claiming the Act prohibits out-of-network providers from collecting for their services rendered to Medicare beneficiaries.\" ECF No. 34-1 at 19. Defendant argues in response, however, that \"the Act is not, and has never been, applied to Medicare plans.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6197836\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/473/172/#p186\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Given the lack of any clear statement of the law going to this point, but with Defendant fervently asserting that Medicare beneficiaries are not implicated, the Court held oral argument and directed the parties to meet and confer to attempt to resolve the question. They did so and timely provided the Court with a supplemental status report in which Defendant provided a guidance letter clarifying that AB 72 does indeed not apply to Medicare beneficiaries. ECF No. 47. Given this policy statement, the Court concludes Plaintiffs' preemption claim is moot, and Defendant's Motion to Dismiss this cause of action is GRANTED as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, Defendant's Motion to Dismiss (ECF No. 34) is GRANTED with one (1) final leave to amend. Not later than thirty (30) days following the date this Memorandum and Order is electronically filed, Plaintiffs may, but are not required to, file an amended complaint. If no amended complaint is timely filed, the causes of action dismissed by virtue of this Memorandum and Order will be deemed dismissed with prejudice and no further notice to the parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   IT IS SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    All further references to \"Rule\" or \"Rules\" shall be to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure unless otherwise indicated.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    Since Plaintiffs concede they are not pursuing a facial challenge, Defendant's Motion to Dismiss on that basis is moot.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    By conceding that they are not pursuing facial challenges to the Act, Plaintiffs essentially concede that this may be the case.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
