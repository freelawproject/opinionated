As part of her general ob/gyn practice at these hospitals, Dr. Bernard\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   provide[s] abortion services only for certain specified indications. The overwhelming majority of second-trimester [abortions] occurring in Indiana are because of fatal or serious fetal anomalies. The identification of many major genetic or anatomic anomalies in the fetus, including anomalies that may cause the death of the fetus at, or shortly after, birth, generally occur in the second trimester. These might include such things as an intracranial mass in the fetal brain, neural tube defects such as spina bifida and anencephaly, or other disorders related to autonomic function. The remainder are because of health risks to the mother or because the pregnancy is the product of rape.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15.

Dkt. 36, 7:21-22, 10:11-13 [hereinafter Meng Dep.]. Dr. Bernard is also aware that Dr. Katherine McHugh (formerly a plaintiff in this case,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 21) has performed D &amp; E in the past \"and wishes to be able to do so in the future.\" Pl. Decl. \u00b6 40. Neither Dr. Bernard nor Defendants are aware of any other Indiana physicians who perform or have performed D &amp; E.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Gonzales\n   </em>\n   described the D &amp; E procedure as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Although individual techniques for performing D &amp; E differ, the general steps are the same.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   A doctor must first dilate the cervix at least to the extent needed to insert surgical instruments into the uterus and to maneuver them to evacuate the fetus. The steps taken to cause dilation differ by physician and gestational age of the fetus. A doctor often begins the dilation process by inserting osmotic dilators, such as laminaria (sticks of seaweed), into the cervix.... [T]he length of time doctors employ osmotic dilators varies.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   Some may keep dilators in the cervix for two days, while others use dilators for a day or less.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   After sufficient dilation the surgical operation can commence. The woman is placed under general anesthesia or conscious sedation. The doctor, often guided by ultrasound, inserts grasping forceps through the woman's cervix and into the uterus to grab the fetus. The doctor grips a fetal part with the forceps and pulls it back through the cervix and vagina, continuing to pull even after meeting resistance from the cervix. The friction causes the fetus to tear apart. For example, a leg might be ripped off the fetus as it is pulled through the cervix and out of the woman. The process of evacuating the fetus piece by piece continues until it has been completely removed.... Once the fetus has been evacuated, the placenta and any remaining fetal material are suctioned or scraped out of the uterus. The doctor examines the different parts to ensure the entire fetal body has been removed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   Some doctors, especially later in the second trimester, may kill the fetus a day or two before performing the surgical evacuation. They inject digoxin or potassium chloride into the fetus, the umbilical cord, or the amniotic fluid. Fetal demise may cause contractions and make greater dilation possible. Once dead, moreover, the fetus' body will soften, and its removal will be easier. Other doctors refrain from injecting chemical agents, believing it adds risk with little or no medical benefit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    Gonzales\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3555978\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/124/#p135\">\n    550 U.S. at 135-36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3555978\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/124/#p135\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1610\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted).

Women obtain second-trimester abortions because they did not know they were pregnant in the first trimester; because they could not access an abortion provider or obtain funding for an abortion in the first trimester ; and because, as Dr. Bernard explains\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , major anatomic or genetic abnormalities are most commonly detected in the second trimester.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \"Poverty, lower education\n   level, and having multiple disruptive life events[ ] have been associated with higher rates of seeking second-trimester abortion.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 30 Ex. 2, at 8 (\"[T]he known risk factors associated with presenting for second trimester abortion include: adolescence, drug and alcohol addiction, poverty, difficulty obtaining funding for the abortion, and African-American race.\").

To the extent such rational relations exist, Defendants have not shown that HEA 1211, based on the record before us, appreciably and in fact advances those interests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   2. Burdens on the Abortion Right\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   In prohibiting standard D &amp; E, HEA 1211 unquestionably imposes substantial burdens on the right of women in Indiana to seek previability abortions in the second trimester.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   (a) A woman receiving an induction abortion because standard D &amp; E is prohibited is burdened as follows. She must exchange an outpatient procedure taking place over two relatively brief periods (or else over one period, if she is early enough in her term to be dilated and evacuated on the same day), likely measured in minutes, for an inpatient procedure which may extend over a grueling two or three days. She must undergo all the physical and emotional rigors and pains of labor, or be rendered insensate for the same period. She must pay an additional $10,000 or more, likely at least in part out of her own pocket. She is significantly more likely to experience retained products of conception or incomplete abortion and to be forced to undergo additional procedures accordingly. She must put herself at risk of uterine rupture. She is highly likely to have preferred\n   D &amp; E and likely to experience greater emotional distress from the induction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   (b) A woman receiving a hysterotomy because standard D &amp; E is prohibited faces burdens nearly unimaginable. She would undergo major, exceptionally invasive surgery at much greater risk to herself in a context where no physician could recommend that she do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   (c) A woman receiving a D &amp; E after fetal demise has been induced by injections either of digoxin or of KCl because standard D &amp; E is prohibited is burdened as follows. She is subjected to additional painful invasions and additional medical risks without additional medical benefits. She is subjected to a procedure which only a minority of physicians are trained to perform and/or currently employ, and then for nonmedical reasons. If she seeks an abortion early enough in the second trimester, she is subjected to a procedure which no physicians currently employ, so far as appears from the record. Finally, when, as will invariably occur, induction of demise fails, she will necessarily be subjected to either induction of labor or hysterotomy, and the attendant burdens outlined above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   (c)(i) A woman receiving a D &amp; E after fetal demise has been induced by digoxin because standard D &amp; E is prohibited is burdened as follows. If she is early enough in her term to be dilated on the same day as the evacuation, she must add an additional day to the procedure time. If she seeks an abortion before 17 weeks LMP, she is subjected to a procedure for which there is no scientific medical authority. If she is obese or suffers from uterine fibroids, the procedure may be entirely unavailable to her or substantially more difficult for her. She risks failure rates ranging from around 4 to around 30 percent, followed either by subsequent injections unstudied for their safety, or else by one of the other second-trimester alternatives outlined above. She is more likely to experience vomiting, hospitalization, and extramural delivery. If she does not experience extramural delivery, she is made to carry a demised fetus until the following day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   (c)(ii) A woman receiving a D &amp; E after fetal demise has been induced by KCl because standard D &amp; E is prohibited is burdened as follows. For the present and foreseeable future, she is highly unlikely to be able to obtain the abortion at all because no physicians in Indiana are currently trained to perform them. Even if such training were available, it would take a substantial interval of time to acquire the necessary competence, during which interval the procedure will remain unavailable; the requisite competence may never be acquired at all. Assuming such training were available and effective, she may still find the procedure unavailable to her because it cannot be completed for reasons of discomfort, obesity, the presence of fibroids, change of fetal position, or seizure. She risks uterine atony or cardiac arrest. She risks failure rates ranging from 1 to 5 percent, followed either by subsequent injections unstudied for their safety, or else by one of the other second-trimester alternatives outlined above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   (d) Finally, under HEA 1211, a woman cannot have fetal demise induced by umbilical cord transection. HEA 1211 proscribes \"knowingly or intentionally\" performing a \"dismemberment abortion.\" \" 'A person engages in conduct \"knowingly\" if, when he engages in the conduct, he is aware of a high probability that he is doing so.' \"\n   <em>\n    Hawkins v.

Accordingly, we presume other physicians operate under the same conception, such that a physician preparing to undertake cord transection would be aware of a high probability of simultaneously though unintentionally transecting other fetal parts as well, resulting in a \"living fetus\" being \"extracted one (1) piece at a time from the uterus\" in violation of HEA 1211.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gonzales\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3555978\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/124/#p135\">\n    550 U.S. at 155\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3555978\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/124/#p135\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1610\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The evidence ... supports a legislative determination that an intact delivery is almost always a conscious choice rather than a happenstance.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   Even if a woman could have fetal demise induced by transection under HEA 1211, she would have to submit herself to a practically unstudied procedure and its attendant medical risks without any additional medical benefit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   3.
