The first involves the right to aggregate or \"stack\" the limits of coverage for underinsured (UIM) benefits between two separate policies of insurance, commonly referred\n   to as \"inter-policy\" stacking. The second is whether a commonly used exclusion to prevent the stacking of benefits by combing the limits of separate policies, commonly referred to as the \"household exclusion,\" remains viable following the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Gallagher v. GEICO Indem. Co.\n   </em>\n   , --- Pa. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12505965\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/201/131/\">\n    201 A.3d 131\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2019).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The defendant carrier concedes that inter-policy stacking of UIM benefits is permissible under Pennsylvania law but contends that its insureds waived such stacking when the policies were purchased. I agree that inter-policy stacking can be waived, but further conclude as a matter of law that no waiver was effectuated in this case as to the policy through which coverage is sought. With respect to the enforceability of the household exclusion, the broad language of the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Gallagher\n   </em>\n   favors a conclusion that such provisions are\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   unenforceable. But even if\n   <em>\n    Gallagher\n   </em>\n   were to be limited to cases where a policy provides for stacked coverage, as urged by the defense, the household exclusion is still unenforceable in this case, because inter-policy stacking was not validly waived. Consequently, I will grant Plaintiffs' Motion for Summary Judgment and deny Defendant's Cross-Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Pertinent Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In July 2015, Plaintiff Corey Donovan was involved in an accident while riding his motorcycle. The motorist who struck Plaintiff maintained insurance coverage, and the carrier tendered the full liability limit of $25,000 available under the motorist's policy. Plaintiff then filed a claim for underinsured motorist (UIM) benefits under the motorcycle policy he held with Defendant State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company. The policy, which he had purchased in April 2015, provided UIM coverage up to $50,000 per person. State Farm tendered the full limit available under the policy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Corey Donovan resides with his mother, Plaintiff Linda Donovan, who maintains a Personal Automobile Policy with State Farm. Her policy extends UIM coverage to \"resident relatives,\" defined as a relative who resides primarily with the named insured. After the motorcycle accident, Mr. Donovan filed a claim for UIM benefits under his mother's policy, which provides for UIM benefits of up to $100,000 per individual.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   State Farm denied this claim, stating that Ms. Donovan's policy did not allow for additional coverage of Mr. Donovan. Defendant State Farm's automobile policy sets forth different coverage terms for UIM benefits depending on whether the insured selected stacked or unstacked UIM coverage. Under Pennsylvania's Motor Vehicle Financial Responsibility Law (MVFRL), a motorist with stacked coverage is entitled to UIM benefits equal to the aggregate amount of liability limits applicable to each vehicle for which the individual is insured.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=75%20Pa.%20Cons.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%201738\">\n    75 Pa.

Under some circumstances, an insured can aggregate coverage under one policy issued by a carrier with one or more other policies issued by that carrier, which is known as inter-policy stacking. An insured can elect to waive stacking, in which case UIM coverage is limited to the amount stated for a single vehicle in the policy in return for a lower premium.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=75%20Pa.%20Cons.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%201738\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 1738(b), (d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Ms. Donovan's policy covered three vehicles, but in 2012, she signed a waiver declining\n   stacked UIM benefits under her automobile policy.

The Waiver signed by Ms. Donovan does not suffice to waive inter-policy stacking.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   There is little direct authority on the intricacies of inter-policy stacking under Pennsylvania law. The most instructive precedent for purposes of this case is the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Craley v. State Farm Fire and Casualty Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5651800\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/586/484/\">\n    586 Pa. 484\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8430872,5651800\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/895/530/\">\n    895 A.2d 530\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2006).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Craley\n   </em>\n   clarified several issues under the MVFRL. First, citing 75 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 1738(a), it confirmed that the Act \"unambiguously provides for inter- as well as intra-policy stacking, thus expressing the clear intention of the General Assembly to compel insurers to provide stacking coverage absent a valid waiver.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8430872,5651800\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/895/530/\">\n    895 A.2d at 539\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In reaching this result, it rejected the view that inter-policy stacking could never be waived.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8430872,5651800\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/895/530/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8430872,5651800\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/895/530/\">\n    at 536\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second, it held that the relevant waiver is the one signed with respect to the policy under which stacked benefits are being sought.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8430872,5651800\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/895/530/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8430872,5651800\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/895/530/\">\n    at 533\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . For purposes of this case then, it is Linda Donovan's waiver that has legal significance; Corey Donovan's waiver is irrelevant. Third, it concluded that \"[i]t is evident that the General Assembly sought to ensure that policyholders would be given full information regarding availability of stacked coverage before deciding whether or not to reject it.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8430872,5651800\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/895/530/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8430872,5651800\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/895/530/\">\n    at 541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Court then turned to an anomaly in the statute with respect to inter-policy stacking-the fact that the language prescribed by \u00a7 1738(d) to accomplish a waiver of stacked benefits does not on its face \"clearly address an inter-policy stacking waiver.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8430872,5651800\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/895/530/\">\n    895 A.2d at 541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

That is so because under such circumstances the language of the waiver would literally apply to a rejection of stacked coverage\n   <em>\n    within\n   </em>\n   the policy, and the premium reduction being acknowledged by the insured could be assumed to stem from waiver of intra-policy stacking.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8430872,5651800\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/895/530/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 542 n.18.

That may literally be true, but State Farm ignores the Court's broader holding that an insured must be given \"full information\" about the availability of stacked coverage and minimizes its conclusion that a waiver that refers only to a single policy form does not \"clearly address\" inter-policy stacking.\n   <em>\n    Craley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8430872,5651800\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/895/530/\">\n    895 A.2d at 541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Ultimately, however, the fatal weakness in State Farm's position is that seeks to avoid the infirmities in Linda Donovan's waiver by relying on Corey Donovan's waiver of stacked benefits under his policy, Def.'s Mot.

I am not persuaded that the Commonwealth's inaction relieves State Farm from its obligation to secure a valid waiver. First, State Farm itself has not asserted legislative or regulatory inaction as a justification for its failure to secure an adequate waiver. It has instead sought to defend the validity of the waivers. Second, it does not assert that it would have been unlawful for it to supplement the waiver to refer to benefits \"under the policy\n   <strong>\n    or the policies\n   </strong>\n   \" as suggested by Chief Justice Cappy, and I am hard-pressed to see how performing such a simple revision could be deemed objectionable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Moreover, to the extent that State Farm might be reluctant to deviate from the statutory language, it had recourse under the Pennsylvania Code to seek guidance from the Insurance Commissioner under Chapter 35 of the Pennsylvania Code, which authorizes petitions for \"issuance, amendment, waiver, or deletion of regulations,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1%20Pa.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2035.18\">\n    1 Pa.

In that regard,\n   <em>\n    Craley\n   </em>\n   was handed down in 2006, and Linda Donovan was presented with the waiver for her policy in 2012. It bears emphasis that State Farm itself was the defendant there, and thus plainly on notice for a prolonged period of time as to a substantial issue concerning the adequacy of its waiver. And Pennsylvania is hardly an insignificant market for State Farm. According to the Insurance Information Institute, as of 2018 it is by a wide margin the leading writer of private passenger auto insurance in Pennsylvania, with a 19.4 percent market share as calculated by direct premiums written.\n   <em>\n    A Firm Foundation: How Insurance Supports the Economy\n   </em>\n   , Insurance Information Institute, https://www.iii.org/publications/a-firm-foundation-how-insurance-supports-the-economy/state-fact-sheets/pennsylvania-firm-foundation (last visited June 25, 2019). In short, though there may be a defect in the waiver provision of the MVFRL, State Farm was well aware of that defect and of its obligation to secure a knowing waiver of inter-policy stacking. In the final analysis, the carrier must bear responsibility for the policy it issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Although Corey Donovan explicitly waived stacking, and Linda Donovan waived intra-policy stacking, the terms of Mr. Donovan's policy are irrelevant under\n   <em>\n    Craley\n   </em>\n   , and I have concluded that that Ms. Donovan did not knowingly waive inter-policy stacking.\n   <em>\n    Gallagher\n   </em>\n   controls this case, and therefore State Farm cannot rely upon the household exclusion to deny underinsured coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

Summ. J. Ex. 2, at 38, ECF No. 16-6. State Farm goes on to observe that, under Pennsylvania law, courts must give plain meaning to clear and unambiguous contract provisions unless to do so would be contrary to a clearly expressed public policy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Antanovich v.

In response, Plaintiffs challenge the validity of this provision, arguing that such a limitation is \"nowhere authorized by the MVFRL.\" Pl.'s Second Suppl. Mem. of Law at 4, ECF No. 22. To the extent that Plaintiffs attack this provision on public policy grounds, I am unpersuaded. But that does not end the inquiry. Though I agree with State Farm that I must apply the plain language of the contract, such an approach does not yield the result that State Farm seeks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The policy provides two forms of underinsured motor vehicle coverage, designated \"W\" and \"W3.\" The policy describes Coverage W as the \"Stacking Option\" and Coverage W3 as the \"Non-Stacking Option.\" Def.'s Mot. Summ. J. Ex. 2, at 34, ECF No. 16-6. The policy states that Coverage W applies to vehicles marked with a \"W\" on the Declarations Page, and that Coverage W3 applies to vehicles marked \"W3.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1792353\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/507/68/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Looking to the literal terms of the policy, the coordination of benefits provision on which State Farm seeks to rely applies only to unstacked W3 coverage.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 38. In contrast, under form W coverage, the full limits of the policy, $100,000, are deemed excess and therefore recoverable by a relative living in the household.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 37.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The consequence of a carrier's failing to secure a valid waiver of stacking is that the policy defaults to stacked coverage by operation of law.\n   <em>\n    Gallagher\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12505965\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/201/131/\">\n    201 A.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   137 ;\n   <em>\n    Bumbarger v.

Super. 2014) (en banc). Applying that principle to this case, the absence of a valid waiver of inter-policy stacking means that Form W3 cannot apply, and I must look to the provisions of the policy that provided for stacked benefits - Form W coverage. As noted above, under Form W, the entire limits of coverage are deemed excess to any other underinsured coverage available. Therefore, the entire $100,000 for underinsured coverage in Linda Donovan's policy is available as excess coverage for an injured relative resident, in this case her son, Corey Donovan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
