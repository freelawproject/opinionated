CRENSHAW, JR., CHIEF UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   This is a Social Security appeal. In response to the recommended denial of his Motion for Judgment on the Administrative Record (Doc. No. 13), Plaintiff has filed Objections (Doc. No. 23) to the Magistrate Judge's Report and Recommendation (\"R&amp;R\") (Doc. No. 16). Spanning 34-pages, those objections could just as well have served as Plaintiff's opening brief, notwithstanding Rule 72(b)'s requirement, that \"a party ... file\n   <em>\n    specific\n   </em>\n   written objections to the proposed findings and recommendations.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(b)(1) (emphasis added). Nevertheless, the Court has carefully reviewed those objections, and considered the record as a whole. Based upon that\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review, as required by Rule 72(b)(3), the R&amp;R will be accepted and the final decision of the Commissioner denying benefits will be affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   As a preliminary matter, Plaintiff devotes almost an entire page of his Objections to arguing that \"the specification of his alleged disability onset date (AOD) as 05/01/15 is nonsensical and inexplicable.\" (Doc. No. 23 at 2). Plaintiff does not identify precisely where in the 1599-page Administrative Record (\"AR\") that date appears. As it turns out, however, that date is listed in the introductory section of the R&amp;R when the Magistrate Judge stated that Plaintiff alleges \"he ha[s] been disabled since May 1, 2015.\" (Doc. No. 16 at 2). Far from being inexplicable, it is explicable as a simple typographical error where 2015 was mistakenly substituted for 2017. Indeed, elsewhere in the R &amp; R, the Magistrate Judge correctly identifies the correct onset date as being May 1, 2017. That has been Plaintiff's position from the start, the ALJ operated on the assumption that was the onset date, and the Magistrate Judge, despite the slip of a finger on the keyboard, also recognized 2017 to be the correct year. In short, this is a non-issue that really would have been better left unraised. Accordingly, the Court turns to the more pressing substantive questions presented by this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiff's primary and overriding objection is that the ALJ did not give controlling weight to treating psychologist Douglas Herr's diagnosis that Plaintiff was disabled as a result of post-traumatic stress disorder (\"PTSD\") and bipolar disorder. This diagnosis is in the form of a letter addressed to Plaintiff's counsel and made a part of the administrative record in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In the letter, Dr. Herr states that he met Plaintiff five times for one hour, and twice for two hours between February 2, 2018, and the date of the administrative hearing on March 29, 2018. After noting\n   Plaintiff \"scored 29/30 on a Folstein Mini-Mental Status Exam indicating that his cognition is likely grossly intact and supporting the hypothesis that [Plaintiff] was not malingering,\" Dr. Herr based his assessment \"on information gathered from [Plaintiff] and his wife, Vanessa Jones, during the course of his treatment.\" (AR at 1523). Although treatment was \"in its early stages,\" Dr. Herr believed that the PTSD could be traced back to Plaintiff's military service as a combat helicopter pilot, and his failure to \"decompensate ... until leaving the military, though he had begun to experience distress while still on active duty at the time of his retirement.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Even though Dr. Herr opined that Plaintiff was \"generally able to maintain activities of daily living,\" he was \"not able to look after himself administratively.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Dr. Herr further opined that Plaintiff had \"severe symptoms that are difficult to categorize with complete confidence,\" that he might \"not sleep for days,\" and \"his attentional capacity is severely compromised.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1524). As for employment, Dr. Herr stated that Plaintiff \"is unable to work a full week, be around coworkers or the public, or maintain a full or even half-day consistently without accommodations.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff insists that the ALJ did not properly consider the record because substantial evidence supports Dr. Herr's conclusion that Plaintiff is disabled and unable to hold a job. In both his initial Motion for Judgment and in his Objection, Plaintiff details the evidence in the record lending support to that conclusion. For example, Plaintiff begins by describing his experience as a helicopter pilot in Iran and Afghanistan who was deployed four times for a total of 36 months between 2009 and 2014. Plaintiff then notes that (1) he was diagnosed as having \"adjustment disorder\" after he underwent \"behavioral health treatment\" in 2010 and 2012; (2) his mind started \"slipping\" while he was stationed in Hawaii, and so his wife \"shadowed\" him daily to insure that he did not miss appointments; (3) he was seen at the Schoefield Barracks Health Clinic in Hawaii on October 25, 2016 and diagnosed by a licensed clinical social worker (\"LCSW\") with \"adjustment disorder with anxiety by history\"; (4) he was prescribed Effexor, an anti-depressant, on November 23, 2016, as well as on December 8, 2016; (5) he reported to Dr. John Bonness on December 17, 2016 that he was experiencing PTSD, anxiety, agoraphobia, and depression, among other things; (6) he met with a LCSW and a psychiatrist in December and early January 2017; (7) on January 17, 2017, he was administered the CAPS 5 Assessment and diagnosed as having PTSD; (8) a week later, as he was \"out-processing\" from the military, a LCSW noted that Plaintiff was still taking Effexor and confirmed the PTSD diagnosis; (9) he and his wife relocated to Tennessee on February 3, 2017, and the Alvin York VA Medical Center became his medical treatment provider; (10) Dr. Gunther, PhD, completed an \"Initial PTSD Disability Benefits Questionnaire\" on May 25, 2017, diagnosed PTSD, and noted that it was causing \"Occupational And Social Impairment with Reduced Reliability and Productivity\"; (11) on June 30, 2017, Plaintiff was seen at the VA for a \"Post Deployment Transition\" evaluation, at which time Dr. David McCoy continued the Effexor prescription to treat his \"adjustment disorder with mixed emotional features\" and \"chronic PTSD\"; and (12) at some point shortly after separating from the Army on April 30, 2017, Plaintiff was given a 100% disability rating by the VA, of which 50% was attributed to PTSD.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This recitation of the evidence favorable to Plaintiff could be viewed as setting forth a clear trajectory of his PTSD from being some sort of an \"adjustment disorder\" in\n   2010, to full-blown and debilitating PTSD after he left the service in 2017. At a minimum, it could be seen as \"substantial evidence that support's Dr. Herr's diagnoses and assessment\" as Plaintiff argues. (Doc. No. 20). But whether substantial evidence supports Dr. Herr's conclusion is really beside the point in this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Substantial evidence can support both Dr. Herr's assessment,\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   the ALJ's decision,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   they are not mutually exclusive and can co-exist. This is because \" '[t]he substantial-evidence standard presupposes that there is a of choice within which the decisionmakers can go either way, without interference by the courts.' \"\n   <em>\n    Blakley v.

It does when the Court considers that review of an ALJ's conclusion is \"highly deferential\" under the \"substantial evidence\" standard.\n   <em>\n    Somberg on behalf of Somberg v. Utica Cmty.

However, the remainder of his assessment is not persuasive as it is not consistent with other evidence, including the claimant's earnings record and his largely unremarkable treatment records. Further, Dr. Herr's assessment is not supported by the objective medical evidence included in his letter, which was an unremarkable cognition score. His assessment was otherwise based on reports from the claimant and his wife. The evidence as a whole does not show\n   that the claimant has been affected to the point where he is unable to perform unskilled work within the above residual functional capacity. The claimant provided evidence as to his past traumatic events at Exhibits 1lE and 9F, but the evidence only documents events from 2005, and the claimant performed substantial gainful activity for about eleven years after that. Further, the treatment records from the period in question are largely unremarkable except as to the claimant's reported complaints and some abnormal mood findings. The undersigned also finds that Dr. Herr's assessment is not persuasive given his brief length of treatment with the claimant. The claimant has only been getting treatment from Dr. Herr since February 2018, and Dr. Herr acknowledged that his information was gathered from the claimant and his wife \"during the course of his treatment, which [was] in its early stages.\" Dr. Herr also noted that the claimant would \"likely benefit from supportive therapy for the rest of his life.\" However, this does not mean that the claimant is unable to do unskilled work.

Quite the contrary, Plaintiff worked full time as a military officer for years after he first experienced traumatic events in combat and continued that work until he took his accrued vacation leave shortly before retiring in May 2017. In fact, his PTSD was not definitively diagnosed until mid-January. While Dr. Gunther noted in May 2017 that Plaintiff's PTSD was causing some \"occupational and social impairment,\" along with \"reduced reliability and productivity,\" he did not conclude that Plaintiff could not be gainfully employed, particularly with the limitations\n   the ALJ found to be appropriate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Despite Plaintiff's claim that his PTSD continued to get significantly worse after he left the military, he concedes that after he saw Dr. McCoy for his \"post deployment transition\" at the end of June, 2017, he \"\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   not receive pyschological evaluation or treatment\" until he began to see Dr. Herr in February 2018 (Doc. 24-1 at 17) (emphasis by Plaintiff), a little over a month before the administrative hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Furthermore, Dr. Herr did not have Plaintiff's treatment records before him. Instead, his assessment was based on Plaintiff's and his wife's representations about how PTSD was affecting Plaintiff. This is not to suggest that Plaintiff and/or his wife exaggerated or were less than forthcoming when they met with Dr. Herr, or that Dr. Herr was duped or misled by them. It is to say, however, that the ALJ had reasons to discount Dr. Herr's conclusions for the reasons already stated, as well as the very limited time period during which Dr. Herr saw Plaintiff before the administrative hearing. Moreover, both Plaintiff and his wife testified at the hearing, including testifying about how the wife had to \"shadow\" her husband while they were in Hawaii, but the ALJ chose to discount their testimony based upon her review of the other evidence in the record. \"It is of course for the ALJ, and not the reviewing court, to evaluate the credibility of witnesses, including that of the claimant,\" and those determinations are subject to deference so long as they are \"based on a consideration of the entire case record.\"\n   <em>\n    Rogers v.

It is clear from reading the ALJ's opinion that she considered the entire file before her in making her credibility determinations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The fact that the VA determined Plaintiff to be 100% disabled is not determinative, even ignoring that agency attributed only 50% of the disability to PTSD. \"[G]overnment agencies have different criteria for determining whether someone is disabled\" and \"[t]hus, one agency's disability determination is not binding on the SSA.\"\n   <em>\n    Kessans v.

After careful consideration of the entire record, the undersigned finds that the claimant has the residual functional capacity to perform light work as defined in 20 CFR 404.1567(b) that is limited to lifting ten pounds, occasionally up to twenty pounds; sitting for a total of six hours in an eight-hour workday; standing and/or walking for a total of six hours in an eight hour workday; frequent use of his non-dominant left arm and hand for pushing and pulling and for fine and gross manipulation; understanding, performing, and maintaining concentration, persistence, and pace for simple instructions and tasks; occasionally interacting with coworkers and supervisors but not working with the general public; working around moderate noise only; and adapting to infrequent changes in the workplace.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   6.

Herr, Psy.D. Docket No. 13-1. Specifically, Plaintiff argues that the ALJ should have given great weight to Dr. Herr's opinion because he is a specialist, his opinion is consistent with other evidence in the record, and as Plaintiff's treating psychologist, he has treated Plaintiff \"long enough and frequently enough\" to form a well-considered opinion.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10507625\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/25/316/#p318\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff further maintains that the ALJ's rationale for discounting Dr. Herr's opinion, namely, that it was \"largely based on reports from the claimant and his wife, and no supporting treatment records were provided\" (TR 90) is erroneous because \"psychological examination and treatment by its very nature involves the solicitation of and reliance upon the symptom report of a patient and available witnesses,\" because Dr. Herr's opinion was based in part on his observations during sessions, and because \"the ALJ made no attempt to obtain treatment records from Dr. Herr nor even gave any indication prior to her decision that such records were needed, and Tennessee law expressly provides that a treatment provider may give a summary of treatment rather than the treatment records themselves, see TCA \u00a7 63-2-101.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15, 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Plaintiff additionally argues that Dr. Herr's opinion is consistent with Plaintiff's earning records and with VA records, and\n   notes that there are no psychological treatment records to speak of between when Plaintiff left the military on May 1, 2017 and when he began seeing Dr. Herr, to which Dr. Herr's opinion could be in conflict.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15-17.

Mr. Jones is continuing in treatment to address chronic, severe symptoms of mental illness that significantly impair his ability to function. The following diagnostics are based on my assessment of Mr. Jones during 5 one-hour and 2 two-hour sessions. The primary focus of these sessions has been treatment, and Mr. Jones has actively cooperated and participated in his treatment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n   Mr. Jones tolerated scored [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] 29/30 on a Folstein Mini-Mental Status Exam indicating that his cognition is likely grossly intact and supporting the hypothesis that Mr. Jones was not malingering. Mr. Jones did not tolerate structured interviewing well due to the severity of his distress. The following assessment is based on information gathered from Mr. Jones and his wife, Vanessa Jones, during the course of his treatment, which is in its early stages.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n   In the course of his military service, Mr. Jones was a Blackhawk Helicopter pilot and saw long periods of active combat. He was repeatedly exposed to traumatic material directly and indirectly during tours of duty adding up to 4 years. He did not decompensate to his current condition until leaving the military, though he had begun to experience distress while still on active duty and at the time of his retirement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n   Mr. Jones currently suffers from a variety of symptoms which I either observed or that were reported by him or his wife.

In order to reduce daily stimulation, which helps to manage his symptoms, the [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] moved from their suburban home to a rural area. Mr. Jones is not able to sustain attention on the task of driving without becoming exhausted. He has to stay in the right lane and avoids heavy traffic. His ability to drive to appointments is limited so he sometimes pulls off to the side of the road and sleeps on his way home from sessions. This is in marked contrast to his previous capacities, when he was able to fly a military helicopter using all four limbs while tracking 5 channels on a radio and planning his mission's next step.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-108\">\n   Mr. Jones has severe symptoms that are difficult to categorize with complete confidence. His anxiety may be so high that he does not sleep for days during which time he is tense and agitated with flashbacks. However, his \"flashbacks\" may also at times be psychotic features occurring in the course of mixed manic episodes, after which he collapses into sleep when the episode passes. It is clear that he has flashbacks and nightmares indicative of severe and chronic PTSD, however, his symptoms may also include a mood instability with mania or hypomania, concurrent depression, rapid cycling and psychotic features.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-109\">\n   Mr. Jones daily rhythms are erratic, his sleep is unpredictable, his attentional capacity is severely compromised, his tolerance for relationships is severely limited as is his capacity for adaptive behavior. He has regular and frequent panic attacks and crying episodes. His speech can be pressured, and he experiences psychomotor agitation (shaky hands). He avoids reminders of his trauma triggers and tries to use simply daily chores to regulate his mood, energy and state of mind. He is unable to work a full week, be around coworkers or the public, or maintain a full or even half-day consistently without significant accommodations.

He also assessed a \"rule out\" diagnosis of type one bipolar disorder, severe with psychotic features. He noted that the claimant obtained a score of twenty-nine out of thirty on the Folstein Mini-Mental Status Exam and that this indicated grossly intact cognition. However, Dr. Herr reported that the claimant did not tolerate structured interviewing well due to the severity of his distress. Dr. Herr also obtained information from the claimant and his wife.

He further noted that the claimant was generally able to maintain his daily living but not able to look after himself administratively and had therefore given power of attorney to his wife. Dr. Herr reported that the claimant had moved from a suburban area to a rural area in order to lessen his daily stimulation and help him manage his symptoms. It was noted that he could not sustain his attention while driving without becoming exhausted and that he had such high anxiety sometimes that he did not sleep for days, flashbacks that at times had psychotic features, and regular and frequent panic attacks and crying episodes.

However, the remainder of his assessment is not persuasive as it is not consistent with other evidence, including the claimant's earnings record and his largely unremarkable treatment records. Further, Dr. Herr's assessment is not supported by the objective medical evidence included in his letter, which was an unremarkable cognition score. His assessment was otherwise based on\n   reports from the claimant and his wife. The evidence as a whole does not show that the claimant has been affected to the point where he is unable to perform unskilled work within the above residual functional capacity. The claimant provided evidence as to his past traumatic events at Exhibits 11E and 9F, but the evidence only documents events from 2005, and the claimant performed substantial gainful activity for about 11 years after that. Further, the treatment records from the period in question are largely unremarkable except as to the claimant's reported complaints and abnormal mood findings. The undersigned also finds that Dr. Herr's assessment is not persuasive given his brief length of treatment with the claimant. The claimant has only been getting treatment from Dr. Herr since February 2018, and Dr. Herr acknowledged that his information was gathered from the claimant and his wife \"during the course of his treatment which [was] in its early stages.\" Dr. Herr also noted that the claimant would \"likely benefit from supportive therapy for the rest of his life.\" However, this does not mean that the claimant is unable to do unskilled work.

The claimant was able to work for several years afterwards and his certified earnings records at Exhibit 8D reflect earnings well above the level of substantial gainful activity through 2016. So the Plaintiff was able to work well above the level of substantial gainful activity through 2016. On October 25, 2016, he was diagnosed with adjustment disorder and anxiety, and it was subsequently determined that he met the criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD. Exhibit 3F.

The claimant reported that he tried to live as healthy as possible by exercising, which indicates that he was not as physically limited as alleged. However, he complained of distress associated with reactions to reminders of past combat experiences. Despite his complaints, the claimant had an unremarkable mental status examination although it was noted that he was \"somewhat anxious and dysphoric.\" He was diagnosed with\n   PTSD and assessed a \"rule out\" diagnosis of major depressive disorder.
