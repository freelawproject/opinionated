Each of the Plaintiffs applied to the State Department for proof of citizenship in the form of a Consular Report of Birth Abroad (\"CRBA\"). The State Department either denied their CRBA applications or, in the case of two of the Plaintiffs, revoked their previously-issued CRBAs. The Department concluded that Plaintiffs are not U.S. citizens because none of their parents satisfied the residency requirement of \u00a7 1401(c). Plaintiffs challenge those decisions under the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20701\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. The Court previously concluded that it has jurisdiction to consider Plaintiffs' claims. The parties' cross-motions for summary judgment on the merits with respect to two representative plaintiffs are now before the Court. Dkt. 52; Dkt. 53. Both of those plaintiffs initially received CRBAs, which the Department subsequently cancelled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment is premised on the contention that \u00a7 1401(c)'s \"residence\" requirement demands no more than \"physical presence\" in the United States for any period, no matter how short. They argue that the Department itself once employed that test and that its more recent, more demanding test is arbitrary and capricious. The Department, in its opposition and cross-motion, argues that the two representative plaintiffs may not challenge the cancellation of their CRBAs under the APA because the APA cause of action is available only to plaintiffs who have \"no other adequate remedy in a court,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20704\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 704\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and because\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201503\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1503\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) provides an\n   alternative means for a person who is not in the United States to seek a determination of her citizenship. But, even if the APA provides an avenue for challenging the denial or cancellation of a CRBA, the Department continues, the representative plaintiffs' claims fail on the merits because \u00a7 1401(c)'s \"residence\" requirement demands more than fleeting physical presence in the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   As explained below, the Court agrees with Plaintiffs that \u00a7 1503 does not provide an adequate remedy sufficient to supplant Plaintiffs' APA causes of action (and does not even arguably supplant their stand-alone due process claims) but agrees with the Department that Plaintiffs' claims fail on the merits. The Court, accordingly, will\n   <strong>\n    DENY\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment and will\n   <strong>\n    GRANT\n   </strong>\n   the Department's cross-motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

The Court disagrees on both counts. As explained below, the D.C.

[\u00a7] 1503 claims.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275641\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/865/643/#p655\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275641\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/865/643/#p655\">\n    at 655\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The only reason that \u00a7 1503 failed to provide the plaintiffs with a means of seeking review was that the plaintiffs had sued in the wrong venue; a person present in the United States may file suit under \u00a7 1503(a) only in \"the district in which such person resides or claims a residence.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201503\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1503\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Xia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275641\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/865/643/#p655\">\n    865 F.3d at 655\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . From this, the Department infers that\n   <em>\n    Xia\n   </em>\n   held that \u00a7 1503(b) and (c) provide an \"adequate remedy\" in circumstances analogous to those present here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   That, however, is not what the D.C.

To be sure, the district court had held, in the alternative, that \u00a7 1503(a) \"provides an adequate alternative judicial remedy for plaintiffs, thus barring any APA claim.\"\n   <em>\n    Xia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275641\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/865/643/#p655\">\n    865 F.3d at 649\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   But that conclusion provides no aid to the Department in this case, which involves the entirely different remedies available to putative citizens outside the Untied States under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201503\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1503\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) and (c). Moreover, the D.C. Circuit did not hold that \u00a7 1503 provided an adequate alternative remedy that precluded the plaintiffs' APA claims. To the contrary, the Court of Appeals discussed \u00a7 1503 only in the context of the plaintiffs' due process claims and the district court's denial of leave to amend based on \u00a7 1503's venue requirements. Any doubt about the scope of the D.C. Circuit's decision, moreover, is put to rest by the court's disposition of the appeal, which reversed the district court's dismissal of the plaintiffs' APA claims and remanded the case, \"without prejudice to plaintiffs' ability to seek leave to file amended complaints in the correct venues to clarify and develop their APA and [\u00a7] 1503 claims.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201503\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201503\">\n    at 661\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

It does not require the aggrieved party to obtain a certificate of identity and then travel to the United States. It does not require the aggrieved party to submit to removal proceedings and possible detention. And it permits the aggrieved party to bring a declaratory judgment action against the Secretary of State, rather than filing a habeas petition challenging the Attorney General's separate decision to deny admission into the United States. Each of these factors played a role in the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Cort\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Cort\n   </em>\n   itself did not address the availability of the APA to bring a challenge to the revocation of a passport or other evidence of U.S. citizenship by a \"person who is within the United States.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201503\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1503\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

Those claims survive regardless of whether Plaintiffs have a cause of action under \u00a7 704.

Residence is not determined solely by the length of time spent in a place, but also takes into account the nature and quality of the person's connection to the place. Residence involves the connection to a specific physical place; it is more than a temporary presence.

While no specific period of residence is mentioned in the statute, Congress' use of the term \"residence\" requires a close examination, on a case by case basis, of the facts related to one's stay in the United States to determine if it falls within the INA's definition of \"residence.\" Residence is not a state of mind but a state of affairs to be demonstrated by objective facts.

One provision of the FAM in effect at the time Kayla and Chana Sitzman received their CRBAs and at the time their CRBAs were cancelled, for example, instructs that the INA does not specify \"the length of residence required to transmit citizenship\" but that the parent must have maintained \"a\n   <em>\n    place of general abode\n   </em>\n   in the United States.\" 7 FAM 1134.3-1 (updated April 1, 1998) (emphasis added). Another provision of the FAM has long instructed that more than \"temporary presence\" is required to satisfy the residence requirement and that mere \"[v]isits to the United States by citizen parents prior to the birth of the child will\" not suffice. 7 FAM 1134.3-2(a) (updated April 1, 1998). The Deputy Assistant Secretary's decision in the present matter\n   is consistent with that instruction, opining that \"[r]esidence is not determined solely by the length of time spent in a place, but also takes into account the nature and quality of the person's connection to the place\" and requires more than \"temporary presence.\" Dkt. 28-2 at 2.

Dkt. 28 at 21. But, the phrase \"without regard to intent\" cannot bear the weight that Plaintiffs give it. Rather, as the Deputy Assistant Secretary opined, it is possible to apply the Department's-and Congress's-understanding of \"residence\" based on objective criteria unrelated to the individual's state of mind.

Although undoubtedly a serious step, revocation of a CRBA is far less serious than revoking citizenship from someone who was-and then, as a result, no longer-a U.S. citizen, and Plaintiffs have failed to identify any legal or factual basis to question the Department's authority to correct its prior, erroneous issuance of the CRBAs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   <em>\n    Third\n   </em>\n   , the hearing officer cited to a 1985 law review article, entitled \"Regulatory Estoppel.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR CIV000260 (citing Peter Raven-Hansen,\n   <em>\n    Regulatory Estoppel: When Agencies Break Their Own \"Laws,\"\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"302\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=64%20Tex.%20L.%20Rev.%201\">\n    64 Tex.
