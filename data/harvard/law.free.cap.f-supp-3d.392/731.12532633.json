Rosenthal, Chief United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In September 2018, Maxim Crane Works, LP sued Zurich American Insurance Company in Texas state court, alleging breach of contract and seeking a declaratory judgment that Zurich must reimburse Maxim for defense costs, a $3.5 million judgment, and other losses Maxim sustained in a related lawsuit. (Docket Entry No. 1-3). Zurich timely removed. (Docket Entry No. 1). The parties cross-moved for summary judgment, responded, and replied. (Docket Entry Nos. 20, 22, 25, 26, 29, 31).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Based on the motions, responses, and replies; the record evidence; and the applicable law, the court grants Zurich's summary judgment motion, (Docket Entry No. 22), and denies Maxim's summary judgment motion. (Docket Entry No. 20). Final judgment is entered by separate order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The reasons for these rulings are detailed below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Construction Project and Accident\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In 2013, Skanska USA Building, Inc., a general contractor, was constructing an office campus in Houston and hired Berkel &amp; Company Contractors as a subcontractor. (Docket Entry No. 19 at \u00b6\u00b6 1-3). Skanska had a contractor-controlled insurance program that included worker's compensation coverage. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 4). Skanska required Berkel and other subcontractors to enroll and obtain coverage for the project.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Berkel enrolled and obtained coverage under the program effective from August to October 2013. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Berkel also had a separate commercial general liability policy with Zurich (the \"Berkel Policy\"), effective from August 2013 to August 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Berkel leased a crane from Maxim for the project. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 5). Berkel's Lease Agreement with Maxim stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   THE EQUIPMENT IS RENTED TO LESSEE ON A\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     BARE RENTAL BASIS ONLY\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , in its \"As Is\" condition. Lessee, at its own expense, shall transport, operate, inspect, maintain and repair the Equipment....LESSEE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ENSURING COMPLIANCE BY IT AND ITS EMPLOYEES/AGENTS, AND OF THE EQUIPMENT ITSELF, WITH ALL APPLICABLE LAWS, REGULATIONS AND ORDINANCES....Lessor shall have no responsibility of any kind for compliance with any such laws, regulations or ordinances during the period the Equipment is in Lessee's possession or control.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   (Docket Entry No. 19-1 at 514). Although Maxim had a separate Commercial General Liability policy with Zurich (the \"Maxim Policy\"), the Lease Agreement for the crane required Berkel to add Maxim as an additional insured under the Berkel Policy. (Docket Entry No. 19 at \u00b6\u00b6 7, 10; Docket Entry No. 19-1 at 514). The parties have stipulated that Maxim is an \"Additional Insured\" under the Berkel Policy. (Docket Entry No. 19 at \u00b6 9). As an Additional Insured, Maxim was a \"person or organization to whom or to which [Berkel is] required to provide additional insured status in a written contract or written agreement prior to the loss except where such contract or agreement is prohibited by law.\" (Docket Entry No. 19-1 at 617;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Docket Entry No. 19 at \u00b6\u00b6 6-8). Maxim did not enroll in Skanska's contractor-controlled insurance program. (Docket Entry No. 19 at \u00b6 4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Later in 2013, a Berkel employee overtaxed the crane, causing it to fall over. Part of the crane fell on Tyler Lee, the project superintendent and a Skanska employee. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11);\n   <em>\n    Berkel &amp; Co. Contractors, Inc. v. Lee\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12656064\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/543/288/#p293\">\n    543 S.W.3d 288\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 293 (Tex. App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 2018). Lee's leg was amputated. He received worker's compensation benefits through the contractor-controlled insurance program. (Docket Entry No. 19 at \u00b6\u00b6 11-12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The State-Court Litigation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In 2014, Lee sued Berkel, Maxim, and other defendants in state court, alleging negligence and other state-law claims. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13). When the state court litigation began, Maxim sought coverage from Zurich under the Berkel Policy as an Additional Insured, but Zurich denied coverage. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 14). Maxim also cross-claimed against Berkel for breach of contract, arguing that Berkel was required to defend Maxim and indemnify or contribute to any loss to Maxim. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In 2015, a jury awarded Lee more than $35 million in damages, allocating 90% of the fault to Berkel and 10% to Maxim. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 16). Maxim settled with Lee for $3,444,300.60, and Zurich paid Lee that amount under the Maxim Policy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 17). Maxim reimbursed Zurich for $3,000,000 of the settlement costs, as required under the Maxim Policy's Deductible Endorsement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Zurich also paid Maxim's defense costs under Maxim's individual policy, and Maxim reimbursed Zurich for the $824,839.38 Zurich paid in defense costs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 19).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   After the jury verdict, Maxim moved for entry of judgment on its cross-action against Berkel. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18). The state trial court entered an amended final judgment\n   in July 2015, stating that \"Maxim is not entitled to reimbursement of Maxim's Defense Fees, Costs, and Expenses of and from Berkel,\" and rendered judgment in favor of Berkel in Maxim's cross action. (Docket Entry No. 19-2 at 169). The court later vacated that final judgment based on Berkel's objections and entered a new final judgment stating that \"Maxim's motion for entry of judgment is denied, and Maxim takes nothing on its claims against Berkel.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 189).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In September 2015, Berkel appealed. (Docket Entry No. 19 at \u00b6 20). In 2018, the Texas court of appeals reversed the judgment against Berkel, concluding that because Berkel and Skanska were covered under the contractor-controlled insurance program, \"Skanska is Berkel's statutory employer\" under the Texas Workers' Compensation Act and \"Lee, as Skanksa's actual employee, is Berkel's co-employee.\"\n   <em>\n    Berkel &amp; Co. Contractors\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12656064\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/543/288/#p293\">\n    543 S.W.3d at 296\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because Skanska was immune under the Act's exclusive-remedy provision, Berkel, as a \"co-employee,\" was also immune.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12656064\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/543/288/#p293\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Maxim also appealed the state-court judgment. (Docket Entry No. 19 at \u00b6 22; Docket Entry No. 19-4 at 125-72). The Texas appellate court concluded that Maxim had \"not preserv[ed] error as to its issues regarding the applicability of [the Texas Anti-Indemnity Act],\" and the Texas Supreme Court denied review.\n   <em>\n    Maxim Crane Works, L.P. v. Berkel &amp; Co.

App.-Houston [14th Dist.] Aug. 9, 2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Maxim again demanded that Zurich cover its defense and settlement costs under the Berkel Policy. Zurich denied coverage because the Texas Anti-Indemnity Act prohibited Maxim's additional-insured coverage under the Berkel Policy. (Docket Entry No. 19 at \u00b6 24; Docket Entry No. 19-4 at 261-62). This lawsuit followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The Federal-Court Litigation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In September 2018, Maxim sued Zurich in state court, seeking coverage under the Berkel Policy. (Docket Entry No. 1-3). Zurich timely removed, and the parties agreed to file cross-motions for summary judgment with a joint stipulation of facts because the disputed issue is one of law. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket Entry Nos. 1, 13).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Issue Preclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Zurich moved for summary judgment that issue preclusion, or collateral estoppel, bars Maxim's claim because Maxim litigated the same coverage claim in state court. (Docket Entry No. 22 at 18-20). In its reply, Zurich explains that it \"has reviewed the pleadings from the Underlying Lawsuit in conjunction with Maxim's collateral estoppel response argument\" and \"is withdrawing its collateral estoppel defense.\" (Docket Entry No. 29 at 4). Because Zurich has abandoned this argument, the court need not address it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Standing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   While Maxim argues that it is entitled to recover under the Berkel Policy because it named Maxim as an Additional Insured, Zurich's standing argument focuses on Maxim's separate policy with Zurich, the Maxim Policy. Zurich argues that Maxim does not have standing to assert its claims because the Maxim Policy \"includes a [d]eductible endorsement that effectively assigns Zurich the very claims that Maxim is asserting against Zurich.\" (Docket Entry No. 22 at 11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Maxim Policy requires Maxim to reimburse Zurich for all defense costs, including the first $3 million of any settlement or judgment. (Docket Entry No. 19-1 at 669). According to Zurich, the Maxim Policy's Deductible Endorsement assigns all rights of recovery to Zurich. (Docket Entry No. 22 at 11, 20-27). The Deductible Endorsement states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   [Zurich has] your rights and the rights of persons entitled to the benefits of this insurance to recover sums that are reimbursable under this endorsement and any Deductible Amount from anyone liable for the injury or damages. You will do everything necessary to protect those rights for us and to help us enforce them.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   If we recover any payment made under this policy from anyone liable for injury or damages, the recovered amount will first be applied to any payments made by us in excess of the Deductible Amount. The remainder of the recovery, if any, will then be applied to reduce the\n   Deductible Amount reimbursed or reimbursable by you as respects that injury or damages.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   (Docket Entry No. 19-1 at 673). The section further explains that the policy applies:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   irrespective of the application of any Deductible Amount(s), including those with respect to...[Zurich's] right and duty to investigate or defend the insured against any \"suits\" seeking those damages; and...[Maxim's] duties in the event of a claim or circumstances likely to result in a claim.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 673-74). The parties' duties under the Deductible Endorsement \"may continue after this policy expires or is cancelled.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 674). The parties agree that Pennsylvania law applies to the Maxim Policy. (Docket Entry No. 22 at 24 n.13; Docket Entry No. 25 at 16 n.7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The jury in the underlying litigation awarded Lee actual damages of $35,443,006.00 and placed 10% of the fault on Maxim. (Docket Entry No. 19-2 at 11-26). Maxim later settled with Lee for $3,444,300.60. (Docket Entry No. 19 at \u00b6 17). Zurich paid this settlement amount, and Maxim reimbursed Zuirch $3,000,000 under the Deductible Endorsement to the Maxim Policy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Zurich billed Maxim $824,839.38 in defense costs, which Maxim paid. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 19).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Zurich argues that the assignment under the Deductible Endorsement \"includes claims against Berkel and its insurer,\" Zurich. (Docket Entry No. 22 at 22). According to Zurich, the Deductible Endorsement unambiguously gives Zurich the exclusive right to recover reimbursable sums under the Maxim Policy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Maxim responds that Zurich's construction overlooks the distinction between \"reimbursable\" and \"reimbursed\" expenses and that the Deductible Endorsement's assignment provision does not apply once the insured, Maxim, has reimbursed the insurer, Zurich. (Docket Entry No. 25 at 15-20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Zurich relies on\n   <em>\n    Zurich American Insurance Co. v. Wausau Business Insurance Co.\n   </em>\n   , No. 16-CV-3643,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%204684112\">\n    2018 WL 4684112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 28, 2018), to support its interpretation of the Deductible Endorsement. (Docket Entry No. 22 at 22-25). In the\n   <em>\n    Wausau\n   </em>\n   case, Zurich and a contracting company that had overseen and coordinated the construction of a shopping center sought a declaratory judgment that Wausau was obligated to defend and indemnify the shopping-center's owners in an underlying personal-injury case.\n   <em>\n    Wausau\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%204684112\">\n    2018 WL 4684112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *1. Zurich defended the owners as additional insureds under a Zurich insurance policy issued to contracting company. That policy included a deductible endorsement materially identical to the one in the Maxim Policy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at *2. Wausau argued that the contracting company lacked standing because it had assigned its right to sue Wausau under the policy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *5. The Southern District of New York agreed, concluding that the \"provision in the Zurich Policy is clear and unambiguous\" in assigning the contracting company's rights to Zurich.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *6. The court concluded that the policy applied beyond the contracting company's right to recover its deductible amount, because it allowed Zurich \"to recover sums that are reimbursable under the endorsement and any Deductible Amount\" and \"there [was] no language in the relevant provisions that limits the assignment.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Zurich argues that the\n   <em>\n    Wausau\n   </em>\n   holding is consistent with its interpretation of the Maxim Policy and that neither Pennsylvania nor Texas law conflicts with New York law on this issue. (Docket Entry No. 22 at 24;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 24 n.13). According to Zurich, \"Maxim is in materially the same position as [the contracting company] in the\n   <em>\n    Wausau\n   </em>\n   case\" because Maxim seeks to recover the money it spent in an underlying case, including the deductible amounts spent on the settlement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25). Zurich points to language in the Deductible Endorsement that Maxim assigned to Zurich Maxim's right \"to recover sums that are reimbursable under this endorsement and any Deductible Amount from anyone liable for the injury or damages.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Zurich reads this to mean that \"Maxim's assignment results in only Zurich being able to pursue Maxim's claims against Zurich,\" because the \"assignment should have the same results if Berkel was not represented by Zurich but by some other insurance company.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26). \"Because of its assignment of claims, Maxim cannot assert the claims it brings against Zurich. Zurich, the assignee of Maxim's claims, has never authorized Maxim to pursue the current lawsuit on Zurich's behalf or otherwise. Accordingly, Maxim has no authority or capacity to bring its claims.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Maxim responds that in\n   <em>\n    Wausau\n   </em>\n   , unlike this litigation, \"Zurich actively pursued its subrogation rights\" and that \"\n   <em>\n    Wausau\n   </em>\n   involved two different insurers, rather than the same insurer ...on both sides of the claim.\" (Docket Entry No. 25 at 19). Maxim also argues that the different applicable law in\n   <em>\n    Wausau\n   </em>\n   and this case has a substantive impact. \"Zurich's self-interested decision not to pursue any subrogation rights that were allegedly assigned to it results in a waiver of those rights under Pennsylvania law.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20 (citing\n   <em>\n    Valora ex rel.

(Docket Entry No. 25 at 15-16). Maxim argues that the Deductible Endorsement's assignment provision is triggered only when reimbursable costs are at issue. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16-17). According to Maxim, Zurich's interpretation of the Deductible Endorsement conflates the terms \"reimbursable\" and \"reimbursed,\" while the Deductible Endorsement distinguishes \"reimbursable\" from \"reimbursed\" in outlining the process for allocating recoveries between Zurich and Maxim. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The Deductible Endorsement states that \"the recovered amount will be first applied to any payments made by [Zurich] in excess of the Deductible Amount,\" and \"[t]he remainder of the recovery, if any, will then be applied to reduce the Deductible Amount reimbursed or reimbursable by [Maxim] as respects that injury or damage.\" (Docket Entry No. 19-1 at 673). Maxim explains that it already reimbursed Zurich for the settlement and defense costs in the underlying lawsuit, the same amount Maxim now seeks under the Berkel Policy. While Maxim admits that it assigned Zurich Maxim's right to recover reimbursable amounts, Maxim argues that it did not assign the right to recover \"amounts that Maxim has actually reimbursed to Zurich.\" (Docket Entry No. 25 at 17 (emphasis omitted)). According to Maxim, this \"is the only logical construction...because Zurich would have no right to seek recovery from third parties for losses Maxim (and not Zurich) actually incurred.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Maxim argues that because Zurich is entitled to reimbursement and recovery from liable third parties, \"[i]t would be ludicrous for Zurich to be able to prevent Maxim from recovering money from a liable insurer\" like Zurich, noting that \"Zurich has self-interested reasons for declining to exercise those rights as to its small portion of the Lee settlement.\" (Docket Entry No. 25 at 16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Zurich replies that Maxim's distinction between \"reimbursable\" and \"reimbursed\" in interpreting the Deductible Endorsement\n   \"reads into the contract a limitation that would disallow Zurich from seeking recovery of any reimbursable amount that has been reimbursed.\" (Docket Entry No. 29 at 5). Zurich argues that this reading would \"negate and render meaningless the specific reference to the Deductible Amount in the assignment\" and would \"add[ ] language to the contract that is not there.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). According to Zurich, Pennsylvania law prohibits that interpretation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Zurich reads the requirement that \"[t]he remainder of the recovery, if any will then be applied to reduce the Deductible Amount reimbursed or reimbursable\" to mean that Zurich may recover more than \"unreimbursed\" reimbursable amounts, but all reimbursable amounts, even if already reimbursed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Maxim's interpretation is the reasonable one. The Deductible Endorsement states that Zurich has the exclusive right to recover costs \"that are reimbursable,\" not those already reimbursed. (Docket Entry No. 19-1 at 673). Under Pennsylvania law, the \"rules of construction do not permit words in a contract to be treated as surplusage...if any reasonable meaning consistent with the other parts can be given to it.\"\n   <em>\n    Clarke v.

Super. 1998) ). As Maxim points out, the Deductible Endorsement implies a distinction between reimbursed and reimbursable costs in noting that recovered amounts apply \"to reduce the Deductible Amount reimbursed or reimbursable by [Maxim] as respects that injury or damage.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 673).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   There is a distinction between \"reimbursed\" and \"reimbursable\" in the Maxim Policy. While\n   <em>\n    Wausau\n   </em>\n   has some similarities to this case, the factual differences that the insured in\n   <em>\n    Wausau\n   </em>\n   had not yet reimbursed Zurich, but was instead seeking coverage for reimbursable (and not reimbursed) amounts from a different insurer make it unhelpful as persuasive precedent. Zurich's critique of Maxim's interpretation of the Deductible Endorsement's explanation of how recovered payments will be allocated also overstates the implications of Maxim's reading. To find that the Maxim Policy distinguishes between \"reimbursed\" and \"reimbursable\" amounts in stating that \"[t]he remainder of the recovery, if any, will then be applied to the Deductible Amount reimbursed or reimbursable\" does not mean, as Zurich argues, that it could never recover reimbursable costs, even if not reimbursed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Under the Maxim Policy, Maxim must reimburse Zurich for defense costs and the first $3 million of any settlement or judgment. (Docket Entry No. 19-1 at 673). Maxim has reimbursed Zurich for those costs in the underlying lawsuit. Under the most logical reading of the Policy, Zurich may recover \"reimbursable\" amounts, but it is not assigned the right to also seek recovery from other sources of amounts that the insured has already reimbursed to Zurich.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Alternatively, the parties' different interpretations show that the Deductible Endorsement is ambiguous with respect to whether only Zurich may assert claims for reimbursable funds. To the extent that there is ambiguity about whether an insured can seek recovery of reimbursable costs from another party, any ambiguity \"is generally construed against the insurance company as the drafter of the agreement\" and \"policy exclusions are to be construed narrowly in favor of coverage.\"\n   <em>\n    Mut.

The Employee Exception\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The Texas Anti-Indemnity Statute's Employee Exception states that the general prohibition against indemnification in construction contracts does not apply to a construction contract requiring indemnification \"against a claim for the bodily injury or death of an employee of the indemnitor, its agent, or its subcontractor of any tier.\" TEX. INS. CODE \u00a7 151.105(5). Maxim argues that the Employee Exception applies to Lee's claims against Maxim because Maxim was expressly covered under the Berkel Policy, which covered injuries to Berkel's employees caused by Maxim's negligence. (Docket Entry No. 20 at 13). Maxim argues that because Berkel \"has been deemed to be the functional equivalent of Lee's employer,\" the Berkel Policy covers Maxim's defense against, and settlement with, Lee. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Zurich responds that Berkel was deemed only Lee's \"coemployee,\" not his employer. (Docket Entry No. 26 at 7). Zurich asserts that neither the Texas Workers' Compensation Act, which was the basis for the state court's finding that Berkel was a statutory \"coemployee,\" nor the Anti-Indemnity Statute allows Berkel to be considered Lee's employer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12-15; Docket Entry No. 22 at 34-37). Because Lee was not a Berkel employee, \"co\" or otherwise, outside the narrow context of the Workers' Compensation Act, Zurich argues that Maxim cannot take advantage of the Anti-Indemnity Statute Employee Exception. (Docket Entry No. 22 at 31; Docket Entry No. 26 at 10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   One issue is whether the Texas appellate court's conclusion in the underlying litigation that Berkel was Lee's statutory \"coemployee\" under the Texas Workers' Compensation Act was the same as concluding that Berkel was Lee's statutory \"coemployer.\" A second issue is whether, if Berkel was Lee's \"coemployer,\" Lee's claim against Maxim was \"a claim for the bodily injury or death of an employee of the indemnitor.\" If Maxim wins both arguments, it can take advantage of the Employee Exception under the Texas Anti-Indemnity Statute and has coverage under the Berkel Policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <strong>\n    1. \"Coemployee\" and \"Coemployer\" Under the Texas Workers' Compensation Act\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Maxim and Zurich agree that Lee was a Skanska employee in 2013. (Docket Entry No. 19 at \u00b6 12). Berkel appealed from the underlying lawsuit judgment. The Texas court of appeals concluded that Berkel was Lee's coemployee and Skanska's employee under the Act. The court explained that because of this coemployee status, Berkel was \"immune from suit under the 'exclusive remedy' provision of [that Act].\" (Docket Entry No. 20 at 21-22 (citing TEX. LAB.

The Texas court of appeals did not state that Berkel was Lee's employer or that Berkel was Lee's \"coemployer\" with Skanska.

The court's conclusion that Austin Bridge was \"a deemed co-employee/co-employer\" does not make the terms interchangeable. The specific contractual relationships among the parties were critical. Austin Bridge was its subcontractor's coemployer by virtue of its contract with Austin Commercial, which incorporated the provision in Austin Commercial's contract with Baylor University that required enrollment in the owner-controlled insurance program that included workers' compensation coverage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 386. Austin Bridge was also a coemployee with Derr &amp; Isbell because Austin Bridge's contract with Derr &amp; Isbell incorporated the requirement that the subcontractor enroll in the owner-controlled insurance program.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   The injured employee was the employee of the lowest-tiered subcontractor, and the contractual requirement for workers' compensation benefits was incorporated into the contracts down the tiers of subcontractors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   In contrast to\n   <em>\n    Austin Bridge\n   </em>\n   , the injured employee here is not the employee of the lowest-tiered subcontractor, Berkel. Instead, Lee was the employee of the general contractor, Skanska. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket Entry No. 19 at \u00b6 12). Skanska subcontracted with Berkel. That subcontract required Berkel to enroll in Skanska's contractor-controlled insurance program. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 4-5). Because Berkel enrolled, Berkel can be Skanska's deemed employee under \u00a7 406.123(e). TEX. LAB. CODE \u00a7 406.123(a), (e). It was that status that led the Texas court of appeals to conclude that Berkel was Lee's coemployee.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Berkel &amp; Co. Contractors, Inc. v.

Unlike in\n   <em>\n    Austin Bridge\n   </em>\n   , in this case, there was no straight line through the subcontracting tiers from Berkel to Lee that would support Maxim's claim that Berkel was Lee's coemployer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   A survey of cases in which Texas courts have found subcontractors to be deemed coemployers of workers suggests that Berkel cannot be Lee's coemployer under \u00a7 406.123(e). To have that status,\n   Lee would have to be either Berkel's actual employee or employed by a Berkel subcontractor enrolled in the contractor-controlled insurance program.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    TIC Energy &amp; Chem., Inc. v.

Instead, Lee was the employee of a higher-tiered contractor. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket Entry No. 19 at \u00b6 12). Maxim has not identified, and the court has not found, a case in which a lower-tiered subcontractor is deemed under \u00a7 406.123(e) to be the statutory employer of a higher-tiered contractor's employee. In sum, the statutory language and the Texas cases interpreting that language show that the terms \"coemployer\" and \"coemployee\" are not interchangeable and that the court cannot deem Berkel to be Lee's coemployer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Whether \"Coemployer\" Status Can Be Imported to the Texas Anti-Indemnity Statute\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Even if Maxim succeed in arguing that Berkel was also Lee's statutory \"coemployer,\" the question remains whether an employee of a deemed \"coemployer\" under the Texas Workers' Compensation Act is also deemed an employee under the Texas Anti-Indemnity Statute. The Employee Exception under the Statute states that the general rule against indemnification for an indemnitee's own negligence \"does not apply to a provision...that requires a person to indemnify ...another party to the construction contract or a third party against a claim for the bodily injury or death of an employee of the indemnitor, its agent, or its subcontractor of any tier.\" TEX. INS. CODE \u00a7 151.103.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Maxim does not address whether \"coemployer\" or \"coemployee\" status can be imported to the Texas Anti-Indemnity Statute. Instead, Maxim appears to assume that once a subcontractor is deemed a \"coemployer\" of a worker under the Texas Workers' Compensation Act, the subcontractor is also then a coemployer under the Texas Anti-Indemnity Statute as well. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket Entry No. 20 at 22-23; Docket Entry No. 31 at 8). Zurich responds that \"even if [the Texas Workers' Compensation Act] deemed Berkel the statutory employer of Lee, such status would be limited to workers' compensation laws and would not extend to other statutes such as the Texas Anti-Indemnity Statute.\" (Docket Entry No. 26 at 7). Maxim argues that \"the Texas legislature intended the [Workers' Compensation Act] and the [Anti-Indemnity Statute] to work together,\" pointing to the Workers' Compensation Exclusion in the Anti-Indemnity Statute. (Docket Entry No. 25 at 22 (citing TEX. INS. CODE \u00a7 151.105(5) )).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   The Texas Workers' Compensation Act has a qualifier in \u00a7 406.123, the section stating that \"the general contractor shall be treated as the employer of the subcontractor\" under specific circumstances. The qualifier states \"[a]n agreement under this section makes the general contractor the employer of the subcontractor and the subcontractor's employees only for purposes of the workers' compensation laws of this state.\" TEX. LAB. CODE \u00a7 406.123(e). This language supports Zurich's interpretation that \"coemployer\" and \"coemployee\" status are limited to laws specifically concerning workers' compensation. Neither party argues that the Texas Anti-Indemnity Statute is a workers' compensation law. While Maxim is correct that the Anti-Indemnity Statute provides that it \"does not affect...the benefits and protections under the workers' compensation laws of this\n   state,\" that language sets the Statute apart from workers' compensation laws.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Neither party has pointed to cases applying deemed \"coemployees\" or \"coemployers\" outside the Workers' Compensation Act. Other Texas laws use different definitions of \"employee,\" suggesting that \"coemployee\" status is not universal across Texas law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. CIV. PRAC. &amp; REM. CODE \u00a7 101.001 (defining \"employee\"); TEX. HEALTH &amp; SAFETY CODE \u00a7 312.007(a) (same).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Because the Texas Workers' Compensation Act supports finding the terms \"coemployer\" or \"coemployee\" apply only to that context, and because Maxim has not offered a persuasive argument or precedent supporting the exportation of that status to the Anti-Indemnity Statute, Maxim has not succeeded in showing that, if Berkel is Lee's \"coemployer,\" it would also be Lee's coemployer under the Anti-Indemnity Statute. Without that connection, Maxim's argument that the Employee Exception in the Anti-Indemnity Statute applies to Lee's claims against Maxim fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   <strong>\n    D. The Workers' Compensation Exception\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   The Workers' Compensation Exclusion is a second exception to the Texas Anti-Indemnity Statute's broad prohibition against indemnification in construction contracts for an indemnitee's own negligence. The Statute excludes from its coverage agreements that affect \"the benefits and protections under the workers' compensation laws of this state.\" TEX. INS. CODE \u00a7 151.105(5). It appears that no court has yet construed this section.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Maxim argues that the Act's Workers' Compensation Exclusion requires Zurich to cover its claims and \"provid[es] an independent basis for concluding that [the Act] does not void Maxim's coverage as an Additional Insured under the Berkel CGL Policy.\" (Docket Entry No. 20 at 24). According to Maxim, the exclusion is meant \"to allow full indemnification (and insurance for such indemnification) for claims arising from third-party over actions, like the Lee Suit, where workers' compensation is available to the injured party.\" (Docket Entry No. 20 at 24). Maxim contends that because \"Lee and Berkel received benefits and protections under the [Texas Workers' Compensation Act],\" full indemnification is proper here. (Docket Entry No. 20 at 24).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Zurich responds that the exclusion is inapplicable because it \"applies solely to the benefits and protections under Texas's workers' compensation laws,\" and because \"Maxim has not shown any benefit or protection that is affected by the application of the Texas Anti-Indemnity Statute\" because both Lee and Berkel have received the benefits of the Texas Workers' Compensation Act. (Docket Entry No. 26 at 20). Zurich argues that Maxim's interpretation of the Workers' Compensation Exclusion would make it \"superfluous and meaningless\" because it would be \"redundant\" with the Employee Exception. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20-21). According to Zurich, the Employee Exception is meant to \"eliminat[e] liability and coverage disputes between [defendants] and streamlin[e] personal injury suits.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21). The goal is to protect workers, not third parties that might be sued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   The lack of legislative history, case law, and secondary sources discussing the Anti-Indemnity Statute make this or any purposive reading of this section difficult.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Beaver, 45 ST. MARY'S L.J. at 538 n.21 (\"There is little legislative intent or history on this Act, as is typical in Texas. The only statement of intent given concerns the duration of insurance programs currently in place, in that there is no requirement as to how long a contractor must maintain insurance for a given construction contract.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   (citing House Comm. on Insurance, Bill Analysis, Tex. H.B. 2093, 82d Leg., R.S. 1 (2011), http:// www.lrl.state.tx.us/scanned/srcBillAnalyses/82-0/HB2093ENG.pdf));\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 546 (\"[A] complete lack of clarity in drafting the statute and lack of legislative intent leaves courts to decipher what the statute in fact covers.\"). The parties' arguments on how to read the law based on legislative intent are largely unsupported.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   The statutory language itself shows that the court need not try to decipher the few clues about the legislators' intent. The Statute states that it is not meant to affect \"the benefits and protections under the workers' compensation laws.\" TEX. INS. CODE \u00a7 151.105(5). A party seeking to avoid the Statute must identify some preexisting workers' compensation benefit or protection under Texas law and explain how making the indemnification agreement void would affect that benefit or protection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Maxim has not identified a preexisting benefit or protection that the Anti-Indemnity Statute would undermine or vitiate here. Maxim argues only that \"[t]his case is deeply intertwined with workers' compensation\" because \"Berkel received the protection of immunity under the [Texas Workers' Compensation Act], and Lee received the benefit of workers' compensation payments.\" (Docket Entry No. 31 at 10). But applying the Statute to relieve Zurich of the obligation to indemnify Maxim would not affect a benefit or protection of the Texas workers' compensation laws. Lee would have, and did, receive his workers' compensation benefits in any event. Maxim has not explained how a ruling for Zurich would alter or substantively impact that result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Because Maxim has not shown that applying the Anti-Indemnity Statute would affect a benefit or protection of the Texas workers' compensation laws, the Workers' Compensation Exclusion does not apply to Maxim's claims for coverage under the Berkel Policy, entitling Zurich to summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   <strong>\n    VI. The Berkel Policy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Because the court concludes that the Texas Anti-Indemnity Act voids Maxim's Additional-Insured coverage under the Berkel Policy for the damages and losses in the underlying litigation, the court need not address whether the Berkel Policy precludes or limits Maxim's recovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   <strong>\n    VII. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   The court grants Zurich's summary judgment motion, (Docket Entry No. 22), and denies Maxim's summary judgment motion, (Docket Entry No. 20). Final judgment is separately entered.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-118\">\n    Maxim looks beyond the Maxim Policy language to argue that Zurich's assertion that Maxim lacks standing is precluded by the unclean-hands doctrine. Maxim argues Zurich has not performed its duty under the policy in good faith. (Docket Entry No. 25 at 18). Because the court concludes that the Policy does not deprive Maxim of standing, it does not consider these arguments.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-119\">\n    Zurich also argues that if the court finds that Maxim has standing to pursue its claims, \"Zurich remains entitled to a reimbursement\" or a \"setoff for any and all reimbursable amounts paid by Zurich to Maxim under the Maxim CGL Policy that have not [been] previously reimbursed to Zurich by Maxim.\" (Docket Entry No. 22 at 26-27). Because, as discussed below, the court concludes that Texas law bars Maxim's recovery, this argument need not be addressed.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-120\">\n    The Statute went into effect in 2012.
