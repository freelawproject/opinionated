Inc. (\"Dillon\"), attempts to hale the Defendant, Soundview Vermont Holdings, LLC (\"Soundview\"), a Vermont corporation, into this Court to litigate their contractual dispute arising out of work Dillon performed in Vermont for one of Soundview's subsidiaries. Soundview moves to dismiss pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(2) for lack of personal jurisdiction. (Docket No. 7). Because the Court finds that asserting jurisdiction would be inconsistent with the Due Process Clause, Soundview's motion is\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      granted\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Background\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Dillon is a Massachusetts corporation that fabricates and repairs boilers and pressure vessels. In August 2012, APC Paper Company (\"APC\") called Dillon's president, John McNamara, to request that Dillon submit a proposal to covert two boilers at Putney Paper Company (\"Putney Paper\")-a wholly owned subsidiary of APC-from oil fuel to natural gas. On August 24, Dillon submitted its proposal and the parties subsequently engaged in several discussions by telephone, email, and fax to further negotiate the terms of a contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On December 6, 2012, Putney Paper prepared a purchase order for Dillon to convert the boilers, which was sent to Dillon on January 3, 2013. After Putney Paper prepared the purchase order, but before it was sent to Dillon, Soundview acquired Putney Paper from APC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In February 2013, Dillon converted the boilers but the relationship between the parties soured due to disputes regarding warranties and the amounts charged by Dillon for the work.
