Azar, II, the Secretary of the United States department of Health and Human Services, and Seema Verma, Administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (collectively, \"CMS\") move to dismiss the complaint filed by Plaintiff True Health Diagnostics, LLC (\"THD\") for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. [Dkt. 9]. THD did not file a response to CMS's Motion, and its response time has lapsed. Local Rule CV-7(e). Although THD did not file a separate response to CMS's Motion to Dismiss, THD did address the subject-matter jurisdiction issues in several pleadings and orally during the July 17, 2019 show cause hearing regarding its Motion for Preliminary Injunction. Based on the relevant filings, evidence, and applicable law, CMS's Motion to Dismiss is GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   THD provides nationwide diagnostic services, consisting primarily of blood and urine testing, for Medicare beneficiaries. THD provides such services by (1) testing samples from physicians in their lab in either Frisco, Texas, or Richmond, Virginia; or (2) managing outpatient labs in\n   hospitals partnered with THD. Most of THD's 400 employees are lab technicians and billers. Approximately 20% of all THD patients are currently Medicare patients, and 30% of THD revenue is from CMS [Dkt. #3-2, \u00b6 4]. Private providers supply the remaining 70% of revenue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. 2017 and 2019 CMS Payment Suspensions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On May 25, 2017, CMS suspended 100% of THD's Medicare payments, without prior notice, based on \"credible allegations of fraud\" pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20405.372\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.372\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4). [Dkt. 2, \u00b6 34]. THD submitted a rebuttal statement on June 5, 2017 [Dkt. 2, \u00b6 41], but CMS refused to lift the suspension [Dkt. 2, \u00b6 46]. Approximately a month later on June 23, 2017, CMS reduced the suspension to 35% (the \"2017 Suspension\"). [Dkt. 2, \u00b6 49].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On June 11, 2019, while the 2017 Suspension was in place, CMS implemented a second suspension of Medicare payments based on \"recent credible allegations of fraud\" (the \"2019 Suspension\"). [Dkt. 2, \u00b6 58]. THD submitted its rebuttal statement concerning the 2019 suspension on June 25, 2019. [Dkt. 3-3]. On July 2, 2019, THD brought suit against CMS for the 2017 and 2019 Suspensions. Specifically, THD alleges five causes of action for CMS's actions: (1) violation of procedural due process; (2) violation of substantive due process; (3) violation of the Administrative Procedure Act; (4) mandamus; and (5) declaratory judgment. [Dkt. 2].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Subsequently, on July 5, 2019, CMS moved to dismiss the case based on Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1), lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, and 12(b)(6), failure to state a claim for which relief may be granted. [Dkt. 9]. On the same date, CMS issued an overpayment determination concerning the 2017 Suspension. [Dkt. 9 at 7].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

THD made the business decision to continue participating in Medicare, and after more than two years, it cannot require this Court to redress its business decision by threatening imminent bankruptcy.

If THD were to file for bankruptcy or to liquidate, there is a low risk of patient disruption because patients using THD's services seek diagnostic testing and not an immediate health service. Moreover, these patients do not know where their medical samples are being tested because it is the physicians who are choosing which diagnostics laboratory to use. Further, as presented at the preliminary injunction hearing, there are over 3,500 diagnostic laboratories nationwide that provide\n   similar services as THD.

But the Fifth Circuit reserved the issue of whether asking for the timely hearing afforded mandamus jurisdiction or not.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   at 507.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   THD requests mandamus relief for the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   \"(i) terminate their unlawful suspensions of Medicare payments to True Health until such time as an overpayment decision is issued and due process provided; (ii) immediately release the suspended funds being held in escrow by Defendants; and (iii) implement a full, speedy, and adequate administrative review process if Defendants intend to recoup or withhold any of True Health's Medicare payments in the future.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   [Dkt. 2 at 20].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   As to (i) and (ii), THD seeks an order to compel CMS to remedy the allegedly injurious act of suspending and withholding its Medicare payments. Like in\n   <em>\n    Family Rehab.\n   </em>\n   , that constitutes an injunctive relief, and thus no mandamus jurisdiction exists for those claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   As to (iii), THD seeks an affirmative action from CMS, but CMS does not owe a nondiscretionary duty to plaintiff. Taking THD's facts as true, it is not entitled to an overpayment determination in a specific amount of time not provided by federal regulation or statute. Nor does CMS have a duty to start the appeals process within a timeframe not set by federal law. Congress, through the Medicare Act and federal regulations, designed am administrative process, and THD fails to point out any specific section requiring CMS to \"implement a full, speedy, and adequate administrative review process\" if it intends to recoup or withhold payments in the future.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

As the Fifth Circuit has stated when addressing this issue, courts \"will not imply a Bivens remedy for an alleged constitutional violation in the denial of Medicare Act reimbursements, because Congress has created a comprehensive statutory administrative review mechanism, which was intended fully to address the problems created by wrongful denial of Medicare reimbursements.\"\n   <em>\n    Marsaw v.

Beyond mentioning\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   once in its Complaint, THD does not explain why the Court has jurisdiction under\n   <em>\n    Bivens.\n   </em>\n   THD has failed to meet its burden of establishing subject-matter jurisdiction under\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    E. The Court's inherent equity power and power to preserve its own jurisdiction does not provide subject-matter jurisdiction.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Although THD asserts the court's inherent equity power and power to preserve its own jurisdiction as bases for subject-matter jurisdiction, it fails to provide one legal authority explaining how either concept grants subject-matter jurisdiction when none exists elsewhere. The Court knows of no such legal authority and does not find subject-matter jurisdiction based on its inherent equity power or power to preserve its own jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Because the Court finds that it lacks subject matter jurisdiction, it need not entertain CMS's 12(b)(6) argument for failure to state a claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
