Dennis Saylor IV, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Defendant Raymond Scanzani is charged with possession of child pornography in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(a)(5)(B). He has filed a motion to suppress evidence seized by the government from his apartment. Scanzani alleges that the search and seizure violated the Fourth Amendment of the United States\n   Constitution because the warrant (1) was not supported by probable cause and (2) was overbroad and did not describe the items to be seized with particularity. In addition, Scanzani alleges that the government's search of his attic, which resulted in the seizure of a story that he had written, exceeded the scope of the warrant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Factual Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In December 2006, Raymond Scanzani was convicted in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida of (1) one count of knowingly mailing and transporting and attempting to mail and transport child pornography by use of a computer in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(a)(1), (2) one count of receiving child pornography by means of a computer in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(a)(2)(B), and (3) one count of possession of child pornography by means of a computer in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(a)(5)(B).\n   <em>\n    United States v. Scanzini\n   </em>\n   , No. 06-cr-60185 (S.D. Fla. 2006).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   He was sentenced to a prison term of 96 months to run concurrently, followed by a lifetime term of supervised release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In addition to the standard conditions of release, the court ordered a series of special conditions. Among other things, the court ordered that Scanzani would be prohibited from \"possess[ing]\" any \"visual depictions of minors or adults engaged in sexually explicit conduct,\" and \"accessing via computer any 'material' that relates to ... possession of child pornography.\" (Conditions of Probation and Supervised Release at 4-5). The court also ordered that he \"shall submit to a search of his/her person or property in a reasonable manner and at a reasonable time by the U.S. Probation Office.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Condition (h) further provided that he\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   shall submit to the U.S. Probation Officer conducting periodic unannounced examinations of [his] person, property, house, residence, vehicles, papers, computer(s), other electronic communication or data storage devices or media, include [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] retrieval and copying of all data from the computer(s) and any internal or external peripherals and effects at any time, with or without warrant by any law enforcement or probation officer with reasonable suspicion concerning unlawful conduct or a violation of a condition of probation or supervised release.

On October 2, 2017, the probation department installed the monitoring software RemoteCOM on his computer. RemoteCOM monitors a user's computer activities and applies specific \"trigger\" words applicable to the user's offense. Once a \"trigger\" word is detected, the system conducts an initial review of the\n   computer activity that may constitute a violation and refers it to the offender's probation officer for further review. A probation officer can also independently review the offender's activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On May 25, 2018, RemoteCOM notified the probation department that monitoring had discovered notable information in the screenshots data field recorded from Scanzani's computer. On June 6, 2018, RemoteCOM provided a report on the activity that it had detected to the probation department. Homeland Security Investigations (\"HSI\") Special Agent Jason Defreitas reviewed the report, which consisted of approximately 34 PDF documents of images from Scanzani's computer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On June 27, 2018, Defreitas submitted an application to Magistrate Judge Cabell for a warrant to search Scanzani's person and home. The application included a supporting affidavit from Defreitas. The affidavit provided background information concerning Scanzani's criminal history and the current investigation. Among other things, Defreitas submitted three photographs from the RemoteCOM report that he opined \"depict[ed] minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct based on the lascivious exhibition of their genitals.\" (Affidavit of Defreitas, \u00b6 5g).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In his affidavit, Defreitas attested that the RemoteCOM report \"consist[ed] of approximately 34 pdf documents containing images from S[canzani]'s computer.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5d). Those documents, Defreitas attested, contained \"screenshots of a narrative story, actively being edited by S[canzani] [that] involv[ed] the sexual molestation of infants, toddlers and young boys.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5e). Defreitas included the first sentence of the story, which read, \"He realized it was absolutely necessary to gain the boy's trust, and begin to form a loving bond with him before he could begin the first stages of total molestation.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The story was apparently written in a distinctive font that Defreitas believed matched the font Scanzani had used in his monthly supervision reports to probation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In addition, Defreitas attested that the report \"contain[ed] numerous images of infants and prepubescent children either fully naked or partially naked with their genitals exposed.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5f). In particular, Defreitas described the three photographs he had submitted to the magistrate judge:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   i. In the file titled CumulativeDetail-34.pdf is an image denoted DSC_0051 of a naked infant boy approximately 1-3 years old with legs spread wide. The photo shows the boy from the mid-torso down, and the focal point of the photo is on the boy's genitals.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   ii. In the file titled CumulativeDetail-33.pdf is an image of a naked boy approximately 3-6 years old standing with one leg and his genitals propped up on a container. The boy is holding a banana.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   iii. In the file titled CumulativeDetail-32.pdf is an image denoted DSC_0008 of a boy approximately 3-6 months old, naked from the waist down lying on his side with his shirt pulled up and his genitals exposed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5fi-iii). After describing the photographs, Defreitas attested that, in his opinion, \"such images depict minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct based on the lascivious exhibition of their genitals.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5g).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The affidavit concluded with extensive information about characteristics common to consumers of child pornography and Defreitas's ultimate conclusion that there was probable cause to believe that evidence, fruits, and instrumentalities of violations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A would be located at Scanzani's residence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Based on the application, Magistrate Judge Cabell issued a warrant to search\n   Scanzani's apartment on June 27, 2018.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The warrant authorized agents to search the \"SUBJECT PREMISES,\" which consisted of \"only Apartment/Unit 1 at 85 Andover Street, Peabody, MA, and any appurtenances to the real property located at 85 Andover Street, Peabody, MA, including the attached garage, and any storage unites and outbuildings thereto.\" (Warrant at 4). The warrant further provided that \"[t]he SUBJECT PREMISES does not include the vacant unit or the other rented unit\" at 85 Andover Street. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The warrant authorized the seizure of \"[a]ll records, in whatever form, and tangible objects that constitute evidence, fruits, or instrumentalities of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A,\" including \"records and tangible objects pertaining\" to \"child pornography and child erotica\" and to \"communications with any other person that relates to the sexual exploitation of children.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6). The warrant also authorized seizure of various types of evidence related to \"computer equipment,\" one of which was \"evidence indicating the computer user's state of mind as it related to the crime under investigation.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On July 3, 2018, agents executed the warrant and seized a cell phone, laptop, USB thumb drive, camera, SD card, and computer from Scanzani's apartment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3). The thumb drive contained images of naked children, including the three images Defreitas had submitted to the magistrate judge. The SD card contained deleted images depicting young children in suggestive poses, some of whom were naked.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   During the search, agents came across an attic at the top of a flight of stairs located outside a door to Scanzani's bedroom. The door to the attic was locked. After telling agents that he had sole control of the attic, Scanzani identified the key to unlock the door. The agents then searched the attic, where they found a handwritten copy of the \"narrative story\" that had been captured on RemoteCOM. Agents also found a second copy of the story on Scanzani's desk in his apartment. That copy had been printed in the same font as the image captured by RemoteCOM and also included handwriting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On August 2, 2018, Scanzani was indicted for possession of child pornography in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(a)(5)(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Analysis\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Scanzani contends (1) that the warrant application did not establish probable cause; (2) that Defreitas \"omitted material information critical to the magistrate's determination of whether to issue the search warrant,\" and that a\n   <em>\n    Franks\n   </em>\n   hearing is necessary to \"determine whether [Defreitas] omitted the information with an intent or reckless disregard to mislead the magistrate\"; (3) that the warrant was unconstitutionally overbroad; (4) that seizure of the physical copies of the narrative story exceeded the scope of the warrant; and (5) that the agents were not authorized to search the attic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Whether the Search Required a Warrant\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The first issue is whether the government was required to obtain a warrant at all, in light of the fact that Scanzani was subject to warrantless searches as a condition of his supervised release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \"To be valid under the Fourth Amendment, a search must be 'reasonable.' \"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Nonetheless, Scanzani contends that the ordinary requirements of the Fourth Amendment still apply, notwithstanding the conditions of supervised release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   First, Scanzani contends that \"[a]fter deciding to pursue and execute a warrant, the government cannot bypass the Fourth Amendment by invoking an alternate source of authorization.\" (Reply Mem. at 11). But it would be an odd, and indeed unfortunate, result if a law enforcement officer's decision to apply for a warrant acted as a waiver of that officer's authority to conduct a warrantless search. Law enforcement officers should be encouraged to seek warrants, particularly in doubtful circumstances. If the rule were as defendant proposes, an officer might decline to seek a warrant in order to avoid a possible waiver, which is hardly a desirable outcome.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   And it is difficult to see what public policy would be served by putting officers in a worse position if they apply for, and obtain, a warrant, than if they had never applied at all.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Second, Scanzani contends that condition (h) is so \"vague\" that he was not put \"on notice of what rights he was forgoing.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). \"[A] condition of supervised release violates due process ... if it \"either forbids or requires the doing of an act in terms so vague that men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Lee\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9374503\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/315/206/#p214\">\n    315 F.3d 206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 214 (3d Cir. 2003). Condition (h) does not forbid Scanzani from doing anything. And to the extent it requires him to do anything, what it requires is not beyond common understanding. It clearly states that he was required to submit to \"examinations\" of his property at any time that a law enforcement officer has \"reasonable suspicion\" that he engaged in \"unlawful conduct\" or violated one of his conditions. Because that requirement is reasonably clear, the condition did not violate his right to due process.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Third, Scanzani appears to contend that even if his conditions of supervised release permitted the search of his apartment, the conditions did not permit agents to seize the physical copy of his narrative story. In particular, he points to the language of condition (h) that any search may \"include the retrieval and copying all data from the computer(s),\" from which he argues that the agents were authorized to seize (or retrieve and copy)\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   data from his computers. That argument, however, misreads condition (h); the condition does not limit what agents were allowed to seize, but rather provides explicitly that agents were permitted (among other things) to retrieve and copy that data. Furthermore, condition (h) makes clear that agents were permitted to search both Scanzani's \"residence\" and \"papers.\" And once the agents did so, and discovered the copies of Scanzani's narrative story, they possessed probable cause sufficient to justify the seizure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Accordingly, because the conditions of Scanzani's release clearly and unambiguously permitted a search of his apartment based on reasonable suspicion of unlawful conduct, and because law enforcement had an objectively reasonable basis to suspect that he possessed child pornography, the search did not require a warrant. In an abundance of caution, however, the Court will address each of his remaining contentions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Whether the Warrant Was Supported By Probable Cause\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Scanzani contends that the search warrant application failed to establish probable cause, and therefore the Court should suppress the evidence obtained pursuant to the search warrant in its entirety. (Def. Mem. at 12). In particular, he contends that the three images Defreitas submitted with his application do not depict \"lascivious exhibition[s] of the anus, genitals, or pubic area of any person\" under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202256\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2256\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2)(A)(v), and that the narrative story mentioned in the affidavit consists of \"protected speech that does not support a finding of probable cause of criminal activity.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \"Probable cause 'is not a high bar.' \"\n   <em>\n    District of Columbia v.

In concluding that the search warrant had not been supported by probable cause, the Tenth Circuit noted \"the danger of assuming that legal conduct\n   <em>\n    standing alone\n   </em>\n   suggests the actor is also inclined to engage in criminal conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4089241\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/813/953/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4089241\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/813/953/\">\n    at 964\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Unlike Scanzani, the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Edwards\n   </em>\n   did not have a prior conviction for possessing child pornography. And the images that were presented to the magistrate judge here were not mere child erotica, but rather child pornography. The narrative story therefore did not \"stand alone\" in the evidentiary calculus. And because a defendant's possession of material involving the sexual molestation of children-even if the material is legal, and regardless of whether the material constitutes child pornography-can have significant probative value, it was entirely appropriate for the magistrate judge to consider the story in making his probable-cause\n   determination.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Supp. 3d at 803\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <em>\n    Tsarnaev\n   </em>\n   , however, was not a case involving a fraud-related crime. There, the warrant in question had provided a list of 13 types of evidence that were authorized to be seized. One item on the list authorized seizure of \"[p]roperty, records, or information related to the state of mind and/or motive of [the defendant and his brother] to undertake the Boston Marathon bombings.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 455. And although the court concluded that the warrant satisfied the particularity requirement, it noted that the \"defendant's argument\" had been \"that some of the enumerated categories, particularly\" items \"8 through 12\" of the warrant-none of which concerned state of mind evidence-were phrased too \"broadly.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 456. It is unclear, therefore, to what extent the court in\n   <em>\n    Tsarnaev\n   </em>\n   even considered the warrant's authorization to seize \"state of mind\" evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Notwithstanding\n   <em>\n    Manafort\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Tsarnaev\n   </em>\n   , the use of the term \"state of mind\" evidence is troubling, and it is far from clear whether the term is sufficiently specific to provide appropriate guidance to the executing agents. With the possible exception of an actual admission by a target, \"state of mind\" evidence is always indirect or circumstantial. And while possession of child pornography or child erotica is clearly evidence of the state of mind of the target, it is much less clear what else would qualify. For example, adult pornography or non-pornographic images of children might qualify, but reasonable persons could also conclude that they do not.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   In any event, it is unnecessary, for present purposes, to conclude whether the \"state of mind\" provision was sufficiently particular. Scanzani contends that if the Court finds the provision vague and overly broad, it should suppress the portions of the story that did not appear in the RemoteCOM screenshots, or any physical copies of the story. But when only part of a warrant is overbroad, suppression may be limited to items seized under those categories and not items seized under the entire warrant.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 457 (citing\n   <em>\n    United States v. Morris\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10516156\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/977/677/#p682\">\n    977 F.2d 677\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 682 (1st Cir. 1992) ). It is unclear under which provision the agents seized the documents in question. But even Scanzani acknowledges that in addition to the \"state of mind\" provision, the agents could have seized the documents under the \"child erotica\" provision of the warrant. And because that provision satisfied the particularity requirement, the seizure of the items under that category was appropriate. Accordingly, even if the \"state of mind\" provision was impermissibly broad (and even assuming a warrantless search were not permitted), suppression of the evidence is not required.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <strong>\n    E.\n    <em>\n     Whether the Warrant Authorized Seizure of the Stories\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Scanzani next contends that the agents' seizure of the physical copies of his narrative story exceeded the scope of the warrant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   First, he contends that the physical copies of the story do not qualify as \"[r]ecords and tangible objects pertaining to ... child erotica,\" because, according to Scanzani, \"child erotica\" is typically understood to mean images and not written words. He cites a number of cases where courts have\n   referred to images of naked children as \"child erotica.\" From this, he contends that the phrase \"generally\" covers only images, and that because the warrant here \"did not provide a more specific definition\" of the phrase, the typical definition should control. (Def. Mot. at 27).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The fact that some cases have referred to photographic images as \"child erotica\" does not mean that written words\n   <em>\n    cannot\n   </em>\n   be child erotica.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Piccininno\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%205492517\">\n    2018 WL 5492517\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (C.G. Ct. Crim. App. Oct. 30, 2018) ;\n   <em>\n    United States v. Gourde\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"81881\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/440/1065/\">\n    440 F.3d 1065\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9th Cir. 2006) ;\n   <em>\n    United States v. Townsend\n   </em>\n   , 649 Fed. App'x. 189 (3d Cir. 2016). Indeed, \"erotica\" itself is commonly defined so as to include the written word; popular dictionaries define erotica as \"literary or artistic works having an erotic theme or quality,\" and \"books, pictures, etc. that produce sexual desire and pleasure.\" Merriam-Webster, www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/erotica; Cambridge English Dictionary, www.dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/erotica.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   In addition, and more importantly, the warrant itself makes clear that agents were authorized to seize \"[a]ll records,\n   <em>\n    in whatever form\n   </em>\n   ... that constitute evidence, fruits, or instrumentalities of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A, including ... [r]ecords and tangible objects pertaining to ... child erotica.\" (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Accordingly, the physical copies of Scanzani's narrative story constituted a \"record pertaining\" to child erotica as provided by the warrant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <strong>\n    F.\n    <em>\n     The Search of the Attic Was Permissible\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Finally, Scanzani contends that the warrant did not authorize the agents to search his attic, and thus the handwritten copy of his narrative story, which agents seized from his attic, should be suppressed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   As noted, the warrant authorized the search of \"only Apartment/Unit 1 at 85 Andover Street, Peabody, MA and any appurtenances to the real property located at 85 Andover Street, Peabody, MA, including the attached garage, and any storage units and outbuildings thereto.\" (Warrant at 4). Scanzani contends that the attic was not an \"appurtenance\" to the property, because it is generally understood that \"appurtenance refers to outer appendages,\" or the \"extension of the exterior of the building.\" (Def. Mot. at 29).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The standard to be applied is one of \"objective reasonableness.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Fagan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4042374\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/577/10/#p13\">\n    577 F.3d 10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 13 (1st Cir. 2009). Therefore, the question is not whether the attic\n   <em>\n    in fact\n   </em>\n   constituted an appurtenance to the property, but rather whether \"the officers executing the warrant [had] an objectively reasonable basis, in light of the known characteristics of the location and the evidence at hand, for concluding\" that it was an appurtenance.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4042374\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/577/10/#p13\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   That inquiry-that is, \"whether a searching officer reasonably could conclude\" that something was \"appurtenant to the premises specified in a particular search warrant necessarily demands close attention to the facts incident to the search in question.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4042374\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/577/10/#p13\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4042374\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/577/10/#p13\">\n    at 14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Although \"each instance is likely to be sui generis,\" the First Circuit has provided some \"helpful guideposts,\" including an area's \"proximity ... to the described premises,\" the \"location's layout and the context-specific relationship between the [area] and the premises,\" and \"extrinsic evidence, including evidence discovered during admittedly valid portions of the search.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4042374\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/577/10/#p13\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Scanzani argues that the attic was \"not close or connected\" to his apartment. But he does not contest the government's description of the stairs to the attic as being\n   located \"just a few steps outside a door to [his] bedroom,\" nor the government's contention that he told agents that he had \"exclusive use and control of the attic\" and that he \"identified on his key ring the key to the attic door, which was at the top of the stairs.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Under the circumstances, the agents executing the warrant had more than a reasonable basis for concluding Scanzani's attic was covered by the warrant. Scanzani has not shown that the agents' conclusion, under the circumstances, was objectively unreasonable. Accordingly, the Court cannot conclude that the search of the attic surpassed the scope of the warrant, and thus it will not suppress the handwritten story seized by the agents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     Conclusion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the motion to suppress is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   <strong>\n    So Ordered.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-97\">\n    Scanzani was convicted under the name \"Scanzini,\" although his true name appears to be \"Scanzani.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-98\">\n    Scanzani's supervision was transferred to the District of Massachusetts on February 14, 2014.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-99\">\n    Scanzani lived in one unit of a multi-level three family home.
