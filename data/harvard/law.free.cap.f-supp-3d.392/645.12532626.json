With respect to the HRA, the West Virginia Supreme Court has not addressed this issue of statutory silence, but would likely reach the same conclusion as the Fourth Circuit, due to its \"longstanding practice of applying the same analytical framework used by the federal courts when deciding cases arising under the W.Va.

The Court disagrees that the clause necessarily forecloses that opportunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The Sixth Circuit already addressed this very issue involving the same provision in\n   <em>\n    Scovill v. WSYX/ABC, Sinclair Broadcast Group, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   and held that it was inappropriate for the district court to find the provision at issue unenforceable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1019. The Sixth Circuit reached this conclusion after relying on the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    PacifiCare Health Sys., Inc. v. Book\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   where the Supreme Court held that, when an arbitration provision is open to interpretation and an arbitrator could interpret it in such a way as to avoid violating the parties' rights, a court should leave that interpretative decision to the arbitrator.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 406-07. The Sixth\n   Circuit found that the arbitration provision at issue in this case is open to interpretation, and an arbitrator could interpret it in such a way as to avoid violating the parties' rights, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   The employer may well have included the provision only to guarantee that the specific disciplinary action the employer imposed would be upheld. For example, the employer may have wanted to ensure that a suspension without pay for thirty (30) days, would not be reduced to a ten (10) day suspension or, that a discharge not be reduced by the arbitrator to suspension without pay. There is nothing in the language of this provision that suggests that it was intended to alter an employee's prima facie case under the ADEA. The language in the provision only requires that the arbitrator uphold the employer's actions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <em>\n    Scovill\n   </em>\n   , 425 F.3d at 1019.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Because the Sixth Circuit believed that \"the arbitrator may interpret this provision in such a way as to avoid infringing upon the Plaintiff's rights,\" it reversed the district court's decision, and held that \"the district court should have left interpretation of this provision to the arbitrator subject to review after arbitration.\"\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Plaintiff does not dispute any of these facts, or that\n   <em>\n    Scovill\n   </em>\n   is directly applicable to this case, but rather argues that the Sixth Circuit's reasoning \"misses the mark.\"\n   <em>\n    See Resp. in Opp. to Def's Mot. to Dismiss\n   </em>\n   , at 11. In support, Plaintiff asserts the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   [The Sixth Circuit's] alternative reading of the standard-augmenting provision has nothing to do with the burden-shifting analytical framework-it bears only upon the relief that can be afforded by the arbitrator. Indeed, at bottom, the [Sixth] Circuit's alternative explanation is that \"[t]he language in the provision only requires that the arbitrator uphold the employer's actions.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   But that jumps way ahead to remedies such as reinstatement, and remedies by definition come\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   a plaintiff has proven his case by showing pretext, which the [Sixth] Circuit acknowledges is prohibited by the standard-augmenting provision.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Pursuant to the plain language of the arbitration clause, if the employer can show that the employee engaged in the alleged conduct then the analysis stops and the employee is not permitted to establish that the employer's alleged legitimate non-discriminatory reason is pretextual.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Based on this argument, the Court believes that it is Plaintiff who \"misses the mark\" on the Sixth Circuit's reasoning. First, Plaintiff claims that \"the [Sixth] Circuit acknowledges [that a plaintiff showing pretext] is prohibited by the standard-augmenting provision,\" but the Sixth Circuit makes no such concession. Second, Plaintiff asserts that, \"[p]ursuant to the plain language of the arbitration clause, if the employer can show that the employee engaged in the alleged conduct then the\n   <em>\n    analysis\n   </em>\n   stops.\" To the contrary, the Sixth Circuit held that the provision at issue may be stating nothing about pretext, and may not actually be a \"standard-augmenting provision.\" Precisely to Plaintiff's point, it is the Sixth Circuit's position that the provision at issue may\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   be referring to remedies or discipline, and may have nothing to do with the burden-shifting analytical framework, or even specifically the ADEA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   After all, the same paragraph\n   also states that the \"Arbitrator shall determine the prevailing party,\" and lays out the allocation of fees.\n   <em>\n    See Agreement\n   </em>\n   , at 9. Thus, it would be entirely consistent for this provision to be interpreted as clarifying that, if Defendant is the prevailing party-\n   <em>\n    after the standard analytical framework for a specific claim is applied\n   </em>\n   -the arbitrator may not alter the specific action of firing Plaintiff merely because the arbitrator finds that he or so would not have done so. This reading of the provision is further supported by the fact that, under the three-part analytical framework of the ADEA, whether Plaintiff actually \"engage[ed] in the conduct complained of\" is completely irrelevant,\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   yet this act is a condition of the arbitrator upholding Defendant's action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Thus, while it is possible that Plaintiff's interpretation of the clause at issue is correct, and that it \"impinges on the arbitrator's analytical process,\" it is also possible that the arbitrator could interpret the clause as only addressing remedies, and find that the employer \"included the provision only to guarantee that the specific disciplinary action the employer imposed would be upheld.\" Therefore, the Court declines to hold that the provision is unenforceable, and will leave the interpretation of this provision to the arbitrator, subject to review after arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Whether the Relief Available Under an HRA or ADEA Claim is Altered\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Finally, Plaintiff argues that the same provision discussed in the preceding section should be unenforceable because it also \"restricts the relief available to Mr. Barach under the HRA and the ADEA.\"\n   <em>\n    See Resp. in Opp. to Def's Mot. to Dismiss\n   </em>\n   , at 11-13. For the same reasons discussed previously, the Court disagrees, declines to hold that the provision is unenforceable, and will leave the interpretation of the provision to the arbitrator, subject to review after arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Severability\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Lastly, Plaintiff implicitly argues that, because the Court finds the fee-shifting provisions unenforceable, the arbitration clause as a\n   <em>\n    whole\n   </em>\n   is unenforceable.\n   <em>\n    See Resp. in Opp. to Def's Mot. to Dismiss\n   </em>\n   , at 4, 7, 11. However, because the employment contains a severability clause,\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   and there is no evidence that the unenforceable fee-shifting provision goes to the \"essence\" of the contract,\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   the appropriate remedy is to sever\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   the fee-shifting provisions, and hold that the remaining clauses are enforceable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Cotton Yarn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5857321\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/505/274/#p288\">\n    505 F.3d at 292\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that, \"if the district court concludes that the [provision] is unenforceable, the district court must then consider whether severance of the ... provisions, rather than invalidation of the arbitration agreements, would be the appropriate remedy.\").
