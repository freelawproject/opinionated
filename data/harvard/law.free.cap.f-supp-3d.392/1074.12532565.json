CHEN, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiff Diva Limousine (\"Diva\"), a licensed provider of livery services in California, brings this putative class action on behalf of providers of pre-arranged ground transportation services against Uber Technologies and its subsidiaries (\"Uber\"). Diva alleges that Uber secures unlawful cost savings by misclassifying its drivers as independent contractors instead of employees. In doing so, Uber takes business and market share from competitors like Diva who operate their businesses in compliance with the law. Diva also alleges that Uber, armed with cash from investors, prices its services below cost in order to drive out competitors. Diva asserts that Uber's actions violate the California Unfair Competition Law (\"UCL\") and the California Unfair Practices Act (\"UPA\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Pending before the Court are Uber's motion to dismiss Diva's First Amended Complaint and Diva's motion for partial summary judgment on the issue of driver misclassification.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket Nos. 33, 113. For the reasons discussed below, Uber's motion to dismiss is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED in part\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    DENIED in part\n   </strong>\n   , and Diva's motion for partial summary judgment is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED without prejudice\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Factual Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The First Amended Complaint alleges the following. Diva is a licensed provider of limousine and chauffeur-driven ground transportation services in California. Docket. No. 106 (\"FAC\") \u00b6 39. Diva maintains affiliate relationships with limousine companies outside of California.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 44. These out-of-state affiliates refer clients who are looking to book rides in California to Diva and receive a fee or commission for the referral.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Uber is a company that \"provides prearranged transportation services for compensation\n   using an online-enabled application or platform.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4. According to Diva, two aspects of Uber's business unlawfully undermine competition and cause harm to Diva. First, \"Uber willfully misclassifies its California drivers as independent contractors\" in violation of the California Labor Code.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 90. Diva alleges that Uber drivers should properly be classified as employees under California law because the drivers are integral to Uber's business and Uber \"controls the precise manner in which the driver delivers Uber's service.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 69, 106 (emphasis removed). By misclassifying its drivers, Uber avoids paying minimum and overtime wages and providing benefits to its drivers as employees, saving it \"a massive amount of money\" and allowing it to lower prices, taking market share from competitors like Diva.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 90, 112, 125.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Second, Uber prices its rides \"at a level that is far below the total average costs attributable to those rides with the purpose of injuring competition.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 129. Because Uber charges less for rides than the costs of providing the rides, it has \"consistently lost massive amounts of money.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 131. Uber is able to continue operating at a loss because of substantial influxes of cash provided by investors.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 147. \"The only rational purpose for Uber subsidizing rides as it has done and continues to do is to drive enough competitors out of business to be able to raise prices down the road.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 146.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   As a result of these practices, since Uber began operating in Los Angeles, Diva has lost corporate and retail client business, and has been compelled by Uber's lower prices not to raise its own rates in line with expenses.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 41-42. It has also received fewer referrals from its out-of-state affiliates.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43. Diva asserts two causes of action: a claim under the UCL, premised on Uber's alleged misclassification of its drivers,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 127, and a claim under the UPA, premised on Uber's alleged loss-leader pricing,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 162-63. Diva seeks injunctive relief under the UCL and damages and injunctive relief under the UPA.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 50, 60.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Diva seeks to certify two classes of Plaintiffs. The UCL class includes \"[a]ll business entities that earned revenue through the provision of pre-arranged limousine or chauffeur-driven ground transportation services for non-shared rides in California from September 10, 2014 to the present.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 47. The UPA class is defined identically, with the exception that the class period runs from September 10, 2015 to the present.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 57.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Procedural Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Diva filed its class action complaint on September 10, 2018.

The UPA expressly exempts two categories of services, articles, or products from its coverage:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   Nothing in this chapter applies:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   (1) To any service, article or product for which rates are established under the jurisdiction of the Public Utilities Commission of this State and sold or furnished by any public utility corporation, or installation and repair services rendered in connection with any services, articles or products.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   (2) To any service, article or product sold or furnished by a publicly owned public utility and upon which the rates would have been established under the jurisdiction of the Public Utilities Commission of this State if such service, article or product had been sold or furnished by a public utility corporation, or installation and repair services rendered in connection with any services, articles or products.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2017024\">\n    Cal.

Their dispute\n   centers on the meaning of the phrase \"for which rates are established under the jurisdiction of the Public Utilities Commission.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   To Uber, this phrase indicates that \"it does not matter\n   <em>\n    who\n   </em>\n   sets the rates, as long as the rates are established\n   <em>\n    under the jurisdiction\n   </em>\n   of the CPUC.\" Mot. at 11 (emphases in original). Diva, on the other hand, interprets the phrase as applying only to rates\n   <em>\n    actually established by\n   </em>\n   the CPUC; it is not enough that the CPUC has the authority to set rates but has not exercised it. Opp. at 8 (\"The narrowly-defined exemption .... only exempts rates that have been established by the CPUC.\").

It is therefore not amenable to the narrow reading Diva advocates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The applicability of \u00a7 17024(1) does not turn on whether the CPUC has actually set rates. As Uber points out, the California Public Utilities Code expressly provides that it is within the CPUC's discretion to regulate public utilities within its jurisdiction, including by setting rates, but that the CPUC is not required to do so in all instances.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20701\">\n    Cal.

First, the dismissal of Diva's UPA claim resolves this issue. As Diva explains, the FAC pleads alternative theories of liability under the UPA and UCL. Opp. at 21-22. The UPA cause of action incorporates only the allegations that pertain to Uber's investor-funded loss-leader pricing, whereas the UCL cause of action incorporates only the allegations that pertain to Uber's driver misclassification.

The FAC alleges that Diva must pay its drivers at least minimum wage ($13 per hour or more in major cities) because they are employees. FAC \u00b6 69. Diva must also bear the cost of overtime wages, work breaks, unemployment insurance, workers' compensation insurance premiums, social security tax, and Medicare tax.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 70-74.

Diva estimates that \"Uber avoids an average of $9.07 an hour in business expenses and employee benefits that it would have to pay if it properly classified drivers as employees.

It contends that the one-way intervention rule does not apply here because the misclassification question raised in its PSJ motion pertains to its UCL class claim, which seeks only injunctive relief as a Rule 23(b)(2) class.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6 50; Docket No. 103 at 2. In contrast to Rule 23(b)(3) classes, which permit class members to out-out of an unfavorable decision and require \"the best notice that is practicable\" to class members, Rule 23(b)(2) class members may not opt out and are only entitled to \"appropriate notice\" directed in the court's discretion. Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(2)(A)-(B). Therefore, some courts have declined to \"apply[ ] the prohibition on one-way intervention to Rule 23(b)(2) class certifications, in which class members may not opt out and therefore make no decision about whether to intervene.\"\n   <em>\n    Gooch v.

While there is less concern that putative class members can engage in one-way intervention in the context of a Rule 23(b)(2) class, asymmetrical risks remain because the named plaintiffs can still hedge their bets by opting not to seek class certification if they receive an unfavorable pre-certification merits ruling. The Court therefore exercises its case management authority to\n   <strong>\n    DENY without prejudice\n   </strong>\n   Diva's PSJ motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ahanchian v.
