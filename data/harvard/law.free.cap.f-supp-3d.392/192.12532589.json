Pet. Writ Habeas Corpus Under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202241\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Pet.\"), ECF No. 1. On June 28, 2019, Respondents Kevin McAleenan, Todd Lyons, Joseph D. McDonald, Jr., and Antone Moniz (collectively, \"Respondents\") moved to dismiss the petition,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Resp'ts' Mot. Dismiss, ECF No. 12; Mem. Supp. Resp't's Mot.

Petitioners opposed Respondents' motions on July 17, 2019, Pet'rs' Mem. Opp'n Resp'ts' Mot. Dismiss Pet. Writ Habeas Corpus (\"Opp'n Mot. Dismiss\"), ECF No. 21; Pet'rs' Mem. Opp'n Resp'ts' Mot.

Putting aside whether res judicata, the abuse of the writ doctrine, or section 2244 of chapter 28 of the United States Code precludes this petition, the Court concludes that Petitioners bring the same substantive claims in this petition as they lodged in a previously dismissed petition.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Pet. Writs Emergency Habeas Corpus, Mandamus &amp; Compl. Decl. &amp; Inj. Relief, Civ. A. No. 18-12232-WGY, ECF No. 1 (D. Mass.

Apr. 18, 2019),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Pet.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   True, the instant petition additionally asserts that Viana belongs to a certified class of plaintiffs eligible to seek provisional unlawful presence waivers,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pet. 19; Order \u00b6 2,\n   <em>\n    Calderon Jimenez\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    McAleenan\n   </em>\n   , Civ. A. No. 18-10225 (May 17, 2019) (Wolf, J.), ECF No. 253. This distinction makes no difference, however, because the Court already decided that Viana lacks even a colorable entitlement to a waiver through that process.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Santos\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20WL%201745187\">\n    2019 WL 1745187\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20212.7\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 212.7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(4)(v) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In adherence to its previous decision, the Court thus GRANTS Respondents' motion to dismiss, ECF No. 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Court nonetheless dismisses the instant petition without prejudice and DENIES Respondents' motion to reconsider, ECF No. 14. In their opposition to Respondents' motion to dismiss, Petitioners point to the Ninth Circuit's recent decision in\n   <em>\n    Thuraissigiam\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    United States Department of Homeland Security\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520260\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/917/1097/\">\n    917 F.3d 1097\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9th Cir. 2019).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp'n Mot. Dismiss 4-6. There, the Ninth Circuit held that Congress violated the Suspension Clause when it stripped federal courts of jurisdiction to consider habeas corpus petitions alleging that immigration authorities did not follow their own procedures and applicable legal standards for reviewing asylum claims raised in expedited removal proceedings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thuraissigiam\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520260\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/917/1097/\">\n    917 F.3d at 1118-19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (declaring application of section 1252(e)(2) of chapter 8 of the United States Code violated the Suspension Clause). Insofar as Petitioners challenge the validity of the expedited removal scheme, their challenge fails because \"an alien seeking initial admission to the United States requests a privilege and has no constitutional rights regarding his application, for the power to admit or exclude aliens is a sovereign prerogative.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Landon\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Plasencia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6190607\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/459/21/#p32\">\n    459 U.S. 21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 32,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6190607\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/459/21/#p32\">\n    103 S.Ct. 321\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6190607\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/459/21/#p32\">\n    74 L.Ed.2d 21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1982) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thuraissigiam\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520260\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/917/1097/\">\n    917 F.3d at 1103, 1112-13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (distinguishing case from\n   <em>\n    Garcia de Rincon\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Dep't of Homeland Sec.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3116906\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/539/1133/#p1141\">\n    539 F.3d 1133\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1141 (9th Cir. 2008), which upheld expedited removal process's limits on habeas corpus review against general due process objections). The\n   <em>\n    Thuraisssigiam\n   </em>\n   decision only holds that section 1252(e) (2)'s limits on habeas corpus review of the expedited removal process suspends the writ of habeas corpus insofar as it fails to provide immigrants with a \"meaningful opportunity\" to show they are entitled to asylum.\n   <em>\n    Thuraissigiam\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520260\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/917/1097/\">\n    917 F.3d at 1110, 1117\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In their opposition, Petitioners suggest -- for the first time -- that Viana had an asylum claim when he first attempted to enter the United States but did not request asylum because he \"was not made\n   aware that he could have raised a valid claim for political asylum due to the imminent threat which his family in Brazil faced due to local gang violence which had targeted them prior to his arrival in 2002.\" Opp'n Mot. Dismiss 5. This claim may fall within the Thuraissigiam decision's ambit because the expedited removal process has long required immigration officers to advise immigrants subject to that process of their right to claim asylum,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    American Immigration Lawyers Association\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Reno\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11679284\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/18/38/#p44\">\n    18 F.

Cir. 2000), but Petitioners only fleetingly allude to this possible ground for relief in their brief, Opp'n Mot. Dismiss 5. Respondents counter with a factual argument -- that \"Viana was not deprived of an opportunity to present an asylum claim.\" Reply 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Consequently, the Court dismisses the petition without prejudice and with leave to file a motion to amend the petition in light of the seriousness of this late-offered allegation. In that motion and proposed amended petition, Petitioners may attempt to support factually and legally their claim to relief based on Viana's supposed unawareness of his right to present an asylum claim. The Court further observes that the\n   <em>\n    Thuraissigiam\n   </em>\n   decision not only created a circuit split with the Third Circuit,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Castro\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    United States Department of Homeland Security\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4355765\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/835/422/\">\n    835 F.3d 422\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3d Cir. 2016), but also the petitioner in\n   <em>\n    Thuraissigiam\n   </em>\n   challenged directly his expedited removal order, not the reinstatement of a final removal order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thuraissigiam\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520260\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/917/1097/\">\n    917 F.3d at 1100, 1111\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Moreover, the Court enters this order having reserved decision on whether res judicata,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   the abuse of the writ doctrine,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   or section 2244(a) of chapter 28 of the United States Code\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   proscribe this second habeas corpus action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-21\">\n    The Court observes that, historically, res judicata did not apply to habeas corpus petitions.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Sanders\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     United States\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716366\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/373/1/#p7\">\n     373 U.S. 1\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 7-8,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716366\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/373/1/#p7\">\n     83 S.Ct. 1068\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716366\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/373/1/#p7\">\n     10 L.Ed.2d 148\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1963).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-22\">\n    The Third Circuit has applied the abuse of the writ doctrine to dismiss a second habeas corpus petition challenging a petitioner's immigration detention.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Zayas\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Immigration and Naturalization Serv.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9301811\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/311/247/#p257\">\n     311 F.3d 247\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 257-58 (3d Cir. 2002) (citing\n    <em>\n     McCleskey\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Zant\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11319331\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/499/467/#p495\">\n     499 U.S. 467\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 495,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11319331\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/499/467/#p495\">\n     111 S.Ct. 1454\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11319331\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/499/467/#p495\">\n     113 L.Ed.2d 517\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1991) ).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-23\">\n    Section 2244(a) states:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n    No circuit or district judge shall be required to entertain an application for a writ of habeas corpus to inquire into the detention of a person pursuant to a judgment of a court of the United States if it appears that the legality of such detention has been determined by a judge or court of the United States on a prior application for a writ of habeas corpus, except as provided in section 2255.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-25\">\n    <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202244\">\n     28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
