The Objections challenge the conclusions reached by Judge Dein in the June Discovery Orders concerning the Oversight Board's invocation of the deliberative process privilege, attorney-client privilege, and work-product doctrine with respect to certain withheld documents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Court has reviewed carefully the June Discovery Orders and all pertinent submissions of the parties. For the reasons stated below, as well as those articulated in this Court's\n   <em>\n    Memorandum Order Regarding Magistrate Judge's May 6, May 15, and May, 2019\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Orders\n   </em>\n   (Docket No. 7695, the \"June 27 Order\"), the Objections are overruled as set forth herein.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    The June 27 Order\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   These Objections follow the\n   <em>\n    Objection of Certain ERS Bondholders to the Magistrate Judge's May 6 and May 15, 2019 Orders on Motions to Compel\n   </em>\n   (Docket Entry No. 7035) and the\n   <em>\n    Reply in Support of Objection of Certain ERS Bondholders to the Magistrate Judge's May 6 and May 15, 2019 Orders on Motions to Compel and Objection to May 30, 2019 Order\n   </em>\n   (Docket Entry No. 7435) (together, the \"Prior Objections\"). In the Prior Objections, the Bondholders challenged Judge Dein's denials of three motions to compel ERS, the Commonwealth, the Puerto Rico Fiscal Agency and Financial Advisory Authority (\"AAFAF\") (ERS, the Commonwealth, and AAFAF, collectively, the \"Government Parties\") to produce documents withheld on the basis of the deliberative process privilege, executive privilege, attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine, and common interest doctrine. In the June 27 Order, this Court overruled the Prior Objections and upheld, as relevant here, Judge Dein's rulings that the Government Parties properly invoked the deliberative process privilege, attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine, and common interest doctrine. The Court assumes the parties' familiarity with the relevant facts and procedural history described in the June 27 Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    The Objections\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In accordance with the discovery schedule established by the\n   <em>\n    Order Granting Urgent Motion to Expedite Consideration of Motion of Certain Secured Creditors of the Employees Retirement System of the Government of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico for Relief from the Automatic Stay\n   </em>\n   (Docket Entry No. 371 in\n   Case No. 17-3566), the Bondholders served a document subpoena on the Oversight Board on March 4, 2019 (the \"Subpoena\"), seeking documents relating to the Stay Relief Motion. (First Objection \u00b6 2.) Following multiple meet-and-confer sessions between the parties and conferences before Judge Dein relating to various objections to the Subpoena raised by the Oversight Board, the Oversight Board served privilege logs upon the Bondholders and the Court on April 29 (the \"April 29 Log\") and May 1, 2019 (the \"May 1 Log\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (First Objection \u00b6 9.) The April 29 Log and the May 1 Log enumerated a total of 335 documents that the Oversight Board withheld under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine, deliberative process privilege, and mediation privilege. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On May 17, 2019, the Bondholders filed the Motion to Compel, which challenged the Oversight Board's invocations of the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine, and deliberative process privilege. On June 6, 2019, Judge Dein granted in part and denied in part the Motion to Compel. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    generally\n   </em>\n   June 6 Order.) With respect to the deliberative process privilege, Judge Dein concluded that (i) the fiscal year 2018 and 2019 Territory Budgets, the April 18, 2018 Fiscal Plan, and potential revisions and corrections to the March 13, 2017, Fiscal Plan were all separate \"decisions\" such that all preceding deliberations are privileged (June 6 Order at 5-6), (ii) the Bondholders had failed to demonstrate a substantial need for the deliberative materials (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-9), and (iii) the Oversight Board had not met its burden of showing that certain withheld factual information was intertwined with privileged deliberative materials (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-12). Judge Dein further held, with regard to entries in the April 29 Log and the May 1 Log citing the attorney-client privilege, that the Oversight Board, in some instances, had not adequately demonstrated that entire withheld documents contained privileged legal advice and, in other instances, did not show that third parties were necessary in order for attorneys to render adequate legal advice. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12-15.) As to the work product doctrine, Judge Dein found, based on the privilege log descriptions, that the Oversight Board had applied work product protection too liberally with respect to certain documents. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15-17.) In view of these deficiencies, Judge Dein directed the Oversight Board to re-review the withheld documents and privilege logs and, as appropriate, either produce any improperly withheld materials or supplement its privilege logs and supporting documentation by June 12, 2019. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12-15, 17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On June 12 and June 13, 2019, the Oversight Board produced a number of previously-withheld documents, as well as a supplemental and amended privilege log (the \"June 12 Log\") and supporting declaration. (First Objection \u00b6 14.) The Oversight Board also produced an additional supplemental and amended privilege log\n   (the \"June 17 Log\") on June 17, 2019. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) That same day, the Bondholders filed the Renewed Motion to Compel asserting that the Oversight Board's document production and privilege logs remained deficient notwithstanding its supplemental submissions. While the Renewed Motion to Compel was still pending, on June 20, the Bondholders filed the First Objection. Shortly thereafter, Judge Dein issued the June 20 Order. Therein, Judge Dein held that the Oversight Board's supplemental submissions established that any disclosure of factual information would also disclose privileged deliberative material. (June 20 Order at 5-6.) With respect to attorney-client privilege, Judge Dein ruled that the revised descriptions demonstrated both that all withheld documents relate to the provision of legal advice and that any third parties included on the legal communications were necessary in order to translate information for a legal purpose. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-11.) Finally, Judge Dein agreed in part with the Bondholders' contention that the Oversight Board had applied the work product doctrine too broadly as to some documents, but nevertheless noted that such materials remained protected from disclosure under the attorney-client privilege and/or the deliberative process privilege. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-12.) Three days after Judge Dein issued the June 20 Order, the Bondholders filed the Second Objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    Standard of Review\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Upon review of a timely objection to a non-dispositive order issued by a magistrate judge, the district judge to whom the case is assigned must consider the objection and modify or set aside any part of the order that \"is clearly erroneous or contrary to law.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n    28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(A) (West 2018);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   Fed.

In the Objections, the Bondholders contend that Judge Dein's rulings in the June Discovery Orders are clearly erroneous and contrary to law because (i) the Oversight Board did not satisfy the requirements of the deliberative process privilege (First Objection \u00b6\u00b6 26-33), (ii) the Oversight Board has waived any deliberative process privilege for materials shared with the Government Parties (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 34-38), and (iii) the Bondholders' need for the materials in question outweighs any harm from disclosure (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 17-25). Additionally, the Bondholders argue that Judge Dein erred in finding that (iv) all of the communications\n   ultimately withheld on attorney-client privilege grounds involved the provision of legal advice (Second Objection \u00b6 17); (v) certain documents shared with third party non-lawyers are privileged (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 18-22), (vi) the crime-fraud exception to the attorney-client privilege does not apply (First Objection \u00b6 40), (vii) the common interest doctrine protects from disclosure withheld materials that had been shared with the Government Parties (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41), and (viii) certain documents qualified for protection as attorney work product (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 42-44).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   As explained in further detail below, the Court incorporates herein by reference the legal findings and conclusions in the June 27 Order that are applicable to the instant Objections. For the reasons that follow and those set forth in the June 27 Order, each of the Bondholders' objections is overruled, and the June Discovery Orders are affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    Deliberative Process Privilege\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \"The deliberative process privilege 'shields from public disclosure confidential inter-agency memoranda on matters of law or policy.' \"\n   <em>\n    Texaco Puerto Rico, Inc. v.

(Second Objection \u00b6\u00b6 9-13.) The Oversight Board's submissions, the Bondholders contend, fail to support its claims that disclosure of the factual information would disclose the deliberative process and that the factual information could not be segregated. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11.) The Bondholders' arguments are unavailing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   As this Court observed in the June 27 Order, the relevant inquiry \"is not merely whether the documents contain factual information-or even whether the document is predominantly comprised of findings of fact-but rather the degree to which the facts are indissolubly linked to the broader analysis.\"\n   <em>\n    Stalcup v.

This question \"hinges on whether the documents were 'prepared to facilitate and inform a final decision or deliberative function entrusted to the agency.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4264307\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/768/65/#p70\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Providence Journal Co. v.

Indeed, Judge Dein evaluated the statements in the\n   <em>\n    Supplemental Declaration of Natalie A. Jaresko in Support of the Financial Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico's Assertions of Privilege\n   </em>\n   (Docket Entry No. 7483-2, the \"Supplemental Jaresko Declaration\"), in conjunction with the June 12 Log and the June 17 Log, and made a factual determination that such statements were sufficient to show that the documents sought by the Bondholders either were themselves deliberative materials or were so intertwined with such materials that disclosing the facts would disclose the protected deliberation. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   June 20 Order at 6 (accepting explanation in the Supplemental Jaresko Declaration that disclosure of email attachments would disclose \"projections or proposals not yet adopted\").).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Having likewise reviewed the Oversight Board's supplemental submissions, this Court finds Judge Dein's conclusions and supporting explanations to be well reasoned and by no means clearly erroneous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Accordingly, the Bondholders' objection to Judge Dein's ruling concerning any factual materials withheld by the Oversight Board is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Documents Created After Certification of the 2017 Fiscal Plan\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The Bondholders also contest Judge Dein's holding that the deliberative process privilege applies to documents created after the Oversight Board certified the Commonwealth Fiscal Plan on March 13, 2017. (First Objection \u00b6\u00b6 26-33.). The gravamen of the Bondholders' assertion here-that materials dated after March 13, 2017, were post-decisional and therefore not eligible for protection under the deliberative process privilege-is the same as that of their argument asserted in Prior Objections. The Court remains unconvinced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \"A document will be considered 'predecisional' if the agency can (i) pinpoint the specific agency decision to which the document correlates, (ii) establish that its author prepared the document for the purpose of assisting the agency official charged with making the agency decision, and (iii) verify that the document precedes, in temporal sequence, the decision to which it relates.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Pharm.

Here, for substantially the same reasons stated in the June 27 Order, it was not clear error for Judge Dein to consider the Fiscal Year 2018 and 2019 Territory Budgets, the April 18, 2019 Fiscal Plan, and potential revisions and corrections to the March 13, 2017 Fiscal Plan to be \"separate decisions\" to which the withheld documents relate for purposes of this privilege analysis. Accordingly, the Court affirms Judge Dein's conclusions that deliberative decisions were made after March 13, 2017, and that the Oversight Board properly withheld all materials reflecting those decisions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Waiver of the Deliberative Process Privilege\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The Bondholders also argue that the Oversight Board waived any deliberative process privilege for materials shared with the Commonwealth, the Commonwealth's advisors, or AAFAF, and that Judge Dein clearly erred in holding otherwise. (First Objection \u00b6\u00b6 34-38.) As they did in the Prior Objections, the Bondholders continue to insist that there can be no common interest among the Oversight Board and any of the Government Parties due to their inherently adverse relationships. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In the June 27 Order, this Court squarely rejected that same argument raised by the Bondholders in the context of the Prior Objections. In doing so, this Court adopted Judge Dein's conclusion that that the Oversight Board and the Government Parties all shared a \"common interest in effective pension reform for the benefit of pensioners and are afforded the deliberative process privilege when acting in a concerted effort toward that goal.\" (June 27 Order at 16 (quoting May 6 Order 3-4).) That reasoning applies equally here. Accordingly, for substantially the same the reasons set forth in the June 27 Order, the Bondholders' argument that the Oversight Board waived the deliberative process privilege is rejected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   D.\n   <em>\n    Substantial Need\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In the Prior Objections, the Bondholders asserted that, even if the deliberative process privilege were to apply, their substantial need for the deliberative materials in the Government Parties' possession outweighed any harm that would result from disclosure. They raise a similar argument here; however, they now also contend that their need for deliberative materials in the Oversight Board's possession is even greater because the Oversight Board was directly responsible for devising a plan to circumvent the Bondholders' property rights. (First Objection \u00b6 25.) The Bondholders' assertions lack merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   As an initial matter, the Bondholders' general arguments concerning their substantial need for the materials in question are rejected for the reasons articulated in the June 27 Order. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   June 27 Order at 17-20.) Further, the Court finds no basis to distinguish between documents in the possession of the Government Entities, on one hand, and documents in the possession of the Oversight Board, on the other hand. Rather, the Court agrees with Judge Dein that the Oversight Board's role in connection with the PayGo system \"does not alter the significance of the sought information to the issues raised by\" the Stay Relief Motion. (June 6 Order at 9.) Whether obtained from the Oversight Board, the Government Parties, or elsewhere, \"evidence of intent to circumvent rights in collateral is, at best, of marginal relevance to the central question\" that would have been considered in connection with the Stay Relief Motion. (June 27 Order at 18.) Accordingly, Judge Dein made no clear error in holding that the Bondholders failed to show a substantial need for the information withheld by the Oversight Board.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <em>\n    Attorney-Client Privilege\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The Court next addresses the Oversight Board's claims of attorney-client privilege. The First Circuit has adopted the following test for determining whether the attorney-client privilege applies:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   (1) Where legal advice of any kind is sought (2) from a professional legal adviser in his capacity as such, (3) the communications relating to that purpose, (4) made in confidence (5) by the client, (6) are at his instance permanently protected\n   (7) from disclosure by himself or by the legal adviser, (8) except the protection be waived.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <em>\n    Cavallaro v.

Under this framework, \"[t]he attorney-client privilege ... safeguard[s] communications between attorney and client, but protects only those communications that are confidential and are made for the purpose of seeking or receiving legal advice.\"\n   <em>\n    Blattman v.

The Court considers each argument in turn below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    The Oversight Board's Invocation of the Attorney-Client Privilege\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The Bondholders assert that, in its response to Judge Dein's directives in the June 6 Order, the Oversight Board failed to substantiate its claim of attorney-client privilege as to 222 documents. (Second Objection \u00b6 17). In respect of these documents, the Bondholders contend that Judge Dein committed clear error \"by finding that inserting general phrases such as 'soliciting legal advice' into the description cloaks the\n   <em>\n    entire communication\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    all attachments\n   </em>\n   with the attorney-client privilege.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) These arguments are misplaced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Judge Dein recognized in the June 20 Order that \"[d]ocuments and segregable parts of documents which do not contain or seek legal advice are not protected by the attorney-client privilege.\" (June 20 Order at 7 (quoting June 6 Order at 13);\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    FM Generator, Inc. v. MTU Onsite Energy Corp.\n   </em>\n   , No. CV 14-14354-DJC,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%208902603\">\n    2016 WL 8902603\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8 (D. Mass. Aug. 25, 2016) (\"An underlying fact or document is not immunized from discovery simply because it has been disclosed to an attorney, especially where ... the attachments themselves do not contain legal advice or any communications between an attorney and a client.\").) Applying this principle, Judge Dein found that the Oversight Board's supplemental submissions sufficiently demonstrated that the attachments or other topics at issue related to legal advice being given. (June 20 Order at 7.) This was not clear error. Indeed, as both Judge Dein and the Oversight Board have pointed out, many of the Bondholders' objections in this regard are predicated on partial quotations of the Oversight Board's privilege log entries. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , June 20 Order at 8; Second Objection \u00b6 17.) Having independently reviewed the Bondholders' privilege logs and declarations, this Court finds no basis to reverse Judge Dein's conclusions on this issue. Accordingly, Judge Dein's ruling concerning the propriety of the Oversight Board's invocation of the attorney-client privilege is upheld.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Documents Shared with Non-Lawyer Third Parties\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The Bondholders also contend that Judge Dein committed clear error in ruling that the Oversight Board properly invoked the attorney-client privilege over\n   documents that it shared with third party, non-lawyer advisors. (Second Objection \u00b6 21.) More specifically, in the Bondholders' view, Judge Dein incorrectly held that the Oversight Board had satisfied the test set forth in\n   <em>\n    Columbia Data Prod., Inc. v. Autonomy Corp.\n   </em>\n   , No. CIV.A. 11-12077-NMG,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%206212898\">\n    2012 WL 6212898\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *15 (D. Mass. Dec. 12, 2012), also known as the\n   <em>\n    Kovel\n   </em>\n   exception to waiver, for determining whether attorney-client privileged material disclosed to a non-lawyer third party will remain protected by the privilege: (i) whether the third party communication was necessary or highly useful for the effective consultation between the lawyer and the client, (ii) whether the third party was serving to translate information between the lawyer and the client, and (iii) whether the third party communication was made for the purpose of rendering legal advice, rather than business advice. (Second Objection \u00b6\u00b6 18-22.) For the following reasons, along with those explained in the June 27 Order, this Court overrules the Bondholders' objections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Here, it was not clearly erroneous for Judge Dein to conclude, based upon her review of the applicable privilege logs and declarations, that the third parties present on various legal communications were necessary to translate information for a legal purpose. Nor did Judge Dein err in acknowledging that \"the Oversight Board's members cannot prepare for litigation and mediation on their own, and furthermore that many of the complex matters in this case require experts to prepare information for counsel's use.\" (June 20 Order at 10.) Rather, Judge Dein reasonably viewed the Oversight Board's submissions against that backdrop. As this Court observed in the June 27 Order, where, as here, \" 'the complexities of modern existence prevent attorneys from effectively handling clients' affairs without the help of others,' the attorney-client 'privilege must include all the persons who act as the attorney's agents.' \"\n   <em>\n    Cavallaro\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9506428\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/284/236/#p245\">\n    284 F.3d at 247\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Therefore, this Court upholds Judge Dein's determinations as to any withheld documents including third party non-lawyers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Crime-Fraud Exception\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The Bondholders argue that Judge Dein erred in rejecting their arguments regarding the crime-fraud exception to the attorney-client privilege. (First Objection \u00b6 40.) The crime-fraud exception applies here, the Bondholders insist, because the Oversight Board \"communicated with others (including AAFAF, a representative of ERS) about the plan to create the PayGo system, the resultant transfer of employer contributions away from ERS to the Commonwealth, and the diversion of the Bondholders' collateral.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Bondholders further postulate that the Oversight Board's privilege log \"concedes that the legal advice sought with respect to [the documents in question] was an unalloyed effort to 'hinder[ ] the enforcement of a security interest' and carry out a fraudulent transfer' in bankruptcy.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    In re Blier Cedar Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6543390\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/10/993/\">\n    10 B.R. 993\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 999-1000 &amp; n.14 (Bankr. D. Me. 1981).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \"The crime-fraud exception ... withdraws protection [under the attorney-client privilege] where the client sought or employed legal representation in order to commit or facilitate a crime or fraud.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Grand Jury Proceedings\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8937056\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/417/18/#p22\">\n    417 F.3d 18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 22 (1st Cir. 2005). To trigger application of this exception, the party seeking to defeat the privilege must \"present evidence ... (1) that the client was engag[ed] in (or was planning) criminal or fraudulent activity when the attorney-client communications took place; and (2)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   that the communications were intended by the client to facilitate or conceal the criminal or fraudulent activity.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8937056\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/417/18/#p22\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citation, internal quotations, and emphasis omitted). In her May 6, 2019,\n   <em>\n    Order on Motions to Compel\n   </em>\n   (Docket Entry No. 6836, the \"May 6 Order\"), Judge Dein rejected the Bondholders' invocation of the crime-fraud exception, finding that the evidence was indicative of the retention of attorneys for the purpose of \"help[ing] with the Commonwealth and/or ERS' reorganization[,]\" and that there is no evidence that any of the attorneys listed on the privilege log \"were employed for an improper purpose.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   (May 6 Order at 8.) This conclusion was neither clearly erroneous nor contrary to law. The Bondholders' contention that the creation of the PayGo structure was a fraudulent transfer in bankruptcy meant to hinder the Bondholders' enforcement of their security interest does not present the requisite prima face showing of criminal or deceptive activity where, as here, the fiscal plan and legislation disclosed the basic structure, cash flow, and economic effects of the reorganization.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In Caesars Entm't Operating Co., Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20Barb.%201145\">\n    15 B 1145\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%207477566\">\n    2016 WL 7477566\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (Bankr.

Similarly, the Oversight Board's consultation with counsel regarding the legal dispute over the legitimacy and ultimate impact of the new structure on the Bondholders' collateral security interest is insufficient to show that advice given in connection with the restructuring was sought and given in furtherance of a crime or fraud.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Grand Jury Proceedings\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8937056\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/417/18/#p22\">\n    417 F.3d at 23-25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (upholding compelled disclosure in context of investigation of perjury);\n   <em>\n    United States v.
