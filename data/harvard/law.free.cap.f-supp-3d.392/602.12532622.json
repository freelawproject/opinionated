It has been preceded by similar lawsuits in United States District Courts in the states\n   of Washington, California, Oregon, and Maine. Now pending before this Court is Baltimore City's Motion for a Preliminary Injunction seeking to prevent the federal government from putting these amended regulations into effect. The City has wisely\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   sought a nationwide injunction. Wisely so, as this Court most respectfully is not inclined to join the cascade of nationwide injunctions issued by United States District Judges across the country with respect to many administrative policies of the federal government. It is not the role of this Court to become involved in these policy questions. Quite simply, the executive branch of government is entitled to deference with respect to its administrative orders. However, the executive branch of government is not entitled to circumvent by administrative order existing laws passed by the United States Congress. When the executive branch seeks to do so, it must be constrained by the federal judiciary.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, for the reasons that follow, a Preliminary Injunction shall be entered in this case enjoining the United States Department of Health and Human Services from implementing these new federal regulations in the State of Maryland until this matter is resolved on the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Specifically, Baltimore City brings a ten-Count Complaint pursuant to the Administrative Procedures Act (\"APA\") against Alex M. Azar II, in his official capacity as the Secretary of Health and Human Services; United States Department of Health and Human Services (\"HHS\"); Diane Foley, M.D., in her official capacity as the Deputy Assistant Secretary, Office of Population Affairs; and Office of Population Affairs (collectively, \"Defendants\" or \"the Government\"). (Compl., ECF No. 1.) Baltimore City challenges the final rule (\"Final Rule\") promulgated on March 4, 2019 by HHS amending the regulations developed to administer Title X of the Public Health Service Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20300\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 300\n   </extracted-citation>\n   to 300a-6, which provides federal funding for family-planning services.

Baltimore City adds that the Separation Requirement also violates the ACA Non-Interference Mandate by creating unreasonable barriers and by impeding timely access to health care services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

(Pl.'s Mot. Mem. 20, ECF No. 11-1.) Baltimore City contends that requiring a referral for prenatal care, even when the client has rejected that option, is coercive and directive, and thus, in direct violation of Congress' mandate. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Baltimore City further asserts that Title X itself is violated for the same reasons, i.e., the Title X statute requires that services be \"strictly voluntary\" and \"never ... coercive.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=84%20Fed.%20Reg.%207731\">\n    84 Fed.

(Defs.' Resp. 18-20, ECF No. 25.) There is, however, no \"silent repeal\" at issue because the nondirective counseling provision is not inconsistent with\n   <em>\n    Rust\n   </em>\n   . The\n   <em>\n    Rust\n   </em>\n   Court did not purport to interpret Section 1008 as requiring directive counseling, but rather, it held that the 1988 rule was one permissible interpretation of Section 1008.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6220676\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/500/173/#p179\">\n    500 U.S. at 184\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6220676\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/500/173/#p179\">\n    111 S.Ct. 1759\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The language of \u00a7 1008-that '[n]one of the funds appropriated under this subchapter shall be used in programs where abortion is a method of family planning'-does not speak directly to the issues of counseling, referral, advocacy, or program integrity.\").

Requiring providers to refer a patient to prenatal health care even when the patient has expressly stated that she does not want prenatal care is coercive, not \"nondirective.\" Requiring providers to provide a referral list that is limited to those that do not provide abortion, even if the client specifically requests an abortion referral, is coercive, not \"nondirective.\" Requiring providers to exclude abortion as one of multiple options available to a client facing an unwanted pregnancy, especially if she has asked about that option, is coercive, not \"nondirective.\" Therefore, Baltimore City is likely to succeed on the merits of its claim that the Final Rule violates the Nondirective Mandate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

This Court need not undertake that analysis at this time in the context of a preliminary injunction. Having found that the Final Rule likely violates provisions of the Affordable Care Act and the Continuing Appropriations Act, the threshold inquiry on the merits has been established. Therefore, it is unnecessary to continue with analysis of the remaining claims. Indeed, Baltimore City does not rely on its constitutional claims to support its request for a preliminary injunction.

The Government argues that there is no imminent threat of irreparable harm because a nationwide injunction has already been issued. However, the Government has also advised this Court that it is appealing the nationwide injunctions and has requested stays of the injunctions pending appeal. Should the stays be granted or the appeals successful, Baltimore City remains at risk and is not a party to the other cases.

In this case, the public interest and balance of equities favors the Plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Baltimore City seeks to avoid potentially costly and harmful public health problems as well as protect the health and welfare of its citizens, especially women. It is in the public interest to continue the existing structure and network of healthcare that Baltimore City currently provides while this Court addresses legal challenges to the Final Rule. On the other hand, should the Government ultimately succeed in this litigation, it will suffer only a delay in implementation of the Final Rule. It is in the public's interest to ensure that government agencies abide by federal laws such as the ACA Non-Interference Mandate and the Appropriations Nondirective Mandate passed by Congress and still binding law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Therefore, the balance of equities and public interest weighs in favor of Baltimore City and the issuance of a preliminary injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Scope of Injunction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Having found that Baltimore City is likely to succeed on the merits of at least some of its claims, it is likely to be irreparably harmed absent an injunction, and the balance of equities and public interest weigh in favor of an injunction, this Court shall issue a preliminary injunction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Baltimore City requests that the injunction be broad enough to protect its interests and asks this Court to issue the injunction against enforcement of the Final Rule in Maryland. Baltimore City notes that it is close in proximity to multiple other States and municipalities whose people make use of its health system. Loss of funding in neighboring states will put pressure on Baltimore's health system, as mobile patients come from neighboring communities to make use of Baltimore's resources.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   As noted above, two other United States District Courts have issued injunctions on a nationwide basis.

This Court further cautions against the danger of nationwide injunctions leading to forum shopping. It is clear that most of the nationwide injunctions issued against the federal government in the past two years have come from United States District Courts in states less favorably inclined politically to the current administration. It is also clear that most of the nationwide injunctions against the federal government in the years before also came from United States District Courts in states less favorably inclined politically to the previous administration. It is important that the federal judiciary not allow itself to become part of \"underlying policy debate.\"\n    <em>\n     Sierra Club v.
