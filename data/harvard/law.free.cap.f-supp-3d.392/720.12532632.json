Specifically, the Indictment alleges that on or about April 25, 2019, Mr. Cruz-Ramos, an undocumented immigrant who had previously been deported from the United States on or about July 24, 2008, was found in the United States again.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On September 17, 1999, the Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\") issued Mr. Cruz-Ramos a Notice to Appear at an\n   immigration hearing.
