Simon, District Judge.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiffs bring this action challenging Defendants' grant of a renewed Grazing Permit (the \"Permit\") to Hammond Ranches, Inc. (\"HRI\") on four allotments-Mud Creek, Hammond, Hammond FFR, and Hardie Summer. Plaintiffs argue that then-Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Defendant Bureau of Land Management (\"BLM\") acted arbitrarily and capriciously in violation of the Administrative Procedures Act (\"APA\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   because they failed to follow the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (\"NEPA\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (\"FLPMA),\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and applicable BLM regulations. Plaintiffs allege that Defendants violated these statutes and regulations when Secretary Zinke ordered that HRI's previous grazing permit be renewed without conducting the analyses required by the FLPMA, BLM regulations, and NEPA, and under the 2015 Oregon Greater Sage-Grouse Approved RMP Amendment (\"GSG-ARMPA\"). Plaintiffs also allege that Defendants violated these statutes when BLM issued a categorical exclusion environmental review and approval (\"CX\") and the approved Permit without performing the required analyses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiffs filed a motion for temporary restraining order (\"TRO\") and preliminary injunction to enjoin grazing on the four allotments. On June 4, 2019, the Court granted Plaintiffs' motion for a TRO and enjoined grazing on the Mud Creek and Hardie Summer allotments through July 2, 2019. The TRO was extended until July 17, 2019 at 5:00 p.m., by the stipulation of the parties. Before the Court is Plaintiffs' amended motion for preliminary injunction, requesting an order enjoining Defendants from allowing turnout and grazing of livestock on the Mud Creek and Hardie Summer allotments until the Court resolves the merits of this case. It is the parties' and the Court's intention to resolve the merits of the case before the 2020 grazing season begins.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   HRI's cattle are currently on the Hammond and Hammond FFR allotments. The cattle have not yet entered the Mud Creek or Hardie Summer allotments. Thus, the requested injunction would not require any cattle be removed from either allotment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendants respond to Plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction primarily by arguing that Plaintiffs have not demonstrated that they will suffer irreparable harm on the Hardie Summer allotment\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   in the absence of preliminary relief. Defendants also argue Plaintiffs fail to show that they are likely to succeed on the merits of their claims and that the balance of the equities and public interest considerations support issuing a preliminary injunction. On June 28 and July 2, 2019, the Court held an evidentiary hearing on Plaintiffs' motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   At the beginning of the hearing on June 28th, Defendants proposed an alternative grazing plan for the Court's consideration. Under this proposed amended grazing plan, there would be no authorized grazing on the Mud Creek allotment except for when the cattle \"quickly and methodically trail through\" to get to the Hardie Summer allotment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   On the Hardie Summer allotment, the pasture known as Fir Creek\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   would be rested, and the remaining pastures would be grazed at a 30 percent utilization standard instead of the 50 percent utilization standard authorized in the Permit. For the reasons discussed below, the Court grants in part Plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction. The Court enjoins any turnout and grazing beyond the amended grazing plan proposed by Defendants at the beginning of the June 28, 2019 hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARDS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

HRI is a family-owned Oregon ranching corporation. Its shareholders are Steven Dwight Hammond, his wife Earlyna Hammond, and his parents Dwight Lincoln Hammond and Susan Hammond, through their Trust. Steven Hammond is the President of HRI, Dwight Hammond is the Vice President, and Earlyna Hammond is the Secretary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   2. HRI began grazing on public BLM lands in 1964. Before the Permit at issue in this case, the most recent permit granted to HRI was Permit No. 3602564, which had a term from March 1, 2004 to February 28, 2014. This permit authorized, for each year: 68 cattle and 471 AUMs on Hammond, from April 1 to October 30; 32 cattle and 32 AUMs on Hammond FFR, from April 1 to April 30; 390 cattle and 590 AUMs on Mud Creek, from May 16 to June 30; and 408 cattle and 407 AUMs on Hardie Summer, from July 1 to September 30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   3. On February 14, 2014, BLM denied HRI's Application for Permit Renewal. BLM explained that under its regulations permit holders and their \"affiliates\" must be in compliance with the rules and regulations issued by the Secretary of the Department of the Interior and the terms and conditions in the permit. BLM found that Steven Hammond and Dwight Hammond were affiliates of HRI. BLM also found that their criminal convictions for intentionally setting fires on public lands violated the regulations prohibiting cutting, burning spraying, destroying, or removing vegetation without authorization and damaging or removing U.S. property without authorization.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=43%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%204140.1\">\n    43 C.F.R. \u00a7 4140.1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

BLM summarized in detail the witness testimony at the criminal trial, and characterized this testimony as demonstrating \"how the Hammonds violated BLM grazing regulations and the terms of [HRI's] grazing permit, endangered the lives of numerous individuals, including firefighters, and altered ecological conditions on public lands.\" BLM described testimony of the Hammonds lighting multiple fires.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   5. Steven Hammond was convicted of two counts, one relating to a 2001 fire and one relating to a 2006 fire. Dwight Hammond was convicted of one count, relating to a 2006 fire. The jury acquitted the Hammonds of several charges. The jury could not reach a verdict on several charges and the judge instructed the jury to continue deliberations on those charges. While the jury was deliberating, the prosecution and defense reached an agreement and the trial ended.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   6. In reaching its final decision in 2014 denying HRI's application to renew Permit No. 3602564, BLM accepted the sworn testimony at trial and, after a \"thorough[ ] review[ ],\" rejected the protest filed by HRI that the sworn testimony was inaccurate or incomplete.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   7. BLM concluded that HRI and its affiliates had an unsatisfactory record of performance. BLM stated: \"The Hammond fire-setting maliciously and knowingly placed public recreationists, firefighters, and BLM range staff at high risk just to further [HRI's] grazing interests.\" BLM also noted that the \"Hammonds set the fires because they disagreed with how BLM managed the land. The Hammonds acted in the interest of improving the rangeland forage for their cattle, but not necessarily for other resources like wildlife habitat.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   8. BLM concluded that each criminal conviction, standing alone or in combination, constitutes an unsatisfactory record of performance. BLM explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   The Hammonds' malicious disregard for human life and public property shows contempt for BLM regulation of public land. The Hammonds' interference with firefighting efforts is antithetical to orderly use of resources. The Hammonds' disregard for orderly and planned prescribed burning that accounts for ecological objectives and human safety is incompatible with the orderly use and improvement of resources. The BLM carefully plans and conducts prescribed burns to meet ecological objectives, such as retaining sagebrush and bitterbrush habitat. By taking matters into their own hands and burning public lands outside of the official BLM process, the Hammonds altered the Burns District's prescribed fire management strategy for years to come. Good stewardship is more than just producing grass for livestock-it requires orderly conduct that protects the multiple objectives of public lands and the lives of those who work and recreate on public lands.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   9. BLM also concluded that the Hammonds' \"additional fire-setting described in the criminal trial,\" outside of their criminal convictions, constituted an unsatisfactory record of performance. BLM found that \"the testimony shows a pattern of intentional fire-setting by Dwight and Steven Hammond-beyond the fires for which they were convicted-demonstrating their callous disregard for human life and BLM multiple use objectives for the land.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   10. HRI appealed BLM's decision and sought a stay of the decision. On April 28, 2014, the Office of Hearings and Appeals (\"OHA\") denied the Hammonds' motion for a stay and BLM's decision went into\n   effect. OHA found that the criminal convictions were sufficient to establish violations of governing regulations. OHA also found that BLM correctly relied on other evidence of \"multiple instances of the Hammonds setting fires to eliminate juniper for the purpose of increasing forage for their cattle\" and held that their \"pattern of starting fires that damage vegetation on public lands and endangers lives is sufficiently serious to warrant permit non-renewal.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   11. HRI appealed the stay denial to the Interior Board of Land Appeals, and it affirmed the denial of the stay. Meanwhile, in the appeal the OHA was considering, the assigned judge was evaluating whether to have the case proceed to summary judgment or directly to a hearing. Industry trade organizations began lobbying then-Secretary of the Interior Zinke and President Donald J. Trump. Between May and November 2018, briefs were filed before the assigned OHA judge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   12. On July 10, 2018, President Trump issued Executive Grants of Clemency, pardoning Steve and Dwight Hammond for their crimes and commuting their sentences. Steve Hammond had served three years of his five-year sentence and Dwight Hammond had served four years of his five-year sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   13. On December 28, 2018, Secretary Zinke exercised his authority to assume jurisdiction over the appeal the OHA was considering. On January 2, 2019, his last day in office, Secretary Zinke issued his decision. He set out the factual and procedural history of the case in slightly more than one page, the applicable law in slightly more than one page, and his analysis in one paragraph. Secretary Zinke's analysis, in its entirety, states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   I find that the pardons constitute unique and important changed circumstances since the BLM made its decision. In light of the Grants of Executive Clemency, the years of imprisonment, and civil damages paid by the Hammonds, I find that it is consistent with the intent of the pardons-and in particular their reflection of the President's judgment as to the seriousness of the Hammonds' offenses-to renew the Hammonds' permit for the duration of the term that would have commenced in 2014. The Hammonds' continuance of grazing will depend on compliance with BLM's grazing regulations. I do not find fault with BLM's assessment of the law and facts in its 2014 Decision and I reiterate BLM's concern for human safety on public lands. The safety of our Nation's firefighters and others working and recreating on public lands remains paramount. I will ask BLM to keep the Office of the Secretary apprised of any permit compliance and human safety issues.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   14. Secretary Zinke concluded his decision by remanding \"the matter to BLM with instructions to renew, within 30 days of the date of this decision, the permit under the same terms and conditions for the balance of the renewal period.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   15. On February 5, 2019, BLM Rangeland Management Specialist Jamie McCormack circulated a memorandum to Burns District Manager Jeffrey Rose. This memorandum noted that Secretary Zinke had directed BLM to renew the Permit under the same terms and conditions as the previous permit. The memorandum stated that BLM had conducted standards and guidelines assessments and evaluations in 2018 on the four allotments, standards were being achieved except the standard relating to species, the failure of that standard was not caused by grazing, and thus the Permit qualified for a CX under the FLPMA, which constitutes compliance\n   with NEPA. Mr. Rose concurred with this conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   16. The CX was dated February 1, 2019, but signed on February 4 and 5, 2019. It concluded that \"the proposed action did not trigger any of the extraordinary circumstances described in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=43%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2046.215\">\n    43 C.F.R. \u00a7 46.215\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\" The CX also concluded that the Permit was \"in conformance with the [land use plans], qualifies as a categorical exclusion, and does not require further NEPA analysis.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   17. On February 13, 2019, Jeffrey Rose of BLM and Steve Hammond of HRI signed the Permit, with an effective date of February 1, 2019 through February 28, 2024.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   18. BLM did not complete an EIS or environmental assessment (\"EA\") analyzing the Permit's proposed grazing on the allotments, or any alternatives. There is no evidence in the record that BLM previously conducted an EA or an EIS with respect to any earlier permits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Plaintiffs' Receipt of Permit and CX\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   19. On January 29, 2019, counsel for Plaintiff Western Watersheds Project (\"Western Watersheds\") noted the media coverage of Secretary Zinke's decision and asked the Department of the Interior and BLM for a copy of that decision. Both agencies provided a copy that same day. BLM noted, however, that they had just received the decision and \"the details of how we will implement this decision have not been finalized.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   20. Plaintiffs requested copies of documents relating to the decision, including a copy of the Permit, and submitted a request under the Freedom of Information Act (\"FOIA\"). On March 25, 2019, Plaintiffs again requested a copy of the Permit, noting that Western Watersheds had not yet received a copy. BLM responded that because Western Watersheds had submitted a FOIA request, the information would be provided under that request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   21. On April 1, 2019, counsel for Western Watersheds responded to BLM, noting that the statutory deadline under FOIA had expired without a response, BLM had indicated it would not provide any response to the FOIA request until May 22, 2019, Western Watersheds believed it had a right to the information as an \"interested party\" under BLM regulations, and it would be a simple matter to email a copy. BLM provided a copy of the Permit and CX to Western Watersheds on April 1, 2019.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   22. Although the Permit authorized grazing to begin on April 1, HRI began grazing on March 25, 2019. No application for different use than is authorized by the Permit, which is required by the Permit before such changed use can begin, was provided to the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   23. The Permit authorized 68 cattle and 471 AUMs on the Hammond allotment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   BLM \"orally\" authorized an increase of up to 490 cattle. No application for different use than is authorized by the Permit, which is required by the Permit before such changed use can begin, was provided to the Court. BLM later realized they had \"miscalculated\" that this number of cattle would comply with the Permit's limitation of 471 AUMs, and thus noted that HRI's total AUMs were in excess of the Permit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   24. BLM issued letters to HRI adjusting the time frame and number of cattle that could be grazed on the Mud Creek\n   and Hardie Summer allotments, in part due to this litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Characteristics of the Allotments\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   25. The Mud Creek allotment is approximately 8,200 acres, all of which is publicly-owned. It contains streams, including Dry Creek and Mud Creek.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   26. The Hardie Summer allotment is approximately 9,800 acres, of which approximately 39 percent is owned by HRI and 61 percent (6,000 acres) is publicly-owned. The allotment is subdivided into five pastures on which the cattle rotate during grazing. The Bridge Creek pasture is publicly-owned, the Cabin pasture is nearly equally owned between BLM and HRI, and the North, Fir Creek, and Sylvies pastures are predominantly owned by HRI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   27. The Hardie Summer allotment also contains five streams, consisting of 3.3 miles of publicly-owned streams with riparian habitat. These streams are: Big Fir Creek, Little Fir Creek, Fish Creek, Lake Creek, and Big Bridge Creek. Big Fir Creek and Little Fir Creek are perennial streams with a significant portion (about half) on public land. Fish Creek is on private land and about 90 percent of Lake Creek is on private land. Big Bridge Creek is an intermittent stream that is mostly on private land. These streams are home to redband trout.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   28. The two allotments lie within the Steens Mountain CMPA. This area was designated by Congress with the purpose \"to conserve, protect, and manage the long-term ecological integrity of Steens Mountain for future and present generations.\" 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 460nnn-12(a). Objectives of this designation include to promote grazing, recreation, historic, and other uses that are sustainable, and to ensure the conservation, protection, and improved management of the ecological, social, and economic environment of the CMPA, including geological, biological, wildlife, riparian, and scenic resources.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=43%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2046.215\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 460nnn-12(b)(2), (4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   29. To assess the effects of this grazing, BLM developed a set of standards to measure the status of the soil, vegetation, riparian areas, and wildlife on the range. The standards are known as the Standards for Rangeland Health.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   30. BLM completed evaluations of Standards for Rangeland Health on the Mud Creek and Hardie Summer allotments in 2007 and 2018. These assessments were performed by an interdisciplinary team consisting of multiple agency specialists. The 2007 evaluation was based on data gathered by interdisciplinary teams in 2006, before the fires that had been set by the Hammonds in August 2006 burned much of the allotments and thus changed their rangeland characteristics.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   31. For the Mud Creek allotment, the 2007 evaluation concluded that the allotment was not meeting two of the five standards, Standard 5 that relates to native species, species listed under the Endangered Species Act (\"ESA\"), or locally important species, and Standard 3 that relates to ecological processes. The 2018 evaluation concluded that the allotment was not meeting Standard 5. The assessment further noted that an Assessment, Inventory, and Monitoring project was initiated in 2016 but sage-grouse habitat determinations could not be completed until the data collection is finished in 2020. Based on available information, BLM found that sage-grouse habitat overall was rated as \"marginal\" because of the lack of sagebrush cover and continuity due to recent fires and juniper encroachment, and the presence of invasive annual grasses. The evaluation found that sage-grouse habitat exists on the allotment and where\n   it does, it is suitable for winter, leking,\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   nesting, and early spring brood rearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   32. For the Hardie Summer allotment, the 2007 evaluation found that all five standards were being met. The 2018 evaluation found that the allotment did not meet Standard 5. The Hardie Summer allotment failed this standard because species composition and diversity had been altered. The assessment noted this alteration was likely caused by juniper encroachment and fire. The assessment also noted that although there were no known sage-grouse leks on the allotment, \"year-round habitat for sage-grouse does occur where sagebrush is present.\" ECF 39-2 at 3. The assessment further noted that an Assessment, Inventory, and Monitoring project was initiated in 2016 but sage-grouse habitat determinations could not be completed until the data collection is finished in 2020. Based on available information, BLM concluded that the allotment offers \"suitable year-round conditions for sage-grouse habitat.\" This habitat was rated \"marginal\" due to the juniper encroachment and the \"infestations of invasive annual grasses within large fire scars adjacent to the allotment.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=43%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2046.215\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   To meet this Standard, BLM recommended reducing juniper, reducing habitat loss, and treating invasive grasses. BLM concluded that grazing was not a causal factor for current habitat conditions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   33. The allotments include Greater Sage-Grouse habitats designated in 2015 as PHMAs and GHMAs. The Mud Creek allotment also includes a sage-grouse breeding ground (\"lek\"), known as the South Bridge Creek lek. Two more leks, known as North Bridge Creek Nos. 1 and 2, lie less than two miles from the Mud Creek, Hammond, and Hammond FFR allotments and within three miles of the Hardie Summer allotment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   34. The Hardie Summer allotment provides year-round habitat for sage-grouse, which are present at least from June to September.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   35. The 2006 fire more likely than not set by the Hammonds burned significant portions of the Mud Creek and Hardie Summer allotments. The Hammonds set the fire to burn brush and shrubs to increase the area for grass to grow for grazing. Because of the 2006 fire, the remaining areas of sagebrush on the Hardie Summer and Mud Creek allotments are of critical importance to sage-grouse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   36. Without active intervention such as planting seedlings, it will take from 50 to 100 years for sagebrush to naturally reestablish in the allotments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   37. Grazing reduces the likelihood that sagebrush will reestablish.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   38. The riparian vegetation on the Hardie Summer allotment is showing signs of recovery after five years without grazing. Willows are regrowing and regaining their natural shape rather than a high browse line from grazing. Willows provide bank stability and overhang hiding cover for fish, are a source of nutrient and insect input critical for trout survival, provide shade necessary to keep stream temperatures low, and are a nesting and insect source for birds. They are, however, palatable to cattle later in the grazing season.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   39. Riparian areas take approximately 20 years to recover from overgrazing and poor management practices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   40. Cattle that graze later in the season, like in the Hardie Summer allotment, are grazing when many grasses have desiccated and it is hot and thus they are drawn to the cooler, greener, riparian areas. Mr. Matthew Obradovich, a BLM employee\n   and one of Defendants' experts who has regularly visited the Hardie Summer allotment, testified that generally by August 1st the grasses and forbs on the allotment are drying and less attractive to cattle and other wildlife.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   41. A single, poorly managed grazing season on Hardie Summer is likely to eliminate the recovery of the vegetation that has grown during the past five years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Sage-Grouse\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   42. The Greater Sage-Grouse is a bird that requires large expanses to meet its seasonal habitat requirements. The loss of habitat from fragmentation decreases the connectivity between seasonal habitats, potentially resulting in the loss of population.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   43. BLM has designated the Greater Sage-Grouse as a \"sensitive\" species. This requires that the \"species be afforded, at a minimum, the same protections as candidate species for listing under the ESA; and provides that BLM Field Office managers are responsible for implementing the policy, including by [e]nsuring actions are evaluated to determine if special status species objectives are being met.\"\n   <em>\n    W.

Idaho Feb. 26, 2009) (quotation marks omitted) (alteration in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   44. The Greater Sage-Grouse requires sagebrush for every part of its life cycle. In spring, nesting and brood-rearing sage-grouse use sagebrush for cover and forage. In summer, sagebrush is used for cover and forage as the birds move from nesting and brood-rearing sites to wetter areas. In the fall and winter, sage-grouse use sagebrush is for food.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   45. Sage-grouse also require tall grasses for cover and forbs for food in spring and during nesting and brood-rearing. Forbs also attract insects that are vital to young chicks. Sage-grouse also rely on the edges of riparian habitats near meadows and stream areas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   46. Non-sagebrush habitat, including tall grasses, can provide Sage-grouse nesting habitat, particularly from April to August.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   47. BLM personnel have seen male and female sage-grouse in the lek on Mud Creek.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   48. BLM personnel noted in June 2018 evaluations of the Bridge Creek and Cabin pastures on the Hardie Summer allotment that sage-grouse use those pastures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   49. Livestock grazing is known to be detrimental for sage-grouse because it reduces the height and density of grasses and forbs. Livestock grazing also increases susceptibility of Wyoming big sagebrush ecosystems to cheatgrass invasion as livestock trample biological soil crusts, suppress native bunchgrasses, and shorten fire-return. Domestic livestock disperse exotic seeds at about two orders of magnitude greater than do native ungulates, further increasing cheatgrass spread. Cheatgrass is highly flammable and suppresses sagebrush initiation and growth.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   50. The areas containing the South Bridge Creek and North Bridge Creek leks burned in the 2006 fire that was more likely than not set by the Hammonds. The number of birds attending the South Bridge Creek lek rebounded after the fire but has again declined. The North Bridge Creek No. 1 lek is no longer active. The North Bridge Creek No. 2 lek has varied in its use, generally around the low teens, with 2019 showing nine males using the lek.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Redband Trout\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   51. BLM has designated redband trout as a \"sensitive species.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   52. Redband trout spawn primarily in spring (March-June) and remain in place until they migrate in fall. They spawn exclusively\n   in flowing waters. Water temperature and stream flow affect migration timing. Juveniles migrate downstream to their ancestral lake or river after one-to-three years in natal areas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   53. Redband trout do best in areas with undercut banks, large woody debris, and overhanging vegetation. A study of redband trout in sagebrush desert basin streams found that abundance increased as habitat criteria such as stream shading, bank cover and stability, fine sediment, and cover for adults increased. The study also found that stream shade in the uppermost 50 meters of a stream would result in the greatest increase in fish density.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   54. Although redband trout are more tolerant of higher stream temperatures than other salmonids, they are still sensitive to water temperature. Their ultimate upper incipient lethal temperature (\"UUILT\") is 26-27\u00b0. Their ideal growth temperature is 13\u00b0. Their optimum temperature is 18\u00b0. They also rely on macroinvertebrate species that are very sensitive to temperature change.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   55. Redband trout suffer sublethal problems at temperatures below the UUILT, including increased prevalence of disease, inability to feed, swim, or avoid predators, impaired growth rates, inability to smolt, alteration of smolt timing, and altered balance of competition with other species.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   56. Water temperatures in Bridge Creek can reach 24\u00b0 on a hot summer day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   57. Livestock grazing is a major source of degradation in the quantity and quality of riparian habitat and habitat for salmonids. Grazing causes streambank damage, removal of riparian vegetation, loss of large woody debris, fine sediment delivery, loss of overhanging banks, increased water temperature, channel widening, shallowing of flow depth, loss of pools, loss of fish cover structures, degradation of spawning habitat, alteration of food base, trampling of redds (spawning beds), and reduced dissolved oxygen in redds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Additional Problems Caused by Grazing\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   58. Grazing late in the season on Hardie Summer occurs when cheatgrass is mostly dried and less palatable to cattle. Exotic crested wheat grass is also less palatable to cattle. Cattle generally find native bunchgrasses more palatable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   59. Grazing to reduce fire intensity requires a reduction in exotic and invasive grasses, but that would require that first the native bunchgrasses and forbs be overgrazed, which is harmful.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   60. When too much grazing is allowed after fire damage, cattle will destroy native vegetation and spread cheatgrass, whereas sagebrush steppe in the absence of grazing is more fire resistant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   61. Livestock grazing has been linked to juniper expansion. Juniper expansion is one of the reasons the allotments failed Standard 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   62. Properly managed grazing, including grazing at a utilization standard that is appropriate for the particular allotment and grazing with consideration to the varying palatability of different forage and the sensitivity and importance, if any, of the riparian zones of a particular allotment, may reduce the harmful effects from grazing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   63. The permitted grazing on Mud Creek and Hardie Summer is likely to cause harm to Greater Sage-Brush habitat and status by: (1) reducing tall grasses and forbs during breeding and nesting season in the allotments; (2) reducing cover for nesting hens and chicks to avoid predation; (3) increasing the spread of cheatgrass; (4) reducing the chances of sagebrush recovery and increasing the chances of juniper expansion; (5) reducing the forage available\n   to nesting hens and chicks; (6) creating habitat fragmentation, including with the SFA south of Steens Mountain; and (7) degrading the riparian areas and wet meadows of the Hardie Summer allotment. Because of the importance of nesting in the months of June through August, some of this harm is likely to be immediate. Additionally, because of the fragile state of the lek on Mud Creek, its connectivity to the surrounding leks, and sensitive status of the Greater Sage-Grouse, harm to the Mud Creek lek is likely to cause irreparable harm to neighboring leks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   64. The permitted grazing is likely to cause harm to redband trout habitat and status by: (1) increasing water temperature; (2) decreasing willows and other shade-providing cover; (3) trampling of redds; (4) causing streambank damage; (5) removing riparian vegetation; and (6) causing loss of large woody debris. Because the permitted grazing in the Hardie Summer allotment is late in the season and cattle will be drawn to riparian areas, this harm will be immediate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   65. Defendants' proposed revised grazing plan that authorizes: (1) no AUMs on the Mud Creek allotment and allows only expeditious trailing through that allotment; (2) resting the Fir Creek pasture on the Hardie Summer allotment; and (3) grazing the remaining Hardie Summer pastures at 30 percent utilization, mitigates the immediate irreparable harm found by the Court arising from the grazing authorized by the Permit. Although Defendants did not quantify what 30 percent utilization equates to in terms of number of cattle, if 50 percent utilization across five pastures allows for 408 cattle, then presumably 30 percent utilization across four pastures would allow for significantly fewer cattle. The Court accepts Defense counsel's representation at the hearing that the proposed \"alternative strategy for grazing in the upcoming season ... would allow for some grazing to go forward in 2019 on Hardie Summer, but much less than what the Plaintiffs are seeking to enjoin.\" When Defense counsel made this representation, he specifically acknowledged that Plaintiffs were only seeking to enjoin grazing on the Mud Creek and Hardie Summer allotments, noting that Plaintiffs \"have now indicated they only seek to have this preliminary injunction address two allotments instead of four, which was the original motion.\" The amended grazing plan therefore mitigates harm to sage-grouse by eliminating nearly all grazing on the Mud Creek allotment and significantly reducing the grazing on the Hardie Summer allotment. It also mitigates the irreparable harm to redband trout by eliminating grazing on a large portion of the Little Fir Creek, and significantly reducing grazing on the remaining pastures. The Court finds persuasive the expert testimony from both Plaintiffs' and Defendants' experts that a 30 percent utilization standard for the four pastures of the Hardie Summer allotment for a single season would not cause irreparable harm to sage-grouse or redband trout.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSIONS OF LAW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

The first problem with this argument is that Secretary Zinke did not find that HRI and its affiliates had a satisfactory record of compliance. To the contrary, Secretary Zinke expressly stated that he found no fault with BLM's 2014 legal and factual findings, which were that HRI and its affiliates did not have a satisfactory record of compliance and thus did not qualify for renewal of the permit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   The second problem with this argument is that a Presidential pardon does not overturn a judgment of conviction, does not clear a person of the underlying conduct of conviction, constitutes a confession of guilt, and does not preclude a government agency from considering the underlying conduct in evaluating permit applications.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nixon v.

Thus the \"current\" grazing management was no grazing and the \"existing\" grazing was none.

OFBF notes that permitting a CX in permit renewals was intended to make the environmental review process more efficient for allotments where the level of complexity of environmental issues is \"negligible\" and that applies in to this CX. This conclusion, however, puts the cart before the horse. The problem with BLM not having conducted an EA or EIS on the allotments, particularly after the 2015 GSG-ARMPA was passed, is that is unknown whether the level of complexity of environmental issues in negligible on these allotments. To the contrary, they have a history of failing at least Standard 5, which indicates that there are environmental concerns.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   In analyzing whether extraordinary circumstances exist, BLM provided brief, conclusory rationale.

Likelihood of Irreparable Harm\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that they are likely to suffer irreparable harm before this case is resolved on the merits if grazing is not enjoined from harm to sage-grouse and redband trout, harm from the procedural violation of Defendants' failure to comply with NEPA, and harm to Plaintiffs' personal interests in the use and enjoyment of the allotments in their ungrazed state. Defendants and OFBF argue that Plaintiffs fail to demonstrate with sufficient likelihood that they will suffer irreparable harm based on the following: (1) the Rangeland Health Evaluations BLM conducted on the allotments; (2) the evidence from Defendants' experts; (3) the history of grazing on the allotments; and (4) the fact that the land can recover from grazing and thus harm is not irreparable. The Court first addresses Defendants' evidence and then considers the harm alleged by Plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

Rangeland Health Evaluations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   BLM's 2018 Rangeland Health Evaluation on the Mud Creek and Hardie Summer\n   allotments concluded that neither met Standard 5 relating to species. According to BLM, these allotments failed the standard because of fire damage, juniper encroachment, and invasive grasses. BLM found that Mud Creek was suitable for sage-grouse leking and brood rearing and that Hardie Summer was had suitable year-round conditions for sage-grouse habitat. The sage-grouse habitat was rated as \"marginal.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   The Rangeland Health Evaluation, however, is not an analysis of harm to species or habitat by the proposed action. Nor is it a comprehensive analysis of the type required by NEPA. The Mud Creek analysis involved a review of only three of the 8,200 acres (0.00036 percent) and the Hardie Summer analysis involved a review of only three of the 6,000 public acres (0.001 percent). The 2018 Hardie Summer and Mud Creek evaluations specifically acknowledged that an Assessment, Inventory, and Monitoring project was ongoing and that the analysis relating to sage-grouse and its habitat required the completion of the collection of data, expected by 2020. The Rangeland Health Evaluations also do not analyze the effects of the grazing authorized in the Permit on redband trout or sage-grouse or their habitat. Rangeland Health Evaluations are not an evaluation of a proposed action, but \"are expressions of the physical and biological condition or degree of function necessary to sustain healthy rangeland ecosystems.\"\n   <em>\n    Standards for Rangeland Health and Guidelines for Livestock Grazing Management for Public Lands Administered by the Bureau of Land Management in the States of Oregon and Washington\n   </em>\n   , at 3 (August 12, 1997).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   Additionally, the Rangeland Health Evaluations did not consider the cumulative impacts of grazing on the four allotments but instead assessed each allotment individually.

Evidence from Defendants' experts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   Defendants' expert Mr. Obradovich relies on the Rangeland Health Evaluations as providing \"a sound basis\" for concluding that the grazing allowed from 2004-2014 was not excessive or improper. As discussed above, these evaluations are not a sufficient basis to conclude that the proposed grazing will not now cause irreparable harm. Mr. Obradovich also opines that because the number of sage-grouse males increased on the leks on Mud Creek between 1995 and 2005, grazing must not be causing harm that led to the reduction in sage-grouse after 2006. This, however,\n   does not take into account the cumulative effect of the harm from the fire in 2006 plus grazing on the allotment after the fire. Mr. Obradovich did not discuss, as Plaintiffs' experts do, how an ecological system that could handle a certain level of grazing before a fire cannot handle that same level of grazing after a fire.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Dyer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%20484438\">\n    2009 WL 484438\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *27 (ordering, when sensitive species including sage-grouse were involved, that after a fire \"BLM must abandon the grazing-as-usual model used in the 2008 authorizations, and modify grazing levels and seasons-of-use in the unburned areas\"). Additionally, as Mr. Obradovich notes, climate change and other ecological factors affect sage-grouse. BLM did not evaluate the proposed grazing in combination with those other factors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   Ms. McCormack also relies on the Rangeland Health Evaluations as \"demonstrate[ing] livestock have been grazing properly over time.\" ECF 22 at 13;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   ECF 40 at 14. She concludes that continuing grazing at the same levels means continuing land management \"that has helped facilitate and allowed for improved riparian areas in these allotments between at least 1980 and 2014.\" ECF 22 at 14;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   ECF 40 at 17. She emphasizes improvements to the riparian areas of the Hammond and Mud Creek allotments, because cattle do not have much access to those areas (unlike in the Hardie Summer riparian areas).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   In their declarations, both of these experts also generally discuss the benefits of \"properly managed\" grazing, but neither analyze what properly managed grazing would be on these particular allotments given their current states-post-fire, with current vegetation levels, with the current status of sage-grouse and redband trout and their habitat, with current climate conditions, and in light of other ecological factors. Defendants' experts discuss the recent historical grazing practice as if that necessarily is a model of what is \"proper\" grazing. Determining proper grazing, however, is what a NEPA analysis is for. It allows BLM to analyze the environmental effects of a proposed action and to consider alternatives to that action. At this point, BLM does not know the environmental effects of the proposed grazing on the allotments as they stand today or alternative levels of grazing because that analysis was not performed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   Ms. Lindsay Davies relies on Proper Functioning Conditioning (\"PFC\") assessments from 1999 and 2006 when grazing was active as supporting that grazing will not harm riparian conditions. Those evaluations, like Rangeland Health Evaluations, are not comprehensive. Indeed, BLM has specifically explained in describing the function of a PFC that it is not intended to evaluate fish habitat. The PFC Technical Reference guide states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-159\">\n   A PFC assessment provides fundamental information regarding the physical function and condition of the riparian area; however, additional information is often needed to obtain a comprehensive assessment of riparian condition. Fish or wildlife habitat and water quality assessments are examples of additional resource assessments that may be needed to characterize overall riparian condition in preparation for subsequent activities. Often these assessments can be done simultaneously with the PFC assessment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   ECF 42-2 at 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   Additionally, the 1999 and 2006 PFCs do not include current conditions such as the effects of climate change and fire. In other words, if the ecological condition of the riparian areas, including stream temperatures, are stressed by factors such as climate change and higher temperatures in\n   recent years, or neighboring areas that have been and have not yet recovered, then adding grazing may cause harm that was not previously present when the earlier assessments were completed. Courts also have questioned the weight that PFC assessments and experts relying on them or their methodology should be given when assessing the status of riparian areas.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Oregon Nat.

This Draft Redband Conservation Plan, however, described the headwater streams as \"close to pristine and capable of supporting a healthy population of redband trout.\" Ms. Davies does not discuss whether grazing on the allotments would affect the \"close to pristine\" streams and if so whether it would affect population of redband trout on the allotments. Additionally, the fact that a population is \"robust\" does not mean that grazing will not negatively affect the population's habitat. Moreover, the draft document discussed the entire population in the relevant region, not the specific population on the streams in the allotments or whether affecting those populations would have a cumulative effect on the populations in the region.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Past grazing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   The fact that there was grazing in the past does not mean that Plaintiffs cannot demonstrate likely irreparable harm. This is so for several reasons. First, there is nothing in the record to indicate that BLM has ever performed an EA or EIS on the proposed grazing, and thus the previous grazing may have been causing irreparable harm to sage-grouse and redband trout without BLM's knowledge. Second, circumstances have changed since the previous grazing, including both climate change causing increased temperatures and the passage of the GSG-ARMPA requiring additional protection for sage-grouse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   <strong>\n    d. Ability of the allotments eventually to recover\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   OFBF argues that because the allotments will eventually recover, including the recovery Plaintiffs argue has been made during the last five years, any harm from grazing is not irreparable. OFBF misinterprets \"irreparable\" harm. Harm is \"irreparable\" when it cannot \"be adequately remedied by money damages and is often permanent or at least of long duration.\"\n   <em>\n    Amoco Prod. Co. v.

Although sagebrush may recover within 50 to 100 years and riparian areas take 20 years to recover, that does not mean that harm to this habitat is not irreparable. Trees can be replanted and will grow and yet logging is regularly found to be irreparable harm.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Connaughton\n   </em>\n   , 752 F.3d at 764 (\"Neither the planting of new seedlings nor the paying of money damages can normally remedy such damage.

Moreover, harm to the redband trout and sage-grouse themselves may also be irreparable harm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

Sage-grouse have been reported by BLM employees on both Mud Creek and Hardie Summer allotments. Both of these allotments failed Standard 5 relating to species.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   The South Bridge Creek lek on the Mud Creek allotment has declined to only two males and the North Bridge Creek leks also have been declining, and one is now unoccupied. Plaintiffs have shown that it is likely that these already fragile populations are exposed to greater risk if grazing is recommenced. Plaintiffs' expert opines that grazing on the Mud Creek allotment will likely lead sage-grouse to abandon the South Bridge Creek lek and it may affect the North Bridge Creek leks as well. Defendants' expert agrees that there is connectivity between the Mud Creek allotment and the surrounding allotment. Thus, harm to this lek is likely to affect neighboring leks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   The U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service recognizes that high grass cover is \"critical for reproductive success\" in sage-grouse and that \"the average nest success for sage-grouse in habitats where sagebrush has not been disturbed is higher than for sage-grouse in disturbed habitats.\" U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife has recognized that high grasses, in and of themselves, can serve as nesting habitat for sage-grouse. Grasses are more important from April through August during a critical nesting time period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   The Mud Creek and Hardie Summer allotments suffer from cheatgrass invasions after the fire. \"Livestock grazing is one vector by which cheatgrass and other invasive weeds are spread into and then displace native vegetation.\"\n   <em>\n    Dyer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%20484438\">\n    2009 WL 484438\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *11 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Blue Mountains Biodiversity Project v.

Braun opines that the added stressor of grazing on the allotments could extirpate the local sage-grouse population, harming connectivity with adjacent, larger sage-grouse populations. Plaintiffs' expert also discusses the importance of the lek located on the Mud Creek allotment, the danger to hens and chicks in June-August that are likely nesting, and the importance of high grasses and forbs to hens and chicks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   Defendants' expert Mr. Obradovich states that he has seen females coming to breed in the lek on the Mud Creek allotment. Defendants' expert notes generally that sage-grouse avoid areas with greater than four percent juniper, although he does not state that any particular area of the Mud Creek allotment has greater than four percent juniper. He also states generally that the nearest \"suitable\" sagebrush for nesting is three miles from the Mud Creek lek. He does not, however, state that he has not observed any nesting on the Mud Creek allotment. High grasses can also provide habitat for nesting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   When Plaintiffs' expert Dr. Braun visited the Hardie Summer allotment, he saw two sage-grouse. BLM employees also reported in June 2018 that sage-grouse use that allotment. The Hardie Summer allotment is of particular importance because it has the \"best\" sage-grouse habitat after the 2006 fire set by the Hammonds. The months of July and August are an important period for rearing sage-grouse young, and livestock disturbance during these months can cause irreparable harm to nests, hens, and chicks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   The Court considers the known damage caused by livestock, risk to nests, hens, and chicks in the next few months, fragile state of the Mud Creek lek, importance of the remaining sage-grouse habitat on the Hardie Summer allotment after the 2006 fire, fact that the allotments contain areas designated as PHMAs and GHMAs, and fact that a single grazing season with too much grazing is likely to eliminate the ecological gains of the last five years on the Hardie Summer allotment. In light of these factors, Plaintiffs have shown likely irreparable harm to sage-grouse and their habitat from the grazing authorized in the Permit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   Plaintiffs fail to meet their burden, however, of showing irreparable harm from a single grazing season under Defendants' amended grazing proposal of a 30 percent utilization standard on the Hardie Summer pastures other than the Fir Creek pasture, which would be rested. Plaintiffs' expert Dr. Braun testified that 30 percent utilization on the Hardie Summer allotment would be \"proper\" and would not cause irreparable harm. All of Defendants' experts who testified at the evidentiary hearing opined that 30 percent utilization (and higher) would not cause irreparable harm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   The only expert to testify that the proposed 30 percent utilization on the Hardie Summer allotment would cause irreparable harm was Plaintiffs' expert Dr. J. Boone Kauffman. After considering all of the testimony and evidence submitted by the parties, the Court finds the evidence more persuasive that one season of 30 percent utilization on the Hardie Summer allotment other than the Fir Creek pasture is not likely to cause irreparable harm to sage-grouse. This is because of the current good condition of much of the allotment, the presence of sagebrush habitat on the allotment that is available to sage-grouse and is not likely to be where the cattle will graze, the reduced level of utilization likely allows for sufficient grasses and forbs for both cattle and sage-grouse, and the reduced level of utilization is less likely to increase the spread of cheatgrass.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Likely Harm to Redband Trout\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   Livestock grazing is known to cause harm to riparian habitat.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   <em>\n    Oregon Wild, v.

Stringham and Plaintiffs' expert Dr. Kauffman both discuss how willow trees in the riparian area currently show a normal growth instead of the \"mushroom shape\" caused by grazing. They disagree over whether the willows were previously affected by grazing and previously had a \"mushroom shape.\" The Court finds the evidence persuasive that the willows were previously affected by grazing. Ms. Stringham relies on the previous PFCs to generally conclude that reintroducing grazing would not negatively affect the ecosystem function gains of the last five years. She does not address the changed circumstances or the fact that PFCs do not analyze fish habitat. As discussed above, the Court does not give much weight to the PFCs because they do not analyze fish habitat or effects on fish species in the same manner as does a NEPA analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   The Court is persuaded by the testimony of Plaintiffs' experts that the riparian areas of the Hardie Summer allotment are likely to face irreparable harm if the permitted grazing is allowed to commence. As discussed above, the assessments conducted by BLM and relied on by Defendants' experts did not address the same issues. In light of the significant harm to riparian habitat that cattle can cause, the sensitive status of redband trout, and the current status of the Hardie Summer allotment's recovery, Plaintiffs have demonstrated a likely irreparable harm to redband trout and their habitat with the permitted grazing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   Plaintiffs have not, however, demonstrated a likely irreparable harm to redband trout and their habitat with the proposed reduced grazing plan. As discussed in the section relating to harm to sage-grouse, the amended grazing plan rests the Fir Creek pasture, which contains a large portion of Little Fir Creek. The remaining four pastures will be grazed at 30 percent utilization, which most of the experts opined will not cause irreparable harm given the current amount of available vegetation on the Hardie Summer allotment. The evidence shows that there is sufficient vegetation to support cattle and not place the riparian zones in jeopardy at the reduced level of grazing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   The Court has some concern, however, with the fact that the grasses and forbs will be dying during the proposed grazing and the riparian areas will become more attractive to cattle. The Court also is concerned with HRI's history of noncompliance, including apparently grazing beyond authorized AUMs, and BLM's recent history of lax enforcement of permit terms with this permittee and changing permit terms on the fly, without proper documentation and without following required procedures, such as what occurred at the beginning of this grazing season on the Hammond allotment. Accordingly, the Court will require BLM to monitor at least once per month of the grazing season (July, August, and September) the actual usage on the Hardie Summer allotment and the condition of a sample of the grazed riparian areas, and to file with the Court within two weeks after the close of the permitted season on the Hardie Summer allotment a report of the findings. Defendants will also be required to file the Actual Grazing Use Reports completed by HRI for the Mud Creek and Hardie Summer allotments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Likely Harm to Plaintiffs' Members' Personal Use and Enjoyment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that their members will suffer irreparable harm in the\n   loss of their personal use and enjoyment of the allotments in their ungrazed state. Defendants do not respond to this allegation. OFBF argues that this harm is\n   <em>\n    de minimus\n   </em>\n   and insufficient to support an injunction because the allotments constitute a small part (39 square miles) of the surrounding 5,125 miles. OFBF does not specify whether that surrounding 5,125 miles is public or private land, and thus whether it would be accessible to Plaintiffs for to view, experience, use, and enjoy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   The Ninth Circuit has held that loss of the ability to view, experience, and use a forested area in its undisturbed state, even though there were significant other forested areas available, sufficed to allege irreparable harm for a preliminary injunction.\n   <em>\n    All. for the Wild Rockies v.

Likely Harm from NEPA Violation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that they have shown a likelihood of irreparable injury from Defendants' alleged violation of NEPA. When a court finds a likelihood of success on the merits of a NEPA claim coupled with likely environmental harm (as the Court finds in this case with grazing at the permitted level), the NEPA violation generally is found to rise to the level of irreparable harm supporting preliminary injunctive relief.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence v.

Thus,\n   <em>\n    when a decision to which NEPA obligations attach is made without the informed environmental consideration that NEPA requires, the harm that NEPA intends to prevent has been suffered\n   </em>\n   .... Moreover, to set aside the agency's action at a later date will not necessarily undo the harm. The agency as well as private parties may well have become committed to the previously chosen course of action, and new information-a new EIS-may bring about a\n   <em>\n    new\n   </em>\n   decision, but it is that much less likely to bring about a\n   <em>\n    different\n   </em>\n   one.

Ms. McCormack does not state that a lack of grazing by HRI in any of the allotments during the time period of a preliminary injunction would increase fire danger. She merely discusses generally that grazing, when \"properly prescribed\" can have beneficial effects and discusses general research indicating that \"[p]roperly managed livestock grazing can decrease risk, size, and severity of wildfires and decrease the risk of post-fire exotic annual grass invasion.\" ECF 40 at 15 (citation omitted). Mr. Obradovich states that \"the\n   <em>\n    potential\n   </em>\n   exists in the absence of grazing for fine fuels such as grasses, both native and invasive annuals,\n   <em>\n    to accumulate over several years\n   </em>\n   of growth to the point where the accumulation\n   <em>\n    becomes\n   </em>\n   a hazard that would readily carry a more intense fire.\" ECF 41 at 8 (emphasis added). Mr. Obradovich's declaration is speculative and describes a risk that might occur in the future, not a risk that is currently present or imminent. At the hearing, Mr. Obradovich's testimony was similarly general in nature and did not describe a currently present or imminent fire danger. Dr. Tamzen Stringham testified that she did not see any cheatgrass on the Hardie Summer allotment and that there is low risk that cheatgrass can become dominate on that allotment based on its ecological characteristics. She expressed no concern about fire danger on that allotment. She testified generally regarding fine fuels and fire risk but not specifically with respect to the Mud Creek (or Hardie Summer) allotment. Her concern regarding the Mud Creek allotment was that without grazing cheatgrass would \"maintain control\" of the allotment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-207\">\n   Defendants' and Harney County's lay witnesses describe general concerns regarding increased fuels from lack of grazing and that this causes an increase in the risk of a \"catastrophic\" fire.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs, however, provide expert testimony that grazing increases the risk of fire by exacerbating the spread of cheatgrass.

Defendants' expert Mr. Obradovich also testified at the hearing that grazing is a vector by which cheatgrass can be spread. Additionally, the significant fire in 2006 (more likely than not set by the Hammonds), occurred after decades of grazing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-208\">\n   Further, BLM specifically found that by denying the permit renewal to HRI, \"the Hammonds will no longer have the economic incentive to burn public land allotments without authorization and endanger people.\" ECF 7-2 at 17. Thus, BLM concluded that not renewing the permit reduced the danger that the Hammonds would set more fires. In any event, the evidence does not show that the claimed increase risk of fire danger is imminent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-209\">\n   Defendants also argue that considering the harm to non-party HRI should result in the Court finding that the public interest factor does not support issuing a preliminary injunction.

Defendants offer no new argument or evidence that persuades the Court to change that analysis.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants simply argue that the harm to HRI is greater with a preliminary injunction than with a TRO. At the TRO stage, however, the Court had analyzed HRI's harm considering the cost of replacement grazing from June 1 through October 30, not the cost of replacing four weeks of grazing (the term of the TRO). The harm to HRI is now\n   <em>\n    less\n   </em>\n   , because HRI has grazed cattle for more than three months at a much higher level of AUMs than authorized in the Permit, due to BLM's \"calculation error.\" Furthermore, limiting the injunction to only grazing above Defendants' alternative proposed grazing plan reduces the potential harm to HRI, because some grazing will be allowed on the Hardie Summer allotment. Moreover, during the previous years when HRI could not graze on federal land, the U.S. Department of Agriculture paid HRI a significant increase in subsidies, indicating that such subsidies may be available to counter the economic harm caused by a reduced ability to graze on federal land. ECF 57-6. For example, from 2010-2013, the last four years of the previous grazing permit, HRI received a total of $84,065 in subsidies. From 2014-2017, the first four years in which the permit was denied, HRI received a total of $587,590 in subsidies, an increase of more than $500,000.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20WL%202372595\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-211\">\n   Harney County expresses concern about the potential public impact on other grazing permittees arising from the legal precedent of enjoining in the \"middle\" of the grazing \"season.\" As the Court discussed in its TRO Opinion, the facts here are unique.\n   <em>\n    W.

Despite repeated requests, Defendants refused to provide Plaintiffs with the Permit and CX until\n   <em>\n    after grazing began.\n   </em>\n   These documents were necessary for Plaintiffs to file a motion for preliminary injunctive relief, particularly given the evidentiary burden on Plaintiffs to obtain such relief. Thus, Plaintiffs were unable to file their motion before the grazing season began due to Defendants' behavior. Denying the motion on the grounds that it was filed after grazing began would reward Defendants for their behavior and may encourage Defendants to repeat this behavior as a strategy to prevail against future motions for preliminary injunctive relief. Additionally, grazing has not yet begun on the Mud Creek and Hardie Summer allotments, and thus grazing is not ongoing (or \"in the middle\") on those allotments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-212\">\n   Harney County also expresses concern that an injunction would exacerbate tensions in the local community regarding federal land management. Harney County notes that these tensions have been heightened by the situation with Hammonds and with \"outsiders\" using that situation in the standoff at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge. Harney County requests that the grazing be allowed to continue so that the community can \"move on.\" Although Harney County's desire to move on from a difficult period is understandable, as noted above courts have long held that there is a strong public interest in having the government comply with governing statutes and regulations. Additionally, if the community is sensitive to federal management of public lands, ensuring that the federal government comply with the governing\n   statutes and regulations is of particular public importance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-213\">\n   Harney County further argues that the economic effect on the community must be considered. The only economic harm asserted, however, is the cost to HRI of finding alternative grazing during the time period of the injunction and moving the cattle from the Hammond and Hammond FFR allotments to that alternative location (instead of moving the cattle to the Mud Creek and Hardie Summer allotments). There are no lost jobs or other community economic harms asserted.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-214\">\n   Some of Defendants' witnesses and\n   <em>\n    amici\n   </em>\n   express concern about the Court permanently enjoining all grazing on the allotments. Such an injunction is not before the Court. The Court is considering a preliminary injunction of limited scope and limited duration, based on likely irreparable harm that has been shown particularly because BLM did not perform the required environmental assessment. The Court expresses no opinion regarding whether if BLM performs the required environmental assessment and follows the applicable statutes and regulations in reviewing and issuing a permit to HRI or any other person to graze cattle on the allotments such grazing could or would be enjoined. Weighing all of the public interest considerations, the Court finds that issuing a preliminary injunction is in the public interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-215\">\n   <strong>\n    E.
