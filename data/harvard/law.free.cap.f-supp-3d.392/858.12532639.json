(Administrative Record (R.) 613-15). She claimed that she became disabled as of April 9, 2009 (R. 613), due to rheumatoid arthritis, COPD, and migraines. (R. 691). Her claim bounced around the administrative review process for nearly a decade. Along the way it was denied, repeatedly, at every level: initial, reconsideration, administrative law judge (ALJ), and appeals council. There were two remands from the Appeals Council, and three denials by two different ALJs. It is that final ALJ's decision, from February 17, 2017, that is before the court for review.

While she alleges she became disabled on April 9, 2019, she also tells us that she quit working for good June 1, 2004, when she was not even 30 years old. (R. 691). Prior to that, she worked just one month in a kitchen preparing food and washing dishes. (R. 701-06); [Dkt. #3, at Page 2/4]. The last time she worked for a full year appears to have been 2001. (R. 638). She receives Medicaid and Link, and is the representative payee for her child and one of her grandchildren for SSI and public assistance from the state. (R. 48-49, 75).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Following three administrative hearings - at which Plaintiff, represented by counsel, testified along with medical and vocational experts - the ALJ determined Plaintiff was not disabled. The ALJ found that Plaintiff had the following severe impairments: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, rheumatoid arthritis, migraine headaches, carpal tunnel syndrome, and obesity. (R. 18). The ALJ embarked on a lengthy summary of the medical evidence and determined that Plaintiff's impairments, either singly or in combination, did not meet or equal a listed impairment assumed to be disabling in the Commissioner's listings. (R. 19-26).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The ALJ then determined that Plaintiff could perform \"sedentary work ... with [these] additional non-exertional limitations\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   - Occasionally lift a maximum of 10 pounds;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   - Frequently lift and/or carry less than 10 pounds;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   - Walk and/or stand for about 2 hours total out of an 8-hour workday;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   - Sit for about 6 hours out of an 8-hour\u00d7 workday; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   - Push and/or pull to include operation of hand/or foot controls with the bilateral upper and lower extremities as restricted by the limitations on lifting and/or carrying subject to:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   Postural limitations were:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   - Never climbing ladders, ropes, or scaffolds;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   - No more than occasional climbing of ramps or stairs; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   - No more than occasional balancing, twisting, stooping, bending, crouching, kneeling, or crawling;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   - Requiring a sit-stand option allowing to stand one to two minutes after sitting for forty-five minutes;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   Manipulative limitations were:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   - No more than occasional reaching overhead with bilateral upper extremities; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   - No more than frequent handling, fingering, and feeling with bilateral hands;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   And\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   Environmental limitations were:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   - Avoiding all exposure to work hazards such as unprotected heights and dangerous moving machinery;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   - Avoiding concentrated exposure to uneven terrain and wet slippery surfaces; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   - Avoiding concentrated exposure to lung irritants, vibrations, temperature extremes, wetness, and humidity.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   (R. 26-27).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The ALJ said that while he found it reasonable to expect that the claimant's medically determinable impairments could cause her alleged symptoms, the claimant's statements concerning the intensity, persistence and limiting effects of these symptoms were \"not\" entirely consistent with the medical evidence and other evidence in the record for reasons explained in this decision. (R. 28). In addition to noting the medical evidence, the ALJ noted several other inconsistencies between Plaintiff's testimony and the record. (R. 27-29). The ALJ then went into depth regarding how plaintiff's RFC finding accounted for each of her limitations to the extent they were credible. (R. 29-30).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Next, the ALJ went through the opinion evidence. He gave some weight to the opinion of the medical expert, but stopped short of according it more than that as the doctor had not reviewed the evidence submitted after the hearing. (R. 30). Similarly, the ALJ rejected the opinion from the medical consultant who reviewed the record before all the evidence had been accumulated. The second reviewing doctor's opinion, based on far more evidence, was given some weight. (R. 30-31).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Next, the ALJ, relying on the testimony of the vocational expert found, that Plaintiff could perform the following jobs that exist in significant numbers in the national economy: call-out operator (45,000 jobs); cutter-paster (22,800 jobs). (R. 32). The ALJ concluded that Plaintiff was not disabled and was not entitled to benefits under the Act. (R. 32-33).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    ARGUMENT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Plaintiff argues that the ALJ's RFC assessment is incomplete because the ALJ\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   failed to account for limitations due to the plaintiff's claimed migraine headaches and side effects of medication. [Dkt. #21, at 7-10]. Plaintiff also finds fault with the ALJ's assessment of her subjective complaints, arguing that the ALJ improperly considered the fact that Plaintiff was able to care for three children, use her cellphone to access sites like Facebook and read books.

Of equal significance is the fact that out of a medical record that is over 1200 pages long and covers the decade from 2006 through 2016 (R. 751-1986), Plaintiff is able to direct the court to just six occasions where she even mentioned migraines to her doctors: October 8, 2007; June 16, 2008; August 24, 2011; June 25, 2012; October 22, 2014; and April 28, 2015.

Nowhere does the ALJ say that some study fails to show that Plaintiff's migraines are severe or frequent. Instead, she points to the stark inconsistency between Plaintiff's\n   <em>\n    claim\n   </em>\n   of crippling migraines two to four times a week and what Plaintiff herself tells us is a ten-year record covering 1200 pages with only four mentions of migraine complaints. If, in fact, her headaches were as frequent and severe as she claimed at the hearing, common sense and human experience - which have a role to play in all cases including Social Security cases - teaches that the plaintiff would have complained regularly and vociferously to her doctors over the decade that is encompassed by her records. Add to that the fact that those mentions include her telling her doctor her migraines are occasional, not four days a\n   week as she told the ALJ. She also admitted to her doctor that her medicine normally works to abate them when they do occasionally arise. \"[D]iscrepancies between the objective evidence and self-reports may suggest symptom exaggeration.\"\n   <em>\n    Jones v.

Thus, it cannot be said that the credibility determination made by the ALJ was erroneous, let alone that it was \"patently wrong.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Many opinions have held that the ALJ may consider a number of factors in weighing a claimant's credibility, including (1) ordinary techniques of credibility evaluation, such as the claimant's reputation for lying, prior inconsistent statements concerning the symptoms, and other testimony by the claimant that appears less than candid; (2) unexplained or inadequately explained failure to seek treatment or to follow a prescribed course of treatment; and (3) the claimant's daily activities.\n   <em>\n    Chaudhry v.

In the Seventh Circuit, the court has said that the Social Security Administration recently announced that it would no longer assess the credibility of an applicant's statements, but would, instead, focus on determining the intensity and persistence of the applicant's symptoms, especially since an assertions of pain often cannot either be credited or rejected on the basis of medical evidence. But no matter how a court explains the ALJ's proper role in making credibility judgments, all are agreed that if the ALJ's credibility finding is supported by substantial evidence, the court may not engage in second-guessing. In this case, the record does not support the plaintiff's claim that she got frequent, debilitating migraines. [Dkt. #21, at 9].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   It is, of course, not conclusive that the plaintiff (or any other witness) was under oath at the hearing. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   discussion\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   ). [Dkt. #21 at 9]. If the administration of the oath were somehow conclusive in Social Security cases, then hearings would be superfluous, and every applicant's testimony would have to be accepted as true. Of course, no such principle exists. Sworn testimony is obviously no guarantee of veracity. Every witness in every case is sworn. Yet, all cannot be \"telling the truth,\" and the rule for which the plaintiff's brief seems to be contending is obviously incorrect. Moreover, it is worth noting that the Plaintiff in this case lied under the penalty of perjury in her\n   <em>\n    in forma pauperis\n   </em>\n   application when she claimed she received no public assistance or welfare of any kind.\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   , at n. 1.

In short, this case proves that testimony is not truthful merely because it was given under oath- although the plaintiff's brief seems to suggest otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Plaintiff also objects to the manner in which the ALJ assessed her allegations. First, she complains that the ALJ ignored her claim that a generalized fatigue and medication side effects cause her to sleep three hours each day. [Dkt. # 21, at 10]. That is simply not true. The ALJ noted the testimony (R. 28), and accounted for it in her RFC finding, accommodating for times when drowsiness could cause Plaintiff to lose focus. (R. 29, 30). The ALJ also questioned whether Plaintiff's claimed 3-hour naps were due to medication, noting that she had testified that she was just\n   tired during the day. (R. 28). Indeed, Plaintiff testified that she napped due to medication at one hearing (R. 223-24) and said she napped simply because she was tired at another. (R. 2009).

In assessing credibility, infrequent treatment or failure to follow a treatment plan can support an adverse credibility finding where the claimant does not have a good reason for the failure or infrequency of treatment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   We disagree with Plaintiff when she insists that the ALJ ought not to have concluded she was able to adequately care for three children when her testimony indicated that she struggled to do so. Quite apart from the fact that an ALJ need not uncritically accept the assertions of a Social Security applicant, a more careful reading of the ALJ's Opinion shows that the ALJ was, once again, pointing out significant incongruities in Plaintiff's allegations. Plaintiff testified that she was crippled by headaches two to four times a week, debilitated by arthritis flares two to three times a week, and could do nothing when either happened. At such times, according to her, she could not send the children to school and thus called the school and said they would not be going. The ALJ said, rightfully so, that it was unlikely that the school system and state agencies would silently tolerate children being absent from school multiple times a week on such a frequent basis. That is a common sense judgment the ALJ could make, and common sense and human experience are valuable tools in all cases for judging credibility.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Social Security cases\n   are not an exception to this fundamental principle of adjudication and of credibility determination.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rice v.

We cannot say the ALJ was out of line to wonder, if one claims she cannot send the children to school because she cannot button a button, why bother with the phone and Facebook at all? But, in any event, and of greater significance, there is also objective evidence to show the alleged symptoms in plaintiff's hands were not as bad as she claimed. As the ALJ noted, examinations revealed normal grip strength, reflexes and sensation. (R. 21). Moreover, one of the jobs the vocational expert and, by extension, the ALJ found Plaintiff could do was call-out operator which requires only occasional manipulation or fingering.
