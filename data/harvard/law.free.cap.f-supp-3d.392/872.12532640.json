PALLMEYER, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Defendants Dmitry Firtash and Andras Knopp were indicted in 2013 on charges\n   that they made use of United States financial institutions to bribe Indian public officials. Allegedly, these bribes were intended to secure approvals for a mining project in India (hereinafter \"the Project\"), many products of which would then be sold to a company headquartered in Chicago. Neither Defendant has appeared in court to answer these charges. Firtash, a Ukrainian citizen, currently resides in Austria, where extradition proceedings are pending. Knopp, a Hungarian citizen, currently resides in Russia, with which the United States has no extradition agreement. Defendants move to dismiss the Indictment on several bases: (1) that the court lacks venue, (2) that the Indictment fails to state an offense, and (3) that prosecution would violate their rights under the Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause. For the reasons stated herein, Defendants' motions are denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. The Allegations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   At the heart of this case is the proposed sale of titanium sponge to an American company headquartered in Chicago. Titanium is an abundant element present in a variety of minerals, including ilmenite,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   which can be found along the Indian coastline.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mining in India requires certain licenses, however, which must be approved by the Indian central and local governments. (Indictment [2] at 3.) In this case, the United States has charged six Defendants, including Firtash and Knopp, with conspiring to obtain these licenses by bribing two Indian public officials: Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy, Chief Minister of the State of Andhra Pradesh;\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and K.V.P. Ramachandra Rao, a state official and close advisor to Reddy. (Indictment [2] at 2, 6.) According to the government, Defendants and their associates aimed to obtain a profit by processing this ilmenite into a product known as \"titanium sponge\" and then selling it to a United States company (\"Company A\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3.) A memorandum of agreement was allegedly signed to provide Company A with five to twelve million pounds of titanium sponge annually. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In connection with the Project, Defendants Firtash and Knopp allegedly worked with at least four co-conspirators: Suren Gevorgyan, Gajendra Lal, Periyasamy Sunderalingam, and K.V.P. Ramachandra Rao. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1, 5). All four are named as co-defendants and remain at large. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1.) Firtash is alleged to have been the leader of this group. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5, 6-7.) In this capacity, he is alleged to have met with Indian public officials to discuss the Project, authorized the payment of bribes to Indian public officials, and directed subordinates, including Knopp, to carry out the logistics of paying those bribes. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-7.) Knopp, too, is alleged to have \"occupied a supervisory role.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) He allegedly met with Indian public officials and directed the activities of co-conspirators. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Additionally, Knopp is alleged to have met personally\n   with representatives of Company A to discuss the sale of titanium products. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Much of the relevant conduct is alleged to have taken place abroad, although several allegations against Firtash, Knopp, and their purported co-conspirators involve the United States. For example, several co-conspirators allegedly attended meetings with representatives of Company A, which is incorporated in Delaware and has its principal executive offices in Chicago, Illinois. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.). Two of these meetings, purportedly attended by Gevorgyan, allegedly took place in Seattle, Washington. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17.) Another named co-conspirator, Lal, allegedly traveled interstate at least five times in June, July, and August 2009. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17-18.) The alleged purpose of one of these trips, from Greensboro, North Carolina to Flushing, New York on July 14, 2009, was to solicit the participation of another company (\"Company D\") in the Project. Additionally, an unidentified co-conspirator allegedly used a cellphone located in Chicago, Illinois to discuss that conspirator's activities related to the project and \"direct future activity.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19.) Finally, United States financial institutions were allegedly utilized to transfer several million dollars of bribe payments before they reached Indian public officials. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II. The Indictment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On June 30, 2013, the government filed a five-count indictment against the six alleged conspirators, including Firtash and Knopp. (Indictment [2] at 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Count One charges a conspiracy to violate the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (\"RICO\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201962\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-19.) It alleges that the six alleged conspirators, acting as a criminal enterprise, conspired to engage in racketeering activity. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-11.) Specifically, the Indictment charges that in planning to bribe Indian public officials, the enterprise conspired to engage in acts that would violate two federal statutes: the Money Laundering Control Act (the \"MLCA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201956\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which criminalizes the laundering of monetary instruments, and the Travel Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201952\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1952\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which criminalizes travel from one state to another to promote or facilitate unlawful activity. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Count Two charges a conspiracy to violate the MLCA that relates to the same conduct, and Counts Three and Four charge conspiracy and aiding and abetting Travel Act violations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20-23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Count Five charges Firtash, Knopp, Gevorgyan, Lal, and Sunderalingam with conspiracy and with aiding and abetting a violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \"FCPA\"), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 78dd-2(a) and 78dd-3(a), which criminalizes the payment of money by a \"domestic concern\" to a \"foreign official\" for the purpose of influencing an official act. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24-27.) It alleges that Lal, a permanent resident of the United States, was a \"domestic concern\" within the meaning of the FCPA,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   and that the targets of bribery, Rao and Reddy, were both \"foreign officials\" under the Act. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5, 24.) In summary, the factual allegation is that Firtash, Knopp, and others conspired to influence the decision-making of foreign public officials through the payment of bribes, and that this would be done using instruments of interstate commerce and while in the territory of the United States. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25-27.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Notably, the Indictment does not allege that Firtash or Knopp were ever physically present in the United States, either in connection with or unrelated to the Project. The government has since alleged that it has evidence showing Knopp took an act to further the conspiracy while he was physically present in the United States, although it has not specified what this act was. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gov't's Resp. [40] at 79 n.40; Gov't's 2nd Supp. Resp. [70] at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Post-Indictment Proceedings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Neither Firtash, Knopp, nor any other Defendant has appeared before this court since the filing of the Indictment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On March 12, 2014, Firtash was arrested in Vienna by Austrian law enforcement on request of the United States. (Gov't's Resp. [40] at 5.) He was released on bond several days later, but barred from leaving Austria. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The United States thereafter submitted a request to the Republic of Austria to extradite Firtash, which was denied by the Vienna Regional Court for Criminal Matters on April 30, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.) The Austrian government appealed this decision to the Vienna Higher Regional Court, which reversed the decision of the lower court on February 21, 2017, ordering Firtash be extradited to the United States. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Firtash submitted a writ to the Austrian Supreme Court requesting a \"retrial.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Webb Letter 1 [56] at 1.) On December 12, 2017, the Austrian Supreme Court stayed Firtash's extradition pending its decision on Firtash's writ. That decision was itself delayed pending a ruling by the Court of Justice of the European Union (the \"CJEU\") on whether the EU Charter on Human Rights applies to Firtash's appeal. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.) On October 24, 2018, the CJEU issued its ruling.

(Firtash MTD [24].) On May 15, 2017, Knopp joined Firtash's motion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Knopp MTD [30].)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

XI; FED. R. CRIM. P. 18. Except in cases where Congress has \"specifically defined where a crime should be deemed to have occurred,\" courts determine whether venue is proper by considering \"the nature of the crime alleged and the location of the act or acts constituting it.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

This \"substantial contacts\" approach is not a rigid test, but rather a \"general guide\" that courts follow to ensure that \"a particular jurisdiction can serve as the venue for a federal criminal trial in a manner consistent with the guarantees of the constitutional venue provisions.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

It does so, describing a conspiracy to, by illegal means, obtain and sell five to twelve million pounds of titanium sponge to Company A, a company with its principal place of business in Chicago, Illinois. (Indictment [2] at 3). The completion of this transaction was the object of each of the crimes charged: the alleged RICO conspiracy, the alleged conspiracy to violate the MLCA, the alleged conspiracy and aiding and abetting Travel Act violations, and the alleged conspiracy to violate the FCPA, are all alleged to have been aimed at the end of ultimately completing the transaction with Company A. This is sufficient for the government to meet its burden.

They cite a concurring opinion from\n   <em>\n    Andrews v. United States\n   </em>\n   , in which Judge Cudahy wrote that \"[i]t would seem ... to violate basic concepts of criminal responsibility and due process to deem a crime committed at places unknown to the defendant, places the very existence of which he may not have had any reason to suspect.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1671009\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/817/1277/#p1282\">\n    817 F.2d 1277\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1282 (7th Cir. 1987).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   This argument fails for multiple reasons.

Moreover, the application of such a test would not necessarily preclude a finding of venue in this case. Surely, Firtash and Knopp's alleged participation in the conspiracy-which included receiving status reports from subordinates-suffices to suggest that they were aware that the object of the conspiracy was to sell titanium products to Company A, and that Company A had its principal executive offices in Chicago, Illinois.

Defendants first contend that the\n   <em>\n    RJR Nabisco\n   </em>\n   Court's comment on the effect of its holding on foreign enterprises-that for such an enterprise to fall within RICO's purview, it \"must engage in, or affect in some significant way, commerce directly involving the United States\"-applies without modification to RICO conspiracy cases. Defendants therefore argue that the Indictment is insufficient in that it \"does not set forth sufficient facts to establish an enterprise significantly affecting United States commerce.\" (Firtash MTD at 9-10.) But this appears to be an overstatement of the Court's holding in\n   <em>\n    RJR Nabisco\n   </em>\n   ; as discussed above, the Court there explicitly reserved judgment on the extraterritorial application of \u00a7 1962(d). Indeed, the segment of the opinion to which Defendants refer is a discussion of RICO's substantive provisions, \u00a7\u00a7 1962(a) - (c), which expressly \"require[ ] proof of an enterprise that is 'engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201962\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201962\">\n    at 2105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting 18 U.S.C. 1962(a) - (c) ). No such language appears in \u00a7 1962(d), which criminalizes conspiracy to violate one of the substantive provisions, and thus only requires proof \"[t]hat the activities of [the enterprise]\n   <em>\n    would affect\n   </em>\n   interstate commerce.\" PATTERN CRIMINAL JURY INSTRUCTIONS OF THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT 549 (2017) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In essence, Defendants are arguing that \u00a7 1962(d) should cease to be read as a conspiracy statute when applied extraterritorially, and instead should be interpreted\n   to criminalize only activity that has already had its intended effect on U.S. commerce. That result is not compelled by\n   <em>\n    RJR Nabisco\n   </em>\n   , however, and is inconsistent with decades of Supreme Court precedent holding that an agreement to commit an unlawful act \"is 'a distinct evil,' which 'may exist and be punished whether or not the substantive crime ensues.' \"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Consistent with this principle, the Court's holding in\n   <em>\n    RJR Nabisco\n   </em>\n   , and the express language of \u00a7 1962(d), this court finds that the RICO conspiracy statute does not require proof that Defendants \"engage[d] in, or affect[ed] in some significant way, commerce directly involving the United States\"-only that Defendants\n   <em>\n    conspired to do so.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Additionally, Defendants' contention that the facts alleged in the Indictment are not sufficient to establish the necessary connection to United States commerce misstates the standard to which indictments are held upon a motion to dismiss. \"A motion to dismiss is not intended to be a 'summary trial of the evidence.'

It exhaustively lays out the nature of the grand jury's finding that Defendants were members of a \"criminal organization\" that \"was engaged in, and the activities of which affected, interstate commerce.\" (Indictment [2] at 5.) It alleges that this criminal organization used \"facilities of interstate and foreign commerce to coordinate, plan, facilitate, and promote the bribery of Indian public officials,\" and that its members \"travel[ed] in interstate and foreign commerce to further the goals of the criminal enterprise.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.) And it details that this enterprise allegedly conspired to illegally obtain and then sell five to twelve million pounds of titanium sponge to a company headquartered in the United States.

Specifically, Defendants argue that the relevant conduct is strictly extraterritorial and not indictable under either the MLCA or the Travel Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The Seventh Circuit has held, however, that indictments charging RICO conspiracy need not even list predicate acts, stressing that the \"outer boundary\" of what is sufficient would be, for instance, a \"mere allegation of 'various acts of bribery.' \"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Based on\n   <em>\n    Glecier\n   </em>\n   , the government contends that Defendants' point\n   is moot at this stage: if the indictment would be sufficient absent any predicate acts, they argue, the inclusion of legally deficient predicate acts cannot warrant pre-trial dismissal. (Gov't's Response at 52-53.) Defendants respond that the general test for sufficiency does not apply where, as here, an Indictment raises extraterritoriality concerns. (Def. Reply at 19.) Putting this issue aside, however, the court declines to dismiss the RICO charge on this ground, because the MLCA has extraterritorial application to the conduct alleged here, and the Travel Act violation charged in the indictment is not extraterritorial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

(Indictment [2] at 20.) The government has proffered that these allegations will be proven through evidence that \"millions of dollars in bribe money was funneled through United States financial institutions, at times acting in their capacity as correspondent banks, in order to make bribe payments to Indian public officials.\" (Gov't's Resp. [40] at 53.) Additionally, the government proffers that evidence at trial will show that money was transferred into the United States to reimburse a co-conspirator operating within U.S. territory, and that \"other transfers were destined for the benefit of third parties located within the United States who were designated as third-party beneficiaries of the bribes paid.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) These allegations suffice to charge criminal conduct that falls within the extraterritorial reach of the MLCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   In challenging this conclusion, Defendants cite a February 16, 2017 letter from the prosecutors (the \"USAO\") to the Republic of Austria Federal Ministry of Justice, in which the government presented it its basis for asserting jurisdiction in the United States. As Defendants read that letter, the government asserts extraterritorial jurisdiction based solely on the transfer of funds from a foreign country to another foreign country through a correspondent bank in the United States. (Firtash MTD [24] at 11-12.) Defendants argue that such transactions do not amount to conduct occurring within the United States under Section 1956(f), and therefore that the MLCA does not reach Defendants' conduct.

Because the Indictment does not specify that the government's proof is limited to correspondent bank transactions-and, indeed, the government has proffered that its proof is not so limited-Defendants are effectively challenging the government's ability to prove its case.

First, they list types of activity that did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   occur in the United States: no meetings with Indian officials took place in the United States, none of the project's mining operations took place in the United States, and the government makes no allegations that \"the titanium sponge meant for sale to Company A was improperly priced based on the alleged bribery scheme.\" (Dfs.' Joint Reply [47] at 38.) That many events did not happen in the United States does not alter the fact that a substantial part of the conspiratorial activity\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   take place in the United States. Defendants also argue that Mr. Lal's enterprise-related activity in the United States was \"incidental[ ] because he resided there,\" and that it should therefore not be considered \"substantial criminal activity in the United States.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 39.) Defendants have offered no authority to support the notion that Defendant Lal's residence in the United States militates against prosecuting acts in which he was involved. Thus, the court finds that substantial conduct of the conspiracy occurred in the United States. This subjects the Defendants to this court's jurisdiction, in accordance with their presumed due process rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Though the court need not reach this ground, this prosecution also satisfies the Fifth Amendment's due process requirements under Restatement \u00a7 402(1)(c)-providing for laws that proscribe conduct outside of a nation's territory when that conduct \"has or is intended to have substantial effect within its territory.\" This is also called the objective territorial theory of international law.\n   <em>\n    Hijazi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3781476\" index=\"184\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/845/874/#p883\">\n    845 F.

The government alleges that \"[i]n or around February 2007, Company A entered into a memorandum of agreement with Ostchem Holding AG, by and through Bothli Trade AG,\" a company over which Firtash exercised control. (Indictment [2] at 3.) \"The agreement specified that the parties would work towards entering a supply agreement whereby Bothli Trade AG would supply 5,000,000 to 12,000,000 pounds of titanium sponge to Company A on an annual basis. The titanium sponge to be supplied to Company A was to be derived from the project\" in India. (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3781476\" index=\"185\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/845/874/#p883\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) Members of the conspiracy also allegedly met with officers of Company A in the U.S. multiple times; travelled to, from, and within the United States; gave orders and directions from within the United States; and transferred money to, from, and through the United States. These efforts to introduce a product, derived from the illegal bribery of foreign\n   officials, into the United States market constitutes, at minimum, an intent to have a substantial effect within U.S. territory.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 403(1)(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   The Defendants claim that, because the agreement with Company A never resulted in an actual purchase, it is insufficient to constitute conduct that had or was intended to have a substantial effect in the United States. Again, the court disagrees. Section 402(1)(c) only requires that behavior be\n   <em>\n    intended\n   </em>\n   to have a substantial effect within the United States. Defendants also argue that if their \"minor incidental 'connections' to the United States could serve as the basis of jurisdiction, almost any business transaction could, rendering ... the presumption against United States jurisdiction voice by the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Microsoft [v.

Further,\n   <em>\n    Microsoft\n   </em>\n   , a patent dispute, focuses specifically on interpreting the extraterritoriality of the Patent Act and not on due process.

The only potential exception to that rule is Section 271(f) of the Patent Act, which provides that patent infringement occurs when \"one supplies ... from the United States for combination abroad, a patented invention's components.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556164\" index=\"196\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/437/#p454\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556164\" index=\"196\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/437/#p454\">\n    at 441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556164\" index=\"197\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/437/#p454\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1746\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted).

Thus, the\n   <em>\n    Microsoft\n   </em>\n   court focused specifically on the extraterritorial application of U.S. patent law, without any mention of due process concerns. Here, the court found above that the pertinent criminal statutes apply extraterritorially, and nothing in\n   <em>\n    Microsoft\n   </em>\n   convinces the court that the Defendants' contacts are so minimal that their prosecution in the United States would violate the Due Process Clause.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   The Defendants also cite several cases that analyze jurisdiction and due process under the sufficient nexus test instead of under international law principles.

Here, however, the court finds that the Defendants' conduct has had a substantial effect in the U.S., rendering jurisdiction over the case constitutional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Finally, the Defendants attempt to distinguish this prosecution from others in which courts have exercised jurisdiction. They point out that the\n   <em>\n    In re Hijazi\n   </em>\n   defendant's fraudulent agreements with a U.S. Army subcontractor \"were intended to\n   have a substantial effect on the United States, namely the theft of millions of dollars from its treasury,\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3781476\" index=\"216\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/845/874/#p883\">\n    845 F.

True enough, but the statute does not require the \"substantial effect\" be felt by a government. The Defendants also attempt to distinguish their alleged conduct from that of terrorism and drug trafficking defendants, using more cases from circuits that utilize the substantial nexus test. The court fully understands that Defendants Knopp and Firtash have not \"conspire[ed] to kill U.S. officers,\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

However, these cases do not address the \"substantial effect\" standard of \u00a7 402(1)(c). Instead, they speak to Defendants' argument under Restatement \u00a7 402(3) that their activity has not severely impacted the security interests of the United States. The court does not reach that argument here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Ultimately, the court finds that the Defendants' conspiracy was intended to have a substantial effect in the United States. This further supports the court's assertion of jurisdiction over Defendants without violating the Due Process Clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Restatement \u00a7 403 - Reasonability\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Even if a court has jurisdiction pursuant to a principle of international law laid out in Restatement \u00a7 402, a state is prohibited from exercising that jurisdiction when it would be unreasonable. Restatement \u00a7 403(1). Reasonability \"is determined by evaluating all relevant factors,\" including, but not limited to:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-114\">\n   (a) the link of the activity to the territory of the regulating state, i.e., the extent to which the activity takes place within the territory, or has substantial, direct, and foreseeable effect upon or in the territory;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-115\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-116\">\n   (c) the character of the activity to be regulated, the importance of regulation to the regulating state, the extent to which other states regulate such activities, and the degree to which the desirability of such regulation is generally accepted;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-117\">\n   (d) the existence of justified expectations that might be protected or hurt by the regulation;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-118\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-119\">\n   (f) the extent to which the regulation is consistent with the traditions of the international system; [and]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-120\">\n   (g) the extent to which another state may have an interest in regulating the activity;\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Restatement \u00a7 403(2). Defendants claim that their prosecution is unreasonable under these factors, and that the court's exercise of jurisdiction over them therefore violates their right to due process. This argument, too, fails. As discussed above, Defendants' alleged activity was intended to have a substantial effect within the United States. The facts establishing jurisdiction under \u00a7\u00a7 402(1)(a) and (c) similarly establish a link between Defendants and the United States sufficient to render jurisdiction reasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Defendants make their most lengthy reasonability argument under \u00a7 403(2)(g), arguing that \"India, not the United States\" has an interest in regulating the alleged conduct. (Firtash MTD [24] at 34.) India very well may have a significant interest in the alleged criminal activity in this case. But that interest does not require the conclusion that the United States must stand\n   aside and decline to prosecute conduct that reaches into and is intended to affect the United States.
