The Pennsylvania Department of Human Services (\"DHS\") received a report about this claim of neglect and, thereafter, investigated the personal care home. This investigation culminated in DHS identifying several violations and temporarily revoking the plaintiffs' \"regular\" personal care home license. The plaintiffs-displeased with DHS's investigation, including that it involved complaints brought to DHS's attention by a competitor-brought the instant civil action under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   alleging that the DHS parties and the plaintiffs' competitor violated their federal civil rights. Specifically, the plaintiffs alleged that the DHS parties denied them procedural and substantive due process in violation of the Due Process Clause, violated the Equal Protection Clause by conducting a biased investigation, and used the investigation to retaliate against them in violation of the First Amendment. The plaintiffs also alleged that DHS employees conspired with the plaintiffs' competitor to deprive them of their \"regular\" license.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   After a lengthy period of discovery, the defendants separately moved for summary judgment and said motions are currently before the court. While the defendants raised numerous arguments as to why all the plaintiffs' claims fail as a matter of law, the court grants the competitor's motion in total, and grants summary judgment in favor of the DHS parties as to the plaintiffs' claims for violations of procedural due process (denial of a predeprivation hearing and bias only), substantive due process, and equal protection. The court denies the DHS parties' motion for summary judgment as to the claim that the DHS parties denied the plaintiffs postdeprivation process due to delay and the claim for First Amendment retaliation. Lastly, as to all defendants, the court grants summary judgment in their favor on the plaintiffs' section 1983 civil conspiracy claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Doc. Nos. 96-100, 103-10. The At Home Defendants and DHS Defendants separately filed responses to the plaintiffs' opposition to their motions for summary judgment on April 3, 2019. Doc. Nos. 112-14.
