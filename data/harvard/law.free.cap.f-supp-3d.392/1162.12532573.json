Drozd, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This matter is before the court on a motion to dismiss plaintiffs' complaint filed on behalf of defendants. (Doc. No. 9-1.) A hearing on the motion was held on December 18, 2018. Attorney Mark Merin appeared in person on behalf of plaintiffs. Attorney John Whitefleet appeared telephonically on behalf of defendants. Having reviewed the parties' submissions, and having heard from counsel, defendants' motion will be granted in part and denied in part for the reasons explained below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This action arises from the death of Armando Osuna (the \"decedent\") on or about May 29, 2018. In their complaint, plaintiffs allege as follows. On the date in question, the decedent returned to a house from which he and his wife, plaintiff Nancy Osuna, had been evicted in order to ascertain when furniture that they had left behind would be made available to them so that the decedent could arrange for a truck to pick it up. (Doc. No. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 13-15.) The owner of the property told the decedent to leave the premises and called defendant Stanislaus County Sheriff's Department (the \"Sheriff's Department\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 16.) Deputies from the Sheriff's Department responded to the call and encountered the decedent on the street near the house. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 17.) Sometime thereafter, the unarmed decedent was shot by the deputies. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18.) He was transported to a nearby hospital; he later lost his life as a result of this incident. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On September 12, 2018, the estate of the decedent (the \"estate\"), Nancy Osuna, and the decedent and Nancy Osuna's son, Paul Osuna (collectively, \"plaintiffs\") filed this complaint against defendants County of Stanislaus (the \"County\"), the, Stanislaus County Sheriff's Department, Stanislaus County Sheriff Adam Christianson, and Doe Defendants 1-50 (collectively, \"defendants\"). (Doc. No. 1.) Doe Defendants 1-25 were deputies employed by the Sheriff's Department who responded to the property owner's call and encountered Mr. Osuna on the street. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-4.) Doe Defendants 26-50 were policy-makers for the county and/or the Sheriff's Department responsible for policies relating to training, supervision, and discipline of law enforcement officers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff bring the following eight causes of action: (1) unreasonable force in violation of Mr. Osuna's Fourth Amendment rights, asserted by the estate against all defendants; (2) deprivation of familial association, companionship, and society in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, asserted by Nancy and Paul Osuna against Doe defendants 1-25; (3) deprivation of association, companionship, and society in violation of the First Amendment, asserted by Nancy and Paul Osuna against Doe defendants 1-25; (4) unreasonable force in violation of Article I, Section 13 of the California constitution, asserted by the estate against all defendants; (5) Bane Act violations alleging unreasonable force and deprivation of familial association, companionship, and society, asserted by all plaintiffs against all defendants; (6) assault and battery claims asserted by the estate against Stanislaus County, the Stanislaus County Sheriff's Department, and Doe defendants 1-25; (7) a negligence claim asserted by the estate against all defendants, and (8) a wrongful death claim asserted by Nancy and Paul Osuna against all defendants. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-19.) The complaint also alleges that multiple incidents of police misconduct have recently occurred involving the Sheriff's Department, frequently resulting in large monetary settlements being reached or jury verdicts in favor of plaintiffs being returned. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 23.) Based upon those previous incidents, plaintiffs allege a pattern and practice of police misconduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On November 5, 2018, defendants filed the instant motion to dismiss. (Doc. No. 9-1.) On December 4, 2018, plaintiffs filed an opposition to the motion to dismiss. (Doc. No. 13.) On December 11, 2018, defendants filed a reply to the opposition. (Doc.

Each is addressed in turn below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Use of Doe Defendants Does Not Violate Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2).\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Defendants argue that the naming of Doe defendants by plaintiffs violates Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2) because \"[p]laintiffs do not identify each doe defendant and his or her alleged act or omission\" and \"vague and generalized allegations ... [are] insufficient to put prospective defendants on notice of their alleged actions or omissions.\" (Doc. Nos. 9-1 at 4; 14 at 3);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2) (\"A pleading ... must contain: a short and plaint statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\"). Defendants' argument is not persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   It is true that the use of Doe defendants in federal courts is \"generally disfavored.\" (Doc.

However, as the court in\n   <em>\n    Gillespie\n   </em>\n   noted\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   situations arise, such as the present, where the identity of alleged defendants will not be known prior to the filing of a complaint. In such circumstances, the plaintiff should be given an opportunity through discovery to identify the unknown defendants, unless it is clear that discovery would not uncover the identities, or that the complaint would be dismissed on other grounds.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"387485\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/629/637/#p642\">\n    629 F.2d at 642\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, defendants do not contend that discovery will not uncover the identities of the Doe defendants and, as reflected in this order, the court does not find that the complaint should be dismissed on other grounds. Moreover, plaintiffs have alleged all the information about the Doe defendants as plaintiffs possess at this juncture of the litigation. In this regard, the complaint alleges that Doe defendants 1-25 are or were deputies of the Stanislaus County Sheriff's Department who encountered the decedent on the day that he was killed, and that Doe defendants 26-50 are or were policymakers for Stanislaus County or the Sheriff's Department who are or were responsible for policies relating to training, supervision, and discipline of law enforcement officers. (Doc. No. 1 at 3-4.) Defendants' contention that plaintiffs \"should be required to identify the unnamed defendants as best as possible, and allege specific acts that these doe defendants did,\" (Doc. No. 9-1 at 4), is unavailing because plaintiffs\n   <em>\n    have\n   </em>\n   alleged as best as possible at this time facts regarding\n   the Doe defendants, and \"[they] do not have access to any further information concerning these parties, including their identities, because, as far as plaintiffs know, 'the only witness other than the officers was killed during the encounter.' \" (Doc.

In\n   <em>\n    Shaw\n   </em>\n   the Ninth Circuit did not rely on the decision in\n   <em>\n    Peterson\n   </em>\n   in concluding that a police department was a separately suable public entity; instead, the court relied on\n   <em>\n    Peterson\n   </em>\n   to reject the notion that a public entity must have some degree of sovereignty. 788 F.2d at 605.

Because this case includes claims against a sheriff's department, and not an intergovernmental association, the court finds\n   <em>\n    Hervey\n   </em>\n   to be of only limited guidance.

(Doc. No. 9-1 at 11-12.) That provision provides that, \"[e]xcept as otherwise provided by statute, a public employee is not liable for an injury caused by the act or omission of another person.\" As noted above in addressing plaintiffs' cause of action for the alleged unreasonable use of force, the complaint contains no factual allegations sufficient to\n   state such a claim against defendant Christianson.

No. 1 at \u00b6 68.) Second, plaintiffs allege that defendant Christianson and Does 26 to 50 breached a duty owed to the decedent by hiring, retaining, and failing to adequately train and supervise Does 1 to 25. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 69.) As to both theories, plaintiffs argue that both Stanislaus County and the Stanislaus County Sheriff's Department are liable on a\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior\n   </em>\n   theory. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 70.)

In that case, the plaintiff alleged that a school district's administrators knew or should have known of a guidance counselor's dangerous propensities, \"but nevertheless hired, retained and failed to properly supervise her.\"\n   <em>\n    William S.

Here, plaintiffs offer no argument as to how defendant Christianson's duty of care towards the decedent amounted to anything more than the general duty to use reasonable care.
