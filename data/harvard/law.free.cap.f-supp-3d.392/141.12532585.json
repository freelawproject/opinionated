On November 21, 2013, he and three co-conspirators (an Iranian national named Seyed Abolfazl Shahab Jamili; Nicaro Engineering Co., Jamili's Iranian company; and an Iranian company called Eyvaz Technic Manufacturing Company) were charged in a ten-count indictment with the illegal export of pressure transducers manufactured by MKS Instruments, Inc., a Massachusetts corporation, from the United States to Iran between 2009 and 2012. MKS pressure transducers can be used in gas centrifuges to produce weapons-grade uranium. The indictment charged Cheng with conspiracy to commit export violations in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201705\">\n    50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1705\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Count I), conspiracy to commit smuggling violations under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20554\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 554\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20371\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Count II), unlawful exports of U.S. goods to Iran on four occasions between April and August 2009 in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201705\">\n    50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1705\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Counts III-VI), and smuggling of U.S. goods to Iran on the same four occasions\n   in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20554\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 554\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Counts VII-X).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Cheng served as the middleman in the scheme: He coordinated shipments from the United States, received them in China, and then sent them to Iran. He knew Kalaye Electronic Company, which the United States had designated as a nuclear weapons proliferator, was the end user of the pressure transducers. He also knew exporting the transducers from the United States to Iran was illegal, so he removed their serial numbers to hide their origin. He and his co-conspirators lied about the end users to secure export licenses to ship the goods to China.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After Cheng's arrest in the United Kingdom and his extradition to the United States, the Court held an initial status conference on June 9, 2015. The Court asked the Government to provide a memorandum addressing whether it had extraterritorial jurisdiction to convict Cheng for conduct in China. The Government informed the Court that Cheng could be prosecuted in a U.S. court pursuant to the First Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    United States v. McKeeve\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11886323\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/131/1/\">\n    131 F.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1st Cir. 1997), because his conspiracy involved pressure transducers exported from Massachusetts. Cheng's attorney, Stephen Weymouth, did not respond to the Government's memorandum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On December 18, 2015, Cheng pleaded guilty to Counts I through VI of the indictment. At the Rule 11 hearing, Cheng said he was satisfied with Weymouth's representation and Weymouth had not pressured him into pleading guilty. Besides explaining that he stopped selling pressure transducers in 2011, not 2012 as stated in the indictment, he agreed with the factual basis for the charges as just described. He specifically admitted he knew exporting the pressure transducers was illegal under U.S. law. Because of the nature of the crime, the Court recognized that evidence about Iran's nuclear program would be a significant issue at sentencing in determining whether a terrorism enhancement or upward departure was appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Cheng also stated during the colloquy that he suffered from \"mania.\" Dkt. No. 76 at 7:11-15. Weymouth explained that he had reviewed Cheng's Chinese psychiatric records, which called him \"manic\" with \"racing thoughts\" and an \"inability to sleep.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11886323\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/131/1/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11886323\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/131/1/\">\n    at 8:2-13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court suggested Weymouth submit the records at the sentencing hearing to support an argument for diminished capacity or a variance based on his mental health. The Court authorized money to interpret the records for this purpose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Pre-Sentence Report (\"PSR\") discussed Cheng's mental health at length. He was hospitalized twice in China, once in 1999 and again in 2012. During his 1999 hospitalization, he was diagnosed with mania and prescribed medication.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   He took the medication until 2003 but stopped due to negative side effects. In addition to his mania, he began having delusions of grandeur in 1999 and experienced suicidal thoughts in the early 2000s and in 2012. Cheng reported that his condition improved significantly after his 2012 hospitalization. Nevertheless, after his arrest, he experienced racing thoughts, vivid dreams and lack of sleep due to \"noise\" in his brain. While in custody at Wyatt Detention Facility, he had monthly mental health counseling sessions and took melatonin to aid in sleeping. Documentation from Wyatt\n   suggested a diagnosis of \"a mood disorder and possible bipolar disorder.\" PSR \u00b6 91.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On January 27, 2016, the Court held an all-day sentencing hearing. The Government called David Albright, the president of a nongovernmental organization that conducts research on nuclear nonproliferation, to testify in support of a terrorism enhancement and upward departure under Application Note 2 to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2M5.1 (evasion of export controls). Albright worked in the field since 1981, wrote hundreds of peer-reviewed articles and five books, and personally studied Iran's nuclear program for over twenty years. His organization conducted significant research on Iran's nuclear program and was the first to identify the Natanz Fuel Enrichment Plant as a gas centrifuge facility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Albright testified that Iran began to develop a program to create weapons-grade uranium in 1985. It used gas centrifuges located at Natanz and the Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant to conduct enrichment. Kalaye Electric Company operated the Fordow plant and acquired equipment and materials overseas to develop and design gas centrifuges. Fordow was used for enrichment at least until it was discovered in September 2009, after Cheng made four shipments of pressure transducers to Iran.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Having studied illegal procurement networks, Albright called Cheng's role in the conspiracy \"critical\" and the scheme \"very sophisticated.\" Dkt. No. 104 at 39:23-40:5, 44:22-45:6. Finally, he opined that Cheng's conduct put the United States at a strategic disadvantage during negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program: Cheng was supplying Iran with tools to manufacture more centrifuges just as the United States was trying to get Iran to agree to reduce the number of centrifuges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Weymouth cross-examined Albright about his qualifications, the basis of his opinions, and the timing of Iran nuclear program. Albright admitted he was a mathematician and physicist by education and his opinion relied only on publicly available documents and statements from others. Weymouth emphasized Albright's testimony that he could only say that the weapons-grade enrichment at Fordow continued until 2009, and he pointed out that, according to assessments of Iran's nuclear program from 2009 to 2013, Iran had never made enough weapon-grade uranium for even one nuclear weapon. Albright also admitted that pressure transducers have nonnuclear and nonmilitary purposes. Weymouth did not put on an expert witness to counter Albright's testimony, but he said he had spent dozens of hours over four weeks preparing for the cross-examination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Court next heard argument on calculation of the guidelines range. The Government sought, and Weymouth opposed, a four-level aggravating role adjustment as an organizer under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1(a), a terrorism enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3A1.4, and an upward departure under Application Note 2 to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2M5.1. Although Weymouth sought a minor-role adjustment in his sentencing memorandum, he conceded at the hearing that it did not apply. The Court rejected the aggravating role adjustment and terrorism enhancement, which the Government never properly sought, but decided to upwardly depart by six levels under Application Note 2 to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2M5.1 because Cheng's scheme posed a serious threat to national security, involved a substantial volume of commerce and number of occurrences, and was highly sophisticated. With the upward departure, the Court found a total offense level of 29. Cheng had a criminal history category of I, so his guidelines range was 87 to 108 months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Court then heard argument on the appropriate sentence. Requesting a term\n   of imprisonment of fifteen years, the Government emphasized the national security threat Cheng's conduct posed to the United States, the sophistication of the scheme, the quantity and number of shipments of pressure transducers sent to Iran, and Cheng's knowledge of its illegality. Weymouth argued for a twenty-four-month sentence because other defendants in similar cases received short sentences and Cheng did not knowingly support Iran's nuclear weapons program, had no exposure to the United States or its laws, executed his scheme solely for personal gain, and did not need to be specifically deterred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Court asked about Cheng's Chinese mental health records. Weymouth did not submit translations of the records, but Cheng and an interpreter had translated them for him. Weymouth said that the records showed Cheng suffers from \"mania\" and argued that, while Cheng was competent to stand trial and criminally responsible, his mania and \"racing thoughts\" likely influenced his decision to participate in the scheme. Cheng then had a lengthy allocution. Among other things, he mentioned his two hospitalizations in China for \"mania\" and his diagnosis of Hepatitis B in 1999.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Court sentenced Cheng to a term of imprisonment of nine years. Citing the factors under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203553\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), the Court emphasized the need for general deterrence, and Cheng's pecuniary motivation for the crime. The Court also recognized that his mental health problems might explain some of his statements (like \"f- - - the United States\") but added it did not have much of a record on the issue of mental health. The Court also noted the sentence was consistent with\n   <em>\n    United States v. Khazaee\n   </em>\n   , a similar case from Connecticut raised by the Government in its sentencing memorandum. The Court issued a memorandum memorializing the reasons for its guidelines calculations and its sentence on February 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The First Circuit affirmed Cheng's nine-year sentence on March 1, 2017.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Cheng\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277482\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/849/516/#p517\">\n    849 F.3d 516\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 517 (1st Cir. 2017). The First Circuit determined that the Court did not err in its upward departure under Application Note 2 to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2M5.1 or its balancing of the sentencing factors and that Cheng's sentence was not disproportionate to sentences in similar case.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277482\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/849/516/#p517\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277482\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/849/516/#p517\">\n    at 518-21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On April 10, 2017, Cheng filed a pro se motion to vacate his sentence under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . After securing counsel, Cheng filed an amended motion on April 5, 2018. In this motion, Cheng argues that Weymouth provided ineffective assistance of counsel in the following ways: 1) failure to translate and use his Chinese mental health records to support a mitigation argument or a departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5H1.3 (mental and emotional conditions); 2) failure to call an expert on Iran to counter the testimony of David Albright; 3) failure to challenge the exercise of extraterritorial jurisdiction; 4) failure to challenge the Government's evidence that Cheng acted willfully; 5) failure to object to the use of Application Note 2 to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2M5.1 ; 6) conceding that Cheng did not play a minor role in the conspiracy; and 7) a lack of trust in the attorney-client relationship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On July 27, 2018, Cheng moved to amend his amended petition. In his motion, he withdraws his claim regarding a lack of trust with Weymouth. He also seeks to add the following ineffective assistance of counsel claims: 1) failure to move to dismiss based on insufficiency of the indictment; 2) failure to distinguish\n   <em>\n    United States v. Khazaee\n   </em>\n   at sentencing; and 3) failure to use his medical records to argue for diminished capacity under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.13. Finally,\n   he contends that his prosecution for extraterritorial conduct violated due process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Motion to Amend\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Rule 15(c)(1)(B) permits an amendment to \"relate back\" to the date of the original pleading for purposes of evaluating a statute of limitations if \"the amendment asserts a claim ... that arose out of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence set out -- or attempted to be set out -- in the original pleading.\" For \u00a7 2255 motions, this provision \"is to be strictly construed, in light of Congress' decision to expedite collateral attacks by placing stringent time restrictions on them.\"\n   <em>\n    Ciampi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8928720\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/419/20/#p23\">\n    419 F.3d at 23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (cleaned up).

Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The First Circuit entered judgment affirming Cheng's conviction on March 1, 2017. His conviction became final on May 30, 2017 when the ninety days to file a petition for certiorari expired. Because he did not move to amend his \u00a7 2255 petition until July 27, 2018, any new claims raised in his motion to amend fall outside the one-year statute of limitations, unless they relate back to his April 5, 2018 motion. The Government seeks to exclude three ineffective assistance claims in Cheng's motion to amend as untimely: 1) failure to move to dismiss on the basis of an insufficient indictment; 2) failure to distinguish\n   <em>\n    United States v. Khazaee\n   </em>\n   at sentencing; and 3) failure to argue at sentencing for mitigation under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.13 (diminished capacity).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Cheng's claim that Weymouth was ineffective by failing to move to dismiss based on the insufficiency of the indictment is untimely. Nowhere in the April 2018 motion does he raise any challenge to the indictment's contents. He argues this claim arises from the same facts as his timely claim that Weymouth was ineffective in failing to argue he had insufficient notice of his criminal liability. This timely claim, however, concerns the distinct question of his contacts with the United States and understanding of the American legal system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The second and third new claims are not time-barred. While Cheng did not specifically mention\n   <em>\n    Khazaee\n   </em>\n   in his April 2018 motion, he made arguments of ineffective assistance concerning calculation of the guidelines range, departures from that range, and his role in the offense that are similar to the arguments he contends Weymouth should have made to distinguish\n   <em>\n    Khazaee\n   </em>\n   . His claim that Weymouth was ineffective for not seeking a diminished capacity departure at sentencing relates back to his timely argument that Weymouth should have translated his mental health records and used them more thoroughly at sentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Remaining \u00a7 2255 Claims\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

In fact, the PSR provided more details than the records by describing Cheng's repeated suicidal thoughts in 2002, 2003, and 2012 and the triggers for his hospitalizations. Relying on the PSR, Weymouth argued at sentencing that Cheng's mental health was a mitigating factor favoring a variance under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203553\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) to a below guideline sentence. The Court acknowledged this mental health history, stating that Cheng's mental health problems involving mania/bipolar disease counseled against taking his extreme anti-American statements too literally. Cheng emphasizes that the PSR and Weymouth called his mental health condition \"mania\" instead of \"bipolar disorder,\" the term used in his Chinese records. While \"mania\" and \"bipolar disorder\" are different psychiatric disorders, he does not explain why the distinction matters for sentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Cheng's Chinese records (which are consistent with the PSR) describe two bipolar episodes with significant symptoms in 1999 and 2012 for which he was hospitalized.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt.

It is unlikely that someone with significant diminished capacity could engage in such a complex scheme to evade U.S. sanctions, although his bipolar disorder might explain his outrageous statements. While the records indicate that Cheng was hospitalized in 2012, he has provided no report from a psychiatrist or other mental health professional about the time period of the admitted conspiracy, which spanned from 2009 to 2011, or records about his mental health during this period. He also has not presented any information about his mental health for the six years prior to the beginning of the conspiracy.

Even if Weymouth's representation was ineffective, however, Cheng fails to demonstrate a reasonable probability that hiring an expert would have changed the result of sentencing because the information his expert would have provided would still have supported an upward departure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Albright testified that Iran used Kalaye, which Cheng knew was the end user of the pressure transducers, to hide its efforts to produce weapons-grade uranium and that Kalaye was designated by the United States as a proliferator of weapons of mass destruction in 2007. He noted that the pressure transducers Cheng sent to Iran were vital for operation of the centrifuges used in its nuclear program. He explained that Iran's nuclear weapons program continued until at least the discovery of the Fordow plant in 2009 but that, even if Iran stopped enriching weapons-grade uranium at that time, it had the capability to restart the program. Significantly, some of the shipments at issue in this case were made before Fordow was uncovered in 2009.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   In his affidavit, Dr. Arnold refers to public documents that he states \"directly contradict the assertion that Iran was pursuing a nuclear weapons program during the period of time that Mr. Cheng shipped export-controlled items to Iran.\" Dkt. No. 142 at 6-7. Instead, he claims Iran stopped its nuclear weapons program in 2003. He concludes that, \"while it is true that the MKS pressure transducers that Mr. Cheng shipped to Iran were likely used by Iran to enrich uranium, it may not have been the case, and likely was not the case, that the parts were used in a nuclear weapons program.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Even if Iran stopped its nuclear weapons program in 2003, before Cheng began supplying pressure transducers, his conduct would still have \"threatened a security interest of the United States\" to an \"extreme\" degree. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2M5.1 cmt. n.2. Cheng provided the Iranian government with pressure transducers that it could use to enrich uranium. While Iran may have used them for civilian nuclear enrichment, it could have restarted its weapons-grade enrichment at any point. Providing pressure transducers to Iran knowing they would be used to enrich uranium of any sort is an extreme threat to American national security. Furthermore, as Albright testified, Cheng actively supplied Iran with pressure transducers while the United States was beginning to negotiate with Iran to eliminate some of its centrifuges. Cheng's conduct therefore directly undermined American efforts to reduce the threat posed by Iran. Because the information Cheng wishes Weymouth had provided the Court would have still showed that Cheng's conduct posed an extreme national security threat to the United States, he fails to demonstrate a reasonable probability that the Court would not have imposed an upward departure under Application Note 2 to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2M5.1 had Weymouth consulted or called an expert on Iran's nuclear program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   c.\n   <em>\n    Evidence of \"Willful\" Mens Rea\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Cheng claims Weymouth was ineffective for not recognizing the Government only had weak evidence he violated American export controls \"willfully\" as required under the IEEPA.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201705\">\n    50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1705\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c). He explains that he lied about the destination of the shipments because he thought MKS did not want to sell to Iran for business reasons. Weymouth should have emphasized the weakness of the Government's mens rea evidence at sentencing to show his scheme was not sophisticated, Cheng contends, and he may not have even pleaded guilty had Weymouth informed him of his mens rea defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The First Circuit has not defined willfulness under the IEEPA, but other circuit courts have defined the term similarly.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Accordingly, the Court rejects Cheng's claim that Weymouth was ineffective for not arguing that the IEEPA's willfulness element requires that a defendant know he needs a license to export the specific goods in question, which he takes from dicta in a Ninth Circuit opinion discussing whether the IEEPA is void for vagueness.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

At the Rule 11 hearing and again at sentencing, Cheng acknowledged in response to specific questions from the Court that he knew his conduct was illegal. These admissions undermine his attempt in his post-sentencing affidavit to suggest he did not understand the illegality of his conduct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Although MKS Shanghai employees were involved in illegal exporting before Cheng contacted them, he and Jamili hatched the scheme to export pressure transducers to Iran. As the middleman receiving transducers from the United States and sending them to Iran, Cheng was an integral part of the scheme to evade U.S. sanctions. His involvement in the scheme covered the most of the period of the charged conspiracy, and during that period, he relayed 1,185 transducers to Iran and exchanged over 39,000 chat messages with Jamili. He decided to remove the transducers' serial numbers to reduce suspicion. He was fully aware he was providing the transducers to a company involved in Iran's nuclear program. He benefited financially from the scheme. Accordingly, Cheng was \"present for the planning of the scheme and deeply involved in its execution\" and was thus not entitled to a minor-role adjustment.\n   <em>\n    United States v.
