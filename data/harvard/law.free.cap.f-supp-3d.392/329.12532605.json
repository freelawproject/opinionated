Pursuant to one standard (IAS 36), Rio Tinto must assess whether an asset is impaired at the end of each reporting period (i.e., at each half year and year end).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34. This is done by determining whether there are any \"impairment indicators,\" and if there are, by testing for impairment by determining the recoverable amount.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   A company must recognize an impairment loss on an asset if its value, as reported in a company's financial statements, exceeds its likely recoverable amount.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Rio Tinto's Controller's Office is responsible for coordinating the impairment review process, and at all relevant times, the Controller reported to Elliott. SEC Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 35, 39. The Controller's Office also prepared papers for Rio Tinto's Audit Committee, of which the Individual Defendants were members.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 42-43. The Individual Defendants were also members of Rio Tinto's \"Investment Committee,\" which made investment decisions for the company.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 27, 54.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In 2010, Rio Tinto identified a company called Riversdale Mining Limited (\"Riversdale\") as a potential acquisition target.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 48-53. Riversdale's principal assets were coal mining licenses for contiguously-located areas in Mozambique.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 50. These coal projects were located in areas of Mozambique believed to have large amounts of \"hard coking\" coal, which is\n   rarer and more valuable than \"thermal\" coal.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 28, 49-50, 55.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Papers presented during an August 2010 meeting of Rio Tinto's Investment Committee estimated that Riversdale's mining licenses were worth approximately $3.4 billion, based in part on two assumptions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 28-29. First, it was assumed that there was production potential of approximately 30 million tons of coal annually by 2020 and 45 million tons annually by 2030.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28. Second, it was assumed that sixty percent of the coal mined would be hard coking coal.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Additionally, Rio Tinto's Technical Evaluation Group (\"TEG\") informed the Investment Committee that same month that a central assumption was that the majority of the coal mined would be barged down the Zambezi River.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29. TEG explained that barging is \"only a concept at this stage and a number of potentially 'showstopping' unknowns exist (such as the ability to dredge and maintain an open channel over the river mouth bar, the impact of cyclones/flooding on river navigability and the ability to obtain environmental approvals).\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   It was assumed that the remainder of the coal mined could be transported using existing rail infrastructure in Mozambique.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30. In advance of a November 18, 2010 Investment Committee meeting, TEG submitted a paper observing that expanding Riversdale's coal production would be largely reliant on barging and that \"significant uncertainties remain over its practical operation, permitting, feasibility and cost.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In December 2010, the Investment Committee presented a proposal to acquire Riversdale to Rio Tinto's Board of Directors (the \"Board\"), which also included the Individual Defendants.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32; SEC Compl. \u00b6 60. The proposal stated that the purchase would increase Rio Tinto's production of coal to more than 30 million tons annually after 2020, that coal could be transported by barging or rail, and that the value of the acquisition was $3.6 billion. SEC Compl. \u00b6 60. However, the potentially \"showstopping\" risks associated with barging were not disclosed to the Board.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Rio Tinto acquired Riversdale in August 2011 for approximately $3.7 billion and renamed the business \"Rio Tinto Coal Mozambique\" (\"RTCM\"). Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 4, 32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Rio Tinto soon ran into problems with the project. First, Rio Tinto encountered problems with respect to barging.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 36-43. By October 2011, the Vice President of Rio Tinto's Energy Product Group (\"RTE\"), which is responsible for Rio Tinto's coal mining business, determined that based on the best information available, barging capacity was limited to 10 million tons annually (not 30 million) due to physical and ecological constraints.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36. Thereafter, RTCM internally generated an updated valuation that reduced its value by approximately $2.1 billion.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37. Moreover, barging was contingent on government approval, and in December 2011, the Government of Mozambique, in a written letter, rejected a barging proposal because of environmental concerns.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 39-40. By January 2012, both Individual Defendants had learned of the rejection.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42. Rio Tinto never formally submitted a revised proposal, and was warned by the Government of Mozambique in April 2012 that if it persisted in raising the subject of barging, it risked losing its mining licenses altogether.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Rio Tinto did not publicly disclose the rejection of the barging proposal or its effect on RTCM's valuation, nor did Albanese inform the Board about it.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43; SEC Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 89-90.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Additionally, Rio Tinto had estimated at acquisition that RTCM could mine about seven billion tons of coal. Compl. \u00b6 45. However, in January 2012, Rio Tinto revised its estimate downward to less than three billion tons.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In late 2011 and early 2012, RTCM created a \"ground-up\" valuation model that generated valuations ranging from approximately negative $3.45 billion to approximately negative $9 billion.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 47. These models incorporated the problems about the transportation options and the coal reserves, but were still based on \"aggressive\" assumptions, including that Rio Tinto would build a new railroad for coal transportation (and sell off excess capacity on it to other companies).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Between September and December 2011, Rio Tinto conducted its review of RTCM for impairment indicators. SEC Compl. \u00b6 91. However, Defendants did not disclose the transportation problems to Rio Tinto's auditors, to the extent they were then known. Compl. \u00b6 49. The auditors believed, therefore, that nothing significant had changed since acquisition and did not test for impairment. SEC Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 92, 94; Compl. \u00b6 51. RTCM was valued at its acquisition price-about $3.7 billion-in Rio Tinto's 2011 annual report (the \"2011 Annual Report\"). Compl. \u00b6 51. The Individual Defendants signed the 2011 Annual Report and certified, among other things, that it gave \"a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit\" of Rio Tinto; that it was prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards; and that they had taken the necessary steps to establish that Rio Tinto's auditors were aware of any relevant information.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 50.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In mid-April 2012, Elliott requested an \"all hands\" meeting with Albanese and RTCM representatives to discuss RTCM.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 54. Elliott asked the CEO of RTE to calculate a \"net present value\" of RTCM in advance of the meeting.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The meeting was held on May 11, 2012, in Brisbane, Australia (the \"Brisbane Meeting\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Elliott did not invite Rio Tinto's Controller to the Brisbane Meeting.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 55. At the meeting, RTCM and RTE management provided the Individual Defendants with certain information, including that: using the best information available, RTCM was worth negative $680 million; the coal transportation options assumed at acquisition were no longer realistic (barging had been rejected by the Government of Mozambique and, in any event, faced physical challenges); and there was a lower proportion of hard coking coal to thermal coal than had been assumed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 56. Additionally, they informed the Individual Defendants that the only way to deliver the necessary capacity of coal at a competitive cost was to build a new rail line (or a \"greenfield\" rail line) at a cost of $16 billion-however, a greenfield rail line would still not give the project a positive valuation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   At the Brisbane Meeting, Albanese rejected a proposal for Rio Tinto to build the greenfield rail line by itself because of capital constraints, but instructed RTCM to seek out potential partners to build it.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 57.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Individual Defendants did not disclose to Rio Tinto's Controller or its auditors the severe adverse developments that the Individual Defendants had learned about at the Brisbane Meeting.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 58, 63, 69, 72.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On August 9, 2012, Rio Tinto filed its interim financial report for half-year 2012 (the \"HY 2012 Report\") as an exhibit to its Form 6-K filed with the SEC.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 76. The HY 2012 Report valued RTCM at more than $3 billion, and did not discuss the recent significant setbacks.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 76-77.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On November 2, 2012, Rio Tinto filed its Form 6-K for the third quarter of 2012 with the SEC.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 88. In its filing, Rio Tinto stated that \"[d]uring the quarter, production at the Benga mine in the Moatize Basin in Mozambique continued to ramp up\" and that \"[w]ork is progressing to expand capacity on the Sena railway\n   line, which remains the system bottleneck.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (alterations in original). Rio Tinto did not disclose any of the severe adverse developments at RTCM.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   At a \"Metal Bulletin African Iron Ore Conference\" which took place from November 6 through 8, 2012, Rio Tinto gave a presentation, during which it displayed a slide titled \"Our presence in Africa is growing.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 89. The slide displayed a map of Africa and identified ten Rio Tinto projects on the continent, including RTCM.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 89.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   At a November 2012 investor conference, an investor stated that \"[i]n the past, certainly in Riversdale and then subsequently, you have talked about barging coal down the Zambezi River,\" and then asked, \"Is that still on the agenda or has that been given up on?\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 90. Albanese replied, \"I think that what we would need to look at would be all the transportation options, but realistically continued upgrades of the Beira line and then looking at a transportation corridor of probably the highest probability, a sort of pathway for expansions, but again I think we need to keep in mind that any of the options should always be looked at, at different times.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On February 5, 2013, Rio Tinto filed a Form 8-A with the SEC to register an issuance of $3 billion in notes pursuant to an amended prospectus filed on March 16, 2012.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 92. That prospectus incorporated by reference the 2011 Annual Report.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Following a November 26, 2012 Audit Committee meeting, the head of Rio Tinto's Technology &amp; Innovation Group (\"T&amp;I\") informed Albanese that RTCM had a negative valuation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 93. Albanese requested confirmation, which he received in December 2012.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The head of T&amp;I then bypassed the Individual Defendants and informed the Chairman of the Board about RTCM's negative valuation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 94. At a January 15, 2013 meeting of the Board, RTCM's value was revised downward to $611 million.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 95. In a January 17, 2013 press release, Rio Tinto stated that it expected to impair RTCM's value by \"approximately $3 billion\" in its 2012 annual results.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 98; Halligan Decl. Ex. 21 at 1, ECF No. 67-21. The press release mentioned infrastructure challenges, including that barging did not receive formal approvals, as well as estimates of less hard coking coal than anticipated. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 98, 101. The press release also announced that Albanese was stepping down as CEO, and that in total, Rio Tinto expected to recognize an impairment of $14 billion in its 2012 full year results.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 98, 100.

In addition, Plaintiff states that \"[b]oth the facts [pleaded] in the SEC complaint and the facts set forth in [a Final Notice issued by the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority] levying a fine on Rio Tinto, which Defendants do not deny, are incorporated by reference as if [pleaded] herein.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 3. Where necessary, therefore, the Court will refer to allegations made in the SEC's complaint in the SEC Action, which is attached to Plaintiff's complaint as Exhibit A.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    SEC Compl., ECF No. 60-1.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    In\n    <em>\n     Dynex\n    </em>\n    , the Second Circuit noted that \"[t]o prove liability against a corporation, of course, a plaintiff must prove that an agent of the corporation committed a culpable act with the requisite scienter, and that the act (and accompanying mental state) are attributable to the corporation.\"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3655013\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/531/190/#p195\">\n     531 F.3d at 195\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . It continued by stating that \"[i]n most cases, the most straightforward way to [allege this] will be to plead [scienter] for an individual defendant.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3655013\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/531/190/#p195\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    It noted, however, that there may be exceptions-for example, if a company \"announced that it had sold one million SUVs in 2006, and the actual number was zero,\" there \"would be a strong inference of corporate scienter, since so dramatic an announcement would have been approved by corporate officials sufficiently knowledgeable about the company to know that the announcement was false.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3655013\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/531/190/#p195\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3655013\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/531/190/#p195\">\n     at 195-96\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (quoting\n    <em>\n     Makor Issues &amp; Rights, Ltd. v.

No such dramatic allegations, however, are present here. Therefore, in order for Plaintiff to adequately allege corporate scienter, he must allege that an individual defendant possessed it.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    The Court arrived at the same conclusion regarding this statement in the SEC Opinion.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Rio Tinto\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20WL%201244933\">\n     2019 WL 1244933\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *11 n.7.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
