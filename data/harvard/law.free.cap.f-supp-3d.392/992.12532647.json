PERRY, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In 2014, plaintiff Zurich American Insurance Company (ZAIC) settled and paid an asbestos claim on behalf of its insured Anheuser-Busch, LLC (A-B). During the period of alleged asbestos exposure at issue in the claim, A-B was consecutively insured by ZAIC and Insurance Company of North America (INA). ZAIC brought this suit for equitable contribution, subrogation, and unjust enrichment against INA. After INA asserted a defense of failure to include all necessary parties, ZAIC added A-B as a defendant. A-B was dismissed from this lawsuit on May 8, 2018.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Before me now are cross-motions for summary judgment brought by ZAIC and INA on the issue of whether INA owes ZAIC any money for the underlying settlement. Because I conclude that the pollution exclusion in INA's policy bars coverage of the underlying claims as a matter of law, I will grant summary judgment in favor of INA on all claims asserted against it.

The lawsuit did not involve any asbestos product manufactured by A-B at the brewery. Instead, decedent's husband allegedly carried asbestos and asbestos dust from the A-B brewery where he worked and then the decedent \"inhaled and ingested\" these asbestos dust particles and fibers when she came into contact with his person and while laundering his work clothes. The complaint alleged that A-B was aware of the need for proper hygiene procedures to insure that asbestos was not carried home on the employees' person and work clothes and was further aware of the dangers of asbestos to all those foreseeably exposed to asbestos, including family and household members of A-B employees. The period of alleged exposure occurred between July 30, 1971 (the date of their marriage), and July 31, 1996 (the date of the employee husband's retirement from A-B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Discovery conducted in the\n   <em>\n    Cotter\n   </em>\n   case established that the decedent's husband came into frequent contact with asbestos while performing maintenance on the brewery's instrumentation and in tunnels beneath the brewery. Asbestos was floating around in the air and on the floor in piles of dust. A-B mechanics, including the decedent's husband, were not provided uniforms or laundry service and instead worked in their regular clothes, which they wore to and from work. They would get asbestos all over their clothing and could see the asbestos dust in the air. Consequently, they took dirt, asbestos dust, and grease with them when they left the job.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   A-B tendered defense of the\n   <em>\n    Cotter\n   </em>\n   suit to insurer ZAIC, who agreed to provide A-B with a defense subject to a reservation of rights to seek contribution for the periods insured after 1980.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The parties settled during a 2014 mediation for $1.5 million -\n   an amount all parties stipulate was reasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   A-B purchased Policy No. GA 85-79-000 from ZAIC for the period of July 1, 1967 to July 1, 1972 for personal injury liability and excess liability coverage, among other coverages. Subsequently, A-B purchased Policy No. GA 87-13-500 for the period of July 1, 1972 to July 1, 1980 from ZAIC with similar personal injury and excess liability coverage. As stipulated by the parties, endorsements to these policies have excess coverage limits between fifteen and twenty-five million dollars. ECF No. 79 \u00b6 7.

Because ZAIC paid the underlying asbestos litigation settlement of $1.5 million and incurred $79,298.12 in defense costs, it filed this suit seeking contribution from INA. INA denies that it has any obligation to contribute to the defense and settlement of the underlying litigation, claiming that its coverage differs from ZAIC's obligation on the underlying asbestos claim because of the pollution exclusion and deductible endorsements in its policies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   ZAIC and INA each move for summary judgment on the issue of whether INA is responsible for paying any portion of the\n   <em>\n    Cotter\n   </em>\n   settlement and defense costs.

Ct. App. 2006).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   INA advances two arguments that it is not liable to ZAIC as a matter of law. INA first contends that it is not in the same coverage position as ZAIC with respect to the\n   <em>\n    Cotter\n   </em>\n   settlement because the pollution exclusion in its policies bars coverage for the underlying claim. There is no dispute that if the pollution exclusion applies in this case, then INA owes no coverage for the\n   <em>\n    Cotter\n   </em>\n   suit and ZAIC could not seek contribution or subrogation against INA as a matter of law. ZAIC responds that INA failed to plead the pollution exclusion as an affirmative defense, and therefore waived its right to assert it. Alternatively, ZAIC contends that the pollution exclusion does not apply as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <em>\n    Did INA Properly Assert the Pollution Exclusion as an Affirmative Defense?\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(c) requires affirmative defenses to be raised in a responsive pleading. Whether the pollution exclusion in INA's insurance policies is an affirmative defense is a question of Missouri state law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    First Union National Bank v. Pictet Overseas Trust Corp., LTD.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3778947\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/477/616/#p621\">\n    477 F.3d 616\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 621-22 (8th Cir. 2007). In Missouri, insurers must plead exclusions to liability as an affirmative defense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Century Fire Sprinklers, Inc. v. CNA/Transp. Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11214529\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/23/874/#p877\">\n    23 S.W.3d 874\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 877 (Mo. Ct. App. 2000). INA does not dispute this but contends that it sufficiently pleaded its pollution exclusion as follows in its Twelfth Affirmative Defense:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   56. The Plaintiff is not entitled to contribution, subrogation, indemnity, unjust enrichment or any other form of relief on the grounds that the Underlying Claim does not come within the coverage afforded by the Defendant's policy and/or the Underlying Claim is within an exclusion from coverage, including but not limited to asbestos exclusions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   ECF No. 59 at 15. It is not disputed that the INA policy contains an explicit \"asbestos exclusion,\" which began in July 1, 1989 and is separate from the pollution exclusion relied upon by INA here. The issue, then, is whether INA's affirmative defense based upon exclusions from coverage, including \"asbestos exclusions,\" is sufficient to encompass an affirmative defense that asbestos is also considered an irritant, contaminant, or pollutant under the pollution exclusion. While an affirmative defense must be asserted in a responsive pleading, \"it need not be articulated with any rigorous degree of specificity, and is sufficiently raised for purposes of Rule 8 by its bare assertion.\"\n   <em>\n    Zotos v. Lindbergh Sch.

Although the Twelfth Affirmative Defense may not be a model of clarity, given INA's argument that asbestos is part of the pollution exclusion in this case I conclude that INA sufficiently pleaded all of its \"asbestos exclusions,\" including the pollution exclusion, as an affirmative defense for purposes of preserving it as an issue for summary judgment and/or trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <em>\n    Does the Pollution Exclusion Apply to Cotter?\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   INA contends that its pollution exclusion bars coverage of the\n   <em>\n    Cotter\n   </em>\n   case because it\n   involved an \"irritant, contaminant, and/or pollutant\" which \"discharge[d], dispers[ed], release[d], or escape[d]\" into \"the atmosphere,\" thereby injuring the underlying decedent. According to the underlying suit, the decedent was exposed to asbestos through the air as she came into contact with her husband and his work clothes. INA argues that this type of contamination is covered by the plain language of the pollution exclusion, which precludes coverage for bodily injury \"arising out of the discharge, dispersal, release or escape of smoke, vapors, soot, fumes, acids, toxic chemicals, liquids or gases, waste materials or other irritants, contaminants or pollutants into or upon the land, the atmosphere or any water course or body of water....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   I agree that the plain language of the pollution exclusion bars coverage of the\n   <em>\n    Cotter\n   </em>\n   claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Interpretation of an insurance policy is a question of law.\n   <em>\n    Standard Artificial Limb, Inc. v.

The same reasoning applies in the case at bar. The allegations in\n   <em>\n    Cotter\n   </em>\n   alleged that asbestos and asbestos dust were ultra-hazardous and dispersed or released in the air by A-B, which created a dangerous and unreasonable risk of injury to the lungs and respiratory systems of those breathing that air and coming into contact with that dust, including the decedent.

According to ZAIC, this \"atmosphere\" language has been interpreted to mean that the exclusion applies only to \"traditional environmental pollution\" cases.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   This argument fails because it ignores the fact that the exposure at issue in the\n   <em>\n    Cotter\n   </em>\n   case occurred not to A-B's brewery employee inside the brewery but instead to his wife who was\n   <em>\n    outside\n   </em>\n   of the brewery. The\n   <em>\n    Cotter\n   </em>\n   lawsuit alleged that asbestos traveled from the A-B brewery on the clothes and person of the decedent's husband and was then released in the air when the decedent came into contact with her husband and his clothes in places outside of the brewery. Even if the Court adopts ZAIC's interpretation of \"atmosphere\" in this case, this type of release clearly and unambiguously constitutes a release \"in the atmosphere\" because it occurred outside the confines of the brewery's building. ZAIC offers no explanation - nor could it - of how the asbestos could travel from inside the brewery and come into contact with the decedent without also being released into the \"atmosphere.\" There is no ambiguity that the asbestos at issue in\n   <em>\n    Cotter\n   </em>\n   was released \"into the atmosphere\" under the terms of INA's pollution exclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Finally, under the terms of the policy INA bears the burden of demonstrating that the discharge or dispersal of asbestos was not \"sudden or accidental.\" ZAIC does not contest that INA met its burden of proof on this issue, and the Court concludes that INA has demonstrated that the asbestos at issue in\n   <em>\n    Cotter\n   </em>\n   was not suddenly or accidentally discharged, given the parties' stipulation that the decedent in\n   <em>\n    Cotter\n   </em>\n   was alleged to have inhaled and ingested the asbestos continuously for more than a decade. Additionally, A-B allegedly had knowledge of the dangers posed by the toxic dust when it released from the brewery and of the need for hygienic procedures to protect from these dangers, but failed and refused to implement any safety procedures, such as laundry services, to protect those at risk from these dangers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <em>\n    Conclusion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Because the INA's pollution exclusion unambiguously excludes coverage for the claims made against A-B in the\n   <em>\n    Cotter\n   </em>\n   case, INA has no obligation to contribute to the settlement amount or defense costs paid by ZAIC on behalf of A-B in the underlying suit. ZAIC's claims for equitable contribution, subrogation, and unjust enrichment against INA necessarily fail as a matter of law where INA's policy bars coverage. Because I conclude that INA is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on all claims asserted against it, I need not and therefore do not consider INA's alternative\n   argument in support of summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Accordingly,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS HEREBY ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that defendant Insurance Company of North America's motion for summary judgment [196] is granted as set forth above, defendant Insurance Company of North America shall have judgment in its favor on all claims asserted against it by plaintiff Zurich American Insurance Company; all claims asserted against defendant Insurance Company of North America by plaintiff Zurich American Insurance Company are dismissed with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS FURTHER ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that plaintiff Zurich American Insurance Company's motion for summary judgment [193] is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   A separate Judgment in accordance with this Memorandum and Order and the Memorandum and Order entered on May 8, 2018 is entered this same date.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    The complex procedural background of this case and my reasoning for ultimately dismissing A-B as a defendant based upon the Missouri case of\n    <em>\n     Nooter Corp. v.

But the text of the exclusion imposes limitations on its own scope separate from the definition of pollutant. For example, the absolute pollution exclusion applies only to harm caused by the \"discharge, dispersal, seepage, migration, release or escape\" of a pollutant. Thus, the exclusion will not apply, even in cases involving a pollutant, if the pollutant did not propagate in one of these enumerated ways.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Porterfield v.

So \"if a child were injured because he drank from a bottle of...[a] household product, even if that product properly could be classified as a 'pollutant,' the injury would not be covered by the pollution exclusion because the pollutant was not disseminated by one of the prescribed methods.\"\n    <em>\n     Lefrak Org., Inc. v.

First, we doubt that the Supreme Court of Missouri would apply\n    <em>\n     Hocker Oil\n    </em>\n    in the manner urged by Titan. As we recently observed,\n    <em>\n     Hocker Oil\n    </em>\n    's approach \"was a minority position when adopted, has been almost uniformly rejected by appellate courts in other jurisdictions, and has not since been cited or referred to favorably by the Supreme Court of Missouri.\"\n    <em>\n     Doe Run Res.

Indeed, not even Missouri's intermediate appellate courts have relied on this aspect of\n    <em>\n     Hocker Oil\n    </em>\n    in the fifteen years since the case was decided. This should come as no surprise, since\n    <em>\n     Hocker Oil\n    </em>\n    seems out of step with Missouri's deeply-entrenched rule that a court \"may not 'create an ambiguity in order to distort the language of an unambiguous policy, or, in order to enforce a particular construction which it might feel is more appropriate.' \"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6051687\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/719/868/#p875\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6051687\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/719/868/#p875\">\n     at 875-76\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (quoting\n    <em>\n     Rodriguez v.

Thus, we do not find\n    <em>\n     Hocker Oil\n    </em>\n    probative of how the Supreme Court of Missouri would decide this case.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    Second, even if\n    <em>\n     Hocker Oil\n    </em>\n    were to represent the best evidence of Missouri law, its unique facts differ substantially from those presented here. The insured in\n    <em>\n     Hocker Oil\n    </em>\n    purchased its insurance from the insurer's \"Gasoline Department,\" and, as a gas station operator, nearly all of its liability risk related in some way to gasoline. Under those circumstances, a reasonable insurance purchaser might be surprised to discover that its policy excludes categorically all harm arising out of the release of gasoline. For this reason, \"the court in\n    <em>\n     Hocker Oil\n    </em>\n    expressly limited its holding to gasoline.\"\n    <em>\n     Doe Run\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6051687\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/719/868/#p875\">\n     719 F.3d at 874\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . In contrast, sealing concrete floors represents only a portion-perhaps twenty-five percent-of Titan's business, and Titan uses a number of concrete sealants other than TIAH. Titan faces a wide range of liability risks unrelated to TIAH, and many of those risks would fall within the policy's coverage. Thus, we do not believe that\n    <em>\n     Hocker Oil\n    </em>\n    would obligate us to cast aside the unambiguous text of the policy.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4070184\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/751/880/#p884\">\n     751 F.3d at 885\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    The Court is aware that the exclusion at issue here is not considered an \"absolute pollution exclusion\" as that term is commonly used in insurance cases because it requires that the pollutant be \"released into or upon the land, the atmosphere or any water course or body of water\" and not be \"sudden or accidental.\" However, that distinction is irrelevant for purposes of determining whether the policy is ambiguous merely because it does not specify asbestos as a contaminant, irritant, or pollutant.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    ZAIC principally relies upon older cases from other jurisdictions in support of its argument. ECF No. 194 at 10-12. The Court has reviewed these authorities and does not find them persuasive in the factual context of the case. First, they rely on contractual interpretation principles requiring a narrow construction of exclusions favoring coverage for the insured. Missouri courts do not apply that principle when the language, as here, is unambiguous.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Doe Run\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12387022\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/531/508/#p512\">\n     531 S.W.3d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    512 ;\n    <em>\n     Cincinnati Ins.

These cases also read into the pollution exclusions an assumption that the clause applies only to \"traditional forms of environmental pollution\" despite the absence of such language in the policies, also in direct contradiction of Missouri's principles of contract interpretation. Moreover, they are easily distinguishable from the case at bar because, as explained, the exposure to the decedent in\n    <em>\n     Cotter\n    </em>\n    did not involve a contained release in a building.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
