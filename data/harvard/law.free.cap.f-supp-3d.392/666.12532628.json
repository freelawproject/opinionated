Truncale, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiff True Health Diagnostics LLC (\"THD\") moves for a preliminary injunction against Defendants Alex M. Azar, II, the United States Department of Health and Human Services Secretary, and Seema Verma, Administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (collectively, \"CMS\"), seeking to enjoin CMS from \"suspending, escrowing, recouping, or withholding any Medicare or Medicaid\n   Payments from True Health.\" [Dkt. 20]. CMS opposes the Motion, asserting that the Court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction and that THD fails to carry its burden of establishing all four elements needed for a preliminary injunction. [Dkt. 25]. Because the Court finds that it lacks subject-matter jurisdiction, THD's Motion for a Preliminary Injunction is DENIED. But even if the Court had subject-matter jurisdiction, THD's Motion would be denied because Plaintiff failed to meet its burden of establishing all four elements for a preliminary injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   THD provides nationwide diagnostic services, consisting primarily of blood and urine testing, for Medicare beneficiaries. THD provides such services by (1) testing samples from physicians in their lab in either Frisco, Texas, or Richmond, Virginia; or (2) managing outpatient labs in hospitals partnered with THD. Most of THD's 400 employees are lab technicians and billers. Approximately 20% of all THD patients are currently Medicare patients, and 30% of THD revenue comes from CMS [Dkt. 3-2, \u00b6 4]. Private providers supply the remaining 70% of revenue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. 2017 and 2019 CMS Payment Suspensions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On May 25, 2017, CMS suspended 100% of THD's Medicare payments, without prior notice, based on \"credible allegations of fraud\" pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20405.372\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.372\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   [Pl.'s Ex. A, Dkt. 35]. As part of its May 26, 2017 letter of suspension (the \"May 2017 Letter\"), CMS listed eight claims, including claim control numbers and dates of services, that failed to meet Medicare guidelines. [Pl.'s Ex. A, Dkt. 35]. The May 2017 Letter noted that the list of eight claims \"is not exhaustive or complete in any sense, as the investigation into this matter is continuing.\" [Pl.'s Ex. A, Dkt. 35]. THD submitted a rebuttal statement on June 5, 2017 [Pl.'s Ex. B, Dkt. 35], and CMS responded with a refusal to lift the suspension [Pl.'s Ex. C, Dkt. 35]. On June 23, 2017, CMS reduced the suspension to 35% (the \"2017 Suspension\"). [Dkt. 9-1].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On June 11, 2019, while the 2017 Suspension was in place, CMS implemented a second suspension of Medicare payments based on \"recent credible allegations of fraud\" (the \"2019 Suspension\"). The June 13, 2019 letter of suspension (the \"June 2019 Letter\") concerning the second suspension explained that the 2019 Suspension \"is distinct from the suspension that was implemented on May 25, 2017.\" [Pl.'s Ex. I, Dkt. 35]. The June 2019 Letter provided a list of five allegedly fraudulent claims and, like the May 2017 Letter, noted that the list \"is not exhaustive or complete in any sense.\" [Pl.'s Ex. I, Dkt. 35]. THD submitted its rebuttal statement concerning the 2019 suspension on June 25, 2019. [Pl.'s Ex. J, Dkt. 35].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On July 2, 2019, THD brought suit against CMS for the 2017 and 2019 Suspensions. Specifically, THD alleges five causes of action for CMS's actions: (1) violation of procedural due process; (2) violation of substantive due process; (3) violation of the Administrative Procedure Act; (4) mandamus; and (5) declaratory judgment. [Dkt. 2].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The next day, on July 3, 2019, THD filed an Emergency Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order, seeking a temporary restraining order (\"TRO\") that enjoins CMS from \"suspending, escrowing, or withholding any further Medicare or Medicaid reimbursements for such a time as to allow the parties to brief and argue a motion for a preliminary injunction\" and for the \"release of the checks that CMS has made out to True Health since June 13, 2019, but not delivered.\" [Dkt. 3 at 2]. THD argued that it has a substantial likelihood of success on its due process claims, it would suffer irreparable harm in the form of bankruptcy or liquidation by July 8 if not provided injunctive relief, the balance of hardships favors THD, and the injunctive relief would serve the public interest. CMS responded to the TRO motion on July 5, 2019. [Dkt. 9 &amp; 10].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On July 5, 2019, CMS issued a letter notifying THD of an overpayment determination as to the 2017 suspension and issued several letters to THD through Qlarant, a Medicare contractor, informing THD of the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   \u2022 CMS terminated the 35% 2017 suspension but that \"[t]he separate 100% payment suspension that was implanted on June 11, 2019 will remain in effect.\" [Pl.'s Ex. K, Dkt. 35].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \u2022 CMS determined that THD received an overpayment of $27,467,142.30 for Medicare services. [Pl.'s Ex. K, Dkt. 35].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \u2022 The CDs attached to the second and third letter contained encrypted results of the overpayment determination, including details for each claim line reviewed. [Pl.'s Ex. K, Dkt. 35].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Novitas Solutions, another Medicare contractor, issued two more letters to THD that explained why THD was responsible for the overpayment, the rebuttal process, interest assessment, recoupment, payment for the overpay amount, the appeals process, and various other actions THD may take after receiving the overpayment determination. [Dkt. 29-1, 29-2].\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On July 8, 2019, the Court granted the TRO. [Dkt. 12]. Neither party provided the Court with evidence of CMS's overpayment determination of the 2017 Suspension until after it had entered the TRO. The TRO preserved the status quo of a 35% suspension by enjoining CMS \"from suspending, escrowing, or otherwise withholding more than 35% of True Health's Medicare or Medicaid payments\" until July 18, 2019. [Dkt. 12]. The Court also ordered THD to pay a nominal bond for the TRO. [Dkt. 23]. THD subsequently filed a Motion for Preliminary Injunction. [Dkt. 20]. CMS timely responded to the Preliminary Injunction Motion, arguing the injunction should be denied because the Court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction and that THD fails to meet its burden of establishing all four elements for a preliminary injunction. [Dkt. 25].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On July 17, 2019, the Court held a show cause hearing for the preliminary injunction with all parties and counsel present. Christian Richards, THD's Chief Financial\n   Officer, testified at the hearing. THD also conceded at the hearing that because CMS has made an overpayment determination concerning the 2017 Suspension, THD can now begin the administrative appeals process for the 2017 Suspension. As of this Order, CMS has made no overpayment determination concerning the June 2019 Suspension.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

The federal statutes and regulations outlining CMS's suspension and administrative appeals process are publicly available so THD knew or should have known about the administrative procedures before deciding to participate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Additionally, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Family Rehabilitation\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   , THD's health services will cause less disruption to Medicare patients. THD is a diagnostics laboratory, usually performing tests in an early stage of a disease progression. If THD were to file for bankruptcy or to liquidate, there is a low risk of patient disruption because patients using THD's services seek diagnostic testing and not an immediate health service. Moreover, these patients do not know where their medical samples are being tested because it is the physicians who are choosing which diagnostics laboratory to use. Further, as presented at the preliminary injunction hearing, there are over 3,500 diagnostic laboratories nationwide that provide similar services as THD. Even if THD were to close, the physicians have plenty of options to choose from and patient samples can be tested at numerous other labs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   This Court cannot deem the exhaustion requirement waived since both requirements (1) entirely collateral claims, and (2) full relief cannot be obtained at a post-deprivation hearing, have not been met.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <em>\n    Family Rehab.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516449\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/886/496/#p501\">\n    886 F.3d at 501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Hawkins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6051222\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/635/155/#p159\">\n    635 F.3d 155\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 159 (5th Cir. 2011) (\"Federal law does not prohibit these payment holds ...

Without a property interest, this is no risk of an erroneous deprivation. Further, the Government's interest here in protecting the integrity of Medicare against fraud and its interest in the administrative process outweigh THD's nonexistent property interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   A comparison between THD's specific allegations and federal regulations further reveals that THD does not have a substantial likelihood of success for its procedural due process claim. THD's first allegation-that CMS violated its procedural due process right by suspending its Medicare reimbursements \"indefinitely without providing any pre- or post-deprivation process to challenge the actual basis of the suspension\"-is meritless for several reasons. First, CMS can suspend payment without notice if the suspension is based on credible allegations of fraud.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20405.372\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.372\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4) (\"If the intended suspension of payment involves credible allegations of fraud under \u00a7 405.371(a)(2), CMS in consultation with OIG and, as appropriate, the Department of Justice determines ... if prior notice is appropriate.\"). Second, as THD concedes, there are post-deprivation procedurals in place to challenge the suspension, including the rebuttal statement and appeals process.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20405.372\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.372\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) (\"[T]he Medicare contractor must, once the suspension is in effect, give the provider or supplier an opportunity to submit a rebuttal statement as to why the suspension should be removed.\");\n   <extracted-citation index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20405.904\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.904\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2). Indeed, THD has already participated in the post-deprivation procedure by submitting rebuttal statements for the 2017 and 2019 Suspensions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [Dkt. 3-11, 3-12]. And now, with the CMS determination on the 2017 Suspension, THD can begin the four-step administrative appeals process. Third, contrary to THD's allegation CMS has not suspended its Medicare reimbursements indefinitely, nor could it because federal regulations prohibit indefinite suspension. As mentioned, CMS must reevaluate every 180 days whether good cause exist to not continue the suspension.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20405.371\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.371\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(i). In addition, CMS must end the suspension after 18 months unless\n   the case has been referred to, and is being considered by, the OIG for administrative action or the Department of Justice requests that the suspension continue.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20405.371\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.371\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3)(ii). Here, CMS terminated the 2017 Suspension on July 5, 2019, and the 2019 Suspension has been in place for just over a month-this is hardly an indefinite suspension and well within the 180 days or 18 months limit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   THD's second allegation, that CMS has repeatedly extended the 2017 Suspension without providing THD any pre- or post-deprivation process to challenge the basis of the suspension, is moot due to CMS's July 5th overpayment determination concerning the 2017 Suspension. Even if it were not moot, as discussed above, CMS can extend the suspension, does not need to provide prior notice, and THD can challenge the suspension post-deprivation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   THD's third allegation-that CMS imposed the 2019 Suspension based on the same claims that were part of the 2017 Suspension, which effectively allows them to exceed existing regulatory time limits-likewise lacks a substantial likelihood of success. THD argues its Exhibit L, a document containing excerpts of the claims CMS investigated as part of its 2017 Suspension, shows that some of the claims CMS investigate as part of its 2017 Suspension also served as the basis for its 2019 Suspension. First, determining whether the 2017 Suspension was based on the same claims as the 2019 Suspension forces the Court to \"examine the merits of the underlying dispute, delve into the statute and regulations, or make independent judgments as to plaintiffs' eligibility under a statute,\" which the Court cannot do.\n   <em>\n    Family Rehab., Inc. v. Azar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516449\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/886/496/#p501\">\n    886 F.3d 496\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018). Second, even if the Court could engage in this substantive analysis, THD failed to show (a) the 2019 Suspension was based on the same claims as the 2017 Suspension; and (b) that implementing two suspensions on overlapping claims is prohibited. The June 2019 Letter specifically noted that the five claims listed were \"not exhaustive or complete in any sense.\" So even if those five claims were investigated as part of the 2017 Suspension, the 2019 Suspension could include other claims that were not subject to the 2017 Suspension. If there are prohibited overlapping claims in the 2019 Suspension that were part of the 2017 Suspension, CMS needs time to investigate that. As to THD's extension of regulatory time limits, CMS implemented the 2019 Suspension approximately a month ago and terminated the 2017 Suspension on July 5, 2019. CMS's actions are well-within the regulatory time limits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   THD's fourth allegation concerning CMS's refusal to make an overpayment determination is moot as to 2017 Suspension and premature as to the 2019 Suspension.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Finally, THD's contention that CMS violated procedural due process by allegedly making an overpayment determination about the 2017 Suspension in September 2017 and January 2018, but failing to inform THD until July 2019, also does not have a substantial likelihood of success. Assuming CMS did make a final determination in September 2017 or January 2018, THD cites no federal regulation or law that mandates when CMS must disclose that determination within a set time limit-much less that it exceeded the time limit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   None of THD's procedural due process allegations show a substantial likelihood of success. THD does not point to a single statutory provision CMS has violated. Instead, THD generally complains about the\n   <em>\n    speed\n   </em>\n   of the administrative process. But there is no constitutional provision, statute,\n   or federal law of any kind, that mandates a government agency to move at the speed a party demands-particularly when the agency complies with the regulatory time limits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   <strong>\n    b. THD does not show a substantial likelihood of success for its substantive due process Claim.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   All of THD's substantive due process claims sound in procedural due process, which lacks a substantial likelihood of success.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [Dkt. 2, \u00b6\u00b6 78-92]. Regardless, as discussed, THD does not have a property interest in Medicare payments so it did not show a substantial likelihood of success for its substantive due process claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <strong>\n    c.

Here, THD does not lack other adequate remedies. It is proceeding through the administrative process with both its 2017 Suspension and its 2019 Suspension. THD fails to show a \"clear right to relief,\" and there lacks \"a clear duty\" for CMS to act in the manner THD demands. As such, THD did not demonstrate a likelihood of success for its mandamus claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   <strong>\n    e.

In the Medicare context, \"the combined threats of going out of business and disruption to Medicare patients are sufficient for irreparable injury.\"\n   <em>\n    Family Rehab. v. Azar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516449\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/886/496/#p501\">\n    886 F.3d 496\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 504 (5th Cir. 2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   THD argues it faces irreparable harm because, without injunctive relief, it will seek \"bankruptcy protection or liquidation outside of bankruptcy immediately\" and its closure \"may deprive patients of these crucial diagnostic services, causing patient health to suffer.\" [Dkt. 3-2, \u00b6\u00b6 9, 10]. Yet little evidence supports either harm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   First, THD failed to establish it is likely to close due to any Medicare payment suspension. As previously mentioned, unlike the plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Family Rehabilitation\n   </em>\n   , which derived \"between 88 and 94 percent\" of its revenue from Medicare-reimbursable services, THD receives only 30% of its revenue from Medicare.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Family Rehab.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516449\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/886/496/#p501\">\n    886 F.3d at 499\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In addition, Medicare only accounts for 20% of THD's expenses. [Dkt. 3-2, \u00b6 4]. Based on the financial information presented and Mr. Richards's testimony, THD stands to make a profit from the Medicare services of its business-even with a 35% payment suspension. For example, THD's total revenue in 2016 was $160.9 million, and its total expenses was $117.8 million. [Defs.'s Ex. 3 at 2, Dkt. 36]. Of those amounts, approximately $48.27 million in revenue (30%) was attributable to CMS and approximately $23.56 million in expenses (20%) was attributable to Medicare costs, resulting in a profit $24.71 million from Medicare services.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although THD did not present specific financial information concerning 2018, Mr. Richards testified that\n   the Medicare portion of THD's business in 2018 decreased by approximately 25% in revenue and $2.4 million in expenses due to CMS's actions (as opposed to market changes). Using the 2016 financial information as a basis, Mr. Richards agreed that THD received approximately $23.53 million\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   in revenue from CMS and spent approximately $21.2 million\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   in Medicare expenses in 2018-resulting in a profit of just over two million dollars. THD failed to show how a suspension of Medicare payments, even at 100%, would cause irreparable harm-particularly because THD derives 70% of its revenue from private payers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Essentially, THD is asking for a government bailout. THD cannot secure funding from private investors to allegedly keep the company solvent and instead demands the federal government save it from the verge of alleged bankruptcy. Even if THD is on the brink of bankruptcy, the government has no obligation to save a private company that cannot convince its private investors to invest. THD voluntarily entered into the Medicare program. And it voluntarily structured its business so that approximately 30% of its revenue is Medicare dependent-even after CMS implemented the 2017 Suspension. This Court will not compel taxpayers to bail out a company because it failed to properly manage its finances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Second, even if THD established imminent bankruptcy, it failed to show patient disruption. Again, unlike the\n   <em>\n    Family Rehabilitation\n   </em>\n   plaintiff that provided home healthcare services to patients, THD provides diagnostic lab testing services to physicians and does not provide patient-based services. It is undisputed that over 3,500 certified laboratory companies provide similar services and do business with Medicare. And although THD contests that its lab model is different from other lab companies, THD conceded at the Hearing that its customers (the physicians) can send the lab samples \"wherever they want to send\" for testing. Thus, should THD close, no patients are uprooted from a hospital or denied services; nor are any patient services, home healthcare or otherwise, disrupted. Instead, should THD close, physicians would merely send their lab samples elsewhere for testing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   <strong>\n    3. THD's threatened injury does not outweigh the damage that the preliminary injunction might cause CMS.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   The balance of hardships tips in CMS's favor. In contrast to THD's economic risk and low risk of patient disruption, if any, CMS's interest in preserving the integrity of the Medicare program is high. Undisputedly, the federal government has a strong interest in protecting the Medicare program against financial loss and fraud.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   <strong>\n    4. The preliminary injunction will disserve the public interest.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   The public interest is served by requiring compliance with Congressional statutes.\n   <em>\n    Sparrow Barns &amp; Events v. Ruth Farm, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 4:19-cv-67,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20WL%201560442\">\n    2019 WL 1560442\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *10 (E.D. Tex. Apr. 10, 2019). Congress designed an intricate process that serves the public by allowing CMS an opportunity to investigate allegations of fraud, providing the aggrieved party multiple levels of review, and having the courts act as a check on agency action through\n   judicial review. To allow THD to circumvent the administrative process and have unfettered access to Medicare funds-paid by the public-while CMS investigates credible allegations of fraud would surely disserve the public.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Although the Court is cognizant of parties who are denied their procedural due right process because CMS fails to follow statutory regulations (e.g., failing to provide an ALJ hearing within 90 days), that is not the case here. Medicare is a voluntary program. THD chose to provide Medicare services, chose to make 30% of its revenue Medicare dependent, and chose to continue providing Medicare services after CMS imposed a suspension in 2017. THD cannot circumvent the administrative process because it wants to be paid according to the schedule it demands. This Court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction to grant the preliminary injunctions, but even if it had jurisdiction, THD failed to meet its burden of establishing all four requirements for a preliminary injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that Plaintiff True Health Diagnostics, LLC's Motion for a Preliminary Injunction [Dkt. 20] is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-112\">\n    CMS contends the 2017 Suspension is the subject of a qui tam case pending in the Easter District of Texas's Sherman Division (Case No. 4:16-cv-547). THD contends the qui tam case is unrelated to this case. Because there is no motion to transfer before the Court, and because such a determination is unnecessary at this time, the Court makes no determination as to whether the qui tam case is related to this case.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-113\">\n    These exhibits are attached to THD's Reply in Support of its Motion for a Preliminary Injunction. [Dkt. 29]. During a conference on July 16, 2019, the CMS orally moved to strike THD's Reply because it was filed after the July 11, 2019 deadline for Plaintiff to file \"additional supporting papers for the preliminary injunction, if any.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    [Dkt. 16]. THD timely filed its Motion for a Preliminary Injunction on July 11, 2019, but did not file its Reply until July 16, 2019. Because THD may file a reply pursuant to Local Rule CV-7(f) and could not have filed it earlier than July 16, 2019 as CMS filed its Response on July 15, 2019, the Court denies CMS's oral motion to strike THD's Reply in Support of its Motion for a Preliminary Injunction [Dkt. 29].\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-114\">\n    Both \u00a7 405(g) and (h) have been made applicable to Medicare.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395ff(b)(1)(A) (making section 405(g) applicable to Medicare).\n    <em>\n     Cf.\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Shalala v.
