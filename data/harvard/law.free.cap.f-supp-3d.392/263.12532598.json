Cotto may go forward only with his claims for damages related to his allegedly compelled attendance at a February 11, 2016 Union rally and an order for the Union to accept his resignation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On August 8, 2012, the Power Authority hired Cotto as an electrical maintenance technician. Proposed Am. Compl. \u00b6 3. Contingent upon his employment, the Power Authority required Cotto to be a dues-paying Union member, even though Cotto opposed the Union's political stances and bargaining positions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4. In particular, Cotto complains that the Union engages in activism unrelated to workplace issues and uses \"union facilities and resources[ ] for leftist groups, marches, and demonstrations against the USA, Free Market, Free World, [and] Private Property Rights.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Cotto further asserts that the Union requires him to participate in the very political activism with which he disagrees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11. Cotto's proposed amended complaint specifically describes two such occurrences.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   First, Cotto complains that, on June 17, 2014, the Union held a General Assembly in which Union leaders forced the membership to approve a strike.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11(a). After the vote, Union leaders \"oblige[d]\" the members to march on Plaza Las Americas \"to disrupt its commercial activities and to 'attack the exploitation of the rich against the people.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11(b). Cotto claims that he disagreed with the strike and the sentiments that the Union leaders expressed at the march.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Second, on February 10 and 11, 2016, the Union demonstrated against the Puerto\n   Rico legislature's restructuring of the Power Authority.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 8, 11(c). Cotto alleges that he attended the February 11 demonstration, but that the Union excused him from the February 10 demonstration because of \"an accident that occurred with a colleague in the Barranquitas Technical Station.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On September 13, 2016,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   as a result of Cotto's alleged failure to attend the February 11 demonstration, the Union's Discipline Committee fined Cotto $200.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 7-9.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Discipline Committee sent Cotto \"several letters\" about the fine, but Cotto believed that the Union's attempt to enforce its policy requiring members to attend protests \"was so intrusive, persecutory and discriminatory,\" so did not respond to them.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On May 29, 2017, the Union filed a civil suit to recover the fine and attorneys' fees in the Caguas, Puerto Rico Municipal Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Cotto also objects to a variety of other Union practices. Cotto alleges that the Union \"unexpected[ly] calls\" union members encouraging them to: (1) not work on certain days, (2) report all vehicles as being \"unusable,\" (3) not work overtime, and (4) deliberately delay work to reduce efficiency and productivity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11(d). Furthermore, Cotto states that the Union's protests consisted of \"foul language, insults, and drinking,\" which created a \"hostile environment\" for Union members, such as Cotto, who \"respect others\" for their personal beliefs and morals.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11(g). According to Cotto, the Union also conducted an illegal secondary boycott of Banco Popular, an affiliate of Cotto's wife's longtime employer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6. Cotto's proposed amended complaint omits several details about this supposed secondary boycott: For instance, although he says the Union \"obliged\" him to participate, he does not say whether he did participate or if the Union threatened to, or actually did, impose adverse employment consequences on him for refusing to participate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19. Nor does Cotto's proposed amended complaint allege when those demonstrations took place.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Additionally, Cotto alleges that he attempted to resign his Union membership in September 2018.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10. Cotto sent the Union a resignation letter, which argued that the Supreme Court's recent decision in\n   <em>\n    Janus\n   </em>\n   permitted him to quit the Union.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   In October 2018, the Union's president sent Cotto a letter asserting that\n   <em>\n    Janus\n   </em>\n   did not alter the legality of the Union's union shop agreement with the\n   Power Authority and refused to accept Cotto's resignation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Cotto filed his original complaint on July 5, 2017. Compl. 1. Cotto's original complaint contained three \"causes of action\" alleging: (1) violations of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution; (2) violations of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth or Fourteenth Amendment\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   to the United States Constitution; and (3) violations of the Puerto Rico constitution.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 13-21. In his original complaint, Cotto demanded $300,000 in compensatory damages and $300,000 in punitive damages.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 24-25(a). He also sought a permanent injunction against the Union, requiring it to \"respect his Free Speech and Free Association rights\" and to \"refrain from further engaging in adverse union member action based on ideological beliefs.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Union moved to dismiss the original complaint pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and (b)(6). Mot. Dismiss Under Rule 12(b)(1) &amp; (6) Fed. R. Civ. P. (\"Union Mot. Dismiss\"), ECF No. 9. The parties fully briefed the motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp'n Def.'s Mot.

Minute Order. On April 5, 2019, Cotto purported to file an \"amended complaint.\" Proposed Am. Compl. 1. The proposed amended complaint largely restates the original complaint's allegations, \"causes of action,\" and prayer for relief.\n   <em>\n    Compare generally\n   </em>\n   Proposed Am. Compl.\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Compl. In addition, the proposed amended complaint asserts that the Union thwarted Cotto's attempt to resign from the Union and asks the Court to order the Union to allow him to resign.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Proposed Am. Compl. \u00b6 12. On April 25, 2019, the Union moved to dismiss Cotto's proposed amended complaint, which Cotto opposed on May 18, 2019. Mot. Dismiss. Proposed Am. Compl.

The Court construes these post-motion hearing filings as briefing on a motion for leave to amend the complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Minute Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   After careful consideration of the parties' submissions with respect to both the motions to dismiss and for leave, the Court ALLOWS Cotto's motion for leave to file his amended complaint, ECF No. 46, only to the extent that the proposed amended complaint theorizes that Cotto's compelled attendance at the February 11, 2016 rally and inability to resign from the Union violates the First Amendment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Proposed Am.

Consequently, the Court orders the Power Authority joined as a defendant in this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 19(a)(2) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ.
