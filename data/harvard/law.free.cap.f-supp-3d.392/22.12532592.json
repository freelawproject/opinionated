That was the year that Congress enacted HIPAA, a law designed in part to improve the availability and continuity of health insurance coverage in the individual and group markets.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pub. L. No. 104-191,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=110%20Stat.%201936\">\n    110 Stat. 1936\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . HIPAA amended the Public Health Service Act (\"PHS Act\") to create federal standards for \"individual health insurance coverage.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PHS Act \u00a7 2741,\n   <em>\n    codified at\n   </em>\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-41,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   In doing so, the law defined \"individual health insurance coverage\" to mean \"health insurance coverage offered to individuals in the individual market, but [that] does not include short-term limited duration insurance.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=110%20Stat.%201936\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 300gg-91(b)(5). That is, Congress in HIPAA exempted STLDI from individual market regulations. Congress did not, however, define what coverage constitutes STLDI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   HIPAA also imposed several reforms on the individual health insurance market. For those seeking individual policies, the law guaranteed coverage availability and preexisting condition protections to \"eligible individual[s],\" i.e., persons with \"18 or more months\" of \"creditable coverage,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=110%20Stat.%201936\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 300gg-41(a)(1), (b)(1)(A), without any \"significant breaks in coverage\" lasting 63 or more days,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=110%20Stat.%201936\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 300gg-3(c)(2)(A). HIPAA defined \"creditable coverage\" to include most forms of health coverage, including STLDI (notwithstanding STLDI's exemption from individual health insurance regulations).\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=110%20Stat.%201936\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 300gg-3(c)(1)(B); H.R.

In addition, HIPAA capped the period during which a group health insurer could exclude benefits for preexisting conditions to 12 months from enrollment (or 18 months for late enrollees) and required that the period be \"reduced by the aggregate of the periods of creditable coverage\" for the individual seeking to participate in the plan. HIPAA, Pub. L. No. 104-191, \u00a7 2701(a)(2)-(3). In sum, individuals who changed plans under certain circumstances were afforded day-for-day credit for their previous coverage, which served to protect them in full or in part from benefit denials for preexisting conditions under their new coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   With Congress having created and exempted an undefined category of health insurance, the Departments, predictably, stepped in to give STLDI meaning. In April 1997, during the Clinton Administration, the Departments published an interim final rule (\"1997 Rule\") defining STLDI as \"health insurance coverage provided\n   pursuant to a contract with an issuer that has an expiration date specified in the contract (taking into account any extensions that may be elected by the policyholder without the issuer's consent) that is within 12 months of the date such contract becomes effective.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=62%20Fed.%20Reg.%2016%2C894\">\n    62 Fed.

Not among the ACA's reforms was any change to HIPAA's definition of \"individual health insurance coverage,\" which expressly excluded STLDI.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-91(b)(5). Accordingly, STLDI remained exempt under the ACA from individual health insurance market regulations, including those imposed by the ACA. STLDI also remained statutorily undefined.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The ACA's most well-known feature, of course, is the so-called \"individual mandate,\" which requires individuals to maintain \"minimum essential coverage\"-e.g., purchasing a QHP on an Exchange,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5000A(f)(1)(C) -or pay a tax penalty.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407356\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/519/#p538\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 5000A(a) - (b).

But, as of January 1, 2019, those exemptions are effectively moot, as Congress's Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (\"TJCA\") reduced the tax penalty amount to $0 for all individuals, effective at the beginning of this year.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Budget Fiscal Year, 2018, Pub.

Two years later, in 2016, the Departments during the Obama Administration became \"concerned\" that individuals were \"purchasing [STLDI] coverage as their primary form of health coverage\" and that STLDI issuers might \"target[ ]\" \"healthier individuals, ... thus adversely impacting the risk pool for Affordable Care Act-compliant coverage.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=81%20Fed.%20Reg.%2075%2C316\">\n    81 Fed. Reg. 75,316\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 75,317 -18 (Oct. 31, 2016). In other words, the Departments were worried that as the cost for ACA-compliant plans rose, more and more healthy individuals would be incented to exit the ACA Exchanges and purchase cheaper health coverage options like STLDI. Accordingly, the Departments adopted a final rule (\"2016 Rule\") that redefined STLDI \"so that the coverage must be less than three months in duration, including any period for which the policy may be renewed.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=81%20Fed.%20Reg.%2075%2C316\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=81%20Fed.%20Reg.%2075%2C316\">\n    at 75,318\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The 2016 Rule thus reduced the maximum term and duration of STLDI from less than twelve to less than three months, and it effectively prohibited renewals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Just days after the 2016 Rule was finalized, American voters elected a new Administration with, to say the least, different views from the previous Administration regarding competition and choice in health insurance markets. On January 20, 2017, President Trump issued an Executive Order stating his Administration's policy \"to seek the prompt repeal of the [ACA]\" and ordering agencies with authority and responsibilities under the ACA to take all possible legal steps \"to minimize the unwarranted economic and regulatory burdens of the Act,\" provide relief from \"regulatory burden[s] on individuals, families, health care providers, health insurers, patients,\" and maximize \"options for patients and consumers.\" Exec.

The Departments stepped in the following year to define STLDI as plans lasting less than 12 months with unlimited issuer-consented renewals, and they finalized that definition in 2004.\n   <em>\n    Thirteen years\n   </em>\n   passed between the 1997 interim rule and the ACA's enactment in 2010. Over that period, the Departments exercised the authority to define STLDI without challenge or resistance. The ACA's passage did not alter this status quo! In fact, the ACA-which in so many ways constituted a sea change to the provision of individual health insurance in the United States-retained\n   <em>\n    untouched\n   </em>\n   HIPAA's exception of STLDI from individual market insurance regulations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-91(b)(5). And it was not for another\n   <em>\n    six years\n   </em>\n   after the ACA's enactment that the Departments revisited STLDI, in an effort to protect the single risk pools and relieve pressure on the struggling individual Exchange markets.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=81%20Fed.%20Reg.%2075%2C316\">\n    81 Fed.

Moreover, as the administrative record shows, the Departments expressly considered adopting an \"initial contract term [that] was somewhat longer than less than 3 months,\" such as, \"for example, less than 9 months.\" 83 Fed. Reg. at 38,218. The Departments decided against a 6- or 9-month limitation out of concern that a shorter term would be less effective in helping individuals maintain continuous coverage.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   While plaintiffs may disagree with this policy objective,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pls.'

As such, I cannot conclude on this record that the 2018 Rule's definition of \"short-term\" is an impermissible statutory construction under\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   's second step.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   As for the word \"duration,\" that word obviously means \"the time during which something exists or lasts.\"\n   <em>\n    Duration,\n   </em>\n   Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/duration (last visited July 18, 2019).

The 2018 Rule permits renewals up to 36 months of total coverage. That construction is obviously consistent with the ordinary meaning of \"limited duration,\" as \"the time during which [the coverage] exists or lasts\" is \"circumscribed within definite limits\" and \"restricted\" to 36 months. And, of course, it must be remembered that from 1997 to 2016 the Departments permitted\n   <em>\n    unlimited\n   </em>\n   issuer-consented renewals. Thus, the 2018 Rule constitutes the\n   <em>\n    most onerous\n   </em>\n   interpretation of \"limited duration\" in the phrase's history, at least as applied to the \"healthy individuals\" who previously could secure issuer-consented renewals and who plaintiffs now fear will exploit renewals to avoid the ACA-compliant market,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pls.'

For the same reasons that HIPAA's structure and purpose do not preclude the 2018 Rule,\n   <em>\n    see supra\n   </em>\n   at pp.30-31, the Rule permissibly construes HIPAA in a manner that fits within the law's statutory scheme and conforms to its purposes. Relevant here, HIPAA was enacted \"to improve portability and continuity of health insurance coverage in the group and individual markets.\" Pub. L. No. 104-191 pmbl. The law accomplished these purposes in part through coverage and preexisting condition protections, the availability of which was contingent on a person's prior \"creditable coverage.\" As such, it was reasonable for the Departments to extend STLDI's initial term to twelve months, as under HIPAA's scheme that would have (1) helped individuals more easily maintain an uninterrupted period of prior \"creditable coverage\" to become eligible for the law's protections (and avoid the \"significant break in coverage\" that could negate eligibility), and (2) in some cases, reduced the period during which a new issuer could refuse benefits to a participant relating to preexisting conditions. As STLDI plans typically lack preexisting condition protections, it is not hard to imagine situations where an individual who developed a medical condition while covered by STLDI-and thus was at risk of losing coverage-would be better positioned to access HIPAA's protections if their STLDI coverage lasted up to a year rather than three months.

To be sure, the ACA's various reforms are interdependent and were designed to work together as features of the individual Exchange markets. However, Congress clearly did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   intend for the law to apply to all species of individual health insurance. In addition to maintaining the STLDI exemption, Congress exempted multiple forms of individual health insurance from the ACA's reforms and the State-specific risk pools.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   In other words, lawmakers were not rigidly pursuing the ACA-compliant market at all costs, e.g., at the risk of individuals going without insurance altogether. Moreover, while Congress certainly sought to foster a robust ACA-compliant market, its chosen methods for doing so were embodied by the individual mandate and tax penalty,\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   the definition of STLDI! Congress has since functionally eliminated those mechanisms, which, as the ACA itself predicted, would result in \"some individuals ... mak[ing] an economic and financial decision to forego health insurance coverage.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"200\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201809\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1809\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2)(A);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    King,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12590981\" index=\"201\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2480/#p2489\">\n    135 S.Ct. at 2486\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Congress found that the guaranteed issue and community rating requirements would not work without the [individual responsibility] requirement.\").
