The parties' dispute centers on redactions made to documents discussing how to handle press inquiries about the meeting, and in particular the Department's withholding of \"talking points\" prepared for Attorney General Lynch. The parties previously cross-moved for summary judgment, and the Court granted judgment for the Department on all documents except two for which the Court determined it lacked sufficient context. The Court ordered the parties to file renewed motions for summary judgment on those documents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Upon review of those new submissions, and for largely the same reasons described in its prior opinion, the Court will grant the Department's motion, deny ACLJ's cross-motion, and enter judgment for the Department.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

And this privilege, the Court held, extended to even those \"final\" versions of talking points prepared by staffers for Attorney General Lynch.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9179841\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/337/146/#p174\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This is so because the \"final decision\" of the agency was what the senior official-here, Attorney General Lynch-ultimately said to the media.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9179841\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/337/146/#p174\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Upon consideration of the additional context provided by the Department in its renewed motion, the Court finds that the withheld attachment also falls within the ambit of the deliberative-process privilege and Exemption 5. The Department official represents that these talking points were prepared by Department staff for Attorney General Lynch in anticipation of her future interactions with the public and the press about her announcement that she was accepting the FBI's recommendation to close the investigation into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Brinkmann Decl. \u00b6 7. And so, like the other sets of talking points withheld by the Department, the attachment constitutes a recommendation by subordinates to their superior advising her how to respond to inquiries. It is, in that respect, both predecisional and deliberative, reflecting a part of the give-and-take between the drafter and the Attorney General leading up to her external interactions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ACLJ\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526728\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/325/162/#p165\">\n    325 F. Supp. 3d at 173\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[A] senior official-especially one as high-ranking as the Attorney General-may\n   elect to use all, some, or none of the talking points prepared for her.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In response, ACLJ insists that the Department has not provided enough context for the Court to determine whether the withheld talking points remain protected under the privilege. See ECF No. 31-1 (\"Pl.'s MSJ Br.\") at 3. It argues that \"the agency fails to explain whether a superior reviewed and approved the final draft forwarded by staff in the attached email; whether the memorandum was reviewed and used by the Attorney General; whether it was followed closely ... [;] and/or how it has been used in dealings with the public.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526728\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/325/162/#p165\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   But these objections, much like those raised in its prior summary judgment motion, do not undermine the Court's conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   To begin with, it is not entirely clear what \"superior[s]\" ACLJ is referring to, and, in any event, how that information would alter the analysis. As the Department official declares, and the unredacted email confirms, these draft talking points were sent directly to the Office of the Attorney General \"for her use.\" Brinkmann Decl. \u00b6 7;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 25-2 at 20. To the extent that other intermediaries were involved before the Attorney General-and there is no indication from the record, including the results of the Department's search, that that was the case-the recommended talking points would remain just that: recommendations to the Attorney General.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   As to whether the Attorney General ultimately relied on the talking points when interacting with the public and the press, the Court holds, as it did in its prior opinion, that any such reliance does not defeat the privilege here. According to the Department, the draft talking points contain \"\n   <em>\n    proposed\n   </em>\n   \" responses to the public about certain topics, including Attorney General Lynch's meeting with President Clinton. Brinkmann Decl. \u00b6 7 (emphasis added). But \"[t]he final decision was what Attorney General Lynch actually said to the [public and the] media, which is, of course, already a matter of public record.\"\n   <em>\n    ACLJ\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526728\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/325/162/#p165\">\n    325 F.

The Attorney General's ultimate reliance on the proposals from her subordinates-to the extent that occurred here-does not amount to such an express and unequivocal choice. And furthermore, as the Court has previously noted, \"sticking to talking points often does not entail a verbatim recitation, leaving open the possibility that 'a simple comparison' of the talking points with the [Attorney General's] public remarks would reveal the agency's deliberations\" that the privilege is intended to protect.\n   <em>\n    ACLJ\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526728\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/325/162/#p165\">\n    325 F.

But ACLJ argues that the Department has failed to provide the Court with sufficient explanation of that decision, insisting that the Department must state with more particularity the proportion of the information in the talking points that is non-exempt.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s MSJ Br. at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In its prior opinion, the Court concluded that the Department's representation that it conducted a line-by-line review of each withheld document, along with its explanation that the \"factual content [contained in the withheld talking points and press statements] was generally intertwined with the advice being given and thus could not be segregated,\" was enough to trigger a presumption in favor of the Department's compliance with FOIA's segregability requirement.\n   <em>\n    ACLJ\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526728\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/325/162/#p165\">\n    325 F.

The Department makes the same representations here,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Brinkmann Decl. \u00b6 9; ECF No. 22-1 \u00b6 18, and the Court therefore reaches the same conclusion, shifting the burden to ACLJ to \"cast doubt on [the Department's] compliance,\"\n   <em>\n    ACLJ\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526728\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/325/162/#p165\">\n    325 F.

But ACLJ never explains why that showing is necessary, or, more importantly, how it would help rebut the presumption afforded to the Department due to its representation that the entire attachment was comprised of proposed talking points which \"prevent[ ] segregation inasmuch as the material itself, and selected facts therein, embod[y] the deliberative process.\" ECF No. 22-1 \u00b6 18; Brinkmann Decl. \u00b6 9.

The agency in that case had invoked FOIA Exemption 7(A), which protects records compiled for law enforcement purposes, and thus its justifications for why it could not extricate non-sensitive information included several ways in which that information could jeopardize the specific ongoing investigation with which it was associated.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Juarez\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5864954,3555526\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/518/54/\">\n     518 F.3d at 56\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .
