(Doc. 89.) The government opposes the motion. The court held an evidentiary\n   hearing on April 19, 2019 at which Samantha Foss and DEA Agents Christopher Paquette and Brandon Hope testified. On May 10, 2019, the parties filed post-hearing memoranda, at which time the court took the pending motion under advisement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendant is represented by Maryanne E.

Findings of Fact.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The court incorporates its findings of fact set forth in its May 30, 2019 Opinion and Order Denying Defendant's Motion to Suppress Audio Recordings and Motion for a Bill of Particulars (Doc. 114) wherein it found, among other things, that in September 2017 through January 2018, the DEA and the Morristown Police Department entered into an agreement with a confidential information (\"CI\") to engage in a series of controlled buys. Pursuant to that agreement, the CI voluntarily agreed to record her telephone conversations with and purchases from Defendant and her mother Esperanza \"Hope\" Delarosa in exchange for monetary compensation and consideration with regard to potential felony and misdemeanor charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On January 23, 2018, Defendant was arrested and transported to the Stowe Police Station where she was placed in a holding cell before being escorted to an interview room where she was seated at a table with DEA Diversion Investigator Christopher Paquette and DEA Task Force Officer (\"TFO\") Robert Sylvia. At the time of the interview, the DEA Agents were in possession of Defendant's cell phone which had been seized from her upon her arrest. The DEA Agents' interview with Defendant was audio and digitally recorded and is reflected in a stipulated transcript introduced into evidence as Gov't Ex.3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Prior to administering\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings, TFO Sylvia introduced himself and DEA Agent Paquette as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   So my name is Rob, and this is Chris. We both work for the DEA, we're both Federal Agents for the DEA. Um, so I want to try to get this processed tonight, we have to do a couple of things. I told you, you're, you are not the only one that's being dealt with tonight, either here or elsewhere, including other states[.] ... Okay. Including, they're doing a federal search warrant up at your house in Morrisville, at least that's here in Vermont, okay. So they're, they're dealing with the kids, they're going to be taken care of. There is two guys there, you know, we're going to treat them just like we treat you, with respect. But we're going to do our business and we'll go from there.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Gov't Ex. 3 at 1-2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Defendant asked to speak to her children and was told that it was possible that arrangements could be made so that she could do so at the end of the night. When Defendant suggested her mother as a person who would be available to take care of her the children, TFO Sylvia responded as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Or if the guys there have something outlandish that's going to have to cause us to do something about it. They'll make arrangements, but, at, when we're done here, you'll know what's going to happen with them, or where they're going, or whether or not ... I would have to talk to my big boss to decide if you would be able to talk to them. Um, but I want to just make sure that we're clear about this, I don't want to hold, we're not holding that over your head. Whether you decide to talk with us, or we have a conversation, and what happens with\n   your kids, I want to make sure that we keep that separate because I want you to talk to me, but I don't want you to think that you have to talk to me because it has anything to do with your kids tonight. We, we clear about that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201956\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201956\">\n    at 2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Defendant nodded her assent. Thereafter, TFO Sylvia spoke to Defendant as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Okay. I just want to make sure I'm not, we're not holding that over your head. That's not how we work, okay? So I've already told you we're federal agents and you have a federal arrest warrant for you. Meaning, what that means is a federal judge has listened to or read what we've learned about you, your mom, and some other folks, and agreed that we have enough to arrest you. And to search your house. And really the reason is, is because you guys are selling drugs. Now hold on to that for a second. So the judge has given us permission to arrest you and to search your place, and to do some other things elsewhere. That's a big deal because not everybody gets arrested by the DEA. Cause we're not the NYPD. We're not the State Police okay. We're talking, it's a very serious set of crimes that you're involved in. Um, what I also want to make clear, is the difference between the local police, and us. You know the NYPD or us, if you were to lie to us, if you were to lie to the NYPD you know, because you were drinking a beer on your door step, if you lie to them, it just hurts their feelings and they go home at the end of their shift. If you were to lie to us, it's actually a federal offense, okay. It's another crime, okay. It could be consider[ed] a crime when you lie to a federal agent, alright. Do you know Martha Stewart, the lady on TV? She went to federal prison, do you know why she went to federal prison? Because she lied to the FBI. So if basket weaving market Martha Stewart can go to jail, um, it's pretty reasonable to think that you know, when people lie to the government they could get in trouble for it. Does that make sense? Alright. So that's what, I just want to be fair. Because you have a chance to have a conversation with us. So we want to, we're going to get your fingerprints, we're going to ask you some information. Some of which we know, you know, your biographical, your height, your weight, where you live, what you do for work, those type of things. So we need to ask you those things, we want to talk to you. In order to do that we have to read you your rights. Have you ever had your rights read to you before?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201956\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201956\">\n    at 2-3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Defendant responded that she had not previously been provided\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings and, in response to TFO Sylvia's questions, confirmed she had not been arrested previously, had not seen\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings provided on television, and did not know her\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights. In response to TFO Sylvia's inquiry, Defendant indicated that she did not need her rights to be provided in Spanish and could understand them in English.

But I am going to ask you just your biographical stuff, because we need to get that. And then what's going to happen tonight, once we're done getting your information, we're going to take your fingerprints. And from here, you're going to go up to Burlington.

When Defendant admitted that she had a prior threat or attempt at suicide, the DEA Agents asked her when that happened; what it consisted of; whether she had suicidal thoughts presently; whether she took any prescribed medications; whether she used alcohol; and twice whether she used narcotics.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Although Defendant initially denied using alcohol, she subsequently admitted that she drank wine and beer. She was asked if she was only an occasional and social drinker and confirmed that she was. She was told that she would be required to be submit to a urine test on the following day at court. When she stated that she had \"never done drugs[,]\" TFO Sylvia asked: \"Not even marijuana?\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201956\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201956\">\n    at 15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The DEA Agents then asked for an emergency contact, suggested one of her brothers for this purpose, asked for his phone number, asked if she could obtain the phone number for her brother from her cell phone, and asked if she would provide the password or her fingerprint for her cell phone.
