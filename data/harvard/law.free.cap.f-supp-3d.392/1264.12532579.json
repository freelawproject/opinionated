Commerce's Reliance on Kangtai's Sales to Customer X as Export Price Sales\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiffs contend that Commerce's reliance on Kangtai's sales to Customer X, which operates in a third country, as a basis for export price is unsupported by substantial evidence because the parties are affiliated and Kangtai prevented Commerce from verifying the parties' relationship.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Pls.' Br. at 8-17. Defendant responds that Commerce properly used Kangtai's sales to Customer X as export price sales because Commerce found Kangtai's responses to its questionnaires and supplemental questionnaire sufficient, and Commerce was able to verify Kangtai's statement and supporting documentation that it was unaffiliated with Customer X. Def.'s Br. at 6. For the reasons that follow, Commerce's decision is not supported by substantial evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   To calculate a respondent's dumping margin, Commerce determines the \"amount by which the normal value exceeds the export price (or constructed export price).\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201673\">\n    19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1673\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Thus, Commerce may use sales to a purchaser operating in a third country as export price, so long as the purchaser is unaffiliated with the exporter and the purchase is for exportation to the United States. If, by contrast, Commerce identifies a sale to an affiliated purchaser, Commerce constructs the export price using the price at which the subject merchandise is first sold in the United States to a purchaser not affiliated with the producer or exporter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677a(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   A purchaser is affiliated with the producer if,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , the producer controls the purchaser.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201677\">\n    19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (33)(G).

In determining whether a principal-agent relationship exists, Commerce maintains that no bright line test exists,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=62%20Fed.%20Reg.%2024%2C394\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=62%20Fed.%20Reg.%2024%2C394\">\n    ,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and will consider \"the totality of the circumstances surrounding the parties involved,\" Final Decision Memo at 5.

Reg. at 24,403\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Commerce considers a variety of factors, including (1) the foreign producer's role in negotiating prices with the downstream U.S. customers, (2) the extent to which the foreign producer interacts with such downstream customers, (3) the extent to which the purchaser maintains inventory of the product, (4) whether the purchaser takes title to shipments and accepts the risk of loss, (5) the extent to which the purchaser further processes the goods or adds value, (6) the methods of marketing a product by the producer to the U.S. customer in the pre-sale period, and (7) whether identification of the producer on the sales documentation implies an agency relationship during the transactions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Steel Threaded Rod from India\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=79%20Fed.%20Reg.%209%2C164\">\n    79 Fed.

Commerce bases its determination that Kangtai and Customer X are unaffiliated upon Kangtai's statements that it was not affiliated with Customer X and on \"record evidence supporting this statement.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Final\n   Decision Memo at 4.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=79%20Fed.%20Reg.%209%2C164\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Although the two entities may lack a formal corporate affiliation, Commerce's determination that the two are not affiliated through a principal-agent relationship is not supported by substantial evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Of the seven factors mentioned in\n   <em>\n    Steel Threaded Rod from India\n   </em>\n   , Commerce relies on the foreign producer's role in negotiating and whether the purchaser takes title to the goods.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Final Decision Memo at 5. Commerce invokes Kangtai's statement that it played no role in negotiations between Customer X and Customer X's U.S. customers, and notes that its examination of Kangtai's sales traces and accounting and sales records identified Customer X as the importer of record that took title to the products upon importation and paid Kangtai for these sales.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Kangtai Suppl. Sections A, C, &amp; D Resp. at 2, CD 58-61, bar code 3563243-01 (Apr. 14, 2017). Commerce, however, concedes that Customer X never maintained an inventory of the goods, did not further process the goods, and that Kangtai shipped directly to U.S. customers, with the bill of lading identifying Kangtai as the supplier. Final Decision Memo at 5; Kangtai's Section A Resp. at Ex. A-8, CD 8-10, bar code 3523067-01 (Nov. 16, 2016). Moreover, the record shows that Kangtai's sales representatives attended trade shows to identify U.S. customers, that Kangtai \"sets the prices of the merchandise under consideration through direct negotiation with its U.S. customers,\" and that its U.S. customers \"arrive at a mutual agreement on the price and then ... sign a sales contract or place orders with Kangtai.\" Kangtai's Section A Resp. at 7, 15, CD 8-10, bar code 3523067-01 (Nov. 16, 2016). Commerce has not adequately explained its determination that the two entities are unaffiliated in light of such evidence under a totality of the circumstances test.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6931620\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/340/474/#p488\">\n    340 U.S. 474\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 488,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6931620\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/340/474/#p488\">\n    71 S.Ct. 456\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=95%20L.%20Ed.%20456\">\n    95 L.Ed. 456\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1951) (explaining that substantial evidence \"must take into account whatever in the record fairly detracts from its weight\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Commerce has also failed to adequately analyze the relevant factors or the record evidence impacting the inquiry of whether a principal-agent relationship exists. Indeed, Commerce provides no analysis of whether identification of the producer on the sales documentation implies an agency relationship during the transactions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Steel Threaded Rod from India\n   </em>\n   at 14-15 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Final Decision Memo at 5. At oral argument, Defendant averred that Commerce addressed whether the identification of the producer on the sales documentation implied an agency relationship, Oral Arg. at 00:23:40-00:24:18, noting that in its determination Commerce stated that \"our examination during verification of Kangtai's sales traces and accounting and sales records all identified Customer X as the importer of record.\" Final Decision Memo at 5. This statement does not substitute for an analysis of whether the sales documentation reveals an agency relationship. Further, although Customer X takes title, the record contains no evidence concerning when Customer X takes title or when title is transferred to its downstream customers, nor does it address the details of payments to and from Customer X.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Commerce\n   also neglects to analyze the methods of marketing, the sixth factor listed above.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Final Decision Memo at 3-5.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   This factor seems highly relevant here, given that Commerce acknowledges that Kangtai attends trade shows in the United States but seems not to reflect upon the fact that Kangtai finds and interacts with-and presumably markets to-potential U.S. customers at these trade shows.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Kangtai's Section A Resp. at 15, CD 8-10, bar code 3523067-01 (Nov. 16, 2016);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Kangtai Verification Report at 2, CD 135, bar code 3642610-01 (Nov. 17, 2017) (\"Kangtai Verification Report\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Kangtai asserts that Customer X is merely \"its customer in the normal business of operation\" and that Kangtai played no role in negotiating with Customer X's U.S. customers,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Kangtai Suppl. Sections A, C, &amp; D Resp. at 2, CD 58-61, bar code 3563243-01 (Apr. 14, 2017), but Commerce seems to take the statement at face value despite record evidence potentially detracting from this conclusion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ultimately, it is undisputed that Customer X proved responsible for more than [[ ]] of Kangtai's U.S. sales during the period of review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAS Data File [attached as Ex. SQ1-1 to] Kangtai's Suppl. Sections A, C, &amp; D Resp., CD 62, bar code 3563243-01 (Apr. 14, 2017). The record is silent regarding the events leading up to Kangtai securing such a commitment from Customer X, and given that the two [[ ]], it is conceivable that Kangtai made efforts to market to those same customers who in the end purchased Kangtai's goods\n   through Customer X. Such insight would seemingly prove critical to Commerce's agency analysis, but the court is left to speculate. Although it is not this court's role weigh the evidence, such unaddressed evidence on the record exposes Commerce's failure to analyze this factor as problematic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In sum, Commerce presents no analysis of factors that seem critical under the circumstances, or of record evidence detracting from its determination.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Without more evidence supporting its determination, or an explanation after at least considering all the relevant factors, Commerce's conclusion that Customer X and Kangtai are unaffiliated is unreasonable.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Defendant laments that \"at no point [did Petitioners] allege ... a principal-agent relationship between Kangtai and Customer X\" in the proceeding below. Def.'s Br. at 9. Commerce noted, by contrast, that \"[P]etitioners first alleged a principal-agent relationship ... a few days before verification,\" and reasoned that, consequently, \"Commerce was not in a position to seek additional information from Kangtai, nor Customer X, concerning this issue.\" Final Decision Memo at 4. During oral argument, counsel for Defendant\n   averred that Defendant was not arguing that Plaintiffs failed to exhaust their administrative remedies. Oral Arg. at 00:25:40-00:26:05;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202637\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2637\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d). It is thus unclear for what reason Commerce and Defendant characterize the timing of Petitioners' principal-agent allegation. Nevertheless, to the extent that Defendant describes the timing in an effort to excuse Commerce from conducting a more thorough investigation, Defendant's argument falls short.

There, Petitioners requested that Commerce ask Kangtai several follow-up questions probing the nature of Kangtai's relationship with Customer X.

The implication is that Commerce was missing necessary information, specifically, evidence revealing the nature of the relationship between Kangtai and Customer X, and that Commerce should have applied an adverse inference in selecting from available information to determine export price, given Kangtai's purported lack of cooperation in Commerce's verification.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677e. The court does not reach the argument because on the current record, Commerce has not supported its determination by substantial evidence that Kangtai and Customer X were unaffiliated. Nonetheless, it seems clear on the current record that an adverse inference pursuant to 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677e(b) would be unwarranted, considering that Kangtai supplied the information requested by Commerce.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677e(b) (providing that Commerce may apply an adverse inference upon a finding that an interested party \"has failed to cooperate by not acting to the best of its ability to comply with a request for information\");\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    Prelim.

Application of an adverse inference is a two-step process: (1) Commerce must find that necessary information is missing from the record, and (2) Commerce must find that an interested party failed to cooperate.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677e. Here, Commerce found neither of these elements. On remand, however, the possibility remains that Commerce could find that necessary information is missing from the record pursuant to 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677e(a), in which case Commerce could be within its statutory authority to apply \"facts otherwise available,\" and then determine whether an adverse inference is warranted, pursuant to 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677e(b), based on the cooperation of the parties.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"15\">\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    Commerce uses \"the best available information\" from a market economy considered appropriate to value FOPs. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(c)(1).
