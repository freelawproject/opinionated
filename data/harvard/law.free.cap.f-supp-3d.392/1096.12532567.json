Cir. 2018), where the plaintiffs made non-conclusory allegations establishing an inventive concept. In\n   <em>\n    Aatrix\n   </em>\n   , for example, the plaintiff alleged that the unique importation of data from third-party programs improved the functioning of the computer.\n   <em>\n    Aatrix\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12515907\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/882/1121/#p1128\">\n    882 F.3d at 1127\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Cellspin\n   </em>\n   , the amended complaint identified \"several ways in which its application of capturing,\n   transferring, and publishing data was unconventional.\"\n   <em>\n    Cellspin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12521505\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/927/1306/#p1319\">\n    927 F.3d at 1315-16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And in\n   <em>\n    Berkheimer\n   </em>\n   , the Federal Circuit cited the specification's description of \"an inventive feature that stores parsed data in a purportedly unconventional manner,\" in denying summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    Berkheimer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275489\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/881/1360/\">\n    881 F.3d at 1369\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In contrast, the portions of the '289 patent and the complaint that Yu highlights as describing a \"unique and unconventional combination and arrangement of digital camera components constitut[ing] an inventive concept\" and \"improved operation and capabilities over prior single-sensor and single-lens digital cameras,\" Dkt. No. 45 at 15, are entirely conclusory and merely describe multiple sensors and lenses. There is no \"non-conventional and non-generic arrangement of known, conventional pieces.\"\n   <em>\n    BASCOM Glob. Internet Servs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5924463\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/827/1341/#p1349\">\n    827 F.3d at 1350\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Any benefits and improvements that might accrue simply from instantiation of the abstract idea of using multiple images to enhance a particular image do not aid Yu's case for patent-eligibility. As the Federal Circuit concluded in\n   <em>\n    BSG Tech\n   </em>\n   , which found that a patent related to indexing information in wide access databases claimed ineligible subject matter, \"[t]hese benefits, however, are not improvements to database functionality. Instead, they are benefits that flow from performing an abstract idea in conjunction with a well-known database structure.\"\n   <em>\n    BSG Tech\n   </em>\n   , 899 F.3d at 1288. None of the purported benefits for digital photography alleged in the complaint,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , AC \u00b6 10; SC \u00b6 12, or in the '289 specification or claims contribute to patentability because they are attributable to the abstract idea of using multiple images to enhance one image, and not anything substantially beyond that.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The other elements of the patent are all well-understood, routine and conventional in themselves, and ordered in a conventional manner. The record from the patent prosecution notes that earlier patents had disclosed multiple image sensors \"closely positioned with respect to a common plane with reference to an image target, with lenses mounted in front of all sensors,\" \"individual A/D conversion circuitry,\" \"a digital image processor,\" and \"image memory.\" Dkt. No. 44-1 at 4-5. While the \"mere fact that something is disclosed in a piece of prior art, for example, does not mean it was well-understood, routine, and conventional,\"\n   <em>\n    Berkheimer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275489\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/881/1360/\">\n    881 F.3d at 1369\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , in combination with all the other evidence, a motion to dismiss is proper on this record.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Aatrix\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12515907\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/882/1121/#p1128\">\n    882 F.3d at 1128\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"There are concrete allegations in the second amended complaint that individual elements and the claimed combination are not well-understood, routine, or conventional activity.

But this simply restates what we have already determined is an abstract idea.\"). \"There is, in short, nothing 'inventive' about any claim details, individually or in combination, that are not themselves in the realm of abstract ideas.\"\n   <em>\n    InvestPic\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517925\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/898/1161/#p1167\">\n    898 F.3d at 1170\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    C. PREEMPTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   While the failure of claim 1 to survive the two-prong inquiry under\n   <em>\n    Alice\n   </em>\n   is enough to warrant dismissal of the complaint, the Court also finds the scope of potential preemption to weigh against patent eligibility.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Athena Diagnostics, Inc. v. Mayo Collaborative Servs., LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520098\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/915/743/#p752\">\n    915 F.3d 743\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 752 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (\"Preemption is sufficient to render a claim ineligible under \u00a7 101, but it is not necessary.\"). Yu contends that \"virtually all dual-lens cameras on the market today use the techniques claimed in the '289 Patent.\" AC \u00b6 12; SC \u00b6 14. In addition, the final limitation in claim 1 of the '289 patent is that the digital image processor produces an image \"from said first digital image enhanced with said second digital image.\" Dkt. No.1-1 at 10:54-58. As a result, while the '289 patent's specification is replete with discussions of how the patent increases resolution and dynamic range,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1:66-2:16, and mentions noise removal and color correction,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 10:13-16, the AC, for example, alleges infringement through iPhone features such as \"improved digital zoom, 'portrait mode,' 'portrait lighting,' and Face ID.\" AC \u00b6 24. These allegations underscore the breadth of potential preemption Yu envisions, which further supports a finding of ineligibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Because the '289 patent is directed to an abstract idea and does not add an inventive concept, the AC and SC are dismissed. In light of the plain language of the claims in the patent, the Court has substantial doubt that Yu can amend around this problem. Even so, the Court cannot say that any amendment would necessarily be futile, and so plaintiffs may file amended complaints by July 23, 2019.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Smith v. Pac.
