At least initially, the company was jointly owned by Jim and Jack. On February 1, 2008, Jim and Jack executed a \"Shareholders' Agreement\" (the \"Agreement\") that defined each party's rights and responsibilities with respect to the company. The Agreement contained two provisions that are relevant to the pending motions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    Section 3(a).\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Termination of Employment, (a) If the employment of any Shareholder [that is, Jim or Jack] now or hereafter employed by Corporation terminates for any reason, other than by Disability, death or Retirement, such termination, whether voluntary or involuntary, shall be treated as an offer (made on the date of termination of employment) to sell all of his Shares and any Shares previously transferred by Shareholder to a trust as permitted by Paragraph 2(c) at the Purchase Price, as determined under Paragraph 9(c), first to the Corporation and then, if required, to the Other Shareholders under the offering procedures set forth in Paragraphs 6 and 7 hereof. The terms of payment of the Purchase Price for such Shares shall be as set forth in Paragraph 10 hereof\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    Section 26(c).\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   The Shareholders acknowledge that major decisions of the Corporation shall require unanimous consent of the Shareholders. In the event of a disagreement between the Shareholders that cannot be resolved, the Shareholders agree that John C. Meyer, Sr., who may consult with Don Fork, shall resolve such disagreement. In the event John C. Meyer is unavailable in the event of disagreement, Don Fork shall resolve such disagreement; otherwise, arbitration under Paragraph 23 hereof shall control.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In late June 2017, Jack represented to Jim that Jack had hired Penn as DVLT's\n   attorney. Jack began paying Penn attorneys' fees with DVLT's funds. Jim asserts that Penn's representation of DVLT was a \"falsehood\"-that in fact Penn represented and had undivided loyalty \"to its real client, Jack,\" rather than to DVLT. Jim also asserts that Penn accepted employment \"with full knowledge\" of this falsehood.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   According to the Complaint, Jack and Penn fired Jim (as well as Jim's wife and daughter) from DVLT by \"expel[ling], freez[ing]-out and exclud[ing]\" him (and his wife and daughter) from the company. Upon effectuating the firing, Jack changed DVLT's physical locks and electronic passwords to prevent Jim's entry, and told Jim that if he tried to enter the building then he-Jack-would call the police. Jack also paid certain bonuses and benefits to himself and his family. After these events took place, Jack and Penn represented to employees, vendors, and industry members that they \"had the good cause as well as the power and authority\" to fire Jim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Complaint states that the company is \"either insolvent or on the brink of insolvency.\" The Complaint also states that Defendants refused to arbitrate certain claims after they fired Jim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Jim now asserts eleven Counts, with some combination of Jack, Barbara, DVLT, and Penn named as Defendants\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   for each: Appointment of Custodian under 15 Pa. C.S.A. \u00a7 1767(a)(2) (Count I); Involuntary Winding Up and Dissolution of DVLT under 15 Pa. C.S.A. \u00a7 1981 (Count II); Declaratory Judgment (Count III); Injunction to Bar Jack and DVLT from Continuing to Use Penn as the Attorney for DVLT (Count IV); Breach of Fiduciary Duty (Count V); Conversion (Count VI); Unjust Enrichment (Count VII); Breach of Contract and Breach of the Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing (Count VIII); Waste of Corporate Assets (Count IX); Damages Resulting from Tortious Conduct (Count X); and, Civil Conspiracy and Aiding and Abetting Torts (Count XI).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    III. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The legal question at the core of the Complaint and motions to dismiss is: Does the Complaint adequately allege that Jim's firing violated the Shareholder Agreement? The answer is yes. Because the answer to this question helps resolve many of the other Counts asserted by Jim, the breach of contract claim (Count VIII) will be addressed first, and the remaining Counts will follow.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Breach of Contract\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Count VIII asserts that Jack breached the Shareholder Agreement contract with Jim. To state a breach of contract\n   claim in Pennsylvania, a plaintiff must allege: \"(1) the existence of a contract, including its essential terms, (2) a breach of the contract; and, (3) resultant damages.\"\n   <em>\n    Meyer, Darragh, Buckler, Bebenek &amp; Eck, P.L.L.C. v. Law Firm of Malone Middleman, P.C.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12280958\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/635/427/\">\n    635 Pa. 427\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12280958,12280948,6805965,6806054\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/137/1247/\">\n    137 A.3d 1247\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1258 (2016). \"[C]ontract interpretation is a question of law.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Old Summit Mfg., LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3808091,3784358\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/523/134/\">\n    523 F.3d 134\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 137 (3d Cir. 2008) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Dep't of Transp. v. Pa. Indus. for the Blind &amp; Handicapped\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8899353\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/886/706/#p711\">\n    886 A.2d 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 711 (Pa. Commw. 2005) ). The parties only dispute whether there was a breach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Section 26 of the Shareholder Agreement requires \"unanimous consent of the Shareholders\" for all \"major decisions of the Corporation[.]\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   It appears that the core of Jim's Complaint is that Jack breached the Agreement by unilaterally taking a \"major decision\"-ousting Jim, the only other Shareholder, from the Company-without seeking Jim's consent, thus breaching the Agreement by violating the \"unanimous consent\" provision. Jim has adequately alleged this breach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Jack argues that firing Jim could not be a breach for two reasons. First, Jack points to Section 3(a) of the Shareholder Agreement, which refers to the \"voluntary or involuntary\" termination of a shareholder from the Company. Jack takes Section 3(a) to allow for the \"involuntary\" termination of a Shareholder. But even if a Shareholder may under certain circumstances be involuntarily terminated, not all involuntary terminations of Shareholders are countenanced by the Agreement-if that involuntary termination does not happen in accordance with the rest of the Agreement, then the termination would constitute a breach. That is what Jim alleges happened here-the termination did not accord with the rest of the Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Jack also points to Section 26(c) of the Agreement. That provision states both that \"major decisions of the Corporation shall require unanimous consent of the Shareholders,\" and also that, \"[i]n the event of a disagreement between the Shareholders,\" their father, John, \"shall resolve such disagreement.\" Jack argues that Section 26(c) \"can only be interpreted as having been included to prevent precisely the type of shareholder deadlock which Plaintiff claims barred Jack from firing him, hiring the Penn Firm, or taking any corporate action without his consent.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Again, it may well be the case that in certain circumstances Section 26(c) allows for a Shareholder to be fired from the Company-but only where its strictures have been followed. Jim's allegation is that they have not been followed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Because Jim has adequately alleged that Jack breached the Shareholder Agreement, the motion to dismiss this Count will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Remaining Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Many of the remaining claims are resolved, at least in part, based on the conclusion that Jim has adequately alleged a breach of contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     a. Count One (Appointment of Custodian)\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Count I seeks appointment of a custodian of DVLT pursuant to 15 Pa. C.S.A. \u00a7 1767(a). Section 1767(a)(2) provides that, subject to several affirmative exceptions, where \"the directors or those in control of the corporation have acted illegally, oppressively or fraudulently toward one or more holders or owners of 5% or more of the outstanding shares ... in their capacities as shareholders, directors, officers or employees,\" a court may appoint a \"custodian of corporation.\" Because Jim has adequately alleged a breach, he satisfies the \"acted illegally, oppressively or fraudulently\" requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Defendants make several arguments in favor of dismissing this Count, none of which persuades. First, Defendants argue that \"some\" Pennsylvania courts do not recognize fiduciary duties between coequal shareholders.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Schmechel v. Gaither\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%206957061\">\n    2015 WL 6957061\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (Pa. Super. June 24, 2015). But Defendants do not explain what this assertion has to do with Section 1767(a), a statutory provision that does not mention fiduciary duties, and delineates the situations-regardless of fiduciary status-when a court may appoint a custodian of corporation. Moreover, Defendants provide no reason why, specifically here, fiduciary duties should go unrecognized.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Second, Defendants point to the clause in the statute entitled \"Exceptions,\" which states that a court \"shall not appoint a custodian to resolve a deadlock if the shareholders by agreement or otherwise have provided for the appointment of a provisional director or other means of the resolution of the deadlock, but the court shall enforce the remedy so provided if appropriate.\" 15 Pa. C.S.A. \u00a7 1767(b)(1). Defendants contend that Section 26(c) of the Shareholder Agreement, which directs that John \"shall resolve ... disagreement[s]\" between Jim and Jack, triggers this statutory exception. But Jim does not allege deadlock because the core of his allegation is that he was never consulted by Jack and thus they could not have reached deadlock. Accordingly, the statutory exception does not apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Finally, Defendants argue that there was no \"oppress[ive]\" conduct, but their argument turns entirely on the assumption that Jim has failed to plead a violation of the Shareholder Agreement. For the reasons already discussed,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   section III.A, Jim has pleaded a violation, and therefore Defendants' argument is based on an unsupported premise.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, Count I will not be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     b. Count Two (Winding Up and Dissolution)\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Count II seeks involuntary winding up and dissolution of DVLT under 15 Pa. C.S.A. \u00a7 1981. Section 1981(a) provides that a court \"may entertain proceedings for the involuntary winding up and dissolution of a corporation\" if (1) those in control of the corporation engage in \"illegal, oppressive or fraudulent\" acts and \"it is beneficial\n   to the interests of the shareholders that the corporation be wound up and dissolved\"; (2) corporate assets are being \"misapplied or wasted\"; or (3) \"[t]he directors are deadlocked in the direction of the management of the business and affairs of the corporation and the shareholders are unable to break the deadlock[.]\" Defendants point to\n   <em>\n    O'Farrell v. Steel City Piping Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"123209\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa-super/266/219/\">\n    266 Pa.Super. 219\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"123209\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa-super/266/219/\">\n    403 A.2d 1319\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1978), a case where a court refused to wind up a corporation because \"the record support[ed] the ... conclusion that the individual appellees pursued a course of conduct based on good faith and generosity rather than fraud and oppression.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1326. But, as this case is only at the motion to dismiss stage, there is no record on which to come to Defendants' preferred conclusion. Rather, the Court must take Jim's allegations as true. Because Jim has adequately alleged illegal or oppressive conduct-his freezing out of the Company contrary to the terms of the Shareholder Agreement-Defendants' motion must be denied on this Count.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     c.

Count III of the Complaint asks the Court to make findings on each disputed factual and legal question in the case. For example, it asks the Court to enter an order \"declaring that ... Jack and [Penn] entered into the Scheme\" described in the Complaint, and that \"[t]he purpose of the Scheme was for seizing for Jack ... complete, unfettered control of DVLT, and to oppressively, and deceitfully render useless in the management of the business of DVLT, Jim's fifty percent ownership of DVLT.\" To the extent that the Complaint asks for declaratory judgment as to factual questions, that request lies beyond the scope of the Declaratory Judgment Act, which allows courts to declare only \"rights and other legal relations.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202201\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). And, to the extent the Complaint asks for declaratory judgment as to legal questions, those questions pertain solely to \"past conduct\" (for example, the Complaint asserts that \"Jack committed acts of shareholder oppression, and misapplication, waste and conversion of the assets of DVLT\"),\n   <em>\n    Warren\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12528862\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/351/835/#p839\">\n    351 F.

Count Four (Permanent Injunction)\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Count IV seeks a permanent injunction barring Jack and DVLT from using Penn as DVLT's attorney. The parties focus a significant portion of their briefing on whether Jim can require Penn to cease its current representation of DVLT and Jack. Defendants argue that this matter has become moot because Penn has entered a notice of withdrawal of appearance in this case. However, it is unclear whether Penn continues to represent DVLT and Jack in other matters. To the extent Penn continues such representation, the request for an injunction is not moot. Moreover, the Complaint also requests an injunction to prevent Penn from representing DVLT or Jack again in the future-a question that is certainly not moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   As to the Count itself, Penn argues that Jim lacks standing to seek this injunction because Jim's claim only relates to \"relief on behalf of DVLT and for the benefit of DVLT.\" Because standing is jurisdictional and thus may be raised\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Med.

Second, Penn argues that aiding and abetting a breach of fiduciary duty does not exist under Pennsylvania law, a proposition that is belied by judicial opinions which have concluded that law firms can be liable for such a violation, and have proceeded to analyze the facts of specific cases to determine whether or not a particular firm was liable for aiding and abetting a breach of fiduciary duty.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at *3 (applying Pennsylvania law to assess \"a claim against a law firm for aiding and abetting a breach of fiduciary duty\");\n   <em>\n    Reis v.

This rule ceases to apply, however, if a court \"converts\" the motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment, as permitted by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(d).
