He filed two motions to dismiss the indictment, both of which go to the validity of his underlying removal order from 2011. Vargas-Molina relies upon \u00a7 1326(d) to collaterally attack that order. And in his second, he argues that the Immigration Judge (\"IJ\") lacked jurisdiction to conduct the removal hearing, rendering the order of removal\n   <em>\n    void ab initio\n   </em>\n   . For the reasons set forth below, Vargas-Molina's 2011 removal order is invalid. His first motion to dismiss is granted, and his second is denied as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Vargas-Molina is forty-nine years old. He is a native of Mexico and has resided in the United States for the better part of nineteen years. (ECF No. 32-6, PageID.160.) He has three children, all of whom live here in this country. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID.161-62.) Two are U.S. citizens. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID.162.) Vargas-Molina first came to the United States in 1994. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) He returned to Mexico for three years and then returned in 1997. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID.160, PageID.167.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Thirteen years later, Vargas-Molina had his first contact with law enforcement. He received two citations in Tennessee on March 21, 2010. At 2:13 a.m., Vargas-Molina was cited by a Tennessee State Trooper for \"simple possession of a sch[edule two]\" substance, cocaine. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID.156.) The citation notes that Vargas-Molina was a passenger in a vehicle that was pulled over and that the police officer \"observed [him] reaching down several times in the attempt to hide something.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In a search that the driver consented to, the officer found two baggies of cocaine under the floor mat on the passenger side of the car. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Then at 6:03 a.m. that same day, Vargas-Molina was ticketed by Brentwood\n   police officers in Williamson County, Tennessee for driving with a suspended license. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID.157.) In 2009, his license was suspended for \"a[n] equipment violation and failure to provide insurance out of ... Michigan.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) A hearing in Tennessee was set for April 1, 2010, to address Vargas-Molina's two citations, and it is undisputed that he did not appear, resulting in an outstanding warrant for these citations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID.156-57 (setting a hearing date for April 1, 2010); ECF No. 32-7, PageID.178; ECF No. 32-8, PageID.181.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Almost a year later, Vargas-Molina was arrested by Customs and Border Patrol (\"CBP\") for unlawful presence in the United States, and he was detained by CBP on March 12, 2011. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID.176.) On March 21, 2011, he appeared with a group of other individuals via video conference from Calhoun County, Michigan before IJ Hacker in Detroit. (ECF No. 32-2, Disc 1, Track 1, beginning at 0:00.) Vargas-Molina's primary language is Spanish, and an interpreter was present (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ), although it is unclear if the interpreter was in Detroit or present with the noncitizens in Calhoun County. During this hearing, IJ Hacker addressed the group, explaining that they were in deportation proceedings, that she would address them each individually, and that they have the right to hire an attorney. (ECF No. 32-2, Disc 1, Tracks 1-2.) She also stated that they have a right to present evidence, to question government witnesses, and to look at any evidence presented by the government, but she would ultimately decide what evidence could become part of the record. (ECF No. 39-1, PageID.336.) Finally, IJ Hacker informed each noncitizen that they could appeal her decision, and it appears that they may have received a document explaining how to do so.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (\"The officer there will hand you a list which explains more about your rights to appeal[.] This document tells you generally how to appeal.\").) Each noncitizen affirmed that he or she understood his or her rights and confirmed some basic facts about their citizenship, entries, etc. (ECF No. 32-2, Disc 1, Tracks 1-2; ECF No. 39-1, PageID.337-44.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   IJ Hacker proceeded to wind her way through the group, and when she addressed Vargas-Molina, she noted that he had an outstanding warrant but was eligible for cancellation of removal, a form of relief from removal. (ECF No. 39-1, PageID.346.) She explained what Vargas-Molina would have to show to receive this relief: that he was physically present in the United States since March 12, 2000, and that his \"children would suffer exceptional ... hardship if [he] were to be deported.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) He confirmed that he would like to apply for cancellation of removal and received an application form. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) But IJ Hacker never raised voluntary departure with Vargas-Molina, which would soon become his primary claim for relief from removal. Although she raised voluntary departure as a possibility for other individuals in the group, she never explained the legal standard for voluntary departure; she simply granted it as to those two people. (ECF No. 32-2 ; Disc 1, Track 6, beginning at 1:00.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On March 31, 2011, the hearing continued before IJ Nettles. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Disc 1, Track 7.) The audio recording of that hearing is available. (ECF No. 43, PageID.397.) Again, Vargas-Molina appeared remotely from Calhoun County Jail and an interpreter was present. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) He was not represented\n   by counsel. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) During the hearing, the defendant explained that he did not fill out his cancellation of removal application and needed more time to gather the information required by the application. (ECF No. 39-1, PageID.357.) IJ Nettles continued Vargas-Molina's case but warned him that he would only receive one more chance to complete his application or else she would consider it abandoned. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) She stated, \"Alright [sic] sir, I am going to give you until April 7th for cancellation or the alternative is voluntary departure[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID.358.) She said nothing else besides this passing mention of voluntary departure to Vargas-Molina.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On April 7, 2011, Vargas-Molina once more appeared remotely from Calhoun County Jail, an interpreter was present, and he was again unrepresented by counsel. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID.361.) He told IJ Nettles that he was still unable to fill out his application for cancellation of removal because he was waiting for his brother to get certain documents to him as \"proofs.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In response to her questions, he explained that he filled out the questions to the best of his ability but needed the documents to finish the application. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID.362-63.) After reprimanding Vargas-Molina for not having his brother read the contents of the documents to him over the phone, the IJ set his case for trial and gave him a week to finish his application. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Then, IJ Nettles asked Vargas-Molina if he had filled out his fee waiver request, and the first of several confusing exchanges ensued:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   IJ: Did you fill out the application sir?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   IJ: The waiver? The application fee waiver, did you fill out the waiver request?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Defendant: Well, ah,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Defendant: If it is not filled in then I don't want to appeal anything.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   IJ: I didn't ask you about an appeal sir,\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The IJ then reiterated that she would set his case for trial and Vargas-Molina would have one more chance to fill out his application for cancellation of removal. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID.363-66.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Then IJ Nettles asked if Vargas-Molina wanted her to set his case for trial and abandon his application for cancellation of removal on the spot. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID.366-67.) Vargas-Molina asked what would happen if he decided not to pursue his case, and IJ Nettles explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   IJ: I would either order you removed, or if you can somehow demonstrate otherwise [sic] qualify for voluntary departure, I would, if you are eligible for it, I would give you voluntary departure, but you have to make arrangements from inside the jail to purchase your ticket.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Defendant: Okay, then I would like to get volunteered.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   IJ: Alright [sic] sir, so at this point and time, you do not, do you want to file your cancellation application yes or no. I need you to answer me clearly.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID.367.) Vargas-Molina, apparently confused by the IJ's terminology, responded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   Defendant: Yes, I want to cancel it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   IJ: No, sir when you say cancel it, you mean that you wish, you don't want to file it, you want to stop your case, you want to stop right now and just ask for voluntary departure? Is that what you mean?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   Defendant: Yes, I would like to ask for voluntary departure if you can give it to me.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID.367-68.) The IJ offered no other explanation of voluntary departure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Then IJ then swore Vargas-Molina to tell the truth in a rapid-fire oath, and began to question him about his criminal history:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   IJ: Sir, have you ever been convicted of any kind of crime sir?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   Defendant: Convicted, no, no.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   IJ: What have you been arrested for? Or charged with?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   Defendant: I have not been arrested.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   IJ: For what?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   Defendant: Yes, the police has stopped me, but I have not been arrested.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID. 368-71.) Vargas-Molina truthfully stated that he had been stopped in Michigan because a tail light was out. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID.371.) He volunteered that he was \"stopped in Tennessee also.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The IJ asked why, and he explained that he was not driving, but the car was stopped because the driver crossed over the line. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Then, the government attorney asked if he had been arrested for possession of cocaine and for driving on a suspended license, and again, Vargas-Molina honestly answered that he had not been arrested. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID.371-72.) After hearing these truthful answers, the government attorney stated that he \"was under the impression that [Vargas-Molina] had an outstanding warrant for possession in Tennessee.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID.372.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   IJ Nettles then resumed her questioning, leading to a third point of confusion for Vargas-Molina. After reminding Vargas-Molina that he told her he was stopped in Tennessee, she told him that the government had run his fingerprints and \"an outstanding warrant in Tennessee related to ... cocaine\" came up. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Vargas-Molina attempted to clarify, explaining, \"[n]o one checked my fingerprints when we were stopped [in Tennessee].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) IJ Nettles responded that Immigration officials ran his fingerprints (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ), but there is nothing in the record that indicates that when the government ran his fingerprints in 2011 a warrant or an arrest came up (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 32-4 (\"Print Rapsheet Screen ... A search of the fingerprints on the above individual has revealed no prior arrest data.\")).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The IJ continued to ask pointed, short questions, and Vargas-Molina continued to answer her questions truthfully.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   IJ: Sir, are you sure that there was nothing to do with cocaine or they didn't say anything to you when you were stopped in Tennessee?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   IJ: Anything?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   Defendant: Well they gave me tickets.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   IJ: For what, you are not answering my questions sir, and I know you are not.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   IJ: Did anybody, did any of the police officer[s] mention anything to you about drugs of any kind, including cocaine when you were pulled over in Tennessee sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   Defendant: That is to say that when they found that they ask me if it was mine.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   IJ: So they found it in the car.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   Defendant. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID.373-75.) Vargas-Molina then explained that the officers found cocaine on the passenger side of the car, where he was seated, but that he told the officers that the drugs were not his. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The IJ turned to what he had done to address the tickets. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID.376.) He truthfully explained that he had not returned to Tennessee because he did not have the money to do so, but he had retained a lawyer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID.376.) The IJ asked, \"So, did he tell you that it was taken care of?\" and Vargas-Molina responded, \"Yes, he told me he was trying to get everything in order.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID.376-77.) The IJ then abruptly stated that she would not grant him voluntary departure because he was not answering her questions honestly and because \"[t]rying to take care of [the citations] and\n   taking care of [the citations] are two different things.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID.377.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The IJ came back to Vargas-Molina's citation for simple possession of cocaine. Vargas-Molina again explained that he was cited because the officers thought the cocaine was his, but he tried to explain that it was not. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Then, in a disturbing exchange, the IJ said, \"Sir, you absolutely told the government attorney something that was not true when he asked you about it.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID.378.) The government attorney confirmed, \"Correct, I asked him if he had ever been arrested for possession of cocaine.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Then, the IJ said that Vargas-Molina would never have identified the basis of his cocaine citation, and so she had to \"literally pull [the existence of cocaine] charges out of [him].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID.37-80.) Then, she said \"Sir, I know why you did that[.] Because you also, on your own said, they didn't take my fingerprints in Tennessee[.] You were thinking that there was no way they can prove that to me[.] That this charge[ ] existed[.] You just told me tickets.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID.380.) The IJ proceeded to list the ways that Vargas-Molina was untruthful. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID.380-81.) The record unambiguously shows that Vargas-Molina was never arrested or formally charged; his warrant was the product of his failure to show up in Tennessee state court to address his citations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   But the IJ continued, stating that \"more importantly, sir ... [y]ou never even went back to see about that case[,] you had ignored outstanding tickets[.] And hiring an attorney does not resolve that.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID.381.) The IJ accused Vargas-Molina of being dishonest and then ordered him deported. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID.382.) She continued, \"I don't believe you answered the questions that were asked today in such a way that you deserve to receive voluntary departure[.] I really believe I gave you an opportunity to tell me the truth ... and it is very unfortunate you chose not to do that.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID.382-83.) Vargas-Molina had not spoken, nor did IJ Nettles give him an opportunity to do so, until this point. She asked him if he understood her, and he said he did. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Then IJ Nettles apprised him of his right to appeal:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   IJ: Do you wish to appeal this order, or do you wish to accept my order deporting you to Mexico as final?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   Defendant: No, I don't want to appeal anymore.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   IJ: You want to end your case today, are you sure?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   Defendant: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   IJ: And you understand that once you give up your right to appeal this concludes your case and you will have a deportation order against you, do you understand that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   IJ: And do you understand that this concludes today's case, and once you waive your rights of appeal then it is a final deportation order against you, do you understand that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   Defendant: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID.383.) Vargas-Molina was removed to Mexico on April 19, 2011. (ECF No. 32, PageID.123; ECF No. 32-7, PageID.177.) He was the sole caretaker of his youngest child. (ECF No. 32, PageID.131.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Vargas-Molina returned to the United States in June 2011 (ECF No. 32-6, PageID.160), and on March 15, 2016, he was arrested and taken into custody by CBP on his way to work installing carpet. (ECF No. 32, PageID.131.) He \"was released [to remain in the United States] due to Prosecutorial Discretion\" because he \"did not fall under any of the Department of Homeland Security's prioritized immigration levels.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID.178.) In May 2016, he applied for asylum.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; ECF No. 32-6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Almost three years later, in January 2019, while Vargas-Molina's asylum application was pending,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\"ICE\") was attempting to locate a suspected \"criminal alien.\" (ECF No. 32-8, PageID.181.) ICE agents pulled a van over because they had seen a person get into the van who matched their target's appearance. The person was Vargas-Molina, who ICE confirmed was not their criminal target. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) He was taken into custody nonetheless (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ) and charged with illegal re-entry following removal in violation of \u00a7 1326(a) (ECF No. 1 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Before the Court are Vargas-Molina's two motions to dismiss the indictment pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 12(b)(1). (ECF Nos. 32, 33.) The first motion relies on \u00a7 1326(d) to attack the validity of his underlying removal action from 2011. (ECF No. 32.) Vargas-Molina argues that the entry of that removal order was fundamentally unfair because his removal hearing as conducted by the IJs violated his due process rights, which prejudiced him because he would have received voluntary departure otherwise, and that he did not knowingly waive his right to appeal his final order of removal. (ECF No. 32, PageID.110-14.) The second motion argues that IJ Nettles lacked the jurisdiction to enter his removal order because his notice to appear did not include a date and time as\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201229\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) requires.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   He acknowledges that the Sixth Circuit rejected this argument in\n   <em>\n    Santos-Santos v.

(ECF No. 33, PageID.184; ECF No. 39, PageID.324.) On July 7, 2019, a hearing was held and oral argument heard. The Court ordered supplemental briefing, which was filed in a timely manner.

Although IJ Nettles noted that he would need to purchase a plane ticket \"from inside the jail,\" neither IJ explained the other statutory requirements to be eligible for voluntary departure, including that he had not been convicted of an aggravated felony or engaged terrorist activities. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229c ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201240.26\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1240.26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(i)(E), (c)(1)(iii). They also would have told him that they must then weigh his positive and negative qualities,\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Dec. 244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 248 (BIA 1972) ). Nothing in the transcript comes close to laying out these legal requirements. Even though IJ Hacker explained to the group that they could present evidence, ask the government witnesses questions, and examine the government's documents, neither IJ told Vargas-Molina that he could present evidence to demonstrate his positive qualities in support of his voluntary departure claim. They did not explain what such evidence might look like or give him a chance to do so. And although IJ Nettles questioned Vargas-Molina about his criminal history, presumably to assess his statutory eligibility and negative qualities, she never told him what she was doing and how it related to his claim for voluntary departure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Second, IJ Nettles failed to live up to her obligation to allow Vargas-Molina to present evidence on his own behalf and to ask questions that elicit relevant facts-favorable and unfavorable. She did not ask any open-ended questions, nor did she ask clarifying questions that would have allowed Vargas-Molina to develop the record. IJ Nettles never stopped to confirm that Vargas-Molina understood her when he was confused about his fee waiver or about when his fingerprints were run. She also moved rapidly between topics, and the record reveals that as a result, Vargas-Molina was very likely confused or simply silent. Vargas-Molina was also not given a meaningful opportunity to clarify his responses, rebut her conclusions, or to speak at crucial points during the hearing. This is most apparent after IJ Nettles first says she will not grant him voluntary departure, and then proceeds at length to deliver her recap of the hearing, including that Vargas-Molina lied about being arrested and attempted to conceal his connection to cocaine by noting his fingerprints were not run in Tennessee. Notably, IJ Nettles did not ask any questions about Vargas-Molina's positive qualities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   While IJ Nettles questioned Vargas-Molina, she also introduced ambiguities in the record, made inaccurate factual conclusions, and determined that Vargas-Molina was dishonest, which was simply not true as confirmed by the documents she had available to review. For example, she made erroneous factual conclusions and failed to clarify ambiguities regarding his Tennessee citations. She concluded that Vargas-Molina lied when he said he had never been arrested and that he tried to obscure that his citation was for possessing cocaine. But the exhibits show that he has never been arrested.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   IJ Hacker recognized\n   this; she accurately stated on the record at Vargas-Molina's first hearing that he had an outstanding warrant. Instead of obscuring the truth, he volunteered-in response to one of IJ Nettles' few open-ended questions, did he \"have any other problems with police\"-that he was stopped in Tennessee. He was truthful about the events of that stop, including the cause, that he received a citation, and what the citation was for. He also attempted to clarify that he was the passenger and the cocaine was not his. But because the questions were so narrow, and were presented so rapidly, Vargas-Molina was forced to explain what had transpired in a piecemeal fashion. He gave truthful, succinct answers in response to IJ Nettles' terse, targeted questioning. Nonetheless, the IJ determined that Vargas-Molina had lied, and she erroneously concluded at one point that he had been arrested for possession of cocaine. This is precisely why open-ended questions are preferred-they are more likely to provide accurate information than closed-ended questions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The IJ also permitted ambiguities on the record as to whether Vargas-Molina was arrested, cited, or charged for driving without a suspended license and simple possession of cocaine. According to the transcript, the government attorney first asked whether Vargas-Molina had been arrested. Eventually, he said that he was under the impression there was a warrant out for his arrest. Throughout the transcript, the confusion between the IJ, the government attorney, and Vargas-Molina regarding arrests, stops, citations, warrants, and charges is obvious. Vargas-Molina continually states that he received tickets, but the IJ never clarifies what she perceives is lacking in his answers and uses the terms arrests, citations, warrants, and charges interchangeably. In the end, it is unclear if her determination was that Vargas-Molina was arrested, charged, cited or something else.\n   <em>\n    Mendoza-Garcia\n   </em>\n   notes the important function of questioning to elicit favorable facts, as well as unfavorable facts, and to clarify the record. That function was not fulfilled here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   At oral argument on this motion, the United States was unable to point to a single instance where IJ Nettles tried to elicit favorable facts or where Vargas-Molina lied. The Court asked the government no less than five times to point to a place in the transcript where IJ Nettles asked a question about a positive quality of Vargas-Molina's or allowed him to present affirmative evidence. Instead, the United States argued that due process is still afforded when an IJ exercises her discretion to conduct hearings in an \"organized manner,\" which includes ending the proceeding when the noncitizen is unwilling to participate by being untruthful. But there is no indication that Vargas-Molina was not truthful or forthcoming. Crucially, this discretion does not negate the IJ's constitutional obligations as defined in\n   <em>\n    Mendoza-Garcia\n   </em>\n   to help unrepresented noncitizens fully develop the record at their immigration hearings, which at the very least includes telling the noncitizen at the outset that evidence of positive qualities is permissible and relevant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   When prompted to point to an instance where Vargas-Molina lied, the United States argued that Vargas-Molina lied when he said he was not arrested for his Tennessee stops because he could have been \"unofficially arrested\" and that no one knew if he was put in handcuffs, placed in a squad car, or taken to jail and then released. This is nothing but speculation. Whether the traffic stop ripened into an arrest is irrelevant because this Court, like IJ Nettles, can only operate upon the record before it. There is no indication in the record that Vargas-Molina was arrested\n   or that he had reason to\n   <em>\n    think\n   </em>\n   he was arrested. Moreover, the government did not explain how IJ Nettles could possibly have known Vargas-Molina was \"unofficially arrested\" so that she could make a finding that he lied when he said he was not arrested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Next, the United States argued that the Court had no way to know whether Vargas-Molina was lying to his interpreter. Court interpreters swear an oath to accurately interpret what is being said during proceedings, and without evidence that the interpreter violated that solemn oath, this argument lacks any merit whatsoever.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Vargas-Molina's due process rights were violated more significantly than the noncitizen's in\n   <em>\n    Mendoza-Garcia\n   </em>\n   . There, the IJ gave basic explanations, asked open-ended questions, and said that the noncitizen would have a chance to speak. Here, the IJ failed to do any of those things and failed to question Vargas-Molina in a manner that could elicit relevant facts. IJ Nettles often spoke over the interpreter, failed to give Vargas-Molina chances to answer her questions before moving on, spoke quickly, and never confirmed that he understood her when he was confused about his fee waiver or when his fingerprints were run.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jacinto\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11453180\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/208/725/#p728\">\n    208 F.3d at 730-32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (describing the IJ's failure to alleviate the noncitizen's confusion during the removal hearing and to give the noncitizen a change to present his story in narrative form, as well as the adverse effect of the IJ's frequent interrupting).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   The United States offers one primary counterargument, which is that because the Sixth Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Estrada\n   </em>\n   held that a noncitizen has no right to be informed of their eligibility for discretionary relief,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   there can be no due process violation based upon an IJ's failure to fully develop the record when the noncitizen seeks discretionary relief.

This case, as any other, requires the Court to apply binding Sixth Circuit precedent to the facts before it.

Consequently, in a case like this where a defendant seeks to collaterally attack his underlying removal order with the express permission of the Supreme Court and Congress, and where the Supreme Court directs courts to determine in a criminal case, where a defendant's liberty is at stake, whether any due process violation has transpired, this Court takes that duty seriously. Moreover, the questions posed to the United States were designed to explore whether such a violation has taken place. The undersigned was \"looking for\" nothing more than to understand the facts and the law that apply to this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Indeed, what is pertinent here is that\n   <em>\n    Mendoza-Garcia\n   </em>\n   held that an IJ has a duty to develop the record in all relevant respects.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520438\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/918/498/#p503\">\n    918 F.3d at 504, 507\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Vargas-Molina abandoned his application for cancellation of removal, and so the only relevant issue in his removal hearing was his claim for voluntary departure. Even though there would be no due process violation if the IJ had not mentioned voluntary departure, she chose to do so and the defendant clearly stated his request to seek this relief, triggering her responsibility to scrupulously and conscientiously probe into the relevant facts. For these reasons, Vargas-Molina successfully demonstrates a due process violation based on the defects in his removal hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

Independently and collectively, these grounds satisfy\n   <em>\n    Mendoza-Garcia\n   </em>\n   's prejudice standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   First, a defendant can satisfy prejudice by showing that the IJ failed to adequately explain the hearing procedures or elicit relevant facts.\n   <em>\n    Al Khouri\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9266133\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/362/461/#p464\">\n    362 F.3d at 466\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Agyeman v.

Here, the IJ failed to explain the procedure and relevant legal and evidentiary requirements, and so Vargas-Molina never had a chance to present evidence of his positive qualities or rebut the IJ's conclusions about his negative qualities. If he had been given the opportunity, Vargas-Molina would have provided affirmative evidence, such as his \"long residence here, close family ties in the United States, and Humanitarian needs,\"\n   <em>\n    Matter of Arguelles-Campos\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=22%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20811\">\n    22 I. &amp; N. Dec. 811\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 817 (BIA 1999). Indeed, Vargas-Molina has been physically present for ten years consecutively and nineteen years collectively, reflecting his substantial ties to the community (ECF No. 32, PageID.116, PageID.131); he has three children who live in this country; and he was the sole caretaker for his youngest child (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID.131). He also points to his work history as a carpet installer, demonstrating his work ethic and ability to remain employed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) He also would have rebutted the IJ's conclusions about his criminal history by providing clarifying testimony as detailed above. Therefore, there is a reasonable probability that had the IJ set forth the standards and evidentiary requirements and given Vargas-Molina a chance to make his case, she would have granted him voluntary departure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Second, Vargas-Molina can show that the IJ's questioning that led to inaccurate conclusions about his negative qualities harmed him because those conclusions formed the basis of an unsupportable credibility determination that he was dishonest. In\n   <em>\n    Al Khouri\n   </em>\n   , the Eighth Circuit found the defendant proved prejudice when the IJ inappropriately restricted the defendant's testimony.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9266133\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/362/461/#p464\">\n    362 F.3d at 467\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . There, the IJ told the defendant, \"I'm going to elicit, that is bring out the information [ ] by questions and answers.\n   <em>\n    I don't want you to tell me your whole life story, just answer one question\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9266133\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/362/461/#p464\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9266133\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/362/461/#p464\">\n    at 463\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis in original).

Based on the record before this Court, IJ Nettles' conclusion that Vargas-Molina was arrested was false, as was her statement that his \"Print Rapsheet\" indicated he had been arrested. (ECF No. 32-4, PageID.154.) His records with the Department of Homeland Security indicate he only had an outstanding warrant. (ECF No. 32-7, PageID.178.) This faulty credibility determination led the IJ to believe that Vargas-Molina's clarification that his fingerprints were not run in Tennessee was evidence of his effort to hide his cocaine citation from her and that he did not actually believe he had taken care of his citations by hiring a lawyer. In other words, the transcript coupled with other exhibits in the record show exactly how IJ Nettles' deficient questioning formed the basis of her assessment of his negative qualities and led to an unsupportable negative credibility determination. Again, Vargas-Molina satisfies prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Vargas-Molina can also demonstrate that he was prejudiced by the IJ's errors when considered collectively. The Court can reasonably predict how the IJ would have weighed his positive and negative qualities. Community ties can offset criminal records.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v. Ordonez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526985\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/328/479/#p497\">\n    328 F.

Vargas-Molina has an insignificant criminal history that does not include any arrests and certainly no violent arrests such as battery.

Moreover, his long tenure in the United States outweighs his criminal history. And whatever negative credibility determination the IJ may still have drawn, it would have at least been significantly mitigated. Therefore, Vargas-Molina can show the IJ's failure to develop his record in support of voluntary departure prejudiced him because he would have received voluntary departure if the IJ had not made those errors.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ,\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   In response, the United States again returned to\n   <em>\n    Estrada\n   </em>\n   at oral argument, arguing that because there can be no due process violation, there can be no prejudice.

In\n   <em>\n    Mendoza-Lopez\n   </em>\n   , similar reasons that led the lower courts to find that the hearings were constitutionally deficient led the Supreme Court to find that the waivers were unintelligent and unknowing. Although a due process violation is not a prerequisite to finding that a waiver was unintelligent and unconsidered, where a hearing is so deficient that it amounts to a constitutional violation, similar reasons will often render a waiver invalid. That is this case here. Like the respondents in\n   <em>\n    Mendoza-Lopez\n   </em>\n   , Vargas-Molina did not have his claim of relief\n   <em>\n    properly\n   </em>\n   explained to him. The IJs did not explain the process, legal standard, or evidence required for Vargas-Molina to make his case for voluntary departure. Therefore, he could not have known on what grounds he could have appealed, such as that the IJ should have examined his positive qualities and that he should have been permitted to introduce affirmative evidence of those qualities. It is equally salient here as it was in\n   <em>\n    Mendoza-Lopez\n   </em>\n   that Vargas-Molina was deprived of the only basis of his appeal, in this case voluntary departure, because he abandoned his application for cancellation of removal. For these reasons, Vargas-Molina's waiver is invalid as were the waivers in\n   <em>\n    Mendoza-Lopez\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   This is consistent with what little applicable case law exists on waiver in cases where the IJ failed to fully develop the record. In\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Due to the IJs' failures, Vargas-Molina did not know of the basis for an appeal, rendering his waiver of appeal unknowing and unintelligent. Therefore, Vargas-Molina has shown the entry of his 2011 removal order was fundamentally unfair, he is excused from the administrative exhaustion requirement, and he was deprived of the opportunity for judicial review. Accordingly, Vargas-Molina successfully challenges his 2011 order under \u00a7 1326(d), and it cannot serve as the basis of his indictment for illegal reentry under \u00a7 1326(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   For these reasons, his first motion to dismiss his indictment (ECF No. 32 ) is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   , and his second motion to dismiss his indictment (ECF No. 33 ) is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED AS MOOT\n   </strong>\n   .
