For the following reasons, the court concludes Defendant has met his burden of demonstrating the illegality of his life sentences on Counts One and Four, but he has not done so with respect to his conviction and ten-year sentence on Count Two.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   II. BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Following Defendant's conviction, the United States Probation Office prepared a presentence report (\"PSR\") in advance of sentencing. (Dkt. No. 311-1, PSR.) Among other information, the PSR recounted Defendant's prior convictions. It identified the following convictions as predicate violent felonies under the ACCA: Massachusetts breaking and entering in the daytime as a juvenile in 1969 (\u00b6 46); Massachusetts assault and battery on a corrections officer in 1973 (\u00b6 66); Massachusetts assault and battery with a dangerous weapon (\"ABDW\"), and assault on a prison guard in 1977 (\u00b6 77); assault on a federal officer in 1979 (\u00b6 80); and Massachusetts armed robbery while masked (five counts), and assault with a dangerous weapon (\"ADW\") (ten counts) in 1985 (\u00b6 81). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PSR \u00b6 85.) The PSR also identified as predicate serious violent felonies under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203559\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1) the 1977 convictions for ABDW and assault on a prison guard (\u00b6 77), as well as the 1985 convictions for armed robbery while masked and ADW (\u00b6 81). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203559\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 125a.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   At Defendant's sentencing hearing on November 6, 1997, the court (Freedman, J.) explicitly found that the predicate convictions identified in the PSR \"at paragraphs 46, 66, 77, 80, and 81\" qualified him for Armed Career Criminal status, and thus an enhanced penalty, under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(1). (Dkt. No. 297-4 at 4.) The court also found that \"there were at least two, if not more, previous acts of violence that this defendant was involved in prior to this particular case ... that puts the defendant\n   squarely within the three strikes and you're out provisions of\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203559\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) and therefore mandated a prison sentence of life. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-6.) Accordingly, the court sentenced Defendant to \"terms of life imprisonment on Count 1 and 4 to be served concurrently ... followed by a sentence of imprisonment for ten years on Count 2.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendant filed a direct appeal, claiming trial error related to certain statements made by the prosecutor during closing arguments, but the First Circuit affirmed Defendant's conviction and sentence on January 7, 1999.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Then, on March 17, 2000, Defendant filed his first motion to vacate under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , alleging ineffective assistance of counsel as well as evidentiary errors at trial, which the court (Freedman, J.) denied on February 28, 2001. (Dkt. No. 274-2 at 70, 165.) And on July 30, 2002, the First Circuit denied Defendant's request for a certificate of appealability. (Case No. 01-1688.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On June 26, 2015, the Supreme Court decided\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

On February 16, 2016, Defendant, relying on\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , filed a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   application for permission to file a second or successive motion pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   with the First Circuit.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The First Circuit granted Defendant's motion to amend, and on July 20, 2016 granted Defendant's application for permission to file a second or successive\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   motion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Dkt. No. 275.) On July 29, 2016, the First Circuit entered a Corrected Judgment clarifying that the order to transfer Defendant's filings to this court included the amended\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   motion.

United States\n   </em>\n   , on which certiorari had been granted on June 27, 2016. (Dkt. Nos. 282, 283.) Then, on March 9, 2017, Defendant filed another Assented-to Motion to Stay, this time pending the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Sessions v. Dimaya\n   </em>\n   , on which certiorari had been granted on September 29, 2016. (Dkt. No. 286.) This court granted Defendant's second motion to stay on March 13, 2017. (Dkt. No. 287.) In a July 10, 2017 Assented-to Status Report, Defendant reported that although the Supreme Court heard argument in\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   on January 17, 2017, it subsequently restored that case to its calendar for re-argument the following term. (Dkt. No. 289.) In response, this court extended the stay pending the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   . (Dkt. No. 290.)

On May 8, 2019, however, the court ordered the government to confer with Defendant's counsel and confirm with the U.S. Probation Office that the PSR the government filed as an exhibit in its briefing was the correct, final version of the PSR.
