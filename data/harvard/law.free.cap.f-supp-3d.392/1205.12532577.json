BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On May 6, 1983, pursuant to jury verdicts in the Eighth Judicial District Court of Nevada, Howard was convicted of murder in the first degree with use of a deadly weapon and was sentenced to death. He was also convicted of two counts of robbery with use of a deadly weapon in the same proceeding. In support of its death verdict, the jury found two aggravating circumstances: (1) the murder was committed by a person who had been convicted of a prior violent felony; and (2) the murder was committed while the person was engaged in the commission of a robbery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On December 28, 2009, this court entered a final order denying Howard's third amended petition for writ of habeas corpus in relation to the conviction and death sentence. Prior to that, the court had concluded that review of several of Howard's habeas claims, including numerous ineffective assistance of counsel claims, was barred by the doctrine of procedural default.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Howard appealed this court's final order. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals subsequently granted his motion to stay pending the outcome of his then-pending state habeas petition. During the stay, Howard filed the aforementioned motion for a limited remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    MARTINEZ v. RYAN\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Martinez\n   </em>\n   , the U.S. Supreme Court held that ineffective assistance of post-conviction relief counsel may serve as cause to excuse a federal habeas petitioner's procedural default of an ineffective assistance of trial counsel claim.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12188233\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/1/\">\n    566 U.S. at 9, 17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12188233\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/1/\">\n    132 S.Ct. 1309\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Howard concedes that, because of\n   <em>\n    Davila\n   </em>\n   , his IAAC claims are no longer subject to review. ECF No. 385, p. 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   With respect to his IATC claims, Howard has confined his argument on remand to certain claims. The court is left to assume that Howard views the remaining claims as lacking sufficient merit to warrant the court's consideration. Accordingly, the court addresses only the claims Howard supports with argument in his briefs on remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   In addition, the court agrees with Howard's point in his reply brief that the court does not contemplate an additional round of briefing on the merits of any claims that may satisfy the\n   <em>\n    Martinez\n   </em>\n   test. See ECF No. 385, p. 11 (\"[T]he Court did not call for bifurcated litigation, with one round of briefs on whether the procedural defaults can be excused and a second round on whether they are meritorious.\"). As the above-excerpt from\n   <em>\n    Runningeagle\n   </em>\n   makes clear, the determination whether Howard's\n   defaults can be excused under\n   <em>\n    Martinez\n   </em>\n   cannot be divorced from the determination whether his remanded IAC claims succeed on the merits. Thus, the analysis below focuses primarily on whether Howard is entitled to habeas relief on any of his remanded claims without necessarily considering whether he can satisfy the\n   <em>\n    Martinez\n   </em>\n   test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <em>\n    IATC for failure to challenge jury instructions on premeditation and intent.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Howard argues trial counsel provided ineffective assistance by neglecting to challenge incorrect jury instructions regarding the mental state required for first-degree murder in Nevada.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Prior to deliberating in the guilt phase of Howard's trial, the jury was instructed that \"Murder of the First Degree is murder which is (a) perpetrated by any kind of willful, deliberate and premeditated killing, or (b) committed in the perpetration or attempted perpetration of robbery.\" ECF No. 338-12, p. 12. An additional instruction read as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   Premeditation is a design, a determination to kill, distinctly formed in the mind at any moment before or at the time of the killing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   Premeditation need not be for a day, an hour or even a minute. It may be as instantaneous as successive thoughts of the mind. For if the jury believes from the evidence that the act constituting the killing has been preceded by and has been the result of premeditation, no matter how rapidly the premeditation is followed by the act constituting the killing, it is willful, deliberate and premeditated murder.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6217594\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/486/367/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , p. 13.

Less than an hour later, the van was spotted in the parking lot of a tavern. (That evening, the victim's body was discovered in the back of the van, which was still parked in the same spot.) Forty-five minutes after being dropped off by his girlfriend that morning, Howard returned to their motel room (across the street from the tavern) carrying a C.B radio and wearing a gold Seiko watch that she had not seen him wearing before. And, later that day, Howard's girlfriend saw that he had a wallet with family pictures. A C.B. radio was missing from the victim's van and, based on the victim's wife's testimony, the wallet and watch matched the descriptions of items belonging to the victim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   The fingerprint evidence played such a minor role in the State's case that the prosecutor did not even mention it in his initial closing argument. ECF No. 338-27, p. 59-100. It was only after Howard's counsel challenged the evidence in his closing remarks that the prosecutor discussed it in rebuttal.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675753\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/552/117/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , p. 125-26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Because there is no reasonable probability the outcome of Howard's trial would have been different if trial counsel had not obtained a continuance, this claim fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   <em>\n    IATC for failure to conduct a meaningful mitigation investigation and present adequate mitigating evidence.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Howard argues trial counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to compile and present mitigating evidence at the penalty phase of his trial. Among the claims this court determined to be procedurally defaulted prior to the Ninth Circuit's remand was a claim that trial counsel failed to adequately investigate Howard's background and present certain information about his past (i.e., the claim set forth in section 22 of Claim Seventeen of Howard's third amended petition (ECF No. 189) ). Even so, this court recounted much of that same information in addressing related penalty-phase IATC claims in its final order denying Howard's third amended petition:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   Howard argues that counsel's deficient performance precluded the jury from learning about his \"tragic life,\" an account of which is contained in his traverse. Docket #280, p. 22-70. According to that account, Howard, who is Black, spent his early childhood in racially-segregated Alabama. His father was a violent drunk who shot and killed Howard's mother and infant sister when Howard was three years old. Howard and his surviving sister were moved in to the affectionless, poverty-stricken household of a couple in their 70s, where they were emotionally abused by the wife. Unable to find a suitable foster placement for Howard, the Alabama Department of Human Resources committed him to the Alabama Industrial School for Negro Children (also known as Mt. Meigs) when he was twelve years old.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n   While providing very scant information about Howard's own experiences at Mt. Meigs, Howard's traverse contains a lengthy description of the abject conditions and atrocities that purportedly plagued the school during the early 1960s, when Howard spent two and a half years there. According to the traverse, Mt. Meigs was essentially a slave labor camp for juveniles, where the students were provided woefully inadequate food, clothes, shelter, and schooling. Forced to work daily in the fields under extremely harsh conditions and allowed to attend school for only half the day, if at all, the inmates were routinely subjected to physical and sexual abuse from their overseers, as well as their peers. Howard's traverse also speculates that he may have been exposed to highly toxic pesticides during his time at Mt.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   Meigs, the effect of which was to damage a region of the brain that controls one's conduct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n   After spending a tumultuous year with his father, who had been released on parole, Howard, then sixteen years old, was taken in by an aunt who lived in New York City. Howard's traverse goes to great lengths to describe the adverse conditions (violent crime and poverty) present in the neighborhood in which Howard lived (i.e., the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn) upon his arrival in New York, but (as with the description of Mt. Meigs) includes very little information about Howard's personal experience.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n   Howard enlisted in the Marine Corps at the age of nineteen. He spent thirteen months deployed with a mine-sweeping team in the vicinity of Danang during the Viet Nam War. According to his traverse, Howard's personality and behavior had changed when he returned to New York from Viet Nam. Among other irregularities, he was \"more erratic and aggressive,\" quick to anger, and prone to drifting off as if in a trance. In addition, he seemed to be self-medicating by drinking beer and smoking \"a lot of marijuana.\" His emotional state appeared to deteriorate throughout the late 1970s and into the early 1980s, a period in which his criminal activity became more pronounced and serious.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n   Lastly, Howard posits in his traverse that much of his behavior could be attributed to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and an accompanying psychotic disorder, a diagnosis that should have been, but never was, considered when he was evaluated at Patton and Atascadero, as well as in other court-ordered evaluations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   ECF No. 294, p. 19-21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   In denying relief, this court found, based on the state court record, that Howard had impeded counsel's efforts to obtain mitigating information by refusing to sign releases, to answer counsel's questions, and to cooperate with a court-appointed psychiatrist.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675753\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/552/117/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , p. 16-23.

With respect to Howard's history of non-violence in confinement, the only specific evidence Howard cites - i.e., the records regarding his stays in mental health facilities - was among the evidence Howard hindered counsel from obtaining. In addition, Howard does not proffer any evidence as to the specific testimony jail personnel, fellow prisoners, or a psychiatrist might have been able to provide.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dows v. Wood\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1743374\" index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/211/480/#p486\">\n    211 F.3d 480\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 486 (9th Cir. 2000) (denying ineffective assistance of counsel claim based on lack of preparation for failure to call witnesses when no affidavits were submitted to support petitioner's assertion as to what testimony would have been provided).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   Because Howard has not established a reasonable probability that the outcome of his trial would have been different but for counsel's failure to refute dangerousness, this claim fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   Lastly, Howard has not presented argument on several of the IATC claims remanded\n   by the Ninth Circuit. Because it is petitioner's burden to demonstrate cause and prejudice to excuse a procedural default, those claims are forfeited.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bousley v.

CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   For reasons set forth above, Howard is not entitled to relief on any of the twenty-nine claims remanded by the Ninth Circuit. Because this order, together with prior orders, completes the proceedings assigned on limited remand, this order is the \"final order\" for the purposes of the Ninth Circuit's limited remand order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 311, p. 2 (\"Within 10 days after the district court enters its final order on limited remand, counsel for the parties shall file simultaneous status reports in this Court.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-174\">\n    The court of appeals ordered this court to also address Howard's motion for leave to file a fourth-amended petition to raise three additional claims.
