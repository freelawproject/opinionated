The '738 patent relates to the preparation of monocrystalline gallium nitride films via molecular beam epitaxy, which, in short, is a process used in creating semiconductors for LED lights. Defendants are Everlight Electronics Co., Ltd. and Everlight Americas, Inc. (together, \"Everlight\"); Epistar Corp. (\"Epistar\"); Lite-On Inc., LiteOn Service USA, Inc., Lite-On Technology Corp., and LiteOn Trading USA, Inc. (together, \"Lite-On\" and, collectively with Epistar and Everlight, \"Defendants\"). Defendants are manufacturers of LED devices that Plaintiff alleges infringe the technology covered by the '738 patent. There are currently four interrelated motions before the Court: (1) Plaintiff's motion to affirm the jury verdict or, in the alternative, to modify the claim construction order or amend its complaint, (2) Defendants' motion to rescind the Court's award to Plaintiff of partial attorney's fees and costs, (3) Defendants' motion for attorney's fees, and (4) Plaintiff's motion for disallowance of costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After hearing, the Court\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     DENIES\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff's motion to affirm the jury verdict or, in the alternative, to modify the claim construction order or amend its complaint (Dkt.

In May 2013, the Court ordered that the cases be consolidated. A jury trial was held between November 2, 2015 and November 19, 2015. The jury found the '738 patent to be valid and that Epistar and Everlight willfully infringed it. Following trial, Defendants renewed their motion for judgment as a matter of law and moved for a new trial or remittitur. On July 22, 2016, the Court denied Defendants' motion as to liability but granted Defendants Epistar and Everlight a new trial as to damages or remittitur. Plaintiff then moved for reconsideration of the Court's decision as to damages, which the Court also denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Appeal\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In August 2016, the parties cross-appealed various rulings made by the Court,\n   including the ruling on Defendants' motion for judgment as a matter of law. On July 25, 2018, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reversed the Court's decision on Defendants' motion for judgment as a matter of law and dismissed all other pending appeals as moot. On October 12, 2018, the Federal Circuit denied Plaintiff's requests for re-hearing. The Federal Circuit then issued a formal mandate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Federal Circuit reversed the Court's denial of judgment as a matter of law for Defendants on the basis that the '738 patent is invalid for lack of enablement. The Federal Circuit described the dispositive issue as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   The district court construed two terms relevant here. First, it construed \"grown on\" to mean \"formed indirectly or directly above.\" Under this construction, claim 19's growth layer and buffer layer do not have to be in direct contact; there can be intervening layers between them. Second, the district court construed \"a non-single crystalline buffer layer\" to mean \"a layer of material that is not monocrystalline, namely, [1] polycrystalline, [2 amorphous or [3] a mixture of polycrystalline and amorphous, located between the first substrate and the first growth layer.\" And, while the district court did not specifically construe \"growth layer,\" BU does not dispute that \"growth layer\" includes within its scope a monocrystalline growth layer.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Assuming a monocrystalline growth layer, together these constructions raise six permutations for the relationship between claim 19's growth layer and buffer layer: (1) monocrystalline growth layer formed\n   <em>\n    indirectly\n   </em>\n   on a polycrystalline buffer layer; (2) monocrystalline growth layer formed\n   <em>\n    indirectly\n   </em>\n   on a buffer layer that is a mixture of polycrystalline and amorphous; (3) monocrystalline growth layer formed\n   <em>\n    indirectly\n   </em>\n   on an amorphous buffer layer; (4) monocrystalline growth layer formed\n   <em>\n    directly\n   </em>\n   on a polycrystalline buffer layer; (5) monocrystalline growth layer formed\n   <em>\n    directly\n   </em>\n   on a buffer layer that is a mixture of polycrystalline and amorphous; and (6) monocrystalline growth layer formed\n   <em>\n    directly\n   </em>\n   on an amorphous buffer layer. The enablement issue in this case concerns this sixth permutation-a monocrystalline growth layer formed directly on an amorphous buffer layer.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    Trs. of Bos.

Cir. 2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Defendants' non-enablement defense had two components: a legal component and a factual component. The legal component turned on what it meant for the \"full scope\" of the patent to be enabled. Defendants argued that in order to be enabled the patent had to teach a person of ordinary skill in the art (\"POSITA\") how to make all six permutations describe above. The factual component turned on whether or not the patent did in fact teach a POSITA how to make a monocrystalline growth layer\n   <em>\n    directly on\n   </em>\n   an amorphous buffer layer. Defendants argued that the evidence at trial established that it was impossible to make a monocrystalline growth layer\n   <em>\n    directly on\n   </em>\n   an amorphous buffer layer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In denying judgment as a matter of law for Defendants, the Court rejected both components of Defendants' non-enablement defense. In turn, the Federal Circuit reversed the Court on both points. On the law, the Federal Circuit held that \"[its] precedents make clear that the specification must enable the full scope of the claimed invention,\" which meant that the '738 patent had to teach all six permutations.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517716\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/896/1357/#p1360\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517716\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/896/1357/#p1360\">\n    at 1364\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

On September 4, 2018, Plaintiff filed a motion to disallow Defendants' costs, which Defendants subsequently opposed. On November 14, 2018, Defendants filed a motion to rescind the Court's award of attorney's fees and costs and a motion for attorney's fees. Plaintiff opposed both motions. Finally, on December 17, 2018, Plaintiff filed a motion to affirm the jury verdict or, in the alternative, to modify the claim construction order or amend its complaint, which Defendants subsequently opposed.

Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    a. Exclusion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Plaintiff contends that the Court excluded at trial the non-enablement invalidity defense upon which Defendants ultimately prevailed on appeal. In its view, the Court excluded the defense as a sanction pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 16(f) and 37(b) because Defendants failed to timely disclose it. The operative pretrial scheduling order required Defendants to file their preliminary invalidity and non-infringement disclosures by October 23, 2013 and their amended / supplemental disclosures by December 16, 2013. According to Plaintiff, neither Defendants' preliminary nor amended invalidity contentions disclosed the winning non-enablement defense. And Defendants failure to timely disclose the defense led the Court to exclude it at trial. Because the defense was excluded as a sanction, it was improper for either the Court or the Federal Circuit to consider it on the merits. Thus, Plaintiff urges the Court to affirm the jury verdict in its favor pursuant to Rule 60(a) notwithstanding the Federal Circuit's decision granting Defendants judgment as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   There are several factual problems with Plaintiff's position. First, Defendants raised the defense in their summary judgment motion on invalidity, and the Court addressed it on the merits. Second, Plaintiff asked the Court to exclude the defense prior to trial due to its late disclosure, but the Court expressly refused to do so. Third, Defendants raised the defense again in their post-trial motion for judgment as a matter of law. In opposing that motion, Plaintiff did not argue the defense had been excluded at trial, and the Court again addressed the defense on the merits. Fourth, Plaintiff did not argue on appeal the defense had been excluded at trial. This case history is difficult to square with Plaintiff's contention that the defense was excluded by the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Nonetheless, Plaintiff parses the trial record for proof that the Court excluded the defense. Plaintiff focuses on the testimony of Defendants' expert witness Dr. Fitzgerald, where the parties repeatedly clashed over the proper scope of his testimony regarding Defendants' invalidity defense of non-enablement. The Court concedes that the record is ambiguous on this particular point. The dispute originated in part around a slide demonstrating all the permutations of the Court's claim construction, which had never been disclosed before. Both Plaintiff and Defendants point to portions of the record they believe vindicate their respective positions.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 1596 at 170-71 (Court acknowledged that invalidity defense had been raised previously and allowed Defendants to explore it with Dr. Fitzgerald),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 1597 at 36-39 (Court barred Plaintiff from asking Dr. Fitzgerald about \"all permutations\" of the '738 patent because Defendants did not raise the issue on direct examination and the issue was \"dead\"). The bottom line, however, is that it is not enough for Plaintiff identify ambiguity in the trial record because there is nothing in the record to suggest the Court struck the enablement defense. Prior to trial, the Court explicitly refused to strike the defense because it determined the defense had been adequately disclosed. If the Court in fact reversed that decision during trial, then there would be a clearer statement in the record to that effect. Following trial, the Court denied Defendants judgment as a matter of law as to enablement on the merits. If the Court in fact excluded Defendants' non-enablement defense at trial, then there would have been no reason to do so. Accordingly, the Court confirms that it did not exclude Defendants' non-enablement defense at trial, and the Federal Circuit properly relied on the defense in granting Defendants judgment as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <em>\n    b. Rule 60(a)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Even if Plaintiff understood that the Court excluded Defendants' non-enablement defense at trial, Rule 60(a) does not supply a procedural mechanism for instating that ruling at this stage of proceedings. Rule 60(a) allows the Court to correct \"a clerical mistake\" or other \"mistake arising from oversight or omission.\" But this is not a simple clerical mistake in the judgment. Plaintiff is asking the Court to re-interpret the trial record in a way that would have significant ramifications for the substantive rights of the parties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bowen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3476359\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/490/27/#p29\">\n    490 F.3d at 29\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . If the Court granted Plaintiff's request, it would be altering the basis for its decision on Defendants' post-trial motion for judgment as a matter of law. Instead of addressing Defendants' invalidity defense on the merits, the Court would be dismissing it on procedural grounds. This in turn would nullify the subsequent reversal of the Court's decision by the Federal Circuit. And Plaintiff would prevail on its claims, notwithstanding the fact that Federal Circuit issued a\n   mandate in favor of Defendants. This stretches Rule 60(a) too far.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Indeed, Plaintiff cites no authority for the proposition that Rule 60(a) -- or, for that matter, any other federal rule or judicial doctrine -- can be used to modify a judgment in the present circumstances. The cases Plaintiff does cite bear little similarity to the facts of this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sartin v. McNair Law Firm PA\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5899446\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/756/259/#p266\">\n    756 F.3d 259\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 266 (4th Cir. 2014) (affirming order clarifying that sanctions order applied to plaintiffs' attorney rather than plaintiffs themselves);\n   <em>\n    Garamendi v.

These cases all involved minor, clerical-type modifications to the judgment, none of which fundamentally changed the outcome of the litigation. Here, Plaintiff's request that the Court affirm the jury verdict in its favor despite Defendant's successful appeal exceeds the scope of relief ordinarily permitted by Rule 60(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <em>\n    c. Mandate Rule\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Not only is there no procedural avenue for granting relief from the Federal Circuit's judgment, but such relief is foreclosed by the \"mandate rule\" which governs the Court's authority to take further actions following an appellate disposition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Exxon Chem.

At minimum, the parties agree that the mandate rule prevents the Court from taking actions that are inconsistent with the judgment and written opinion of the Federal Circuit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Retractable Techs., Inc. v.

On its face, then, Plaintiff's request that the Court affirm the jury verdict is inconsistent with the judgment of the Federal Circuit. Plaintiff argues that this is not the case because the Federal Circuit opinion did not\n   <em>\n    directly\n   </em>\n   address the Court's supposed exclusion of the non-enablement defense. This is unpersuasive for two reasons. First, the Federal Circuit reversed the Court on the merits of Defendants' non-enablement defense. Embedded in the Court's decision on the merits was the conclusion that the defense had not been excluded at trial. Second, in order to reverse the Court on the merits, the Federal Circuit reviewed the trial record and found that it contained evidence sufficient to grant judgment in favor of Defendants. That means that the Federal Circuit looked at the same record Plaintiff now contends contains proof that the Court excluded Defendants' non-enablement defense. Yet the Federal Circuit did not reach the conclusion urged by Plaintiff. Rather, based on the same record, the Federal Circuit granted judgment for Defendants. For both these reasons, the Plaintiff's request for relief falls within the\n   scope of the Federal Circuit's mandate. The Court lacks the authority to affirm the jury verdict and, therefore, must deny Plaintiff's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <em>\n    d. Amendment\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In the alternative, Plaintiff requests that it be allowed to amend its complaint to allege infringement of two additional claims -- claims 11 and 12 -- of the '738 patent. Both claims specify that the buffer layer be \"recrystallized, partially amorphous,\" which excludes permutations of the patent that have a purely amorphous buffer layer. In other words, Plaintiff proposes to add claims not susceptible to Defendant's argument that it was impossible to grow a monocrystalline growth layer\n   <em>\n    directly on\n   </em>\n   an amorphous buffer layer. And, likewise, the Federal Circuit's judgment would not invalidate them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a) instructs that the Court should give leave to amend freely \"when justice so requires.\" Fed.

The only basis for \"good cause\" put forth by Plaintiff is the same argument that Defendants belatedly disclosed their non-enablement defense. But Plaintiff was aware of this defense at least as early as November 2014 when Defendants moved for summary judgment on invalidity. Indeed, on November 14, 2014, Plaintiff moved to strike Defendants' motion because it contained defenses that had not been timely disclosed. Further, Plaintiff moved to strike Defendants' non-enablement defenses again in September 2015. At no point after November 2014 (until the present motion) did Plaintiff seek leave to amend. This delay defeats any showing of good cause. In that time, the Court held two trials, and the parties pursued cross-appeals to the Federal Circuit and back. The burden on the Court and Defendants of granting Plaintiff leave to amend at this stage is simply too great. Thus, the Court denies Plaintiff's request for leave to amend its complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <em>\n    e.

They argue that the case is exceptional for two reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   First, Defendants claim that the case is exceptional due to the meritless nature of Plaintiff's claims. For a case to be \"exceptional\" under \u00a7 285, the losing party's litigating position must be \"so merit-less as to 'stand out' from the norm.\"\n   <em>\n    SFA Sys., LLC v.

Defendants contend that once Plaintiff's expert Dr. Piner conceded that it is \"a basic law of physics that it is not possible to epitaxially grow a monocrystalline film on an amorphous structure,\" Plaintiff's claims ceased to have any merit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In Defendants' view, this was the critical admission because the Federal Circuit ultimately found that the '738 patent was not enabled since it was impossible to grow a monocrystalline growth layer directly on an amorphous buffer layer. Defendants characterize Plaintiff's various arguments and procedural maneuvers from that point forward as \"specious,\" \"desperate,\" \"meritless,\" and \"frivolous.\" No matter the gloss Defendants' try to give the record, however, they cannot escape the fact that the Court ruled against their non-enablement defense when they raised it on summary judgment, and then ruled against it again on the motion for judgment as a matter of law. Further, the\n   jury returned a verdict for Plaintiff finding infringement of the '738 patent. These facts belie the argument that Plaintiff's position was entirely without merit. Thus, the Federal Circuit's reversal of the Court's enablement decision does not change the Court's conclusion that Plaintiff took a reasonable, albeit unsuccessful, position on enablement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Second, Defendants contend that Plaintiff engaged in a pattern of litigation misconduct which makes this case exceptional. Defendants complain of two sets of inappropriate conduct: (1) Plaintiff pursued a frivolous \"design-win\" theory of damages based on Defendants' foreign sales of infringing products; and (2) Plaintiff engaged in abusive and uncivil conduct throughout the litigation, first by filing a series of unmeritorious sanctions motions against Defendants, and then by sending threatening emails to Defendants' counsel during and after trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The first set of conduct is insufficient to make this case exceptional. Plaintiff disputes Defendant's claim that the \"design-win\" theory was unmeritorious, pointing to two subsequent decisions finding that foreign sales of infringing products were actionable under U.S. patent law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    WesternGeco LLC v.

The Court will not punish Plaintiff for pursuing a novel legal theory, especially one that has since been partly vindicated by the Supreme Court. Moreover, the Court does not accept Defendants' assertion that the \"design-win\" theory was frivolous because Plaintiff ultimately dropped it at trial. Given that the Court expressed uncertainty about the theory throughout the case and then severed it from the main trial, Plaintiff's decision not to pursue the theory seems like a reasonable decision as a matter of litigation strategy, not a concession that the theory was without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The second set of activity presents a closer question. As Defendants point out, Magistrate Judge Boal observed that Plaintiff's use of sanction motions was \"expensive and wasteful.\" Dkt. No. 796 at 11. On the other hand, some of those motions were successful. Defendants were sanctioned for denying Plaintiff reasonable access to sales data, which resulted in a wasted trip by counsel to Taiwan. Defendants were also ordered to pay costs related to their over-designation of documents as \"attorneys eyes only\" in violation of the case's protective order. And Magistrate Judge Boal did not restrict her criticisms to Plaintiff, observing that in the course of discovery Epistar \"inappropriately attempted to shift to [Plaintiff] its obligations,\" Dkt. No. 832 at 4 n.3, and \"disregarded its obligations,\" Dkt. No. 911 at 5. While Plaintiff's tactic of weaponizing sanctions motions was unfortunate, it is precisely the conduct to which the Court was referring when it previously described how \"both sides tangoed.\" Dkt. No. 1770 at 7. Therefore, the Court will not base an award of attorney's fees on Plaintiff's use (or misuse) of sanction motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The conduct of Plaintiff's counsel in sending threatening emails to Defendants' counsel during and after trial, however, does support a partial award of attorney's fees. During trial, the Court reprimanded Plaintiff's counsel, Michael Shore, for authoring a \"toxic email series\" and ordered that he stop sending emails to Defendants' counsel. Dkt. No. 1598 at 4:24-5:21. Once the trial ended, Mr. Shore resumed sending emails to Defendants' counsel, prompting Defendants\n   to file a motion for contempt against him. The Court then ordered Mr. Shore to stop sending emails to Defendants' counsel \"until proceedings before this Court have ended.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dkt. No. 1650 at 4. At least one of the emails sent by Mr. Shore, which claimed \"I usually just execute lawyers who try to perpetrate a fraud upon my clients and the Court,\" Dkt.

Both instances are detailed in the Court's July 2016 opinion on Plaintiff's motion for fees and costs and formed the basis for the Court's partial award of attorney's fees for Plaintiff pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20285\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 285\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Aside from these two instances, however, the Court observed that Defendants' litigation conduct \"was not unreasonable. While counsel on both sides were aggressive and at times uncivil, that is unfortunately true in many patent cases. Here, both sides tangoed. Considering the totality of the circumstances, the Court cannot assign blame for this contentiousness to one side.\" Dkt. No. 1770 at 6. After all, as discussed above, the Court had to bar Plaintiff's lead counsel from sending emails to Defendants' counsel due to the threatening nature of his prior emails. Notwithstanding this misconduct, the Court still awarded Plaintiff nearly $70,000 in costs. The Court previously concluded that Plaintiff's misconduct was not serious enough to overcome the presumption in favor of awarding costs. For similar reasons, the Court finds that Defendants are entitled to recover their costs now that they are the prevailing parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <em>\n    b. Taxable Costs\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <em>\n    Deposition Transcripts:\n   </em>\n   Defendants originally sought $74,234.94 in total costs for deposition transcripts. They subsequently revised their request down to $52,744.33 after Plaintiff pointed out that they were double counting for video\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   transcripts of certain depositions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   In total, the revised request covers 48 depositions of 40 different witnesses, that were \"either (a) noticed by the Plaintiff; (b) obtained for use because Plaintiff listed them on their witness list, (c) designated by Plaintiff as a trial witness, or (d) their testimony was in part admitted to the court (either in trial or in a pre-trial proceeding).\" Dkt. No. 1853 \u00b6 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Plaintiff argues that Defendants can only recover transcription costs for depositions that Defendants used at trial. Four of the depositions on Defendants' list fall into this category, with a total transcription cost of $3,370.85.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201920\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1920\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2), the prevailing party can recover costs related to \"recorded transcripts necessarily obtained for use in the case.\" The language of the statute does not limit taxable costs to transcripts used at trial. And the First Circuit has held that courts have the discretion to award \"deposition costs if special circumstances warrant it, even though the depositions were not put in evidence or used at the trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Templeman v. Chris Craft Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"333018\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/770/245/#p249\">\n    770 F.2d 245\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 249 (1st Cir. 1985). Therefore, the Court will not limit Defendants to recovering just the costs for deposition transcripts used at trial. Rather, the Court will take a case-by-case approach to determining whether \"special circumstances\" exist to award transcript costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   First, Plaintiff claims that Defendants cannot recover the costs of 15 transcripts from the depositions of manufacturer representatives because Defendants previously took the position (in opposing Plaintiff's\n   motion for fees and costs) that the witnesses' testimony was \"completely immaterial to the case.\" Dkt. No. 1813 at 12. But Plaintiff fails to acknowledge the reason that the manufacturer representatives' testimony was \"completely immaterial\"; their testimony was relevant only to Plaintiff's \"design-win\" theory of liability, which Plaintiff ultimately did not pursue at trial. While Plaintiff is correct that the transcripts were not necessary for trial, Defendants are correct that the transcripts were necessary at the time they were obtained because Plaintiff intended to use them at trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    WBIP, LLC v. Kohler Co.\n   </em>\n   , No. CIV.A. 11-10374-NMG,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%204471412\">\n    2014 WL 4471412\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (D. Mass. Sept. 8, 2014) (awarding costs because it \"appropriate for [the prevailing party] to obtain the transcripts as part of its preparation for trial\"). Accordingly, the Court allows Defendants to recover the costs of the 15 manufacturer representative transcripts or videos totaling $8,670.81.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Second, Plaintiff claims that Defendants cannot recover the cost of 19 transcripts from the depositions of Defendants' employees or expert witnesses. On this score, Plaintiff has a stronger argument. Courts in this district generally have held that parties cannot recover the costs of their own deposition transcripts.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Hillman v. Berkshire Med.

The Court denies Defendants costs for the 19 transcripts from the depositions of their own employees and expert witnesses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Once these specific objections are resolved, there are still ten transcripts for which Plaintiff generally objects to the award of costs. Seven of the ten transcripts are for witnesses that Plaintiff listed in their pretrial disclosures as \"expects to call\" witnesses. Defendants can recover costs for these transcripts because it was reasonable to obtain them in anticipation of cross-examination at trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    WBIP\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%204471412\">\n    2014 WL 4471412\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3. Two transcripts were cited in Defendants' motion for summary judgment on invalidity. The costs for these transcripts are also recoverable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Keurig, Inc. v.

Defendants included the transcript in their initial bill of costs but did not supply additional information in opposing Plaintiff's motion to disallow costs. Without more, the Court cannot determine whether it is appropriate to award costs for the Lei transcript. Therefore, the Court denies costs for that one transcript.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   In total, the Court allows Defendants costs for 28 deposition transcripts for a total of $25,990.41.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <em>\n    Demonstratives:\n   </em>\n   Defendants seek $50,527.51 for \"[f]ees and disbursements for printing.\" Of this amount, Plaintiff objects to $44,257.00 in costs related to the preparation and presentation of demonstratives, including various graphics, charts, and other visual aids that were used at trial.

However, in\n   <em>\n    Summit Technology, Inc. v.

After reviewing the limited caselaw, the Federal Circuit concluded that most likely \"the First Circuit would adopt the narrow, legal definition of the term 'exemplification' endorsed by the Fifth Circuit, the Eleventh Circuit, and [the Federal Circuit] applying Sixth Circuit law\" and, accordingly, denied the prevailing party costs related to its trial consultant.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"936319\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/435/1371/#p1374\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"936319\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/435/1371/#p1374\">\n    at 1377-78\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Defendants argue that the demonstratives created by their trial consultant were \"useful\" and \"helpful\" to the Court in the course of the trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201920\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1920\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (4) (stating that \"exemplification\" costs are taxable if \"\n   <em>\n    necessarily\n   </em>\n   obtained for use in the case\" (emphasis added)).

In its reply brief, however, Plaintiff concedes that this form of relief is foreclosed by the mandate rule.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    Accordingly, Defendants are not seeking their attorney's fees for the entire case but only those incurred from September 2015 when Dr. Piner made this admission.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    The Court did not originally rule on the contempt motion.
