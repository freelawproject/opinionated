(Docket No. 4650.) Rodr\u00edguez moves to enforce the plea agreement, requesting that the Court compel the United States to amend its sentencing recommendation. (Docket No. 5158.) For the reasons set forth below, Rodr\u00edguez's motion is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On September 2, 2008, a grand jury charged Rodr\u00edguez and 73 other individuals with, among other offenses, conspiring to possess with intent to distribute controlled substances within 1,000 feet of a public school, and conspiring to use and carry firearms and ammunition during, and in relation to a drug trafficking crime in violation of 21 U.S.C. section 846 and 18 U.S.C. section 924(\n   <em>\n    o\n   </em>\n   ), respectively. (Docket No. 4.) Rodr\u00edguez stood trial with defendants Wilfredo Rosario-Camacho (\"Rosario\"), Josu\u00e9 P\u00e9rez-Mercado (P\u00e9rez\"), Ram\u00f3n Maysonet-Soler (\"Maysonet\"), and Jos\u00e9 Negr\u00f3n-Sostre (\"Negr\u00f3n\"). (Docket 2068.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On the forty-fourth day of trial, the jury found Rodr\u00edguez, Rosario and Maysonet guilty of counts one through six of the indictment. (Docket No. 2661.) The jury found P\u00e9rez and Negr\u00f3n guilty of counts one through five of the indictment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Rodr\u00edguez received a sentence of life imprisonment as to counts one through five,\n   and a consecutive 240-month sentence as to count six. (Docket No. 3146.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The First Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the defendants' convictions and remanded the case for a new trial, holding that \"the closure of the courtroom during jury selection was a structural error.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Negr\u00f3n-Sostre\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4273833\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/790/295/#p311\">\n    790 F.3d 295\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 311 (1st Cir. 2015). The First Circuit Court of Appeals concluded, however, that \"there was sufficient evidence to establish that each of the defendants aided and abetted each of the others in the possession with intent to distribute all of the types of drugs charged.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4273833\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/790/295/#p311\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4273833\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/790/295/#p311\">\n    at 311\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Each defendant reached a plea agreement with the United States, obviating the need for a second trial. Negr\u00f3n entered into a plea agreement with the United States first, followed by Rodr\u00edguez. (Docket Nos. 4627 and 4650.) Rodr\u00edguez's plea agreement provides that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   The United States reserves its right to amend this recommendation if further plea negotiations with similarly situated codefendants result in a more favorable sentence recommendation as part of their plea agreement(s).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   (hereinafter, \"codefendant clause\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 4. The United States and Rodr\u00edguez stipulated to a Total Offense Level of 38, agreeing \"to recommend a sentence within the applicable guideline range.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On February 11, 2106, Rodriguez pled guilty to count one of the indictment. (Docket No. 4649.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After Rodr\u00edguez pled guilty, Rosario, Maysonet and P\u00e9rez entered into plea agreements with the United States (hereinafter, \"subsequent plea agreements\"). (Docket Nos. 4673, 4675 and 4692.) The subsequent plea agreements set forth a Total Offense Level of 38; the United States agreed, however, \"to recommend a sentence within the lower to mid-range for the applicable guideline range.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The United States did not amend Rodr\u00edguez's sentence recommendation to reflect the \"lower to mid-range\" language in the subsequent plea agreements, declining to exercise its right to do so pursuant to the codefendant clause.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 4650 at p. 4. On May 11, 2016, the Court sentenced Rodr\u00edguez to 265 months of imprisonment. (Docket No. 4721.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Rosario moved to withdraw his guilty plea, asserting\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   that the Court participated in plea negotiations in violation of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11. (Docket Nos. 4729 and 4911.) The Court granted Rosario's motion, deeming \"it appropriate to order the Clerk of the Court to reassign this case to a different judge.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Rosario-Camacho\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12522645\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/282/449/#p458\">\n    282 F. Supp. 3d 449\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 458 (D.P.R. 2017) (Besosa, J.). After reassignment to a different judge, the United States and Rosario entered into a second plea agreement. (Docket No. 5043.) Pursuant to the second plea agreement, the United States and Rosario agreed to recommend \"a term of imprisonment of 160-180 months.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 3. The United States and Rosario stipulated to a Total Offense Level of 34, four levels less than the first plea agreement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 4673 at p. 5. Rosario pled guilty as to count one of the indictment. (Docket Nos. 5045 and 5064.) The\n   Court imposed a sentence of 160 months imprisonment. (Docket No. 5092.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Rodr\u00edguez's Motion to Enforce the Plea Agreement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Rodr\u00edguez moved to enforce his plea agreement on May 28, 2019, more than a year after the Court imposed his sentence. (Docket Nos. 4720 and 5158.) Rodr\u00edguez sets forth two arguments in support of his motion. (Docket No. 5158.) First, he argues that Rosario \"negotiated a more favorable sentence recommendation and obtained a substantially lower sentence, all in violation [of Rodr\u00edguez's] plea agreement.\" (Docket No. 5158 at p. 7.) Second, Rodr\u00edguez argues that the \"sentence imposed by this Court followed a change of plea that was the product of a violation of [his] constitutional rights.\" (Case No. 19-1185, Docket No. 3 at p. 1.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ultimately, Rodr\u00edguez seeks to vacate his sentence, and compel the United States to adopt the sentencing recommendation set forth in Rosario's second plea agreement. (Docket No. 5158.) The United States opposed Rodr\u00edguez's motion, and Rodr\u00edguez replied. (Docket Nos. 5165 and 5169.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Jurisdiction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Court possesses \"original jurisdiction, exclusive of the courts of the States, of all offenses of the laws of the United States.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203231\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court's authority to grant post-conviction relief, however, is limited.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Fed. R. Crim. P. 35(a) (\"Within 14 days after sentencing, the court may correct a sentence that resulted from arithmetical, technical or other clear error.\").

The motion to enforce the plea agreement is devoid of any argument as to jurisdiction. (Docket No. 5158.) Accordingly, Rodr\u00edguez's motion is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Rodr\u00edguez may seek relief, however, pursuant to the applicable statute. The First Circuit Court of Appeals has held that \"habeas corpus provides an appropriate procedural vehicle for advancing\" claims that the United States breached a plea agreement.\n   <em>\n    Bemis v.
