PAULEY III, Senior United States District Judge:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiffs Kortright Capital Partners LP (\"Kortright\") and its co-founders Matthew Taylor and Ty Popplewell bring this diversity action against Investcorp Investment Advisers Limited (together with various affiliates, \"Investcorp\"). Broadly speaking, Plaintiffs allege that Investcorp-a longtime seed investor in funds operated by Kortright-induced them to proceed with a multi-million-dollar transaction with a competitor of Investcorp's, which depended\n   on Investcorp's consent and participation. Although Investcorp purportedly promised to support the transaction, Plaintiffs claim that Investcorp reneged at the last moment-mere days before the closing date of the transaction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In the wake of the transaction's implosion, Plaintiffs brought an assortment of New York common law claims for negligent misrepresentation, negligence, breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and promissory estoppel. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint, ECF No. 1 (\"Compl.\").) Only Plaintiffs' negligent misrepresentation claim survived Investcorp's motion to dismiss and subsequent motion for summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kortright Capital Partners LP v.

This Opinion &amp; Order also addresses the parties' motions to preclude the expert testimony of their respective damages and industry experts. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. at 640.) Finally, this Court calculates the fees to be awarded Plaintiffs for Investcorp's discovery misconduct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kortright Capital Partners LP v. Investcorp Inv.

(Trial Tr. at 40-42 (Taylor).) Kortright was an investment adviser for a series of hedge funds that began managing money for clients in May 2010. (Trial Tr. at 43 (Taylor).) In general, Kortright employed a hybrid strategy between event-driven investing and long-term value investing. (Trial Tr. at 43-45 (Taylor); Trial Tr. at 1223-24 (Popplewell).) After forming Kortright, Plaintiffs planned to develop its track record for a few years under a joint venture structure with its original seed funder before seeking a new seeding arrangement that would eventually enable Kortright to stand on its own as an asset manager. (Trial Tr. at 45-46 (Taylor).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In 2013, Plaintiffs embarked on their search for a new seeding partner. One of Kortright's potential suitors was Investcorp, an alternative asset manager that offered its clients the opportunity to invest in hedge funds and other products. (Trial Tr. at 803-04 (Vamvakas).) As relevant here, one of Investcorp's businesses-its single manager platform-involved identifying hedge fund managers and providing them with seed capital to grow their assets in return for a revenue share. (Trial Tr. at 645, 803-07 (Vamvakas); Trial Tr. at 995 (Erdely).) Investcorp would also monitor the performance of the managers in real time. (Trial Tr. at 997-99 (Erdely).) Once the contractual commitment period lapsed, Investcorp typically redeemed that capital in order to seed additional fund managers. (Trial Tr. at 665, 807-08 (Vamvakas); Trial Tr. at 996 (Erdely).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Between the spring and summer of 2013, Kortright and Investcorp negotiated a seeding relationship and each conducted due diligence on the other. (Trial Tr. at 47-48 (Taylor); Trial Tr. at 645 (Vamvakas).) Investcorp's risk committee approved an investment in Kortright, touting the Kortright team's talent, track record, and reputation. (Trial Tr. at 647-50 (Vamvakas);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   P-9.) The parties' efforts culminated in a Project Agreement executed on June 26, 2013. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   P-11.) In broad strokes, the Project Agreement provided for up to a $50 million investment of Investcorp's clients' capital subject to the funds' liquidity provisions-namely, that Investcorp could redeem its investment if it provided notice of redemption at least 45 days before the end of each quarter. (Trial Tr. at 53, 72-73 (Taylor).) Under the Project Agreement, the investment of client capital was subject to a \"fiduciary reasonable best efforts\" clause, which meant that the capital would be subject to Investcorp acting in what it reasonably believed to be its clients' best interests. (Trial Tr. at 249-52 (Taylor); Trial Tr. at 814-15 (Vamvakas).) Investcorp also agreed to invest $50 million of proprietary capital from its balance sheet subject both to the general liquidity provisions as well as a two-year lockup period. (Trial Tr. at 51-53 (Taylor); Trial Tr. at 1225-26 (Popplewell); Trial Tr. at 664-65 (Vamvakas).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In exchange for Investcorp's seed funding, the Project Agreement afforded Investcorp a bevy of consent, informational, and economic rights. (\n   <em>\n    Accord\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. at 1177, 1179-80 (Klein) (explaining the nature of seeding relationships generally).) For example, Investcorp had the right to consent to any mergers, sales, joint ventures, changes in Kortright's structure, or changes in control. (Trial Tr. at 54 (Taylor);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   P-11, \u00a7 2.1.) The Project Agreement also entitled Investcorp to receive notice of various events and to inspect Kortright's financial statements and valuations. (Trial Tr. at 55-56 (Taylor);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   P-11, \u00a7\u00a7 2.2, 2.3, 2.5.) And in particular, Investcorp had the right to receive a revenue share at different levels of Kortright's growth, based on its assets under management. (Trial Tr. at 56-57 (Taylor);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   P-11, \u00a7 3.2.) Throughout the life of Kortright's relationship with Investcorp, Plaintiffs primarily interfaced with Nick Vamvakas, the head of Investcorp's single manager platform business. (Trial Tr. at 47-48 (Taylor); Trial Tr. at 644-45, 800 (Vamvakas).) In addition, Plaintiffs periodically communicated with Investcorp's research analysts about the specifics of the portfolios. (Trial Tr. at 818 (Vamvakas).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    The Man Opportunity\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Between 2011 and 2015, Kortright's annual profits grew from roughly $1 million to approximately $5 million. (Trial Tr. at 242 (Taylor).) Although the relationship with Investcorp enabled Kortright to raise assets and attract clients, Taylor and Popplewell were dissatisfied with the rate of Kortright's growth. As part of the seed investor arrangement, Investcorp had agreed to serve as a placement agent for the Kortright funds pursuant to a marketing agreement between the parties. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   P-12.) Plaintiffs believed that Investcorp could leverage its \"robust\" marketing team and connections in the hedge fund industry to promote Kortright and raise funds. (Trial Tr. at 69 (Taylor).) However, shortly after Kortright and Investcorp began their relationship, Investcorp's marketing department downsized from five or six people to a single person. (Trial Tr. at 70 (Taylor).) And because this coincided precisely with the period in which Kortright needed to grow, Taylor and Popplewell fell short of their growth goals. (Trial Tr. at 73-74 (Taylor).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In the summer of 2015, Taylor began discussing a potential business opportunity with Man Group plc (\"Man\"), an asset management company based in the United Kingdom. (Trial Tr. at 89-92 (Taylor); Trial Tr. at 424 (Jones).) Although Man sent over proposed terms at that time in contemplation of a potential transaction, these exploratory discussions did not result in any agreement with Man at that time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Despite Plaintiffs' growing frustrations with Investcorp's marketing of the Kortright funds, Taylor still perceived Investcorp to be committed to the partnership, and Kortright had a few prospective clients that it hoped to bring on board. (Trial Tr. at 92-93 (Taylor).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   By the end of 2015, two developments caused Taylor to revisit Kortright's earlier discussions with Man. First, Investcorp made a redemption request for a portion of its proprietary capital for year-end 2015, possibly signaling a shriveling commitment to Kortright. (Trial Tr. at 95-97 (Taylor); Trial Tr. at 822-23 (Vamvakas); Trial Tr. at 1236 (Popplewell);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   P-53.) Second, the prospective clients that Kortright wooed during the summer failed to materialize by the end of the year. (Trial Tr. at 95-96 (Taylor).) These circumstances gave rise to Taylor's concerns that the withdrawal of capital by Investcorp-Kortright's strategic investor-could spook potential clients from investing in Kortright.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Based on lingering doubts over Investcorp's continuing commitment to Kortright, Taylor rekindled discussions with Man in December 2015. Man sent Taylor an indicative proposal that month. This proposal carried the same general structure as the proposal Plaintiffs considered in the summer of 2015 and eventually became the template for the Man transaction. (Trial Tr. at 278-79 (Taylor);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   D-5.) Things came to a head in February 2016. The catalyst was Investcorp's submission of redemption notices for a substantial portion of its proprietary capital for March 31, 2016. (Trial Tr. at 102-04 (Taylor);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   P-71; P-76.) Intensified discussions between Taylor and Man occurred in February and March 2016, eventually crystallizing into two possible structures for the contemplated transaction as reflected in a final indicative proposal on March 30, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. at 108-17 (Taylor);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   P-108.) The first option contemplated a transition of the existing Kortright funds to Man and for Taylor and Popplewell to manage those funds as well as additional funds to be allocated by Man. Taylor and Popplewell understood the second option to provide for the Kortright funds to be wound down and for them to join Man as employees.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. at 116 (Taylor); Trial Tr. at 1235 (Popplewell).) Although Option A-in contrast to Option B-required Investcorp's formal consent as a contractual matter, both Man and Plaintiffs preferred Option A. (Trial Tr. at 114-16 (Taylor); Trial Tr. at 1235-37 (Popplewell).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Investcorp first learned about a contemplated transaction between Kortright and Man in April 2016. (Trial Tr. at 668, 824 (Vamvakas).) At a business lunch on April 4, 2016, Taylor informed Vamvakas of Plaintiffs' concerns over Investcorp's commitment to Kortright and the implications for Kortright's growth and viability. (Trial Tr. at 119-20 (Taylor).) Taylor stated that he and Popplewell were going to join Man and move on, but that Plaintiffs and Investcorp had an opportunity to continue an economic relationship. (Trial Tr. at 671, 824 (Vamvakas).) Taylor outlined Option A\n   and Option B, explaining that Plaintiffs preferred Option A-that is, with Investcorp's participation. (Trial Tr. at 120 (Taylor);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. at 671 (Vamvakas).) In substance, Vamvakas agreed that Option A was preferable and represented that although he could not speak for Investcorp at that lunch, he would \"run it up the flagpole.\" (Trial Tr. at 121-23 (Taylor); Trial Tr. at 669 (Vamvakas).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   That afternoon, Vamvakas relayed his conversation with Taylor to Lionel Erdely, the chief investment officer of the Investcorp division that oversaw its single manager platform. (Trial Tr. at 673, 678 (Vamvakas); Trial Tr. at 881-82, 993, 1015 (Erdely).) At the end of the April 4 lunch, Taylor had asked Vamvakas to relay Erdely's response as soon as he could. (Trial Tr. at 123 (Taylor).) Erdely authorized Vamvakas to continue exploring the proposal with Taylor, but not to make any promise or commitment to him. (Trial Tr. at 826-27 (Vamvakas); Trial Tr. at 947, 1021-22 (Erdely).) On the whole, Taylor felt optimistic about Option A, perceiving Vamvakas to be genuinely pleased about the potential opportunity with Man. (Trial Tr. at 121-24 (Taylor); P-112 (email from Taylor to Man reporting that Option A \"should be very workable\").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Over the next couple days, Vamvakas and Taylor continued to discuss the contours of a proposed transaction with Man as it related to the Kortright-Investcorp relationship. On April 6, 2016, Vamvakas, Taylor, and Popplewell held a follow-up telephone call. (Trial Tr. at 127 (Taylor); Trial Tr. at 676-77, 827 (Vamvakas); Trial Tr. at 1239 (Popplewell).) Vamvakas relayed that others at Investcorp with whom Vamvakas spoke preferred to pursue Option A. (Trial Tr. at 127 (Taylor); Trial Tr. at 1239-40 (Popplewell).) Selecting Option A meant that the parties needed to terminate the Project Agreement, to which Investcorp assented. (Trial Tr. at 134, 304 (Taylor).) The parties also began to flesh out the broad commercial terms for the transaction, including a contemplated revenue share for Investcorp, a schedule for Investcorp to receive a revenue share post-closing, and the concept of a defined prospect list.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Trial Tr. at 128-34 (Taylor); Trial Tr. at 1240 (Popplewell);\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. at 827 (Vamvakas).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   When it comes to the parties' discussion of Investcorp's participation\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   -that is, the core of Plaintiffs' negligent misrepresentation claim-their recollections are reminiscent of Rashomon. According to Taylor, Vamvakas relayed that Investcorp would consent to and participate in the contemplated transaction, that it would redeem its proprietary capital, and that it would leave its clients' capital invested through the transaction's closing. (Trial Tr. at 127-28, 131-32 (Taylor).) Similarly, Popplewell recalls Vamvakas reiterating that Investcorp's proprietary capital could not stay in the fund and would be redeemed, while client capital would remain invested. (Trial Tr. at 1239-42 (Popplewell).) Taylor and\n   Popplewell also remember Taylor informing Vamvakas that Option A was premised on bringing over a commercially viable fund to Man such that the redemption of proprietary capital would functionally require client capital to remain invested, and that such client capital needed to remain invested through closing. (Trial Tr. at 128-29, 132 (Taylor); Trial Tr. at 1242 (Popplewell).) On the other hand, Vamvakas categorically denied that Taylor asked him to commit Investcorp's client capital to the contemplated Man transaction, that Taylor ever told him the transaction required Investcorp's commitment of client capital, that he indicated to Taylor that Investcorp would commit client capital to the transaction, or that he in fact committed Investcorp to leaving its client capital invested. (Trial Tr. at 678-79, 827-31 (Vamvakas).) Instead, Vamvakas testified that he essentially informed Plaintiffs that there was no guarantee of client capital in proceeding with the transaction. (Trial Tr. at 678-79; 827 (Vamvakas).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Though the parties' accounts diverge as to the extent to which Vamvakas represented that Investcorp's client capital would remain invested, this Court finds Taylor's contemporaneous email memorializing the April 6 telephone call to be probative evidence as to what was discussed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   P-113.) In that email, also sent on April 6, Taylor purported to \"summarize [their] conversation as best [he] could\" and solicited Vamvakas' feedback. (P-113.) Among other items, Taylor's email restated the parties' agreement for the \"Kortright funds to move to Man GLG\" and for the \"Project agreement to be terminated/amended.\" (P-113.) With respect to Investcorp's revenue share rights, Taylor wrote \"IVC to retain existing revenue share for balance of term.\" (P-113.) And most relevant to what Vamvakas may have said on the April 6 telephone call with respect to Investcorp's client capital, Taylor recounted that the \"[e]xpectation is that IVC prop capital to be redeemed as soon as practicable and IVC client capital to remain invested.\" (P-113.) On balance, this Court finds that Vamvakas at minimum represented that Investcorp intended to participate in Option A by leaving its client capital invested-implicitly, through the closing of the transaction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Vamvakas responded later that evening with some comments and a proposal to speak more at noon the following day, April 7, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   P-114.) On the April 7 telephone call, Taylor and Vamvakas updated each other on the status of some of the items set forth in Taylor's April 6 email, including the defined prospects list, the possibility of a revenue share for new clients, and the schedule for Investcorp to receive a revenue share post-closing. (Trial Tr. at 138-39 (Taylor);\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. at 1244 (Popplewell).) Vamvakas testified that he did not make any commitment with respect to client capital on the April 7 phone call, which Plaintiffs do not appear to dispute. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. at 834 (Vamvakas).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Taylor sent another email on April 11 further detailing the parties' agreement to the schedule regarding the investment needed for Investcorp to maintain a revenue share, followed by emails between Taylor and Vamvakas the next day updating the defined prospect list. (P-116; P-122; P-123.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   III.\n   <em>\n    The Man Transaction\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In mid-April 2016, the parties engaged Sidley Austin LLP to draft the agreements needed to consummate the Man transaction, with three separate attorneys from the firm representing Plaintiffs, Investcorp, and Man. (Trial Tr. at 137, 147 (Taylor); Trial Tr. at 688, 837 (Vamvakas);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. at 463-66 (Munsell).) The parties held a kick-off call with Sidley Austin on April 12, 2016. Vamvakas testified that he did not represent that Investcorp would commit its client capital on that call. (Trial Tr. at 838 (Vamvakas).) Following the kick-off call, Taylor circulated a revised list of summary terms reflecting additional specificity as to the revenue share schedule, changes to the defined prospect list, and the removal of the bullet point relating to the expectation that Investcorp client capital remain invested. (Trial Tr. at 148-51, 324-25 (Taylor); Trial Tr. at 466-67 (Munsell); Trial Tr. at 689-90 (Vamvakas);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   P-126.) Taylor explained that this bullet point had essentially been folded into the concept of an aggregate minimum balance at closing. (Trial Tr. at 324-25 (Taylor).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Based on these terms, the Sidley Austin attorneys drafted several agreements governing the relationships among Plaintiffs, Investcorp, and Man, which the parties executed on June 16, 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Trial Tr. at 476-77 (Munsell).) Specifically, (1) Plaintiffs and Investcorp entered into an agreement that terminated the Project Agreement and accordingly, many of Investcorp's special rights as a seed investor (P-187); and (2) Taylor, Popplewell, Investcorp, and Man entered into a revenue sharing agreement that governed Investcorp's revenue share rights in the Kortright funds post-closing as long as Investcorp maintained a minimum threshold of client capital invested (P-186;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. at 695-96 (Vamvakas)). Kortright, Taylor, and Man also executed the Man transaction agreement, which required that Kortright obtain the consent of its investors as a condition precedent to closing. (P-184; Trial Tr. at 175-76 (Taylor).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   To satisfy the transaction agreement's condition precedent and in accord with \u00a7 5.2 of the transaction agreement, Plaintiffs prepared an investor consent letter informing their investors of the Man transaction, sharing that Investcorp \"plans to continue its partnership\" with Plaintiffs, and soliciting investor consent to the transaction via the transfer of capital. (P-190; Trial Tr. at 176-77 (Taylor).) The consent letter-dated June 17, 2016-required Kortright's investors to affirmatively consent to the Man transaction by June 24, 2016 or be compulsorily redeemed from the Kortright fund on June 30, 2016. (Trial Tr. at 180 (Taylor); Trial Tr. at 527 (Munsell); Trial Tr. at 733 (Vamvakas).) With respect to its client capital, Investcorp returned ballots affirmatively consenting to the Man transaction on June 22 and June 23, 2016. (Trial Tr. at 730-33 (Vamvakas); P-197; P-204.) While hoping to bring a $50 million fund to Man, by June 24, 2016, Plaintiffs had received consent from investors with a total of $44 million invested in Kortright, including approximately $40\n   million from Investcorp's clients. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   P-209; Trial Tr. at 132, 412 (Taylor).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   IV.\n   <em>\n    The Implosion of the Man Transaction\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Investcorp's consent to the Man transaction with respect to its client capital can be characterized as ephemeral. The morning of Friday, June 24, 2016, Vamvakas sent Taylor an email, stating \"Matt, we have a serious problem. We need to speak ASAP.\" (P-210.) Vamvakas and Taylor spoke sometime that day. During their conversation, Vamvakas informed Taylor that Investcorp realized it needed to obtain its own clients' consent to the Man transaction, which it did not have and would be unable to obtain. (Trial Tr. at 187-88 (Taylor);\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. at 849 (Vamvakas).) Taylor-who was upset, to say the least-responded that Investcorp needed to fix the problem, either by substituting its own proprietary capital or by obtaining its clients' consent. (Trial Tr. at 188 (Taylor); Trial Tr. at 850 (Vamvakas);\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   P-212.) In response to Taylor's repeated inquiries, Vamvakas updated him by email throughout the day on the status of purported efforts to obtain consent from Investcorp's clients. (Trial Tr. at 189-90 (Taylor); P-212; P-219.) Vamvakas also updated Erdely on the status of his communications with Taylor. (Trial Tr. at 986 (Erdely).) Friday came and went without any change in Investcorp's client consent-by late Friday afternoon, Taylor suggested that Vamvakas \"give some thought to quantifying damages\" if he could not resolve the problem. (P-219.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Over the weekend, Taylor continued to press Vamvakas about his efforts to resolve the client consent issue. (Trial Tr. at 190 (Taylor).) At the same time, Taylor kept Popplewell and Man apprised of the unfolding situation. (Trial Tr. at 190-91 (Taylor);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   P-227.) That following Monday-June 27, 2016-Vamvakas emailed Taylor to let him know that Investcorp would not \"be in a position to consent to the Man Transaction\" and \"[a]s a result, Investcorp's clients will be mandatorily redeemed from the Fund as of June 30, 2016.\" (P-219.) Thereafter, Taylor informed Man that Investcorp would not be consenting to the Man transaction. (Trial Tr. at 1129-30, 1139, 1146-47 (Jones).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In the ensuing days leading up to June 30, 2016-the contemplated closing date-Plaintiffs and Man searched for a way to salvage the Man transaction without Investcorp's participation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Trial Tr. at 194, 196 (Taylor);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   P-222; P-223; P-225.) At Taylor's request, Vamvakas spoke with Mark Jones of Man on June 29, 2016. (Trial Tr. at 771-72, 853-54 (Vamvakas); Trial Tr. at 1148-49 (Jones); P-230.) In substance, Vamvakas relayed the same reason for withdrawing Investcorp's consent with respect to its client capital-that is, that Investcorp's underlying clients did not consent to the Man transaction and the transfer of their capital because they no longer wanted the risk of the Kortright strategy. (Trial Tr. at 772-83 (Vamvakas); Trial Tr. at 1146-48 (Jones).) Jones and Vamvakas asked each other whether Investcorp or Man could inject other sources of capital into the fund, but neither could. (Trial Tr. at 772, 854 (Vamvakas).) Ultimately, Plaintiffs and Man concluded that the Man transaction could not be consummated without Investcorp's participation. The final nail in the coffin came on June\n   30, 2016, when Vamvakas confirmed by email that there was \"no change in consent.\" (P-234.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   But the truth was that contrary to what Vamvakas told Taylor, Investcorp never actually needed the consent of its own clients to participate in the Man transaction. (Trial Tr. at 747 (Vamvakas);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. at 973-76 (Erdely) (testifying that Investcorp did not need client approval of redemptions based on its discretionary authority over investment decisions).) As Vamvakas testified, the need for client consent was a lie he concocted to soften the blow to Plaintiffs as to why Investcorp needed to withdraw client capital, notwithstanding Erdely's admonitions to tell the truth.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. at 747-81, 849-50 (Vamvakas);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. at 980-82 (Erdely).) In fact, the decision to withdraw from participation in the Man transaction stemmed at least in part from a meeting Vamvakas had on the afternoon of June 22, 2016 with two members of Investcorp's investment team-Erdely and Greg Berman, the primary Investcorp analyst covering Kortright. After receiving Kortright's investor consent letter, Erdely instructed Berman to prepare an analysis on whether to consent or redeem for that meeting.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Trial Tr. at 955-57, 1040-41 (Erdely);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   P-198; P-199; P-200.) At the meeting, Berman expressed his concerns to Vamvakas and Erdely about Plaintiffs' ability to manage money and Kortright's deteriorating performance. (Trial Tr. at 735-44, 847-48 (Vamvakas); Trial Tr. at 1045-46 (Erdely).) By the end of the meeting, Erdely had decided to redeem Investcorp's client capital on Berman's recommendation,\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   although he did not inform Vamvakas of his final decision until the next day. (Trial Tr. at 848 (Vamvakas); Trial Tr. at 970-71, 1046 (Erdely);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   P-201 (email from Berman after the June 22 meeting reflecting the recommendation to redeem \"Kortright now\").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Despite Vamvakas' initial surprise at the June 22 meeting about the sudden prospect of redeeming Investcorp's client capital, the writing was on the wall from the investment team's perspective. While Investcorp had an investment committee-chaired by Erdely-that made final investment decisions with respect to single managers, approval by the investment committee had not been-and never would be-sought with respect to the transfer of client capital.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Trial Tr. at 884, 1000-01\n   (Erdely),\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. at 738 (Vamvakas).) Along similar lines, Erdely never spoke with Vamvakas, Taylor, or Popplewell about the transfer of client capital to Man, despite his roles as the chair of the investment committee and as chief investment officer. (Trial Tr. at 939-40 (Erdely).) And one day before the June 22 meeting, members of Investcorp's investment team contemplated a potential redemption of its client capital, either in June 2016 or September 2016. (P-196.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   V.\n   <em>\n    The Aftermath\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Several consequences radiated from the Man transaction's failure to close. Plaintiffs liquidated the Kortright portfolio to satisfy the redemption of Investcorp's client capital, which constituted approximately 90% of the fund. (Trial Tr. at 196-98 (Taylor).) Plaintiffs and Investcorp entered into an amended agreement terminating the Project Agreement to provide Plaintiffs additional time to satisfy the redemption in an orderly manner. (Trial Tr. at 197-201 (Taylor); Trial Tr. at 492-94 (Munsell); Trial Tr. at 768, 855-56 (Vamvakas);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   P-233.) The cratering of the Man transaction also impacted Taylor and Popplewell personally. Since the failure of the Man transaction to close, Taylor has not been employed in the investment management business despite his efforts to obtain employment. (Trial Tr. at 236-39 (Taylor).) Likewise, Popplewell has been unable to find employment in the investment management industry.

In\n   <em>\n    Schonfeld\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff asserted various contract and tort claims, alleging in substance that defendants induced him to abandon a certain March Supply Agreement and enter into an Interim Agreement and December Supply Agreement by falsely representing their intention to fund the Interim Agreement.\n   <em>\n    Schonfeld\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11192813\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/218/164/\">\n    218 F.3d at 171-72\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

As relevant here, the Second Circuit concluded that plaintiff could recover damages based on the loss of the March and December Supply Agreements as lost income-producing assets.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Schonfeld\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11192813\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/218/164/\">\n    218 F.3d at 175\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   But even assuming that the Man transaction agreement constitutes an income-producing asset with a determinable market value, this Court disagrees that it is an\n   <em>\n    existing\n   </em>\n   asset that Plaintiffs abandoned in reliance on Investcorp's representations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rather, it is precisely what Plaintiffs sought to obtain in reliance on those representations. That the\n   <em>\n    Schonfeld\n   </em>\n   panel allowed plaintiff to recover the value of the December Supply Agreement-that is, the agreement that the\n   <em>\n    Schonfeld\n   </em>\n   plaintiff was induced to enter-is of no moment. Critically, the Second Circuit noted that the plaintiff there sought to recover the market value of the December Supply Agreement \"in connection with his breach of contract, promissory estoppel, breach of fiduciary duty and corporate waste and mismanagement claims.\"\n   <em>\n    Schonfeld\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11192813\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/218/164/\">\n    218 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   177 n.2. For his analogous\n   <em>\n    fraud\n   </em>\n   claim, however, the plaintiff sought only to recover the market value of the March Supply Agreement-in other words, the\n   <em>\n    existing\n   </em>\n   agreement that he abandoned in reliance on the defendants' representations.\n   <em>\n    Schonfeld\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11192813\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/218/164/\">\n    218 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   177 n.2 ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Schonfeld\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11192813\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/218/164/\">\n    218 F.3d at 183\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that because the out-of-pocket rule \"permits recovery for a plaintiff's reliance interest, including damages incurred by passing up other business opportunities,\" plaintiff \"may seek to recover the market value of the March Supply Agreement ... abandoned in reliance on [defendants'] promises\" (citations and quotation marks omitted)).

While Kortright points to a bankruptcy court decision that calculated damages based on the value of the combined entity that\n   <em>\n    would have\n   </em>\n   resulted from a merger, the cases that the bankruptcy court relied on for that proposition arise in the tortious interference context.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Coin Phones, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298572\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/203/184/#p215\">\n    203 B.R. 184\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 215 (Bankr.

Plaintiffs offered testimony from Klein on seed investor customs and practices in the hedge fund industry and the investment performance of Kortright leading up to and after June 2016. In particular, Klein opined that Kortright's performance between February 2016 and May 2016 was not abnormal, that Investcorp's redemption of capital adversely impacted Kortright's performance in June 2016, and that Investcorp's non-consent to the Man transaction sent a negative signal to Man and Kortright's investors. Savoldelli testified to the fiduciary duties owed by asset managers to their clients and the usage of mandatory redemption clauses and special redemption windows. Savoldelli also responded to a few aspects of Klein's testimony, opining that Kortright's performance between April and June 2016 was highly anomalous, that any liquidation in June 2016 did not meaningfully affect Kortright's June 2016 performance, and that any negative signal to Man or Kortright's competitors sent by Investcorp's redemption of client capital was overshadowed by Kortright's own track record leading up to June 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   In contrast to the wholesale exclusion of the irrelevant testimony of Dr. Gompers (and by extension, Dr. Hubbard), Klein and Savoldelli's testimony calls for a more nuanced approach.

Supp. 3d at 357\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Certainly, Investcorp's representations that it intended to participate in the Man transaction by leaving its client capital-as opposed to proprietary capital-invested relate to future conduct.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    US W.

Supp. 333\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 344 (S.D.N.Y. 1992). Thus, the dispositive question here is whether Investcorp harbored a preconceived and undisclosed intention not to leave its client capital invested in Kortright\n   <em>\n    as of April 2016\n   </em>\n   , when Vamvakas relayed Investcorp's preference for Option A and willingness to participate using client capital.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   On this question, Plaintiffs have not put forth sufficient evidence to prove that the answer is yes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Specifically, Investcorp-in accord with the parties' understanding in April 2016-made a redemption request for its remaining proprietary capital in mid-May 2016 to be redeemed at the end of June but left its client capital invested. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. at 162 (Taylor); Trial Tr. at 859 (Vamvakas);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. at 936-42, 1027 (Erdely).) This account is corroborated by the minutes from a regular investment committee meeting that took place on April 22, 2016, which reflect a decision with respect to Kortright to \"[r]edeem from the manager on behalf of IVC balance sheet (but retain in client portfolios and Emerging Alpha).\" (D-40; Trial Tr. at 1024-26 (Erdely).) Moreover, the Sidley Austin attorney representing Kortright testified that he had no recollection of any indication from Investcorp's deal counsel that the redemption of Investcorp's client capital was a possibility. (Trial Tr. at 474-75, 478 (Munsell).) Taken together, this evidence suggests that as of April 2016, Investcorp intended to participate in the Man transaction\n   using its client capital, particularly when juxtaposed with the absence of evidence to the contrary. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Trial Tr. at 719 (Vamvakas) (testifying that he was unaware of any hesitation or concern within Investcorp about transferring client capital even as of June 16, 2016).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Such a conclusion is also supported by evidence of Investcorp's conduct generally between April 2016 and June 2016. Following the early April 2016 discussions at issue in this case, both Kortright and Investcorp behaved consistently with an intention to proceed with the Man transaction by taking action in furtherance of the transaction. For example, between April and June 2016, Investcorp assisted in marketing the Kortright funds to its clients in connection with the Man transaction. (Trial Tr. at 149, 153, 157 (Taylor); Trial Tr. at 907-16 (Erdely).) Indeed, Taylor testified that Investcorp's negligent misrepresentation \"begins with the representations made in early April, and extends all the way through all of their conduct that confirmed those very same April representations, all the way until the very end of June, when all of a sudden it was different.\" (Trial Tr. at 340 (Taylor).) In other words, Taylor's testimony that Investcorp acted consistently with its April 2016 representations until June 2016 undermines the suggestion that Investcorp never intended to leave its client capital invested.\n   <em>\n    Accord\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Elliot v. Nelson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9293394\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/301/284/#p288\">\n    301 F. Supp. 2d 284\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 288 (S.D.N.Y. 2004) (finding that evidence demonstrating that defendants had taken steps-albeit unfruitful ones-toward raising money for a venture capital fund undermined the falsity of purported representations that defendants intended to raise the money).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   To be sure, Investcorp had concerns with Kortright's performance in April 2016. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. at 698 (Vamvakas); Trial Tr. at 896-97 (Erdely).) These concerns began in July or August of 2015-indeed, Erdely had met with Plaintiffs on at least one occasion to discuss redemptions of capital based on performance-related concerns. (Trial Tr. at 820-21 (Vamvakas);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. at 892-93, 1011-12 (Erdely).) However, from Investcorp's perspective, Kortright's performance deteriorated well into 2016. Compared to its peers, for example, Kortright's performance gradually degraded in Investcorp's eyes from ranking in the top quartile in December 2015 to the bottom quartile by April 2016. (Trial Tr. at 899-904 (Erdely).) And as a quantitative matter, the Kortright funds sustained steady losses between January and May 2016, with much of the loss occurring by April 2016. (Trial Tr. at 904-06 (Erdely).) Moreover, in February 2016, Investcorp considered downgrading Kortright in its internal ranking system that tracked the capacity of managers to deliver future performance. (Trial Tr. at 885-89, 893-95 (Erdely); P-78.) Although Investcorp ultimately did not downgrade Kortright, its concern over Kortright's ability to deliver future performance grew, resulting in a downgrade from a \"B\" during the January to April 2016 timeframe to a \"C\" in May 2016. (Trial Tr. at 885-89, 1023, 1032-33 (Erdely); P-162.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Concluding that Investcorp held a preconceived and undisclosed intention in April 2016 not to leave its client capital invested based on its internal doubts regarding Kortright's future performance is a leap too far, especially viewed in the context of Investcorp's conduct in furtherance of the Man transaction in April 2016 and the ensuing months. In particular, the evidence that Investcorp only\n   <em>\n    considered\n   </em>\n   downgrading Kortright in February 2016 and did not do so until May 2016 is insufficient to demonstrate that Investcorp intended in April 2016 to redeem its client capital. Rather, the weight of the evidence reflects that despite Investcorp's concerns\n   with Kortright's deteriorating performance, it simply did not intend to redeem its client capital until June 2016, when it believed continued investment to be untenable. (\n   <em>\n    Accord\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. at 943, 970-72, 1043-44 (Erdely).) In other words, this Court finds it implausible that Investcorp \"had lured [Plaintiffs] into the elaborate and expensive ruse of pretending\" to proceed with a transaction in which it had no intent to participate, \"for no apparent purpose.\"\n   <em>\n    Elliot\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9293394\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/301/284/#p288\">\n    301 F.

The reasonableness of a plaintiff's reliance involves a consideration of \"the entire context of the transaction, including factors such as its complexity and magnitude, the sophistication of the parties, and the content of any agreements between them.\"\n   <em>\n    Emergent Capital Inv.

(Trial Tr. at 248-49, 316-17 (Taylor); Trial Tr. at 1266-68 (Popplewell).) Specifically, Taylor knew from his negotiation of the Project Agreement that the investment of client capital was subject to a \"fiduciary reasonable best efforts\" standard. (Trial Tr. at 249-52, 316 (Taylor).) Moreover, at the time Vamvakas made the April 2016 representations, he was unaware of the terms or closing date of the contemplated transaction that would eventually become the Man transaction because those specifics had not yet been finalized. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. at 311-14 (Taylor); Trial Tr. at 830 (Vamvakas); Trial Tr. at 1281-82 (Popplewell);\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. at 948, 1017-18 (Erdely).) Given Taylor and Popplewell's experience in the investment management industry, interpreting Vamvakas' April 2016 statements as a guarantee that it would indefinitely invest in an undefined transaction was unreasonable. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. at 1359-60, 1368-70 (Savoldelli); Trial Tr. at 1204-05 (Klein).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   IV.\n   <em>\n    Attorney's Fees\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The final issue that remains to be decided is the amount of attorney's fees to which Plaintiffs are entitled for Investcorp's discovery misconduct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kortright Capital Partners\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=330%20F.R.D.%20134\">\n    330 F.R.D. at 140\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

What the trial evidence shows is that despite representing its intent to participate in the Man transaction in April 2016, Investcorp changed its mind at the last moment. Of course, the evidence also demonstrates that Investcorp was not forthright with Plaintiffs about the reason for its change of heart, and that Investcorp's internal decision-making was haphazard. Moreover, Investcorp's subsequent actions to cover up the lie-at worst-arguably bespeak some knowledge that it did not do right by Plaintiffs. But whether Investcorp's post-April 2016 conduct renders it liable to Plaintiffs was not at issue in this trial. Rather, the dispositive question undergirding Plaintiffs' remaining cause of action is whether Investcorp misrepresented its desire and intent to participate in the Man transaction at the time it made those statements in April 2016. Considering the evidence as a whole, this Court concludes that the answer to that question is no. As the New York Court of Appeals explained almost a century ago,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-107\">\n   [a]lthough a false representation as to a state of mind[ ] may be a false representation of a material fact, it does not follow that every broken promise acted upon is actionable.... Disappointed hopes are not the basis of legal liability. If they were, no one, without making himself liable for damages, could innocently and in good faith say that he would advance money in aid of an embarrassed enterprise and then change his mind when it developed that the situation was not as rose colored as good[-]natured optimism had pictured it when the promise was made.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   <em>\n    Adams v.

If Vamvakas had been upfront about the need for such approval, Plaintiffs argue they would have opted for Option B. However, the omission of such information does not make Vamvakas' representations as to Investcorp's intent or willingness to proceed with the Man transaction-as opposed to its ability, for example-false or incorrect.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"17\">\n   <p id=\"p-129\">\n    On summary judgment, this Court rejected Investcorp's argument that the existence of a fully integrated agreement bars reliance on any representation not contained therein.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Kortright Capital Partners LP\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%206329396\">\n     2018 WL 6329396\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *2-3.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"18\">\n   <p id=\"p-130\">\n    While Investcorp does not explicitly oppose the reasonableness of the hourly rates charged by Plaintiffs' counsel, it certainly makes that suggestion by citing to cases in which judges in this district have approved hourly rates in the ballpark of $600 for large law firm partners.
