Insurance Coverage\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff lived with his parents in West Chester, Pennsylvania, at all relevant times. (Compl. \u00b6 2.) Plaintiff himself was covered by two insurance policies issued by State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company-a motorcycle policy and a personal automobile policy. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 7, 9.) The motorcycle policy provided $ 15,000/$ 30,000 in UIM coverage for one motorcycle. (Compl. \u00b6 7.) The automobile policy provided $ 15,000/$ 30,000 in UIM coverage for one motor vehicle. (Compl. \u00b6 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Smith's parents had an automobile insurance policy with Nationwide that provided for $ 50,000/$ 100,000 in stacked UIM coverage for two motor vehicles. (Compl. \u00b6 11.) Smith's parents had \"selected and paid for stacked underinsured motorist coverage under the Nationwide Policy,\" which would include \"both intra-policy stacking and inter-policy stacking.\" (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 33, 35.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    b.

(Compl. \u00b6 12.) Smith was thrown from the motorcycle and \"sustained serious and permanent injuries in the collision\" \"caused by the negligence and carelessness\" of the tortfeasor. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 15, 16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Smith made a claim upon the tortfeasor's insurance policy with Allstate Insurance Co. which provided $ 25,000/$ 50,000 in liability coverage. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 17-18.) Smith received the $ 25,000 liability limit under the tortfeasor's Allstate policy. (Compl. \u00b6 20.) Plaintiff alleges that this coverage was \"insufficient to compensate [him] for the serious injuries and damages sustained in the accident,\" and that thus the tortfeasor is an \"underinsured motorist\" as defined by the MVFRL. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 21-22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Smith also filed a claim with State Farm for recovery of UIM benefits under his State Farm motorcycle policy. (Compl. \u00b6 23.) Plaintiff received the $ 15,000 limit of UIM coverage under the motorcycle policy. (Compl. \u00b6 24.) Plaintiff asserts that the limits of tortfeasor's insurance liability coverage and his motorcycle policy's UIM coverage were \"insufficient to compensate [him] for the serious and permanent injuries sustained in the June 26, 2018 motor vehicle accident.\" (Compl. \u00b6 25.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiff then made a claim for UIM benefits under his parent's Nationwide policy. (Compl. \u00b6 26.) Nationwide denied the claim based upon the \"household vehicle exclusion\" in the policy. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 27-29.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   That exclusion states that there is no coverage for:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   6. Bodily injury suffered while occupying a vehicle owned by you or a relative but not insured for Underinsured Motorists coverage under this policy; nor to bodily injury from being hit by any such motor vehicle.

Thus, Plaintiff asserts that \"[t]he household exclusion is violative of the MVFRL in that it abrogates the inter-policy stacking of the underinsured motorist coverage in the household for which a specific, additional premium was charged and accepted.\" (Compl. \u00b6 30.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Memo. at 7.) Defendant contends that the\n   <em>\n    Gallagher\n   </em>\n   Court limited its holdings to those facts, and asserts that \"the instant case is two factual steps removed from\n   <em>\n    Gallagher\n   </em>\n   : (1) the motorcycle was insured by State Farm (Policy A), and not Nationwide; and (2) the Smith Parents, not Plaintiff, purchased Policy B from Nationwide.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.) Defendant alternatively argues that \"[e]ven if\n   <em>\n    Gallagher\n   </em>\n   could be read to render the household exclusion void regardless of the circumstances, it would be inequitable to apply that holding here, as that would require Nationwide to pay for a risk it never agreed to insure, and Plaintiff never paid for,\" particularly where the policy was underwritten before\n   <em>\n    Gallagher\n   </em>\n   was decided. (Mot. at 12.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Plaintiff responds in two ways. He first argues that did not matter that Defendant did not know of the other policy here, that \"the fact that Nationwide did not insure the motorcycle is of no relevance-no more significant than the fact that the injured victim may have been operating a car rather than a motorcycle.\" (Resp. Memo. at 22.) Plaintiff also responds that in\n   <em>\n    Gallagher\n   </em>\n   , the motorcycle policy was issued by GEICO Indemnity Company and the personal auto policy was issued by GEICO General Insurance Policy, who he contends are \"separate and distinct.\" (Surreply at 1-2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Plaintiff focuses on the \"methodology\" employed by the\n   <em>\n    Gallagher\n   </em>\n   court, arguing that it represents a change in the way Pennsylvania courts review the underlying policy goal of the MVFRL. (Resp. at 10-12.) Plaintiff asserts that \"[c]ost control is no longer used to justify unfair and inequitable policy exclusions\" because the cost control goal has \"now been jettisoned for the equally important goal of remediation.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Defendant responds that the policy goal underlying the MVFRL has not changed, and cites to a number of opinions in pre-\n   <em>\n    Gallagher\n   </em>\n   cases that it asserts were not overruled by\n   <em>\n    Gallagher\n   </em>\n   , each of which noted the cost containment goals of the MVFRL.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Eichelman v.

The central issue before Judge Kearney in\n   <em>\n    Butta\n   </em>\n   was whether\n   <em>\n    Gallagher\n   </em>\n   announced a new rule and applied retroactively to the plaintiff's claim.

As a result,\n   <em>\n    Gallagher\n   </em>\n   applies to the MVFRL since its inception and applies to Mr. Butta's policy.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12531743\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/383/426/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12531743\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/383/426/\">\n    at 436-37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Judge Kearney noted that \"even assuming\n   <em>\n    Gallagher\n   </em>\n   established a new rule, we would not be able to properly exercise our judicial discretion to determine whether\n   <em>\n    Gallagher\n   </em>\n   should apply retroactively without discovery.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12531743\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/383/426/\">\n    Id. at 441-42\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Based upon\n   <em>\n    Gallagher\n   </em>\n   , and in light of our review of the facts in the light most favorable to the Plaintiff, the Court concludes that Plaintiff has sufficiently stated a claim for declaratory relief and breach of contract. Plaintiff's parents paid an additional premium for stacked UIM coverage for themselves and their relatives. As Plaintiff properly observed, the household vehicle exclusion \"takes away inter-policy stacking, with no notice to the insured, no signed Rejection, and no return of the premium.\" (Resp. at 21.) In other words, the household vehicle exclusion in the Nationwide policy at issue acts as a \"\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   waiver of stacked UIM coverage,\" even though Plaintiff's parents did not sign a waiver and paid an additional premium for the coverage.

Accordingly, the Court is unprepared to determine, at a motion to dismiss stage, that the household vehicle exception in the insurance policy at issue does not act as a\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   waiver of stacked UIM coverage. The parties may raise this issue again in summary judgment motions, should they chose to do so, with the benefit of discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
