BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   This lawsuit revolves around injuries Plaintiffs allegedly suffered after surgically receiving Mentor's MemoryGel Silicone Breast Implants (\"MemoryGel Implants\"). Plaintiffs plead the following in their First Amended Complaint (\"FAC,\" Dkt. No. 1, Ex. A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Parties\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Vieira is a citizen and resident of Solano County, California. FAC \u00b6 1.

NuSil Technology is a limited liability company incorporated in Delaware with its principal place of business in Carpinteria, California.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7. NuSil LLC and NuSil Technology are silicone raw material suppliers and allegedly manufactured, produced, supplied, and shipped the silicone used in the MemoryGel Implants.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    B. FDA Regulation of Silicone Breast Implants\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In 1976, Congress passed the Medical Device Amendments (\"MDA\") to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (\"FDCA\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36. Under the MDA, medical devices, such as the MemoryGel Implants, are subject to three classifications and regulated accordingly.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37. Class I devices require the least and most general oversight, Class II devices are reviewed according to more stringent \"special controls,\" and Class III devices receive the most oversight and require rigorous premarket review and approval.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") classified silicone breast implants as Class III devices.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38. Accordingly, the FDA requires manufacturers to meet certain requirements for Class III devices.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On April 10, 1991, the FDA published a final regulation under Section 515(b) of the FDCA requiring that manufacturers of silicone breast implants submit pre-market approval (\"PMA\") applications with data showing a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness of the implants by July 9, 1991.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Mentor's FDA Approval\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In order to eventually seek PMA for its MemoryGel Implants, Mentor was required to first provide the FDA with sufficient information regarding the safety and efficacy of the medical device.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 46. On December 12, 2003, Mentor submitted a request to the FDA for PMA for its MemoryGel Implants. On November 17, 2006, Mentor received approval subject to certain conditions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 62-63. One of the conditions imposed on Mentor required it to conduct six post-approval studies\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   to further characterize the safety and effectiveness of MemoryGel Implants.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 63.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Plaintiffs' MemoryGel Procedures\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Vieira was implanted with MemoryGel Implants on April 16, 2007.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19. Vieira alleges that following implantation she developed Hashimoto's disease, experienced fatigue, memory loss, hair loss, light sensitivity, skin rashes, vision issues, numbness, dizziness, nausea, chronic sore throats, chest pain, migraines, joint pain, stiffness and swelling, muscle pain and weakness.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 20-21. Vieira was unaware as to what triggered her symptoms.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21. Vieira's injuries caused her to be bedridden; she subsequently moved to her parent's household in Vacaville, California for home care.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22. On June 27, 2016, Vieira underwent a bilateral explantation of her implants in Los Angeles, California.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23. A gel bleed was discovered in the right implant during the procedure.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Within six months of explantation, Vieira saw relief of approximately 80% of her symptoms and is now in remission from her Hashimoto's disease.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Barozzi received MemoryGel Implants on April 12, 2012.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26. Barozzi alleges\n   that following implantation, she developed a rash on her chest and abdomen along with dry eyes and mouth, experienced recurrent sore throats, ear infections, and bladder infections.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28. Barozzi's pain increased over time.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Barozzi also developed rheumatoid arthritis, experienced fatigue, joint pain and stiffness, muscle weakness, memory loss, shortness of breath, cognitive dysfunction, chest pains, itching, nausea, dizziness, numbness, vision issues, light sensitivity, night sweats, metallic taste, poor wound healing, and hair loss.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27. Barozzi was unaware as to what caused her injuries.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28. On August 2, 2016, Barozzi underwent a bilateral explantation of her implants.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29. A gel bleed was discovered during the procedure.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29. After explantation, various defects were found in Barozzi's implants.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    E. This Action\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiffs filed a FAC in the Los Angeles County Superior Court asserting causes of action for: (1) negligence/negligence per se; (2) failure to warn; and (3) manufacturing defect. Defendants filed a notice of removal in this Court and then filed a motion to dismiss Plaintiffs' FAC pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim.

Mr. Mraz's deposition seriously undermines Plaintiff's argument that NuSil LLC is a properly named defendant and belongs in the case.

Mentor argues that NuSil LLC was not involved with the production of the silicone used in its MemoryGel implants. Specifically, Mentor argues NuSil LLC is a holding company with no operations, and thus could not have participated in the manufacture of Mentor's allegedly defective implants. In support of this argument, Mentor submitted to the Court the Deposition of Scott Mraz (\"Mraz Dep.\", Dkt. No. 1 Ex. M), an individual member of NuSil LLC since August 1, 2005. Mr. Mraz testified that NuSil LLC (1) is a holding company that transacts no business of its own and whose sole purpose is to hold stock for its members; (2) has not developed, designed, manufactured, supplied, or distributed any products, including the silicone or silicone gel used to manufacture breast implants ; and (3) has no ownership interest in or control over the plant, equipment, and supplies that are\n   used to manufacture the silicone raw materials used in breast implants.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mraz Dep. at 18:7-21, 40:8-12, 40:2-7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Vieira produces evidence contrary to Mr. Mraz's position and suggests there is a triable issue.

These allegations are merely conclusory. Plaintiffs' Complaint lacks any reference to the specific adverse events that Mentor failed to report. Further, Plaintiffs do not specifically allege that poor performance on post-approval studies is a violation of federal law. Additionally, the Court rejects Plaintiffs' claims that Mentor violated federal regulations and state law by defectively manufacturing MemoryGel Implants.

Plaintiffs do not point to any facts supporting her assertion. Plaintiffs have not explained how any purported failure to report the unspecified adverse events caused her injuries. In turn, Plaintiffs allegations are based not on a failure to report actual adverse events from the post-approval studies but rather on a purported failure to properly conduct those studies. \"The alleged technical defects in Mentor's post-approval studies, however, do not constitute adverse events.\"\n   <em>\n    Ebrahimi v.

Cal. May 25, 2018). Plaintiffs cannot pursue a claim premised on a counterfactual assumption that Mentor would have identified additional adverse events if it had conducted the studies more adequately. Any such claim is impermissibly speculative. Additionally, any claim premised on Mentor's alleged failure to conduct the post-approval studies adequately is impliedly preempted, because there is no state law duty to conduct post-approval studies in the first instance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Furthermore, Plaintiffs' failure to report a claim fails because they do not allege facts showing that the FDA would have exercised its discretion to include additional adverse events in its publicly-accessible adverse-event database had Mentor reported the events. Nor do Plaintiffs allege facts showing that their treating physicians even relied on information in the adverse event database making decisions. Without such facts, Plaintiffs cannot\n   establish a causal nexus between their alleged injuries and Mentor's alleged failure to report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Plaintiffs deduce that if Mentor had conducted follow-up with participants enrolled in clinical studies that there would have been adverse event reports showing heightened instances of rupture rates. No facts support the conclusion that additional information from patients in post-approval studies would reveal additional adverse events regarding ruptures or would result in the FDA requiring different labeling. Nor has Plaintiff Vieira alleged any facts explaining how Mentor's purported failure to report adverse events from its post-approval studies somehow caused her injuries. Plaintiff Vieira's failure to report claim, thus, fails for lack of proximate causation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <strong>\n    5. Plaintiffs' Manufacturing Defect Claims Are Preempted\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   For manufacturing defects claims to survive preemption, plaintiffs are required to allege \"that the manufacturing of the device both fell short of the FDA's requirement for manufacturing and-based on the same deficiency-was defectively manufactured under California law.\"\n   <em>\n    Funke v.
