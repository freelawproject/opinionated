On January 22, 2019, the court held a hearing on the motion at which all parties were represented by counsel.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Gone are the days in which someone lugs around a Walkman, a CD player, or a portable DVD player in order to listen to music. Today, users can enjoy high-quality music and other audio on small electronic devices, like phones and computers. Part of what makes this possible is MP3 technology, which allows audio files to be compressed and stored using less space, so that a user can store thousands of songs on a small device, rather than needing hundreds of CDs or DVDs. The process of creating MP2 or MP3 audio requires encoding an audio signal into the MP2 or MP3 format. The process of turning MP2 or MP3 audio into playable audio requires decoding the MP2- or MP3-formatted audio back into playable audio.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff Dell Technologies Inc. (\"Dell Technologies\") is a Texas-based electronics seller. Dell Technologies is the parent company to hundreds of Dell subsidiaries around the globe.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In 2001, Defendant Sonic Solutions, the predecessor to Defendant TiVo Corporation, provided Dell with audio MP3 software, marketed as Roxio Creator, which Dell installed and sold on its computers. Defendant Rovi later acquired TiVo through a complex corporate merger, and Dell alleges that TiVo is a successor in interest to the liabilities of Sonic Solutions. Non-party Dell Products, L.P., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Dell Technologies, and Sonic Solutions LLC (\"Sonic\") entered into a software-licensing agreement effective August 30, 2001 (\"Licensing Agreement\" or \"Agreement\"). Pursuant to a 2010 clarification agreement (\"Clarification Agreement\"), Plaintiff Dell Global B.V. now holds all rights and obligations previously held by Dell Products, L.P. under the Licensing Agreement. The Clarification Agreement states that Dell Global holds the rights and obligations under the Licensing Agreement \"on behalf of itself and each of its worldwide affiliates.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   As part of the Licensing Agreement, Sonic represented that \"the Licensed Product(s) will operate substantially in accordance with its written specifications.\" The written specifications for Roxio software require that the Roxio software enable MP3 decoding capability by using Microsoft preloaded MP3 codec and not install any third-party MP3 codec. Dell alleges that Sonic represented that the Roxio software would leverage and use Microsoft Windows operating system for encoding, decoding, recording, and playing MP3 audio files in order to avoid potential liability for third-party royalties. This representation is important because a third\n   party, Audio MPEG, Inc., holds the exclusive rights to grant licenses to third parties for certain U.S. and non-U.S. patent rights relating to the encoding and decoding of MP3 audio. One of Audio MPEG's licensees is Microsoft, which permits Microsoft to sell software capable of encoding and decoding MP3 audio. Dell alleges it relied on the written specifications and repeated representations made by Sonic that Roxio would not utilize third-party codec when it installed and continued to sell Roxio software on Dell computers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Licensing Agreement also states that \"the Licensed Product(s) shall not infringe any copyright, patent, trade secret or any other intellectual property rights or similar rights of any third party.\" Finally, under the Agreement, Sonic agreed to fully indemnify, defend, and hold Dell harmless \"from and against any and all claims, actions, suits, legal proceedings, demands, liabilities, damages, losses, judgments, settlements, costs and expenses, including, without limitation, attorneys' fees, arising out of or in connection with any alleged or actual ... breach by Sonic and/or the Licensed Product(s) of any other representations and/or warranties contained in this Agreement.\" Sonic, at its own expense, must \"procure for Dell the right to exercise the rights and licenses granted to Dell under this Agreement or modify the Licensed Product(s) such that it is no longer infringing ... and reimburse Dell for any royalty payments paid for the Licensed Product(s).\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In 2015, Audio MPEG sued Dell Inc. in the United States for patent infringement based, in part, for having distributed the Roxio software.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Audio MPEG, Inc. v. Dell Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 2:15-cv-73 (E.D. Va.).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Audio MPEG's parent company Sisvel sued Dell Inc. and Dell GmbH in Germany for patent infringement also based, in part, on sales of the Roxio software.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   During the course of the litigation, Dell learned that the Roxio software included unlicensed MP3 functionality and did not use the pre-programed Microsoft functionality for encoding and decoding MP3. Dell states that before settling and during the litigation, Dell requested that TiVo indemnify and defend Dell, but TiVo refused. Dell Technologies-as the parent company of Dell Inc., Dell GmbH, and Dell Global B.V.-entered into a settlement agreement and license with Audio MPEG, Sisvel, and the patent owners to resolve,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , the infringement claims related to the distribution of Roxio's software.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Dell Technologies and Dell Global B.V. filed suit in Texas state court asserting the following state-law claims against TiVo: (1) negligent misrepresentation, (2) fraudulent misrepresentation, (3) fraudulent nondisclosure, and (4) breach of contract. Dell claims that TiVo breached the Licensing Agreement in three ways: (1) the Roxio software did not follow the written specifications related to the software functionality;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   (2) the Roxio software infringed on the intellectual property rights of a third party; (3) TiVo did not comply with its obligations to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Dell for its losses resulting from Roxio's infringement. Dell's misrepresentation and nondisclosure claims are based on repeated representations made by TiVo that Roxio contained the proper functionality.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   TiVo answered, asserting defenses of noninfringement and patent exhaustion. TiVo also asserted counterclaims seeking a declaratory judgment that the Roxio software did not infringe on the Audio MPEG patents and that the Audio MPEG patents were exhausted by a third-party license with Microsoft.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   TiVo then removed the case to this court, asserting jurisdiction under Sections 1331, 1332, 1441, 1454, 1446. TiVo asserts that this court has diversity jurisdiction under Section 1332, because Dell improperly joined Dell Technologies, a non-diverse plaintiff, in state court in order to defeat diversity jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1441. TiVo also asserts that this court has jurisdiction under Section 1454, because TiVo's counterclaims for a declaration of noninfringement and patent exhaustion arise under federal patent law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201454\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1454\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Finally, TiVo asserts that this court has original jurisdiction to hear this case under Section 1331, because Dell's state-law claims arise under federal patent law. The owners of the Audio MPEG patents, Audio MPEG, and Sisvel are not parties to this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Dell moves to remand this case to state court, claiming that Dell Technologies is not improperly joined and that this court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction over TiVo's counterclaims and Dell's state-law claims, because the claims do not arise under federal patent law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    II. DIVERSITY JURISDICTION AND IMPROPER JOINDER\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   For the purposes of diversity jurisdiction, \"a corporation shall be deemed to be a citizen of every State and foreign state by which it has been incorporated.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1). Plaintiff Dell Technologies is incorporated in Delaware, and Plaintiff Dell Global B.V. is incorporated in The Netherlands. Defendants TiVo Corporation and Rovi Corporation are incorporated in the Delaware, and Defendant Sonic Solutions LLC is incorporated in California. Because one of the Plaintiffs, Dell Technologies, and two of the Defendants, TiVo and Rovi, are citizens of Delaware, there is not complete diversity of citizenship between the Plaintiffs and Defendants as pleaded.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1).

Dell and Sonic, however, are sophisticated parties. They both agreed to the Licensing Agreement containing an express right of indemnification for Dell affiliates injured by Sonic's breaches of representations and warranties. That Dell Technologies is or may be a third-party beneficiary to the Agreement extends beyond its status as the parent company of Dell Global and Dell Products. Dell Technologies is a third-party beneficiary because the specific language of the Licensing and Clarification Agreements allows \"each\" Dell affiliate-including Dell Technologies-to seek redress for Sonic's breaches of contract. Broad though the language is, it is what Sonic agreed to by contract, presumably in exchange for other binding promises by Dell.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Sonic, TiVo's predecessor,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   represented to Dell in the Licensing Agreement that the Roxio would comply with the Agreement's provisions about the software's functionality. The Roxio software did not operate as specified.

Dell was sued for patent infringement in Virginia because TiVo's product allegedly infringed on third-party patents-in breach of the Licensing Agreement-and TiVo's products did not operate according to the agreed upon functionality-also in breach of the Licensing Agreement. Dell also seeks reparations for the alleged misrepresentations made by TiVo before and during the\n   <em>\n    AudioMPEG\n   </em>\n   suit. And the measure of damages sought by Dell would be related, in part, to the settlement Dell paid in the\n   <em>\n    AudioMPEG\n   </em>\n   suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Thus, if Dell continues to press its claims that TiVo's product infringed in breach of the Licensing Agreement, some court will have to determine whether or not TiVo's product did in fact infringe. In that sense, the federal patent issue-infringement-plays a more central role in the resolution of this case than did the state-law claim in\n   <em>\n    Gunn\n   </em>\n   and it is not a hypothetical question. On the other hand, the facts of this case are unique: the prior patent case is finished; neither the patent owner nor an exclusive licensee is joined in this lawsuit; and the patents are now fully licensed as to the products TiVo supplied to Dell. Perhaps of most importance, the patents are now expired, which obviates the potential for a future infringement action against TiVo. Even though the resolution of the infringement issue would no doubt affect the parties to this suit, much like the facts of\n   <em>\n    Gunn\n   </em>\n   , an infringement determination is still \"backward looking\" as it would not \"change the real-world result of the prior federal patent litigation.\"\n   <em>\n    Gunn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407443\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/251/#p256\">\n    568 U.S. at 261\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407443\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/251/#p256\">\n    133 S.Ct. 1059\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
