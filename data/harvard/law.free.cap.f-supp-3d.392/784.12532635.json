As previously discussed, in\n   <em>\n    Hicks\n   </em>\n   , the majority held that \"the SSA's procedures violate the\n   long-standing principles of procedural due process that predate the\n   <em>\n    Mathews\n   </em>\n   test.\"\n   <em>\n    Hicks\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519324\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/909/786/#p794\">\n    909 F.3d at 797\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, the majority also concluded that the plaintiffs would prevail under\n   <em>\n    Mathews\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519324\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/909/786/#p794\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, the\n   <em>\n    Hicks\n   </em>\n   decision granted summary judgment for the plaintiffs and reversed the Commissioner's determination based on violation of the plaintiffs' procedural due process rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   It follows, then, that if the SSA violated the plaintiffs' procedural due process rights that SSA must reinstate the plaintiffs' benefits until the appropriate due process is provided. Any other result would be inapposite. It would be illogical to grant summary judgment for the plaintiffs based on a procedural due process violation but then allow the government to continue to deprive the plaintiffs of a protected property interest while the plaintiffs await the due process to which they are legally entitled. Ultimately, the SSA may not discontinue the plaintiffs' Social Security benefits until it has provided the basic procedural due process protections outlined in the\n   <em>\n    Hicks\n   </em>\n   decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   This result is also supported by Judge Amul R. Thapar's previous decision in\n   <em>\n    Hicks\n   </em>\n   at the district court level. In a memorandum opinion clarifying that the Court's opinion was a reversal of the Commissioner's determination, Judge Thapar explained that \"[t]he SSA must therefore return Hicks to the position she was in before the agency's decision.\"\n   <em>\n    Hicks v.

Ky. Mar. 31, 2017). Judge Thapar reached this conclusion for two reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   One, Judge Thapar explained that the SSA's regulations require that the SSA resume payment of benefits if the Commissioner's redetermination decision is reversed.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201227929\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   SSA regulations require that a recipient of SSDI and SSI benefits receive a hearing before benefits are terminated.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Soc. Sec. Admin.,\n   <em>\n    Hearings, Appeals, and Litigation Law Manual\n   </em>\n   (\"HALLEX\") \u00a7 I-1-3-25(C)(5). But here, the plaintiffs did not receive a hearing that comported with the basic tenants of procedural due process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Two, it appears that the Commissioner agreed to reinstate Hicks's benefits if Judge Thapar's opinion was in fact a reversal of the Commissioner's redetermination decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201227929\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Three additional considerations warrant discussion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   First, some authorities suggest that this Court may not award benefits if all essential factual issues have not been resolved. In\n   <em>\n    Faucher\n   </em>\n   , the Sixth Circuit explained that \"the [district] court can reverse the decision and immediately award benefits only if all essential factual issues have been resolved and the record adequately establishes a plaintiff's entitlement to benefits.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1830367\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/17/171/#p175\">\n    17 F.3d at 176\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But\n   <em>\n    Faucher\n   </em>\n   is easily distinguished from these cases. The\n   <em>\n    Faucher\n   </em>\n   decision addressed a district court's\n   <em>\n    award\n   </em>\n   of benefits at the initial disability determination stage, not\n   <em>\n    reinstatement\n   </em>\n   of benefits after a violation of procedural due process. Here, the cases before the Court are instances where the plaintiffs were determined to be disabled and their disability benefits were terminated during the redetermination process. As such, the Court is not\n   <em>\n    awarding\n   </em>\n   benefits here in the first instance. Instead the Court is simply requiring\n   <em>\n    reinstatement\n   </em>\n   of benefits that were taken from plaintiffs without due process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In fact, application of the\n   <em>\n    Faucher\n   </em>\n   rule in this case would make little sense seeing as the defect with the Commissioner's determination is based on the violation of due process as a matter of law, not based on an unresolved issue of fact or review of the\n   record. Preventing courts from reinstating benefits based on procedural due process defects during redetermination proceedings would make little sense. Such a rule would render courts unable to remedy procedural due process violations by the SSA. Even if Courts do not have the authority to award benefits in the first instance if essential factual issues are unresolved, surely courts may reinstate benefits after finding an unlawful deprivation of benefits by an administrative agency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Second, the Court acknowledges that a statement in a well-reasoned decision by Chief Judge Karen K. Caldwell seems to suggest that reinstatement of benefits is not required, even if the court finds for the plaintiffs on the due process claim. Previously, some of the plaintiffs filed motions for preliminary injunctions, requesting that the Court require the SSA to continue issuing benefits during the pendency of the appeals of the Commissioner's decision. In the order denying the motions for preliminary injunctions, Judge Caldwell stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   [E]ven if the Court were to find in favor of Plaintiffs' due process claims (or any other substantive claim), the ultimate remedy Plaintiffs seek-the reinstatement of their previously awarded benefits-is not something the Court would provide even in a final decision on the merits in this action. To resolve any potential infirmity in the redetermination process, the most likely relief this Court would award to Plaintiffs would be to remand the decision for the ALJ to hold a supplemental hearing to allow Plaintiffs the opportunity to dispute the alleged fraud in the previously excluded evidence. It would not be to completely re-do the redetermination process, nor would it be to reverse the ALJ's decision to eliminate Plaintiffs' benefits out of hand.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hicks\n   </em>\n   , No. 16-cv-154-ART, D.E. 36 at 32 (E.D. Ky. Oct. 12, 2016).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <em>\n    Wombles v. Colvin\n   </em>\n   , No. 7:16-cv-079-KKC, DE 16 at 4, Pg ID 227 (E.D. Ky. Dec. 7, 2016). Still, after considering the context of this statement and accounting for subsequent legal developments, there are various reasons that this statement does not impact the reinstatement of benefits at present.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   One, Judge Caldwell seems to have based this conclusion on Judge Thapar's October 12, 2016, decision in\n   <em>\n    Hicks.\n   </em>\n   But Judge Caldwell's order was entered in December 2016, before Judge Thapar entered an order on March 31, 2017, which clarified that his decision did reverse the Commissioner's redetermination decision, requiring continuance of Hicks's benefits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hicks\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201227929\">\n    2017 WL 1227929\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3. Thus, it is unclear if Judge Caldwell would have reached the same conclusion after Judge Thapar clarified his earlier decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Two, Judge Caldwell's order was entered before the Sixth Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Hicks.\n   </em>\n   Again, it is unclear if Judge Caldwell would have reached the same conclusion after the Sixth Circuit's decision holding that the Commissioner's redetermination procedures violated the plaintiffs' due process rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Three, Judge Caldwell was considering motions for preliminary injunctions, which require courts to weigh four factors, including the likelihood of success on the merits and the risk of immediate irreparable harm. When Judge Caldwell entered her decision, courts in the Eastern District of Kentucky had split on the plaintiffs' due process claims. This likely made consideration of likelihood of success on the merits difficult.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   As a result, after considering the context of the statement quoted above and subsequent legal developments in the Conn cases, it appears that Judge Caldwell's statement in\n   <em>\n    Wombles\n   </em>\n   has little, if any effect on the present determination on reinstating\n   benefits to the plaintiffs in the above-captioned cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Third, this result does not indicate that the plaintiffs are in fact disabled or that the plaintiffs will be entitled to SSDI or SSI benefits after additional proceedings. The Sixth Circuit's holding is based on the government's violation of the basic tenants of procedural due process, not a finding that the plaintiffs are in fact disabled. Essentially, the Sixth Circuit's holding stands for the proposition that the plaintiffs are entitled to an opportunity to rebut the Commissioner's finding that all the evidence submitted by four doctors who participated in Conn's fraudulent scheme was tainted with fraud and challenge the Commissioner's decision to disregard all medical evidence submitted by these doctors. Still, there is no dispute that some of the evidence submitted by former Conn clients was tainted with fraud. It is possible that the plaintiffs, once provided this required process, will be deemed ineligible for SSDI and SSI benefits and ultimately have their benefits terminated. The government must return the plaintiffs to the status quo until they are afforded an opportunity to challenge the Commissioner's decision to disregard medical evidence submitted by certain doctors, but that does not necessitate a finding that the plaintiffs will be entitled to benefits after additional redetermination proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In sum, the Sixth Circuit held that the Commissioner's determination that the plaintiffs were not disabled must be reversed because the redetermination process violated the plaintiffs' procedural due process rights. Thus, it follows that this procedural due process violation resulted in a deprivation of a property interest without due process, which necessitates additional proceedings and reinstatement of the benefits which were terminated without due process. As a result, the SSA must reinstate the plaintiffs' benefits and return the plaintiffs to the status quo before the Commissioner's determinations in these cases.
