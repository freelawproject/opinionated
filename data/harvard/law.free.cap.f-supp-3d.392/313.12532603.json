Plaintiff also seeks a declaration that defendant must indemnify plaintiff for costs incurred in the underlying action. The parties have filed cross-motions for summary judgment. As there are no remaining genuine issues of material fact, plaintiff's motion for summary judgment is granted in part as to defendant's duty to defend and indemnify plaintiff's insured, and defendant's motion for summary judgment is granted in part as to plaintiff's status as a co-primary insurer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Non-party Amelia Associate's, Inc. (\"Amelia\") leased to non-party Vintage Steakhouse, LLC (\"Vintage\") a property located in a shopping center for use as a steakhouse (the \"Lease\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In February 2017, non-parties Kathleen Mich and William J. Mich, Jr. commenced an action in New York State court against Delmonico's Porterhouse, LLC, Vintage, and Amelia (the \"Underlying Action\"). Mr. and Ms. Mich alleged that: Ms. Mich was injured after tripping and falling on the sidewalk while walking into Vintage; Vintage was the owner and tenant of the premises where the fall occurred; Vintage operated and maintained the premise where the fall occurred; and Vintage caused the sidewalk to be constructed in a dangerous condition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Lease\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Lease was in effect on April 18, 2014, when Ms. Mich fell. The Lease defines the \"Premise\" as \"[t]he premises consisting of approximately 2,791 square feet of gross leasable area, as cross-hatched on Exhibit A.\" Exhibit A depicts the entire shopping center, with the building leased to Vintage cross-hatched. Notably, the sidewalk where Ms. Mich fell is not cross-hatched.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Insurance Policies\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Both Amelia and Vintage had insurance policies that covered injuries sustained from falls like Ms. Mich's. Amelia took out a general liability insurance policy from plaintiff (the \"Peerless Policy\"). The Peerless Policy covers damages arising from falls like Ms. Mich's, and it was operative when Ms. Mich fell. Section IV of the Peerless Policy limits coverage when other collectable insurance is available for a loss that would typically be covered under the policy. If, in that scenario, the coverage is \"primary\" under the Peerless Policy, then plaintiff shares liability with the provider of the other collectable insurance as a co-primary insurer. But if the Peerless Policy only provides coverage that is \"excess over\" another policy, then plaintiff's liability is limited. Section IV(4)(b) states that the Peerless Policy is \"excess over ... any other primary insurance available to [Amelia] covering liability for damages arising out of the premises or operations for which [Amelia has] been added as an additional insured....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Vintage obtained its own general liability insurance policy from Tower National Insurance Company (\"Tower\"), and defendant assumed Tower's duties and rights under the policy after Tower's liquidation (the \"Technology Policy\"). The Technology Policy also covers damages arising from falls like Ms. Mich's and was operative when she fell. Pursuant to the Lease, the Technology Policy lists Amelia as an \"additional insured\" (the \"AI Endorsement\"). But Amelia's coverage under the AI Endorsement excludes \"[l]iability for 'bodily injury' or 'property damage' that is not sustained within that part of the premises leased to [Vintage].\" This coverage is \"excess over any primary insurance available to the additional insured.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The Coverage Dispute\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On June 1, 2015, Liberty Mutual Insurance, on behalf of plaintiff, advised defendant's claims administrator, Am Trust North America (\"AmTrust\"), that it would tender Mr. and Ms. Mich's personal injury claims against Amelia to AmTrust. On July 10, 2015, AmTrust denied the tender, noting that the Technology Policy does not cover Amelia in the Underlying Action because Ms. Mich fell on a sidewalk that was not included in the Lease. Specifically, AmTrust cited the clause of the AI Endorsement that excludes liability from injuries not \"sustained within that part of the premises leased to [Vintage].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Over the next two years, plaintiff sent several letters asking defendant to reconsider the denial or to at least provide co-insurance for the damages. But defendant\n   repeatedly reiterated its position. Plaintiff commenced this action on March 14, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56, a court may grant summary judgment when \"the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" \"Where the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the nonmoving party, there is no genuine issue for trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Matsushita Elect.

Defendant's Duty to Defend and Indemnify Amelia\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   To support its argument that the AI Endorsement's coverage does not extend to Amelia in the Underlying Action, defendant relies on the Lease and other evidence gathered during discovery. Even assuming that the four corners of the complaint give rise to an ambiguity as to whether defendant is liable for coverage in the Underlying Action, defendant has failed to supply any evidence that compels me \"to leave the boundaries of the complaint\" in determining its liability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Moreau\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=568%20N.Y.S.2d%20466\">\n    568 N.Y.S.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   468 ;\n   <em>\n    Avondale Indus., Inc. v.

For example, Exhibit A - defendant's hand-sketched silver bullet - is at odds with the testimony of Vintage's owner, who signed the Lease with the understanding that it included the sidewalk. And although the definition of \"Premises\" refers to the cross-hatched area of Exhibit A, the Lease also refers to Exhibit A as a \"parking plan\" (twice), suggesting that the purpose of the exhibit was to indicate which parking spots were reserved for Vintage rather than to carefully delineate the boundaries of the Leased property. Further, Vintage's obligations as a tenant, outlined in Section 11.02 of the Lease, include maintaining the sidewalks.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   This obligation is difficult to square with the Common Area definition in Section 8.02 upon which defendant relies. Finally, defendant states that the Lease was not even tailored to Vintage's property, but nevertheless relies on an in-depth analysis of the Lease as positive proof absolving it of liability.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   In doing so, however, defendant\n   has unintentionally shown that the Lease may be ambiguous and poorly drafted, which cuts against its reliance on it here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Indeed, when these ambiguities are construed against defendant, even defendant's most favorable evidence cannot establish \"to a certainty\" that defendant faces no liability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Avondale\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3709392\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/774/1416/#p1424\">\n    774 F.

Here, in contrast, the clauses both refer to the type of liability at issue in the Underlying Action. Thus, as defendant noted (and plaintiff has not contested), these two policies cannot be reconciled. The parties are therefore co-primary insurers of Amelia in the Underlying Action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Accordingly, plaintiff's [32] motion for summary judgment is GRANTED IN PART as to defendant's duty to defend and indemnify Amelia and DENIED IN PART as to defendants' role as the only primary insurer. Defendant's [33] motion for summary judgment is DENIED IN PART as to its duty to defend and indemnify Amelia and GRANTED IN PART as to plaintiff's role as a co-primary insurer. The parties shall submit a proposed form of judgment within 7 days that is consistent with this decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    The Lease, dated November 3, 2000, and amended March 10, 2002, was initially between Amelia (the landlord) and Delmonico's Porterhouse, LLC (the tenant). Delmonico's Porterhouse, LLC later rebranded as Vintage. These two entities are therefore the same for the purposes of this case.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    Because defendant stipulated that Amelia is included as an insured person on the \"Schedule\" of the AI Endorsement (the first requirement for the AI Endorsement to come into effect), the only issue in these cross-motions is whether defendant's liability extends to Amelia because Ms. Mich's accident occurred on the insured premises (the second requirement for the AI Endorsement to come into effect).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    The parties agree that New York State law governs the insurance policies at issue.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    That Vintage's owner testified that he never paid any money to maintain parts of the sidewalks does not mean he was not obligated to do so, and he did testify that he pay to keep the portion of the sidewalk at issue free of snow and ice.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    Defendants also argue that because Amelia painted the sidewalk to avoid future accidents, Amelia must have been obligated to maintain the sidewalk, so plaintiff's is liable for Ms. Mich's fall. That Amelia took initiative to prevent future accidents has no bearing on plaintiff's liability (or, more telling, defendant's lack of liability). Indeed, Section 11.03 of the Lease expressly allows Amelia to fulfill Vintage's maintenance obligations under the Lease to avoid injury to others. And even if Amelia's post-accident painting rendered plaintiff liable, that liability need not be exclusive. Separately, Section 11.03, a section defendant apparently overlooked, refers to Vintage's maintenance obligations \"to the Shopping Center or to the Premises,\" suggesting a broader scope of Vintage's obligations under the Lease than it asserts here.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
