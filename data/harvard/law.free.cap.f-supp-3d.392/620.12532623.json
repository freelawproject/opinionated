Schroeder, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This is an employment discrimination action by Plaintiff Shannon Jefferies, proceeding pro se. Jefferies's sole remaining claim is one of retaliation in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (\"Title VII\") because UNC Regional Physicians Pediatrics (\"Regional\") terminated her employment. Before the court is Regional's motion for summary judgment (Doc. 22.) The motion is fully briefed and ready for decision. For\n   the reasons discussed below, Regional's motion will be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Viewed in the light most favorable to Jefferies as the nonmoving party, the facts reflect the following:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Jefferies is a black woman who worked as a Certified Medical Assistant (\"CMA\") at Regional from September 2014 to June 19, 2017. (Doc. 5-1 at 1.) During the summer of 2016, Cornerstone Healthcare (\"Cornerstone\"), Jefferies's former employer, merged with Regional, resulting in tension between the two staffs. (Doc. 23-1 at 2-3; Doc. 23-3 at 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Under the attendance policy at Regional, employees were disciplined after the occurrence of a specific number of unscheduled absences and tardies, with each tardy counting as half an occurrence. (Doc. 23-1 at 3.) After three occurrences, employees received an oral reminder. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18). After five occurrences, employees received a written reminder. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) After six occurrences, employees received a final reminder. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) And after seven occurrences, employees would be terminated. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In January 2017, Regional's Practice Manager, Eric Welch, who was Jefferies's immediate supervisor, gave all employees a \"clean slate\" with respect to attendance, meaning that each employee began 2017 with zero occurrences. (Doc. 23-1 at 4; Doc. 23-2 \u00b6 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Between January and June 2017, Jefferies received several disciplinary actions from Welch. On March 20, 2017, Welch issued Jefferies an oral reminder based on three unscheduled absences, which Jefferies signed on March 21, 2017. (Doc. 23-1 \u00b6 15; Doc. 25-7 at 2.) Jefferies later became suspicious that Welch was not equally enforcing the attendance policy against former Cornerstone employees and complained to Welch's supervisor, Becca Wohlgemuth. (Doc. 23-7 at 2.) During this time Allison Skeen, CMA, who is white, informed Jefferies that she had also received an oral reminder for attendance policy violations. (Doc. 23-4 at 29.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On May 11, 2017, Welch issued Jefferies a second oral reminder based on complaints from coworkers and a patient's mother. (Doc. 23-1 \u00b6 16; Doc. 23-2 at 8.) The coworkers had complained that Jefferies had slammed down a clipboard at the registration desk and stated that \"someone was 'being a bitch.' \" (Doc. 23-2 at 8-9.) On May 10, 2017, a patient's mother told an office manager that she had an exchange with Jefferies that was \"very inappropriate\" when Jefferies accused her of \"[having] an attitude problem this morning\" and Jefferies \"was rude to her the rest of the visit and just made her feel uncomfortable.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. 23-2 at 8-10; Doc. 25-12 at 4.) Welch signed the oral reminder on May 23, 2017, but Jefferies refused to sign and instead submitted two written rebuttals disputing the accuracy of these complaints.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. 23-1 \u00b6\u00b6 16-17; Doc. 23-2 at 11-15.) Later that day, Jefferies emailed Welch and Wohlgemuth stating that she felt she was \"being singled out\" and \"targeted\" due to her race, ethnicity, internal complaints about the attendance policy, and past issues with Cornerstone staff. (Doc. 23-1 \u00b6 19: Doc. 23-2 at 17; Doc. 25-13 at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On May 24, 2017, Jefferies was contacted by Paul Earring of Regional's Human Resources department in response to her May 23 email. (Doc. 25 at 9.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   On June 13, 2017, Jefferies requested and received permission for a scheduled tardy for the morning of June 19, 2017, due to a \"family issue\" involving her son. (Doc. 23-2 at 30.) During this scheduled tardy, Jefferies filed an EEOC charge stating that she was the only CMA being held to the attendance standards and that she had been discriminated against \"due to [her] race (Black) and in retaliation for [her] complaint of being singled out due to my race in violation of Title VII.\" (Doc. 25-18 at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   When Jefferies returned to the office on June 19, 2017, she was immediately terminated by Wohlgemuth. (Doc. 23-3 \u00b6 22.) Wohlgemuth told Jefferies she was being terminated based on emails Wohlgemuth had received from other employees alleging that Jefferies violated company policy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 12, 15-18, 22; Doc. 25-18 at 5.) These emails described Jefferies rummaging through a coworker's drawer, retrieving personal information (including a coworker's disciplinary action), and sharing it with other employees in violation of both Regional's employee code of conduct and its confidentiality policy. (Doc. 23-3 \u00b6\u00b6 12, 15-17; Doc. 25-22 at 4; Doc. 23-1 at 14-15; Doc. 23-2 at 34.) There is no indication in the record that Wohlgemuth knew that Jefferies had filed an EEOC charge; to the contrary, Wohlgemuth states in her affidavit that she was not aware that Jefferies had filed or planned to file a charge with the EEOC at the time she made the decision to terminate Jefferies's employment. (Doc. 23-3 \u00b6 25.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On June 20, 2017, Jefferies filed a second EEOC charge claiming she was terminated in retaliation for having filed the previous EEOC charge. (Doc. 25-18 at 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On March 5, 2018, Jefferies filed this lawsuit against Regional in the General Court of Justice, Guilford County, District Court Division-Small Claims court. (Doc. 1-1.) Regional timely removed the action to this court based on federal question jurisdiction. (Doc. 1.) Regional then moved to dismiss the complaint, and the court granted the motion as to all claims against Welch and all claims against Regional except for Jefferies's retaliation claim now before the court. (Doc. 7; Doc. 11.) The court issued Jefferies a\n   <em>\n    Roseboro\n   </em>\n   letter,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   notifying her of her obligation to respond, her ability to file evidence in support of her claim, and the consequence of likely judgment in favor of the Defendant for failure to do so. (Doc. 24.) Jefferies has filed a response with multiple attachments. (Doc. 25.) The motion is therefore ready for decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

In deference to Jefferies's pro se status, the court sent her a\n   <em>\n    Roseboro\n   </em>\n   letter on April 2, 2019, informing her that \"[her] failure to respond, or if appropriate, to file affidavits or evidence in rebuttal within the allowed time may cause the court to conclude that the defendants' contentions are undisputed ....\" (Doc. 24.) A party's brief does not\n   constitute evidence that the court can consider on a motion for summary judgment. Similarly, statements such as those submitted by Jefferies that \"do[ ] not subject the author to the penalty of perjury for any misstatements\" (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. 25-19 at 8) cannot by themselves defeat a summary judgment motion.\n   <em>\n    Turner v.

In contrast, affidavits that are signed under penalty of perjury, such as those of Jean Michelle Harrell and Rebecca Lynn Benfield (Doc. 25-19), are proper evidence. Moreover, although a verified complaint may serve as an affidavit for summary judgment purposes,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Smith v.
