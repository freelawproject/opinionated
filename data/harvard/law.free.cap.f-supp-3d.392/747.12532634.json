INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In this putative class-action lawsuit, Plaintiffs Jessica and Michael Arnold claim that when they purchased an automobile-insurance policy from Safeco Insurance Company of Illinois, they expected that the policy would cover the full amount of their auto loan in the event of a total loss of the vehicle. Specifically, they expected the policy to include coverage for the \"gap\" between the actual value of the vehicle and the amount of Plaintiffs' indebtedness under their auto loan. Defendants assert that a policy exclusion precludes coverage for a portion of the auto loan amount called \"negative equity rollover,\" which is caused when a remaining balance on the insureds' old vehicle is \"rolled over\" onto the loan for their new vehicle. Plaintiffs do not dispute the fact that the policy exclusion exists,\n   but take issue with the timing in which it was disclosed by the insurer. Plaintiffs argue that because the insurer waited to disclose the exclusion until after the policy had been purchased, Plaintiffs were not sold the policy they expected and were foreclosed from purchasing exclusion-free \"gap\" insurance from the dealership. Plaintiffs assert twelve (12) causes of action arising from this central dispute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This matter is now before the Court on three pending motions: Defendants' joint Motion to Dismiss and for Judgment on the Pleadings (Doc. # 49); Plaintiffs' Cross-Motion to Stay (Doc. # 51); and Defendants' Motion for Sanctions (Doc. # 52). All three motions have been fully briefed and are now ripe for review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   (Docs. # 50, 53, 54, 55, and 56). For the reasons set forth herein, Defendants' joint Motion to Dismiss and for Judgment on the Pleadings (Doc. # 49) is\n   <strong>\n    granted\n   </strong>\n   ; Plaintiffs' Cross-Motion to Stay (Doc. # 51) is\n   <strong>\n    denied\n   </strong>\n   ; and Defendant Liberty Mutual's Motion for Sanctions (Doc. # 52) is\n   <strong>\n    denied\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On October 30, 2017, Plaintiffs Jessica Arnold and Michael Arnold (the \"Arnolds\"), both individually and on behalf of a class of similarly-situated persons (\"Plaintiffs\"), filed a Class Action Complaint in the Circuit Court of Boone County, Kentucky, against Defendants Liberty Mutual Insurance Company (\"Liberty Mutual\") and Safeco Insurance Company of America (\"Safeco-America\"). (Doc. # 1-4) (noting Complaint filed in Boone Circuit Court, No. 17-CI-01433). Plaintiffs filed a First Amended Class Action Complaint on November 9, 2017. (Doc. # 1-2).

(Doc. # 1-2 at \u00b6\u00b6 27-28). The dealership determined that the Arnolds' Mazda had $ 3,700 in \"negative equity,\" but it agreed to subtract $ 1,500 when calculating the amount to be \"rolled over\" into the auto loan for the Toyota Camry; the Arnolds claim this reduced the \"negative equity roll-over\" onto the financing for the Toyota Camry to $ 2,200.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201332\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201332\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 29, 31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After the trade-in, the Arnolds purchased an insurance policy from the Defendants for the Toyota Camry and added guaranteed auto protection (\"GAP\") coverage to the policy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201332\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201332\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 27, 34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

(Doc. # 49 at 10-11). The limitations period for a civil-conspiracy claim under Kentucky law is one year from the date of accrual. Ky. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 413.140(1)(c). It is undisputed that Plaintiffs purchased the policy in 2015; the endorsement was mailed to them on September 2, 2015, and received three days later on September 5, 2015.

Thus, the last potentially-relevant overt act alleged by Plaintiffs occurred more than one year prior to the filing of the complaint on October 30, 2017. (Doc. # 1-3). Accordingly, Plaintiffs' civil-conspiracy claim is time barred.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chamberlain, LLC v. Hills Land &amp; Dev.

Plaintiff argues that this more general statute carries a five-year statute of limitations and should apply here because Plaintiffs' KCPA claim was brought generally under the KCPA, \u00a7 367.170, not under \u00a7 367.220 specifically.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%20521047\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Stevens v.

Plaintiffs' Response asserts that \"the Arnolds identified the promise very clearly: GAP insurance coverage without an exclusion of carry-over balances from previous loans or leases as well as statements that fraudulently induced them to change their position.\" (Doc. # 50 at 32). In support of their argument that they alleged sufficient facts to support a promise, Plaintiffs point to six paragraphs in their Second Amended Class Action Complaint (Doc. # 46) as well as a Kentucky Auto Product Guide apparently published by Safeco-Illinois and attached as an exhibit to Plaintiffs' Response.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   (Docs. # 46 at \u00b6\u00b6 25-26, 33, 60, 190-92 and 50-7 at 32-33).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   However, nowhere in these documents cited by Plaintiffs is there a promise to provide GAP insurance with\n   <em>\n    no exclusions.\n   </em>\n   Paragraphs 25 and 26 of the Second Amended Class Action Complaint identify Plaintiff Jessica Arnold as a licensed, independent insurance agent with 13 years of experience, including experience selling insurance on behalf of Defendants; Plaintiffs allege that during her time as an agent, Plaintiff Jessica Arnold routinely sold GAP insurance \"with the understanding that the GAP insurance offered by the Defendants would pay the difference between the remaining debt on the customer's financing and the actual cash value of the motor vehicle after being declared a 'total loss.' \" (Doc. # 46 at \u00b6\u00b6 25-26). Plaintiffs allege no facts, however, specifying how Plaintiff Jessica Arnold came to have this understanding. The next paragraph identified by Plaintiff likewise makes a vague reference to Plaintiffs' \"understanding\" of coverage without specifying the source of their alleged understanding.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 33. The next paragraph relied upon by Plaintiffs asserts that \"an agent never mentioned the exclusion.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 60. However, Plaintiffs fail to offer any authority to support their assertion that an agent's alleged failure to \"mention\" policy exclusions constitutes the requisite promise to satisfy the first element of a promissory-estoppel claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   Finally, Plaintiffs point to their bad-faith allegations in Count IX of the Second Amended Class Action Complaint, where they assert:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-147\">\n   190. Under the terms of their policies, the Plaintiffs and the proposed class were led to believe the Defendants, under the GAP insurance coverage and during the course of a valid claim, would pay the difference between the actual value of the automobile and the amount still owed on the vehicle when a total loss occurred.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-148\">\n   191. This was how the Defendants explained the GAP insurance coverage to their agents and how they marketed and advertised the policy to the general public.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-149\">\n   192. Further, the Kentucky Essential Personal Auto Policy, offered to the potential consumer by the Defendants, outlined all coverage terms, conditions, and exclusions that would ever apply to a Kentucky auto policy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   (Doc. # 46 at \u00b6\u00b6 190-192). These vague allegations still fall short of alleging facts regarding who made the promise or the specific nature or substance of the promise. Further, these allegations fail to identify a promise of \"GAP insurance coverage without an exclusion of carry-over balances from previous loans or leases\" or otherwise identify with any specificity \"statements that fraudulently induced [Plaintiffs] to change their position.\" (Doc. # 50 at 32).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   Plaintiffs also point outside the pleadings to a Kentucky Auto Product Guide apparently published by Safeco-Illinois and attached as an exhibit to Plaintiffs' Response. (Doc. # 50-7 at 32-33). However, even considering this document, Plaintiffs still fail to demonstrate that Defendants promised to provide GAP coverage with no exclusions. The product guide does not specifically list \"GAP insurance,\" but does list \"New Vehicle Replacement\" and \"Auto Loan/Lease Coverage.\" (Doc. # 50-7 at 32-33). The \"New Vehicle Replacement\" section specifically notes that coverage is \"subject to certain limitations.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32. Likewise, the portion of the Kentucky Auto Product Guide that addresses \"Auto Loan/Lease Coverage\" specifically notes that there are exceptions to coverage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   (Doc. # 50-7 at 33). This paragraph includes a statement that \"[c]overage does\n   not apply to overdue payments, penalty charges assessed for excessive mileage or excessive wear and tear,\n   <em>\n    etc.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). As set forth\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   in Section III.A.2.e, the language is clearly non-exhaustive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   In sum, nowhere does Safeco-Illinois represent that the coverage at issue was offered \"without an exclusion of carry-over balances from previous loans or leases.\" (Doc. # 50 at 32). Nor do Plaintiffs point to any specific language or otherwise provide factual support for their claim that Defendants published \"statements that fraudulently induced [Plaintiffs] to change their position.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs have failed to identify the requisite promise-the first element of the promissory-estoppel claim-and therefore their claim fails as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   In addition to failing to allege facts identifying the requisite promise, Plaintiffs also failed to allege facts to support a finding that their alleged reliance was justified. Just as in\n   <em>\n    Butler\n   </em>\n   , reliance on this purported promise was not justified because it directly conflicted with the written language of the policy endorsement as well as the language of the Kentucky Auto Product Guide, which notified Plaintiffs that the coverage was subject to exclusions.\n   <em>\n    Butler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"218\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2005%20WL%201009621\">\n    2005 WL 1009621\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4. Further, as Plaintiff Jessica Arnold alleges that she is an insurance agent with 13 years of experience and familiarity with the sale of insurance policies,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   (Doc. # 46 at \u00b6 25), it strains logic to assert that she justifiably relied upon a belief that her specific policy endorsements contained no additional exclusion language aside from what was generally available in a product guide-particularly when the product guide cited by Plaintiffs clearly communicated that additional exclusions applied. (Doc. # 50-7 at 32-33). Accordingly, because Plaintiffs failed to identify either a promise or justifiable reliance on a promise, their promissory-estoppel claim fails as a matter of law and Defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings is\n   <strong>\n    granted\n   </strong>\n   as to Count XI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   <strong>\n    o. Whether Plaintiffs failed to state a claim for violation of the Kentucky UCSPA (Count XII)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   Finally, Defendants argue that they are entitled to judgment on the pleadings as to Plaintiffs' statutory-bad-faith claim for violation of the Kentucky Unfair Claims Settlement Practices Act (\"UCSPA\") (Count VI) \"for the same reasons the bad faith and KCPA claims fail.\" (Doc. # 49 at 23-24). Specifically, Defendants assert that-just as with a common-law-bad-faith claim-under Kentucky law, an insurer must be contractually obligated to pay the claim under the terms of the policy in order to be liable under a statutory-bad-faith claim.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"219\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2005%20WL%201009621\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Demetre\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12385486\" index=\"220\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/527/12/#p26\">\n    527 S.W.3d at 26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The gravamen of the UCSPA is that an insurance company is required to deal in good faith with a claimant, whether an insured or a third-party, with respect to a claim which the insurance company\n   <em>\n    is contractually obligated to pay.\n   </em>\n   \") (emphasis added). Here, because Defendants were not contractually obligated to pay for carry-over balances from previous loans or leases pursuant to the express language of the policy endorsement,\n   <em>\n    see supra\n   </em>\n   Section III.A.2.j, Plaintiffs' claim fails as a matter of law, and Defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings as to Plaintiffs' statutory-bad-faith claim (Count XII) is\n   <strong>\n    granted\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Plaintiffs' Cross-Motion to Stay Pending Discovery\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   In response to Defendants' joint Motion to Dismiss and for Judgment on the Pleadings (Doc. # 49), Plaintiffs filed a Cross-Motion to Stay proceedings to allow time\n   for fact discovery regarding,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , the legal relationship between Defendants Safeco-Illinois and Liberty Mutual. (Doc. # 51 at 9-13). However, as each of Plaintiffs' claims against both Defendants fail as a matter of law,\n   <em>\n    see supra\n   </em>\n   Sections III.A.2.c-o, Plaintiffs' Cross-Motion to Stay (Doc. # 51) is\n   <strong>\n    denied as moot\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Defendants' Motion for Sanctions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   Finally, the Court will turn to Defendant Liberty Mutual's Motion for Sanctions. (Doc. # 52). The Motion arises from the August 17, 2018 telephonic conference held by the Court to discuss four pending motions in this matter: Defendants' (First) Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings (Doc. # 23); Plaintiffs' (First) Motion to Stay (Doc. # 37), Plaintiffs' Motion for Leave to Amend the First Amended Complaint (Doc. # 38), and Defendants' Motion to Strike (Doc. # 41). Following the conference, the Court entered an Order granting leave for Plaintiffs to amend the complaint \"to the extent that Plaintiffs seek to name the proper party and amend the allegations of Count Two.\" (Doc. # 45). The Court denied the other pending motions, and provided that Defendants may renew their Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings after the filing of Plaintiffs' Second Amended Complaint.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs filed their Second Amended Class Action Complaint on August 31, 2018, substituting Safeco Insurance Company of Illinois (\"Safeco-Illinois\") for the previously-named Safeco Insurance Company of America (\"Safeco-America\"), and adding more specific allegations to the \"Fraud and Misrepresentation\" claim (Count II).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   (Doc. # 46) (highlighting changes and amendments in\n   <strong>\n    bold\n   </strong>\n   typeface). Otherwise, the allegations were identical to the First Amended Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   Liberty Mutual asserts that, following its telephonic conference with the parties, the Court \"allow[ed] Plaintiffs to amend their complaint to substitute Safeco-Illinois in place of\" both Safeco-America\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   Liberty Mutual and, therefore, that by only substituting Safeco-Illinois in place of Safeco-America, and keeping Liberty Mutual in the case Plaintiffs acted \"contrary to the Court's order.\" (Doc. # 49 at 6). Liberty Mutual urges the Court to impose Rule 11 sanctions based upon the violation of the Court's Order by Plaintiffs' counsel. (Doc. # 52 at 9). Defendant further asserts that Rule 11 sanctions are appropriate because Plaintiffs have no factual basis to support their claims against Liberty Mutual because Safeco-Illinois was the entity that issued the insurance policy at issue in this litigation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that by presenting a pleading or written motion to the Court, an attorney certifies that, among other things, \"the factual contentions [made therein] have evidentiary support or, if specifically so identified will likely have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(b)(3). If counsel violates Rule 11, after giving notice and a reasonable opportunity to respond \"the court may impose an appropriate sanction on any attorney, law firm, or party that violated the rule or is responsible for the violation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11(c)(1). In reviewing a Rule 11 motion, courts employ an \"objective standard.\"\n   <em>\n    Mann v. G &amp; G Mfg., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10536338\" index=\"221\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/900/953/#p958\">\n    900 F.2d 953\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 958 (6th Cir. 1990). Courts have broad discretion in determining whether Rule 11 sanctions are appropriate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ridder v. City of Springfield\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"833993\" index=\"222\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/109/288/#p298\">\n    109 F.3d 288\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 298 (6th Cir. 1997) ;\n   <em>\n    Mann\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10536338\" index=\"223\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/900/953/#p958\">\n    900 F.2d at 958\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   Here, the Court finds that Rule 11 sanctions are not appropriate. The Court notes that, aside from exchanging Rule 26(a)(1) disclosures, the parties have not\n   had a meaningful opportunity to conduct discovery. Plaintiffs have not had an opportunity to propound interrogatories or otherwise confirm the relationship between Liberty Mutual and Safeco-Illinois aside from publicly-available information and the policy itself. While the Court determined that Plaintiffs' legal theories failed as a matter of law, there is insufficient evidence that sanctions are warranted. The Court finds that Liberty Mutual has failed to demonstrate that Plaintiffs' counsel acted unreasonably in believing discovery could have shown Liberty Mutual had a hand in marketing the coverage at issue or otherwise was potentially responsible for the alleged claims-handling practices at issue, particularly when Liberty Mutual's name was referenced in policy documents as well as Safeco advertising materials and Liberty Mutual claims representatives appear to have handled Plaintiffs' claim at least in part.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   (Doc. # 54 at 6-10, 13).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   Moreover, the Court finds that Liberty Mutual overstates the scope of the Order granting Plaintiffs' request for leave to amend. There is evidence that Plaintiffs' Motion to Amend was directed at having named the wrong Safeco entity.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , (Doc. # 52-1 at 3). Neither the Court's Minute Entry Order for the August 17, 2018 Telephone Conference nor the Court's review of the unofficial transcript of the proceedings show that the Court specifically required Plaintiffs to substitute Safeco-Illinois for\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   Defendants.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   (Doc. # 45). Rather, the Court's Order granted Plaintiffs' request for leave to amend \"to the extent that Plaintiffs seek to name the proper party and amend the allegations of Count Two\" and denied the remaining motions without prejudice.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10536338\" index=\"224\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/900/953/#p958\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   (Doc. # 38 at 10) (stating that \"the Arnolds now seek to add Safeco-Illinois as a new party to this case\"). Dismissal of Liberty Mutual was not expressly discussed. Based upon this unintended ambiguity, it is not clear that Plaintiffs acted in violation of the August 17, 2018 Order. Without more, the Court declines to exercise its discretion to impose sanctions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   Plaintiffs in turn argue that \"[b]ecause Liberty Mutual is taking such a bizarre position, has bombarded Plaintiffs' counsel with harassing emails and threats, and intentionally misstates what occurred during the Court's telephone conference, the Plaintiffs request that the Court ... in turn, impose the appropriate Rule 11 sanctions in favor of Plaintiffs.\" (Doc. # 54). Due to the ambiguity caused by the parties' arguments at the August 17, 2018 Telephone Conference, the Court likewise declines to exercise its discretion to impose Rule 11 sanctions on counsel for Liberty Mutual.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   Finally, the Court notes that each sides' request for sanctions fails on procedural grounds. Liberty Mutual asserts without support-despite attaching extensive communications with opposing counsel-that it served Plaintiffs with its Motion for Sanctions in compliance with Rule 11(c)(2), but both parties fail to actually show that they served one another at least 21 days before making their request to the Court in compliance with the Rule.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reed v.
