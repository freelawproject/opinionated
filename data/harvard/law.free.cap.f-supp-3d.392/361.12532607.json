(Summons with Notice, ECF No. 1-1, at 1.) According to the Notice, the claims asserted by Plaintiffs were for \"intentional and unintentional discrimination\" based on sex, gender and race, in violation of various provisions of federal law, New York state law and New York City law, including the federal Equal Pay Act and the New York State Equal Pay Law. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.) The Notice annexes and incorporates by reference a Charge of Discrimination that was filed with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\") on December 5, 2013 against the City and DCAS by Local 1180 and Jane Doe Administrative Managers # 1-1000 and Jane Doe Former Administrative Managers # 1-1000, as well as a Supplemental Charge of Discrimination that was filed on November 19, 2014. (Summons with Notice, Exs. A &amp; C.) The EEOC Charge and Supplemental Charge allege violations of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (\"Title VII\"), in addition to violations of the Equal Pay Act. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) It is alleged that the City and DCAS \"engaged in a pattern or practice of wage suppression\" in the job title Administrative Manager Non-Managerial (hereinafter, \"Administrative Manager NM\") that \"adversely impacted women and persons of color.\" (Summons with Notice, Ex. A, \u00b6 18.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   On April 7, 2017, the Summons with Notice was served upon Defendants.

(\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Summons with Notice at 1\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Compl. at 1.) The Complaint asserts claims under the federal Equal Pay Act and the New York Equal Pay Law. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 117-28.) The Complaint-like the EEOC Charges-alleges that the City and DCAS engaged in discriminatory pay practices with respect to the job title Administrative Manager NM.

(Stipulation \u00b6 16.) This Back Pay, totaling $5,635,684.00, was to be used to pay legal fees and payment for work done by class members in the past. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Defendants and NYCHA also agreed to certain injunctive relief, including step increases and changes in labor practices.

(Stipulation \u00b6\u00b6 8(e), 9, 20.) White females, nonwhite males and nonwhite females in the job title shall receive greater back pay awards than white males based upon calculations performed by Thomas Econometrics Inc. of the disparate pay received by these groups during the class period.

To the extent that the Court has a role in determining the reasonableness of the legal fees charged, the Court has reviewed the time entries and hourly rates of Plaintiffs' counsel and is satisfied that $300,000.00 is a reasonable amount of legal fees to charge in pursuit of the claims filed at the EEOC.

For example, Plaintiffs' counsel have multiple entries for ministerial tasks for which an attorney should not be charging her client; for example, Kagan on a number of occasions billed to \"[c]alendar upcoming dates\" (\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Healey-Kagan Decl., Ex. 3, ECF No. 131-3, at 104, 108, 114, 119, 120), and Cullum on some occasions billed to \"[o]rganize file.\" (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 120, 129.)

While these meetings conceivably brought some value to the client, the Court, in its experience, finds that a reasonable client would not agree to compensate Plaintiffs' counsel for the hours spent by each attorney attending these meetings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Based upon its careful review of all the relevant time entries, the Court's rough lodestar calculation\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   credits Kurland with 1,095 hours at $600 per hour ($657,000.00); Kagan with 742 hours at $350 per hour ($259,700.00); Cullen as a law clerk with 189 hours at $150 per hour ($28,350.00); and Cullen as a junior associate with 422 hours at $200 per hour ($84,400.00) for a total of $1,029,450.00.
