The federal court ruled that \"[t]he determination whether the [video] is discoverable by a party to plane crash litigation is a question that must be addressed\n    <em>\n     to the court where that litigation is pending\n    </em>\n    ....

The NTSB stated that it had \"completed its production\" in this case, and that it had asserted exemptions as it believed were appropriate.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4343326\" index=\"282\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/40/498/#p502\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    Accordingly, the NTSB indicated that all issues in this case could be resolved following briefing. The NTSB filed a \"Motion for Summary Judgment,\" rather than a motion for partial summary judgment; moreover, the NTSB's proposed order stated that the case would be closed, should the Court find in favor of the NTSB.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ECF No. 51, Proposed Order. Furthermore, despite receiving clear notice from Plaintiffs that it had not briefed the Court about the wreckage\n    <em>\n     or related documents\n    </em>\n    , the NTSB failed to seek leave to file a reply brief addressing Plaintiffs' arguments. In light of the foregoing, the Court finds that the merits of all of the issues raised by Plaintiffs are squarely before the Court and can be ruled on.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
