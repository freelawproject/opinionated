(\"\n   <em>\n    Rembrandt\n   </em>\n   \"). In this suit, to which the Court will refer as\n   <em>\n    Rexing II\n   </em>\n   , Rexing brings what it characterizes as distinct and separate claims for conversion and deception after Rembrandt allegedly failed to return certain egg packing materials, collectively called EggsCargoSystem. The problem, according to Rembrandt, is that these claims should have been brought, if at all, in\n   <em>\n    Rexing I\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   Rexing scrambled that opportunity, and the prohibition on claim splitting means that Rexing cannot put the yolk back in the shell via this separate lawsuit.

[\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 22-1 at 5-6\n   </em>\n   .] In its summary judgment response brief, Rexing argued that the purchase agreement's remedies clause was unenforceable in part because it failed to compensate Rexing for its \"substantial upfront costs in preparation for its obligations under the Purchase Agreement.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   [\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Rexing I\n    </em>\n    , Filing No. 90 at 34\n   </em>\n   .] In support, Rexing cited to the declaration of Dylan Rexing, [\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Rexing I\n    </em>\n    , Filing No. 89-10 at 1-8\n   </em>\n   ], which, in turn, cited what the declaration described as accurate evidence of its expenses.

In\n   <em>\n    Rexing I\n   </em>\n   , the Court applied Iowa law, which both parties agreed was mandated by the choice of law provision in the purchase agreement.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12529716\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/360/817/\">\n    360 F.

In support of this proposition, both parties cite to cases stating the general rule that, in diversity cases, a federal court applies the law of preclusion of the state in which the court is located.

Frequently, as in\n   <em>\n    Harmon\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Infra-Metals\n   </em>\n   , the law that would be applied in the state court will be the law of that state-but not always.

Perhaps an Indiana court, faced with the allegations in\n   <em>\n    Rexing II\n   </em>\n   and the purchase agreement that governs the parties' relationship, would hold that Iowa law applies. But the Court need not undertake such an inquiry because the parties themselves have not done so, and \"[c]ourts do not worry about conflict of laws unless the parties disagree on which state's law applies.\"\n   <em>\n    Wood v.

The parties both apply Indiana law, so the Court follows suit and applies Indiana law as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Rembrandt first argues that dismissal is appropriate under Indiana's doctrine of res judicata, citing this Court's summary judgment order in\n   <em>\n    Rexing I\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 30 at 5-8\n   </em>\n   .] In response, Rexing argues that res judicata does not apply because the summary judgment order was not a final judgment on the merits, because\n   <em>\n    Rexing I\n   </em>\n   did not determine the issues raised in\n   <em>\n    Rexing\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    II\n   </em>\n   , and because the claims raised in each case were not part of the same transaction or occurrence. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 24 at 5-12\n   </em>\n   .] In reply, Rembrandt argues that the Court's summary judgment order was a final order for purposes of summary judgment under Indiana law and that the requirements for res judicata are otherwise satisfied in this case.

The plaintiff argued that the judgment from the first suit was not final because the trial court had not \"state[d] with particularity the reasons for any summary judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 688. But this technical shortcoming had no impact on the issue of finality because the trial court in fact entered judgment; the time to challenge the propriety of the summary judgment order was at the time of the judgment in the first suit, not by way of a second, separate lawsuit. The court explained that a judgment is final if the trial court \"did intend to dispose of the subject matter of the litigation as to the parties as far as the court had the power to dispose of it and that there was reserved no further question for future determination,\" which the judgment in the first suit obviously did.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 689.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Here, by not entering partial final judgment (something that the Court had not been asked to do), the Court confirmed that it did\n   <strong>\n    not\n   </strong>\n   \"intend to dispose of the subject matter of the litigation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   By operation of Rule 54(b), the\n   <em>\n    Rexing I\n   </em>\n   summary judgment order did not \"dispose\" of anything on its own accord, and no final judgment was entered to effect such a disposal. Rather, the\n   <em>\n    Rexing I\n   </em>\n   summary judgment order was a nonfinal, interlocutory order lacking the finality required to trigger res judicata. Res judicata therefore does not bar Rexing's claims in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Claim Splitting\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   As an alternative to its res judicata argument, Rembrandt argues that Rexing's claims fail pursuant to the prohibition on claim splitting. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 21 at 8-10\n   </em>\n   .] In response, Rexing argues that its\n   <em>\n    Rexing II\n   </em>\n   claims are not impermissibly split from\n   <em>\n    Rexing I\n   </em>\n   because the claims involve different proofs and different elements and are the result of subsequent acts.

Then, when asked in discovery as to the damages Rexing was seeking, Rexing specifically included EggsCargoSystem among its start-up expenses for which it believed Rembrandt to be liable. Whether dressed up as a category of damages (as in\n   <em>\n    Rexing I\n   </em>\n   ) or an independent\n   tort claim (as in\n   <em>\n    Rexing II\n   </em>\n   ), it is clear that\n   <em>\n    Rexing II\n   </em>\n   seeks to recover the same damages for the EggsCargoSystem it sought in\n   <em>\n    Rexing I\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Rexing's argument that its\n   <em>\n    Rexing II\n   </em>\n   claims accrued after it filed\n   <em>\n    Rexing I\n   </em>\n   is belied by its allegations in this case. Rexing refused to take egg loads no later than June 5, 2017. Over the next week, Rexing twice unsuccessfully demanded that Rembrandt return the EggsCargoSystem. On June 16, 2017, Rexing filed its\n   <em>\n    Rexing I\n   </em>\n   Complaint alleging that its performance under the purchase agreement was excused and that Rembrandt breached the express warranties of the purchase agreement. Rexing made another demand for the EggsCargoSystem the next day. Rexing thus was well aware of its ability to allege an independent claim for return of or damages for the EggsCargoSystem before it filed\n   <em>\n    Rexing I\n   </em>\n   -and this is true regardless of Rembrandt's subsequent return of some of the materials. In other words, Rexing wholly fails to explain how the partial return of the EggsCargoSystem had any impact on the availability of its\n   <em>\n    Rexing II\n   </em>\n   claims at the time it filed\n   <em>\n    Rexing I\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <em>\n    Rexing I\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Rexing II\n   </em>\n   are derived from the same business dispute involving the same claim to damages for the EggsCargoSystem, which Rexing purchased to fulfill its obligations under the purchase agreement. Rexing's legal theories may differ, but because Rexing had the same claims available to it at the time it filed\n   <em>\n    Rexing I\n   </em>\n   -and certainly well before the pleading amendment deadline-it was obligated to raise\n   <strong>\n    all\n   </strong>\n   claims it had to the packing materials in that case.
