Accordingly, they have brought a pre-enforcement challenge to those two provisions alleging that they violate the First Amendment to the United States Constitution facially and as applied to their proposed activities. They additionally claim that the Librarian of Congress's failure to include certain exemptions from the reach of the anti-circumvention provision in a 2015 final rule promulgated under a rulemaking procedure created by the DMCA violated the First Amendment and the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\"). They seek declaratory and injunctive relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Defendants-the United States Department of Justice, Attorney General William Barr, the Library of Congress, Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden, the United States Copyright Office, and Register of Copyrights Karyn Temple Claggett\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   -have moved to dismiss plaintiffs' claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and, alternatively, for failure to state a claim under Federal Rule 12(b)(6).

S. Rep. No. 105-190, at 2 (1998). In implementing those treaties via the DMCA, Congress was primarily responding to \"the ease with which digital works can be copied and distributed worldwide virtually instantaneously.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201201\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201201\">\n    at 8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In short, Congress was concerned with the pirating of copyrighted works in the digital world. Three of the DMCA's central provisions respond directly to that concern.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The first- section 1201(a)(1)(A) -is an \"anti-circumvention\" provision.

The anti-trafficking provision at issue in this case, section 1201(a)(2), prohibits, in relevant part, a person from \"manufactur[ing], import[ing], offer[ing] to the public, provid[ing], or otherwise traffic[king] in any technology, product, service, device, component, or part thereof, that is primarily designed or produced for the purpose of circumventing a technological measure that effectively controls access to a [copyrighted] work.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201201\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1201(a)(2)(A).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The DMCA also includes certain fine-grained permanent exemptions, some of which apply to the anti-circumvention provision and to both anti-trafficking provisions,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201201\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1201(e) (broadly exempting official law enforcement activity); some of which apply to the anti-circumvention provision and only one of the anti-trafficking provisions,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201201\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1201(j) (exempting security testing \"solely for the\n   purpose of good faith testing, investigating, or correcting, a security flaw or vulnerability\"); and some of which apply only to the anti-circumvention provision\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201201\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1201(d) (exempting nonprofit libraries, archives, and educational institutions that seek to circumvent TPMs to determine whether to purchase a copyrighted product).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Additionally, cognizant of its \"longstanding commitment to the principle of fair use,\" H.R. Rep. No. 105-551, pt. 2, at 35 (1998) (\"Commerce Comm.

The court then held that the DMCA and an injunction issued pursuant to its anti-trafficking provisions prohibiting the posting of a specific code capable of circumvention-DeCSS-was content-neutral because only the functional, non-speech component of the code was targeted:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   [T]he target of the posting provisions of the injunction-DeCSS-has both a nonspeech and a speech component, and ... the DMCA, as applied to the Appellants, and the posting prohibition of the injunction target only the nonspeech component. Neither the DMCA nor the posting prohibition is concerned with whatever capacity DeCSS might have for conveying information to a human being, and that capacity, as previously explained, is what arguably creates a speech component of the decryption code. The DMCA and the posting prohibition are applied to DeCSS solely because of its capacity to instruct a computer to decrypt CSS.
