Principal and agent, \u00a7 97<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014what is power of agent selling on commission. A selling agent on commission who takes orders and submits them to his principal has no implied authority to constitute other persons agents of the company, or to secure assistance for himself in selling and to add the commissions of such assistants to his own commissions and to the selling expense falling on the company.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b317-5\" pgmap=\"317\">3. Principal and agent, \u00a7 242*\u2014what evidence shows agent\u2019s powers. Where a person, who had purchased a box ball alley through an agent, and who had been promised commissions for procuring other purchasers, wrote to the principal inquiring concerning the payment of money and received a letter stating that the agent was \u201call right in every respect,\u201d and'also stating how the money might he paid, held that such letter could not be considered as an assertion that the agent was a general agent with power to bind the company for the promised commissions, but referred only to the money involved.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b317-6\" pgmap=\"317\">4. Evidence, \u00a7 185*\u2014what constitutes admission. In an action for commissions for selling box ball alleys, where the question at issue was whether an agent was a general agent with power to bind his principal for the commissions, held that a statement of the treasurer of the company that the agent was a \u201cgeneral representative\u201d was not, in view of other evidence, an admission of the agent\u2019s powers, but rather a repudiation.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b317-7\" pgmap=\"317\">5. Principal and agent, \u00a7 239*\u2014when letter is competent evidence of agent\u2019s powers. In determining an agents\u2019 powers, a letter written by the principal to another person concerning a similar transaction is incompetent.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b317-8\" pgmap=\"317\">6.
