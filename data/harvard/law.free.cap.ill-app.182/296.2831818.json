A special finding of a jury must be unanimous.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b321-8\" pgmap=\"321\">2. Appeal and error, \u00a7 1521*\u2014when error in submitting special interrogatory is harmless. The submission of a special interrogatory is not ground for reversal where the plaintiff is not injured and no miscarriage of justice results.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b321-9\" pgmap=\"321\">3. Appeal and error, \u00a7 572*\u2014when exceptions are necessary. Technical error in instructions is not available to a plaintiff who appeals, where exceptions to the giving of such instructions are not preserved in the record, and this rule is not abrogated by section 81 of the Practice Act of 1907; J. &amp; A. 8618.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b321-10\" pgmap=\"321\">4.

Evidence, \u00a7 457*-\u2014when evidence given at a former trial is proper. Admission of questions and answers made by plaintiff\u2019s witnesses at a former trial or mistrial, held harmless, since such evidence was proper if variant; and if its existence was not admitted by the witnesses, and if the evidence was identical, or its giving was admitted, the error in admitting it could not have prejudiced the jury.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b321-13\" pgmap=\"321(25) 322(60)\">7.
