A second cause of action is contained in the petition, in which plaintiff sets up a mechanic\u2019s lien on certain real estate belonging to Huberty to secure the account referred to. The answer of defendant denies the averments of the petition, and then alleges that on August 9, 19\u00d35, \u201cHe entered into a written agreement with plaintiff whereby he guaranteed the account of H. G. Schmitt, who was then under contract with this defendant for the erection of a certain building on the premises described in the petition, limiting his guarantee to the amount of $3,844, which was the original estimate for the lumber and which was all he agreed to pay.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b133-9\">\u201cSaid defendant states that he has paid plaintiff the aforesaid sum of $3,844. That he never con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>tracted with them- for lumber other than his agreement to guarantee the account of said Schmitt who purchased said lumber and to whom all of said lumber was delivered.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b134-4\">The cause was tried to a jury and at the conclusion of the plaintiff\u2019s evidence the court on motion of defendant Huberty directed the jury to return a verdict in his favor. Judgment on this verdict was affirmed by the circuit court and this proceeding is brought to reverse the judgments of the courts below.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b134-5\">Other pertinent facts are stated in the opinion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b134-6\"><em>Messrs.

If the meaning of a written statement is clear, effect must be given to that meaning even <em>though </em>the parties intended something else. 2 Parsons on Contracts (9 ed.), 656; <em>Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Lane, </em>59 Ohio St., 307; <em>Felter </em>v. <em>Weybright, </em>8 Ohio, 167; <em>McCoy </em>v. <em>Bixbee, 6 </em>Ohio, 310; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Hankins, </em>1 Cin., 449, 27 Ohio St., 371; <em>Coal Co. </em>v. <em>Mining Co., </em>40 Ohio St., 559; <em>Wolfe </em>v. <em>Scarborough, </em>2 Ohio St., 362; <em>Railroad Co. </em>v. <em>Reid, 6 O. </em>D., 273; <em>Day </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>2 Ohio, 345.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b134-8\">A special provision will override a general only where the two cannot stand together. <em>Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>Roost, </em>55 Ohio St., 581. To construe these words as a limitation of liability completely nullifies the words \u201cI will pay you for <em>all </em>lumber\u201d in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>the second line of the agreement and in the last line of the agreement. The two cannot stand together under this construction. Again this contract should be construed with reference to its object and as an- entirety and accordingly the whole contract must be considered in endeavoring to get at the intention of the parties even though the object of the inquiry be the meaning of a doubtful isolated clause. <em>Railway Co. </em>v. <em>Reid, </em>6 O.

G. Schmitt in erecting a building on your property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-8\">\u201cWe thank you for this letter as it puts the matter in a shape which is very satisfactory to us.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-9\">\u201cYours truly,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-10\">\u201c(Signed) The Mills-Gray-Carleton Co.,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-11\">\u201cBy C. H. Carleton. <em>President.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-12\">The contention of the plaintiff is, that by the contract thus made, Huberty became liable to pay plaintiff for all of the lumber furnished by it which was used in construction of the building. While the defendant contends that his liability was conclusively limited to the sum of $3,844.00, and that for any other or additional material, plaintiff would have to look to the contractor, Schmitt.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-13\">The testimony offered by plaintiff showed that as the work progressed certain changes were ordered by Huberty in the construction of the building. These required additional lumber and the reworking of some of the lumber covered by the estimate referred to. Some of the lumber covered by the estimate was not needed and was not delivered. From time to time Huberty made payments to plaintiff, and when these payments amounted to $3,844.00 which w\u00e1s after all of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>material had been delivered, he refused to make any further payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">The total value of the lumber furnished by plaintiff, which was used in the construction of the building, was $344.51 in excess of the amount which defendant paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">Testimony was tendered by plaintiff tending to show that extras were ordered by Huberty himself and that statements were rendered by plaintiff to him as the work progressed for the material furnished, the bills for material which was in addition, to that originally estimated being marked \u201cextra.\u201d That Huberty made no objection to any of these charges until after the material was furnished.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">The courts below sustained the contention of defendant that his liability was conclusively limited to the amount stated in his letter of August 9, 1905, and that the subsequent matters referred to did not change or add to that limit.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-9\">The letter of defendant of August 9th, opens with the explicit statement, \u201cYou can charge to my account and I will pay you for all lumber delivered to H. G. Schmitt for use in \u2022 construction of building on my lots,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-10\">The concluding sentence is the promise: \u201cI will pay you on or before the 10th of each month, * * * for all lumber delivered and accepted the preceding month.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b138-11\">This language is not uncertain or ambiguous, and leaves no room for discussion as to its meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-12\">The contract must be construed with reference to its object and as one entire contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>It will be observed that the material was to be charged to account of Huberty, himself, and the promise was to pay for all lumber delivered.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\">The object to be \u25a0 accomplished as expressed in the contract was the construction of the building, in which the material was to be used. It is a matter of common knowledge that few, if any, buildings are carried to completion without changes which either .increase or.diminish the requirements of material.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">But it is claimed that the clause, \u201clumber to be delivered and charged on basis your estimate of August 4th, amounting to $3,844.00,\u201d is conclusive in its legal effect and cuts down the comprehensive terms in the rest of the letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">The word \u201cestimate\u201d is defined in Webster\u2019s Dictionary as follows: \u201cA <em>rough </em>or <em>approximate </em>calculation, as an estimate of the cost of a building or the quantity of water in a pond.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">The use of the word \u201cestimate\u201d in this contract taken in its ordinary meaning and import, excludes the idea of an exact detailed <em>schedule </em>or <em>list </em>of material which schedule or list was by the agreement not to be increased or diminished as the building progressed. On the contrary, the use of the word \u201cestimate,\u201d in connection with the other language of the cpntract, and the object to be accomplished, clearly leads to the conclusion that the basis referred to in the contract, on which the amount of $3,844.00 was arrived at, was an <em>approximate </em>calculation or estimate of the lumber required and which might be altered in the carrying out of the work.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>This construction harmonizes and gives effect to the entire instrument, a result enjoined by familiar rules. -</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">We are strengthened in this view by the conduct of the parties subsequent to the making of the contract. As already shown, defendant ordered additional lumber himself; statements were rendered to him for all material furnished as the work progressed, and the bills for extra material were marked \u201cextra,\u201d all without objection from him.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">And even if the contract had explicitly limited Huberty\u2019s liability for lumber furnished on Schmitt\u2019s original order to the amount named, he would nevertheless be responsible for material which he personally purchased in addition thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">We think therefore that the common pleas court , erred in directing a verdict for defendant and the judgments of the courts below will be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-9\">\n<em>Judgments reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b140-10\">Spear, C.
