Baldinger and Frederick D. Bal* dinger, a minor. The object of the action was to have the court declare fraudulent as. against creditors of A. F. Baldinger, deceased, certain assignments made by him of . policies of life insurance issued on his life by defendant life insurance company and assigned by him to his wife, Emma C. Baldinger,\u2019and his minor son, Frederick D. Baldinger, and to secure the application of the proceeds of said policy to the payment of a debt due the plaintiffs, apd to .the debts of the other creditors of said B\u00e1ldinger, deceased.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b54-10\">The petition averred the indebtedness of A. F, Baldinger to Rebecca J. Price, which indebtedness was evidenced by a promissory note dated July 23, 1896, calling for three thousand dollars with interest, and signed by A- F. Baldinger.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b54-11\">\u2022 It further averred the death of Rebecca J. Price and the terms of her will, by' which the plaintiffs i\u00f1' .error were made sole beneficiaries, and the assignment by her executor of this note to these plaintiffs in error as a distribution to them in kind of pkrt of the estate of said Rebecca\u2019J. Price.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b55-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>It further avers the issuing of the policies to A. F. Baldinger, and that while he was still in-' debted upon this note, and no part thereof having been paid, he assigned said policies to Emma C. Baldinger and Frederick D. Baldinger, a minor, under the age of.fourteen years; that at the date of said assignments of said policies that A. F. Baldinger was wholly insolvent and had not sufficient property aside fro'm these policies to pay and discharge his indebtedness, and at the date of his death said Baldinger had no property or estate whatever aside from said policies and said assignment of said policies was wholly without consideration and in fraud of the rights of the plaintiffs and other creditors of said A. F. Baldinger, and prayed that said assignment of said' policy may be held and decreed to be fraudulent and the same set aside and held for naught, and for such other and further relief to which they might be found to be entitled.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b55-4\">The Equitable Life Insurance Compaq paid into court the sum of ten thousand dollars, being the sum of the three policies issued by it on the life of A. F. Baldinger and was dismissed from the action. Emma *C. Baldinger was appointed administratrix of the estate of A. F. Baldinger and made a party defendant in her representative capacity.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b55-5\">Emma C. Baldinger filed a general demurrer to the plaintiffs\u2019 petition, which demurrer was overruled by the common pleas court, and she thereupon filed an answer, and also answered in her representative capacity as the administratrix of the estate of A. F. Baldinger. Upon the issues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>joined between the plaintiffs and Emma C. Baldinger a decree was rendered by the common pleas court in favor of plaintiffs as to part of said policies and in favor of Emma C. Baldinger as to others. The- plaintiffs, and Emma C. Baldinger both appealed from this judgment of the common pleas court. The two appeals were consolidated in the circuit court and that court sustained the general demurrer of Emma C. Baldinger to the plaintiffs\u2019 petition, and the plaintiffs not desiring to amend or further plead, the petition was dismissed and judgment rendered against the plaintiffs for costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b56-6\">It was suggested upon oral argument of this cause that this transfer was made to Emma C. Baldinger, wife of A. F. Baldinger, and now his widow, and that Frederick D. Baldinger was not one of the assignees and that this petition should be considered the same as if his name did not appear therein.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b56-7\"><em>Messrs.

The court pointed out that the language in said amended Section 6343 is not stronger than that employed in the Statute of Frauds (Section 4196, Revised Statutes), and that the latter section had been held since the decision of <em>Burgett </em>v. <em>Burgett, </em>1 Ohio, 469, to have no application to sales made to innocent purchasers for value.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b57-5\">' The relief sought, and to which plaintiffs are entitled, if entitled to any relief, was not the surrender value of the policies at the time of the fraudulent conveyance, but their value at the time suit was brought. These life insurance policies were simply securities for money, dioses in action, and subject to every rule of-property known to the law. Ah assignment, fraudulent as to creditors, passed no title as against them. The policies always remained the property of Baldinger for the purpose of satisfying his pre-existing debts: whether the plaintiffs shall have relief depends not on the value at the time of the conveyance, but on whether the amount they show themselves entitled to recover in the action merits to be dignified by judicial consideration. <em>Savings Bank </em>v. <em>McLean, </em>84 Mich., 625; <em>Appeal of Elliott\u2019s Exrs., </em>50 Pa.

If they have no cash value, they remain the property of the bankrupt. Creditors cannot continue them in force, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>thus gamble on the life of the debtor. 1 Remington on Bankruptcy, Sec. 1012; 2 Moore on Fraudulent Conveyances, 1190.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b59-4\">The petition shows on its face that the proceeds of the policies are exempt from the claims of creditors.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b59-5\">The courts generally hold that statutes exempting life insurance are of the same nature as exemption laws generally, and are to be liberally construed, and we submit that under a liberal construction of these statutes, the assignment of a policy of insurance by the husband to his wife is \u201ceffecting an insurance on his life\u201d within the meaning of these statutes. If the deceased had surrendered his policies and had obtained new ones, making the wife the beneficiary, there could be no doubt that she would have been entitled to the insurance under Section 3628; and we can see no reason tvhy such a proceeding would be necessary in order to give the wife the benefit of the insurance; and it has been held that the assignment of a policy under the circumstances shown in this petition, is effecting insurance for the benefit of the wife, within the .meaning of exemption laws similar to ours. <em>Cole </em>v. <em>Marple, </em>98 Ill., 58; <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Wortham, </em>95 Tenn., 505; <em>Morehead\u2019s Admr. </em>v. <em>Mayfield, </em>109 Ky., 51, 58 S.

Baldinger to the plaintiffs' petition presents two questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\"><bracketnum>1.</bracketnum> Is it necessary to aver in a petition filed for the purpose of setting aside a sale or transfer claimed to be in fraud of creditors that the person or persons to whom the sale, conveyance, transfer, mortgage or assignment is made in violation of the provisions of Section 6343, Revised Statutes, as amended, 1902, knew of the fraudulent intent on the part of the debtor or debtors?</p>\n<p id=\"b60-8\"><bracketnum>2.</bracketnum> Do the provisions of Sections 3628 and 3629, Revised Statutes of Ohio, permit a transfer to a wife of a policy of insurance then in force on the life of the husband, the husband at the time of making the transfer being insolvent.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-9\">It would appear that Section 6343 as amended May 12, 1902, is sufficient answer to the first proposition. The presumption is, that every amendment of a statute is made to effect some purpose. That purpose may be either to add new provisions and conditions to the section as it then stands, or for the purpose of making plain the meaning and intent thereof. Whether this amendment changes the construction of the statute or simply makes its construction plain, is of little importance, the result must be the same, and every person seeking \u25a0 to avail himself of the provisions of this section mtist by his- pleading and proof bring himself within the provisions of this statute, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>including, as a matter of course, the amendment of May 12, 1902, which is as follows: \u201cProvided,however, that the provisions of this section shall, not apply unless the person or persons to whom such sale, conveyance, transfer, mortgage or assignment be made knew of such fraudulent intent on the part of such debtor or debtors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b61-4\">This provision of the section as it now stands would require an averment in the petition that the person making such purchase, or receiving such conveyance, transfer, mortgage or assignment knew of such fraudulent intent on the part of such debtor or debtors at the time of the transaction complained of.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">It would also appear that Section 3628 and Section 3629, Revised Statutes, construed together sufficiently answer the second question presented; by the demurrer. It would seem to be the policy of the law, not only to permit, but to encourage-every husband to provide by insurance upon his life for the maintenance and support of his widow and children after his death. At the same time the law protects his creditors to the extent of the funds actually diverted from his estate by reason of the procuring and keeping in effect such insurance. It would not appear that the creditor ' could be injured, delayed or defrauded beyond the amount of money actually expended in the purchase of this insurance. A debtor is under no legal obligation to insure his life for the benefit of his creditors. All that the law requires of him is that the property and means of which he is possessed, saving and excepting certain property-exempt by law from execution, shall be honestly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>applied to the payment of his debts, and he is not permitted to give \u00a3\u00a1,way that which in justice belongs to his creditors. So that when the law provides for the return to his estate of the money used in the purchase of this insurance, it gives to the creditor everything he is entitled to have, or could have reached by any process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">The same reasoning equally applies to the assignment to the wife of a policy then in forpe, for there is no provision requiring the debtor to keep that policy in force or to pay any further premiums thereon. The creditor cannot reach the policy by any process of law. It would only become available to his estate upon the death of the insured, then of course it would be applicable to the payment of his debts. But the possibilities of it ever becoming assets of his estate are so remote and so dependent entirely upon the will and the pleasure of the debtor, and not upon any legal obligation that he owes to his creditors to keep the insurance in force until his death, that the assignment of the same to his wife cannot be held to be an assignment in fraud of creditors nor could such assignment in any way, manner or form hinder or delay his creditors in the collection of their debt for there is no process known to the law that could reach the proceeds of this policy until by the terms of the policy itself it becomes an absolute obligation on the part of the insurance company to pay. The proposition that the failure of the insured to keep this policy of insurance in force by the annual payment of dues would be in fraud of creditors, and hinder and delay creditors, is just as tenable as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>proposition that they have been defrauded, hindered and delayed by the assignment of the same to his wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\">The statute under consideration is even broader than above stated, for it also provides that if any person, other than the husband, either effects or transfers insurance upon his life to a married woman, that such insurance cannot be reached either by the person effecting the insurance on his own life in her behalf, or transferring the same to her after it has been effected, nor can it be reached by his creditors. From these statutes it would clearly appear that the only relief the creditor could have, is that provided in Section 3628, Revised Statutes of Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b63-6\">Spear, C.
