In the few cases in which fhws regulating bulk sales have been held unconstitutional, the question of constitutionality has almost invariably turned upon the extent and harshness of the provisions of the particular law, rather than on the general right to place some restrictions on such sales. <em>Block </em>v. <em>Schwartz, 27 </em>Utah, 387, 76 Pac.

Rep., 392.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b384-9\">In placing the burden of proceeding with evidence of good faith on the parties to the sale, the matter being one clearly within their knowledge, the present statute is in harmony with an established principle of evidence that underlies many <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>common law presumptions, as well as numerous statutory rules of evidence. This principle is, that when a particular fact lies peculiarly within the knowledge of one party, the other party should be relieved from the burden of proof of such fact, upon proof of certain preliminary facts which afford a basis for a presumption as to the existence of the main fact, in the absence of testimony from the persons having knowledge of the circumstances. Best on Evidence, Sec. 274; 1 Greenleaf on Evidence, Sec. 79; <em>Railroad Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>139 U. S., 560.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b385-4\">The supreme court of Ohio has several times upheld the validity of statutes prescribing rules of evidence, which cannot be distinguished, in principle, from the rule established by Section 6343, Revised Statutes. <em>Pennsylvania Co. </em>v. <em>McCann, </em>54 Ohio St., 10.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b385-5\">If we correctly understand the opinion of this court in <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Crawford, </em>the chief objection to the law there considered, and the one objection which rendered it clearly invalid, was that the formalities required were in some instances practically impossible of performance, and in all instances so numerous and difficult that the law amounted to a practical prohibition- of sales in bulk.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b385-6\">It jg evident that not one of the objections to the specific provisions of the former act, nor the principle on which such objections are based, <em>i. e., </em>that restrictions imposed under the guise of regulation must be reasonable, is applicable to the' present act.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b386-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>The present\u2019 act is not an amendment of' the former act, nor does it expressly repeal the former act. The former act was Section 4155-5, Revised Statutes, contained in the chapter on conveyances and incumbrances. The present act is an amendment of Section 6343, which relates to \u25a0fraudulent conveyances. This statute was held constitutional by this court in the case of <em>Bobilya </em>v. <em>Priddy, </em>68 Ohio St., 373.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b386-6\">The present law is not invalid as class legislation, but is, in every respect, a valid and constitutional enactment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b386-7\">No argument is needed to demonstrate that the law operates equally upon all who are in the same class, <em>i. e., </em>upon all who are the owners of stock, goods, wares and merchandise, and upon all who are the creditors of owners of stocks of goods, wares and merchandise'. The only question is whether the possession of stocks of goods, wares and merchandise is a reasonable basis for classification. The test by which the validity of this act must be ascertained is stated in the opinion in <em>Miller </em>v. Crawford, 70 Ohio St., 214.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b386-8\">The classification of traders and merchants 'as a distinct \u201cclass\u201d which is properly subject to special restrictions for the protection of its creditors has been recognized by legislation for more than 300 years. Statutes giving remedies against, merchants and traders which are not available against debtors in general', have existed 'since 1570. The English bankruptcy act (Act of 13 Eliz., 1570) limited its provisions as to who might be declared bankrupt to traders, merchants and dealers in money.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b387-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>At the date of the American Revolution the-English law exempted from its operation, \u201cevery-' body except traders, brokers and merchants, in general, those dealing in money and buying and selling.\u201d 1 Remington on Bankruptcy, 11. The United States law of 1800 was likewise limited to traders, merchants, underwriters and brokers. 1 Remington on Bankruptcy, 12. The Lower Canada bankruptcy act of 1869 applied to \u201ctraders\u201d only. <em>Harman </em>v. <em>Clarkson, </em>22 U. C. C. P., 291.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b387-4\">Where the validity of a law passed for a lawful purpose, such as the prevention of fraud, depends upon the reasonableness of a classification made by the law, the court will presume that the facts justify the classification made by the legislature in the absence of proof that the classification is unreasonable. <em>Marmet </em>v. <em>State, </em>45 Ohio St., 63; <em>State, ex rel., </em>v. <em>Trenton, </em>53 Atl. Rep., 202; <em>St. John </em>v. <em>New York, </em>201 U. S., 637.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b387-5\">We are unable to see why the same presumption should not be made in favor of the reasonableness of a classification adopted by the legislature, tha\u00a3 is universally made as to the reasonableness of rates of charge prescribed by law. <em>Cotting </em>v. <em>Stock Yards Co., </em>183 U. S., 79; <em>State </em>v. <em>Hanlon, 77 </em>Ohio St., 32.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b387-6\">The Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution is, at least, as strict in its prohibition of class legislation as the provisions of the Ohio Constitution. <em>State, ex rel., </em>v. <em>Ferris, </em>53 Ohio St., 314; <em>State </em>v. <em>Gilbert, </em>70 Ohio St., 242;</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b387-7\">That the classification made by the present law is not forbidden by the United States Constitution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>was expressly held by the supreme court of the United States in the recent case of <em>Lemieux </em>v. <em>Young, </em>211 U. S., 489.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b388-6\">The comparison of the classification created by this act with other classifications which have been sustained as reasonable by this court, should remove all doubt as to its validity. <em>Senior </em>v. <em>Ratterman, </em>44 Ohio St., 661; <em>Adler </em>v. <em>Whitbeck, </em>44 Ohio St., 574.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b388-7\">It seems to us that the supreme court of Illinois reasoned more convincingly in its decision in the case of <em>Booth </em>v. <em>People, </em>186 Ill., 43, 184 U. S., 425, than in the case of <em>Off &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Morehead, </em>235 Ill., 40, in which they held the bulk sales law unconstitutional. In the former case, the court held constitutional a statute' prohibiting grain option contracts, although no other option contracts were prohibited. <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>State, </em>77 Ohio St., 214.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b388-8\">The courts of Connecticut, Massachusetts, Michigan,\u2019 Minnesota, New York, Georgia, Kentucky, Maryland, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Washington and Wisconsin have held similar laws constitutional, and the decisions in Louisiana, Pennsylvania and New Jersey have enforced similar laws. <em>Walp </em>v. <em>Mooar, </em>76 Conn., 515; <em>Young </em>v. <em>Lemieux, 79 </em>Conn., 434; <em>Squire &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Tellier, </em>185 Mass., 18, 69 N.

Rep., 496.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b389-4\">We believe the only state which now holds a similar law unconstitutional is Illinois. The law held unconstitutional in Illinois imposed restrictions of the same general nature as the prior Ohio law. <em>Off &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Morehead, </em>235 Ill., 40, 85 N. E. Rep., 264.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b389-5\">We believe the reasoning of the court in this case is sufficiently answered by the previous portion of this brief. The decision also strikes us as somewhat inconsistent with the decision of the same court in <em>Booth </em>v. <em>People, supra, </em>and <em>Gage </em>v. <em>Caraher, </em>17 N. E. Rep., 777; <em>Meadowcroft </em>v. <em>People, </em>163 Ill., 56, 45 N. E. Rep., 305.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b389-6\"><em>Mr. William R. Stewart, </em>for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b389-7\">Under this statute, if is unimportant whether the vendor at the sale was solvent or insolvent; whether he acted in good faith or not; whether his stock was small or large; whether the sale was open or secret; whether the proceeds were to be given to his creditors or not, a purchaser could not buy, an owner could not sell, until the latter\u2019s declared intention to sell, describing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>property, and all the conditions of the sale were for seven days spread on the public records, where the. seller did business.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b390-6\">Such legislation, we submit, unreasonably interferes with the rig'ht to buy and sell. merchandise. It deprives the buyer and seller, even though they be of abundant means, of purchasing, selling or enjoying property. <em>Mugler </em>v. <em>Kansas, </em>123 U. S., 623.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b390-7\">The protection of the citizen in the equal enjoyment of personal freedom and private property are secured by our constitution in terms as broad as those which vest the legislative power in the general assembly. The power to destroy or substantially impair these rights is not included in the grant of legislative power, and a law purporting to be the exercise of legislative power, whether of the power of -taxation, or of trade regulation, or of protective legislation (often called police power), or of any other legislative power, is void if in effect it is a substantial impairment of these rights secured by the constitution against the operation of every manifestation of legislative power. <em>State </em>v. <em>Conlon, </em>65 Conn., 478; <em>State </em>v. <em>Insurance Co., </em>73 Conn., 255; <em>McKeon </em>v. <em>Railroad Co., </em>75 Conn., 343; <em>State </em>v. <em>McMahon, </em>76 Conn., 97; <em>State </em>v. <em>Feingold, 77 </em>Conn., 326; <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Crawford, </em>70 Ohio St., 207.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b390-8\">The defendant in error insists the amended statute interferes not only with' the liberty and property of the vendor, as stated, but that its pro-, visions are inexcusably oppressive upon the vendee, insomuch as the alleged protection of the vendor\u2019s creditors may, in a measure, appear publicly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>worthy, while, in his case there' appears no sufficient excuse or good reason for imposing a purchase prohibition that interferes and hinders him from trading with and lawfully acquiring from a retail dealer, property he could unrestrictedly acquire from any other person than a retail dealer. <em>In re Jacobs, </em>98 N. Y., 98; <em>People </em>v. <em>Marx, </em>99 N. Y., <em>377; People </em>v. <em>Gillson, </em>109 N. Y., 389; <em>State </em>v. <em>Goodwill, 33 </em>W. Va., 179, 6 L. R. A., 621.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b391-4\">The legislature may not, under the guise of protecting the public interest, arbitrarily interfere with private business or impose unusual or unnecessary restrictions upon lawful occupations. In other words, its determination as to what is a proper exercise of its police power is not final or conclusive, but is subject to the supervision of the courts. <em>Lawton </em>v. <em>Steele, </em>152 U. S., 133; <em>Colon </em>v. <em>Lisk, </em>153 N. Y., 188.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b391-5\">It does not appear that said amended statute is justified as a police regulation. This statute does not assume to be a remedy against fraudulent transfers of property, or occasion inquiry as to . whether the vendor or vendee were actuated by good or bad motives. Under its provisions the <em>bona \u00f1des </em>of the parties or their solvency is not regarded, the innocent and the wicked suffer \u2022 \u25a0equally. A statute such as this may possibly be\u2019 justified in point of morals as a police regulation, if it be' true that all sales of merchandise in bulk by retailers are probably or presumed fraudulent, and that the parties to such sales ordinarily intend to cheat their- creditors. \u2019In- this regard we know, however, of common knowledge, that only in a small percentage of such sales does actual fraud <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>exist. It is as unnecessary, therefore, as it is unjust, to put the seal of suspicion and condemnation on transfers of property that are in their essentials not probably or necessarily fraudulent. No legislative enactment 'can impute a crime under the guise of police power to any person whilst pursuing the exercise of a constitutional right. <em>People, ex rel., </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>157 N.

Rep., 22, 65 L. R. A., 308, decided by the supreme court of Utah on March 24, 1904, it was held that a statute prohibiting, under penalty, a merchant from \u25a0 disposing of his stock of goods in bulk, without notifying his creditors, was a violation of federal constitutional safeguards, and not justified by the police power. <em>Wynehamer </em>v. People, 13 N. Y., 378; <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Hart, </em>182 N. Y., 330; <em>State </em>v. <em>Loomis, </em>115 Mo., 307; <em>Allgeyer </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>165 U.

Such cases are <em>McDaniels </em>v. <em>Shoe Co., </em>30 Wash., 549, 60 L. R. A., 947; <em>Squire &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Tellier, 69 </em>N. E.

On behalf of the defendant it is insisted that that judgment is fully sustained by our decision in <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Crawford, </em>70 Ohio St., 214. Counsel' for the plaintiff in error call attention to manifest differences between this statute and its predecessor, which was denounced as unconstitutional in the case cited. The statute denounced in that case apparently gave no consideration either to the nature of legislative power or to the limitations which are placed upon its exercise. In that case it was pointed out that in view of the intricate provisions of the act sales in compliance with it would, in many cases, be entirely impracticable, and that the statute in effect would amount to a prohibition of such sales. The terms of the present <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>statute <em>go no </em>farther than to create a presumption that a sale in bulk, without giving the prescribed notice, is fraudulent, only placing upon the parties to the transaction, the burden of which vendors and purchasers are relieved in all other cases of proving a sale free from fraud. The statute does not define the character of the presumption intended by the act, whether it shall be <em>prima facie </em>or conclusive. If the difference is material in the present inquiry, as counsel seem to regard it, we should, in deference to the familiar doctrine that if of two permissible interpretations one would render a statute unconstitutional and the other would not, the latter should be adopted, accept the statement of plaintiffs'\u2019 counsel as correctly defining the character and scope of the presumption intended: \u201cThe provisions of Section 6343, Revised Statutes, that certain sales 'shall be presumed <em>to </em>be made with intent to hinder, delay or defraud creditors/ unless notice is filed as thereinafter provided, creates a rule of evidence. It renders admissible the fact that the vendor -has failed to file notice of a sale out of the ordinary course of business, as a fact from which the intent of the parties may be inferred, and places upon the defendant the burden of proceeding with evidence \u00f3f the actual intent after proof of the lack of notice has been introduced.\u201d The question then is, whether the guarantees of the Constitution respecting the equal rights of all to the enjoyment and use of property includes or excludes the rules of evidence and the presumptions by whose application <em>those </em>rights are practically preserved and enforced. This question is quite apart from that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>so much discusse\u2019d in the briefs and cases cited respecting the power of the general assembly to establish rules of evidence by statutes of general and equal operation. It would seem that the distinction in this respect upon which counsel for plaintiff insist is quite inconsistent with the nature and scope of these constitutional guaranties as they are set forth in <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Crawford. </em>Without repetition of anything that is there said, it is quite convenient to quote a pertinent statement of the nature of those guaranties from a writer whose views are received with general respect: \u201cIf the legislature should undertake to provide that persons following some specified, lawful trade or employment, should not have capacity to make contracts, or to receive conveyances or to build such houses as others were allowed to erect, or in any way to make such use of their property as was permissible to others, it can scarcely be doubted that the act would transcend the due/ bounds of legislative power, even though no express constitutional provision could be pointed out with which it would come in conflict.\u201d Cooley Const. Limitations. Although counsel point out the suggested differences between the provisions of the two statutes, they do not inform us of any difference in the constitutional view between a provision that a sale without compliance with the statute should be fraudulent absolutely, and one which upon the same condition shall be <em>prima facie </em>evidence that the sale is fraudulent, thus devolving upon the parties in the limited case to which the statute applies, a burden for the protection of their property rights of which all others are relieved. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>pertinent effect of the constitutional provisions referred to is to ordain equality of rights in property. In contemplation of this act, where the subject of the contract of sale is the limited property described by the terms of the act, the sale is to be presumed to be fraudulent, while in all other 'cases the sale is presumed to be unaffected by fraud. Counsel have not communicated to us any view upon which we could sustain the proposition that laws can be equal which accord to one, without proof, rights which they accord to others only upon proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">Not placing ultimate reliance upon the suggested differences between the two statutes, counsel insist that there is a valid basis for discrimination to be found in the ease with which stocks of merchandise may be purchased upon credit and then sold and transferred to the prejudice of the original vendor. Careful attention to what has been said upon this point has failed to develop in our minds the perception of any difference in this respect between sales where the subject, upon one hand, is merchandise, and on the other, flocks, herds or machinery, or the capital stock of corporations, or any others of the large list of the subjects of property. The case in this respect does not differ from <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Crawford, </em>and it is not deemed necessary to add further to what was said in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">Finally, we are admonished that acts of the general assembly should not be adjudged unconstitutional upon doubtful considerations. Not since <em>The State, ex rel. Knisely, </em>v. <em>Jones et al., </em>66 Ohio St., 453, has the admonition been urged upon our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>attention with so much eloquence and impressiveness. Since the beginning of constitutional government, according to the American understanding of that phrase, the courts h\u00e1ve so admonished themselves, and the admonition has become an established rule of interpretation. It was founded upon the observation that members of the lawmaking department of the government take the same oath as do those of the judicial department to heed the provisions of the constitution, and the further observation that they were mindful of their oath. The rule continues as expressive of becoming deference to a coordinate department of the government. But nothing would be more fatal to the efficient exercise of the judicial function in constitutional government than to invoke, for the purpose of raising doubts, a rule devised for solving them. In that respect it is quite like the familiar rule respecting reasonable doubts as a test of the probative effect of evidence in criminal cases. He has been an inattentive student of the history of the state who thinks that public or private injury has resulted from a too devoted adherence to the provisions of the organic law. It seems to us that this act very plainly from its nature, takes its place among the enactments which constitute the promoted legislation of the state not suggested by comprehensive views of the rights and interests of all the people, but furthered by those who desire to obtain advantages not accorded by the general law.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b397-5\">Spear, C.
