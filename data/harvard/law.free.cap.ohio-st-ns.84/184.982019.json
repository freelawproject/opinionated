On the 14th day of November, 1904, Y. &amp; L., being indebted to the Memphis National Bank on overdraft in -the sum of $436.55, sent said note endorsed in blank to that bank with which they had an account, requesting it to discount it and place the proceeds to their account, all of which was done, the bank having no knowledge of the instructions by the maker to Y. &amp; L., thus extinguishing the overdraft and leaving a credit balance of $491.85 in favor of Y. &amp; L.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b236-8\">On the 17th day of November, 1904, Y. &amp; L. drew their check against the credit balance for the sum of $500, which was honored by the bank, leaving their account overdrawn in the sum of $8.15, and shortly thereafter, the account was closed and Y. &amp; L. ceased business with the bank.

A promissory note, or other negotiable instrument received in payment of a pre-existing debt, is taken for a valid consideration. <em>Carlisle </em>v. <em>Wishart, </em>11 Ohio, 172; Section 3171x, Revised Statutes; <em>Swift </em>v. <em>Tyson, </em>16 Pet., 1.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b244-9\">2. The discount of a negotiable paper by a bank at the request of a customer and placing the proceeds to his credit, makes the bank a <em>bona fide </em>holder for value. <em>Gordon </em>v. <em>Kearney, </em>17 Ohio, 572.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b244-10\">3. Where one of two persons must sustain a loss, he shall be the sufferer who placed the means of imposition in the hands of the wrong-doer. Between two innocent persons, he shall suffer who incautiously g'ave the means of obtaining the false credit. <em>Gordon </em>v. <em>Kearney, supra, </em>576.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b244-11\">4. The extension of time constitutes a sufficient consideration for a note. <em>Holzworth </em>v. <em>Koch, 26 </em>Ohio St., 33.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b245-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>5. An agreement to forbear suit until the maturity of the note will be presumed from the acceptance thereof. <em>Holzworth </em>v. <em>Koch, supra.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b245-6\"><em>6.

The foregoing confession is no more than the facts compel, and tends to an easy solution of the contention, that the bank was not justified in applying proceeds of the discount to extinguish the overdraft of $436.55.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">We find that the note in question was payable to order of Young &amp; Lane \u2014 negotiable in form and the bank purchased it from the payees in the usual course of business, who endorsed it in blank, thus vesting the legal title in the bank. Instead of paying the proceeds to Young &amp; Lane over the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>counter, the bank, at their request placed the same to their credit. It appears that Young &amp; Lane had discounted other paper at this bank, not only-on this occasion, but had been transacting business with it previously, so that a regular account current existed between it and Young &amp; Lane when this purchase was made. It so happened that they owed the bank $436.55 as an'overdraft on their account, and all the proceeds were placed to their credit, and after extinguishing or satisfying such overdraft, the bank owed Young &amp; Lane on the account $491.85, or, in other words, they had a credit balance of that amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">As before stated, by the check of November 17th, for $500 drawn on and honored by this bank, they exhausted the credit balance, which left the account again overdrawn in the sum of $8.15.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">It being conceded that the bank was 'justified in honoring this check, because it had no knowledge of the mere agency of Young &amp; Lane, and no knowledge of any relations they sustained to The Hamilton Machine Tool Co., maker of the note, except that shown by the note 'itself, it must also be conceded, that the bank acted in good faith, for it appears in the evidence of its cashier, and not controverted, that Young &amp; Lane, in the course of their dealings with the bank, on previous occasions had overdrawn their account, which they subsequently made good, as they did in the discounting of this note \u2014 ostensibly their own note \u2014 and the bank acted upon it as their note.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">In respect to extinguishing the overdraft, it is urged, that while the bank was ignorant of the agency of Young &amp; Lane for the maker of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>note, it used the proceeds of the discount in satisfying a pre-existing debt, which they could not do with funds actually belonging to the principal\u2014 the maker of the note. Is this position sound? It is entirely clear, and we think it cannot be controverted, that in discounting the note for Young &amp; Lane, the bank became its absolute owner and that too in good faith. It was sent from Hamilton, Ohio, to. Young &amp; Lane, at Knoxville, Tennessee, that they might get it discounted. To get it discounted would, or might, necessitate its sale. They were entrusted with such use of the note as would bring about its discount, of course for the benefit of the maker, but of the latter it is conceded the bank had no knowledge, and there was nothing on the face of the note, or in the negotiation, to excite suspicion or put the bank on inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">Therefore, Young &amp; Lane were authorized to hold themselves out to anyone who would discount the paper, as its absolute owners, as thev were the payees named therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">But it was urged in argument that, as to this overdraft, the bank would not be the loser, if the court should credit its amount on the judgment in this case, for the reason that it has recourse on Young &amp; Lane for that overdraft. The facts are against this \u25a0 claim. E. B. McHenry, who was cashier of the Memphis bank, testified to his acquaintance with Young &amp; Lane, especially Lane, and that \u201cin May, I think it was the 24th or 25th of May, perhaps, 1904, the firm of-Young &amp; Lane opened an account with the bank and did business there, was there for some time afterwards,, making <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>deposits and having notes discounted, and checking on their account, just as an ordinary customer would do.\u201d He also states that this bank had previously discounted two or three notes made payable to Young &amp; Lane by The Hamilton Machine Tool Co., and that they were made payable at the same bank in Cincinnati mentioned in note referred to in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">The rate of discount was six per cent., and he states that the bank paid full value less this discount.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">Another important fact in the record, is that but little if any business was transacted with this bank by Young &amp; Lane after the purchase of the note, and certainly none after the bank became aware that anything was wrong or irregular between them and their principal. This concern, Young &amp; Lane, resided at Knoxville, Tennessee, and sent the note with letter to the bank with instructions quoted above. After this purchase, and in January, 1905 \u2014 after they had overdrawn their account by the check of November 17, 1904\u2014 business between them and the bank ceased. \u2022 It has not been pointed out by counsel, and we do not know, how the bank could open up its account with Young &amp; Lane \u2014 restore the charge of $436.55 overdraft \u2014 and pursue them for that amount. It had been paid and so entered on its books and the account closed, so far as business was concerned. By application of part of the proceeds to extinguishing the overdraft, the bank necessarily changed its position from that of a creditor to that of a debtor for the credit balance. This was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>wiped out by check later, which admittedly was properly honored by the bank. . The bank had a claim for $8.15 overdraft and that was all. The former overdraft had been paid and defense of pajmient could have been sustained had the bank sued for it. It had no right of action against them.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">We are convinced that the bank believed and had a right to believe the note belonged to Young &amp; Lane, having purchased it before maturity and in good faith, and it should not suffer because the apparent owner\u2019s u.sed part of the proceeds to pay their debt to the bank. Neither fair play nor any maxim of equity requires such result.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">The authorities relied on by counsel for the parties are collected in the briefs, and we have attempted to state the legal conclusion that should be drawn from undisputed facts, and we therefore affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b252-9\">Davis, Si-iaucic, Johnson and Donahue, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
