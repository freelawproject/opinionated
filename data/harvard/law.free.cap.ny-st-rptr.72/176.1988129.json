Judgment\u2014Opening default\u2014Reasonable condition.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b208-7\">Requiring defendant to deposit money with the clerk as a condition for opening a default is a reasonable exercise of the court\u2019s discretionary power where, to grant the defendant\u2019s motion without requiring security of some sort to satisfy the plaintiff\u2019s claims, costs, disbursements, etc., would, in effect, defeat him in the collection of his claim and give other execution creditors a preference over him.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b208-8\">8.
