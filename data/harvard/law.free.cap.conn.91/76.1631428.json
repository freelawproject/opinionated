As to her personal estate, they either took it absolutely by the marriage, or, after 1859, were entitled to its possession and enjoyment as statutory trustees.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">This condition no longer prevails as to persons married after April 20th, 1877; but we are not permitted to assume that the original intent of this statute has been changed, because the Act of 1877 (now \u00a7 391 of the General Statutes) defining the rights of surviving husbands and wives married after that date in the estate of a deceased consort, preserves the same distinction and expresses it definitely. After defining the rights of a surviving wife in her husband\u2019s estate, it provides that \u201cthe wife shall, also, when, in the opinion of the Court of Probate, it is necessary, be allowed a reasonable sum from the estate of the husband, for her support and for the support of her family during the settlement of his estate\u201d; while in defining the rights of a surviving husband no such provision for an allowance is made. Reading \u00a7\u00a7 359 and 391 together, no other conclusion is possible than that the widow alone is entitled to an allowance.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">The appellee Croke, the surviving husband, invokes the rule of construction expressed in \u00a7 1 of the General Statutes, that words imputing the masculine gender may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>be applied to females; but that will not authorize us to read the word widow as including widower.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">It is also contended that the word \u201cfamily\u201d includes th\u00e9 surviving husband, and, in connection with homestead and exemption laws, the word is often used to describe the whole group of persons living under the same roof with the paterfamilias, including both of the parents, the children, if any, and sometimes the servants. Sections 359 and 391, however, do not deal primarily with the group relation. They refer primarily to a condition of legal dependence. Hence they expressly authorize an allowance to the dependent parent and not to the other, and the disjunctive phrase \u201cwidow or family\u201d in \u00a7 359 indicates that the word \u201cfamily\u201d was not intended to include a surviving husband, but to include legal dependents other than the widow who lived under the same roof with the deceased, and answered to that general descriptive term.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">There is error, the judgment is set aside and the cause remanded with direction to enter judgment for the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">In this opinion Prentice, C. J., Thayer and Wheeler, Js., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b90-9\">Roraback, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AxX\">I concur in the result, but not in the reasons given by the majority of the court in reaching the conclusion that there is error in the present case. All of the cases unite upon this test, that where there is no dependency there can be no allowance for support. The record now before us does not show that the husband was financially helpless or in any way dependent upon his wife while living, or upon her estate after her decease, for his support. For this reason, and this alone, I think that there was error in making the allowance in question.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
