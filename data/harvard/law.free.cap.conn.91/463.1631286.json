Albert Hooker, late of Berlin, to pay over to the plaintiff, a life tenant, $1,000 from the principal of said estate, taken to and tried by the Superior Court in Hartford County, <em>Case, J.; </em>facts found and judgment rendered in favor of the plaintiff, setting aside the decree of the Court of Probate, from which the defendant appealed.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"ALx\">\n<em>No error.</em>\n</disposition>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b476-12\">Mr. Frisbie, the trustee under the will of N. Albert Hooker, filed his account as such trustee with the Court of Probate for the district of Berlin, and petitioned the court, at the request of Mrs. Anna N. Hooker, for authority to pay over to her the sum of $1,000 out of the principal fund of the trust estate. The court denied the petition, and Mrs. Hooker took her appeal from the decree of denial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b476-13\">Upon the trial it appeared that Mr. Hooker left a will, which was duly probated, and left surviving him his widow, the plaintiff, a son Henry, and a daughter Caroline, the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b476-14\">The will of Mr. Hooker, in clause two, provided as follows: \u201cI give and bequeath to my wife Anna N. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>Hooker the use income and improvement of all the rest, residue and remainder of my estate, including real, personal and mixed, so long as she remains my widow.

In case the wife should not remarry, all that remained of the estate was given to his children.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b477-6\">Upon the settlement of the estate there was set out to Mrs. Hooker as life tenant property of the appraised value of $35,996.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b477-7\">Mrs. Hooker qualified as trustee and acted as such up to April 14th, 1914, when she resigned, and Mr. Frisbie was appointed and qualified as such trustee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b477-8\">Mr. Frisbie filed his account May 1st, 1915, and at the request of Mrs. Hooker petitioned the Court of Probate for authority to pay to her $1,000 because the income had not been sufficient for her comfortable maintenance and support. Mrs. Hooker has never remarried.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b477-9\">The personal estate had been increased by reason of the care, skill and self-denial of Mrs. Hooker, from $26,200 to over $130,000.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b477-10\">In his lifetime Mr. Hooker had a yearly income of nearly $8,000, and maintained a summer home in Berlin, with two servants, and horses, carriages and a coachman, and in the winter occupied comfortable apartments in New Haven in a boarding-house.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b477-11\">Since his death, Mrs. Hooker has lived in the winter in one room on the fourth floor of this boarding-house, and in the summer in the Berlin home, keeping one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>servant and no horses. In the summer her expenses have averaged $200, and in the winter $150, a month. Mrs. Hooker has no other income except $200 a year. She is in her sixty-third year, her health is impaired, and she is under large expense on account of medical advice. The doctors have advised a change of climate, and that she do not go up and down stairs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b478-6\">Mrs. Hooker, instead of selling the stocks, retained them, and by living prudently paid the expenses of the estate and its debts out of the income.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b478-7\">During the year preceding May 1st, 1915, Mrs. Hooker was obliged to expend $800 for repairs on the barn, which expenditures were for the sole benefit of the remainder interests of the estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b478-8\">Mrs. Hooker desires said $1,000 to use in putting in a bathroom in the house and in otherwise improving it so that she may make it her home for the entire year, and also to partially repay her for the $800 expended upon the barn.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b478-9\">The income of the estate for the year preceding May 1st, 1915, was $2,407.79, and for the following year $2,892.46. The estate pays Mr. Frisbie $200 a year for his services, and has paid $500 for a surety bond, and $100 for legal expenses. Mrs. Hooker has at present unpaid a board bill of $500 and doctors\u2019 and other bills amounting to $350.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b478-10\">The court found that the application for $1,000 was made in good faith and is a reasonable request in view of all the circumstances.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b478-11\"><em>Samuel A.

The term \u201cnecessary,\u201d in a connection such as this, is a variable one, and restricted or enlarged by the surrounding circumstances. Applied to Mrs. Hooker, it meant all reasonable necessaries suitable to her situation and station in life, having especial reference to the fact that she would be the widow of Mr. Hooker.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">Concerning the provision of a will, \u201cShould it be necessary for their personal comfort to use any portion of said property,\u201d etc., we said: \u201cThe right to resort to the principal was founded on necessity and restricted by necessity,\u201d and meant, \u201cas in the case of the obligation of a husband to furnish necessaries for his wife.\u201d <em>Peckham </em>v. Lego, 57 Conn. 553-556, 19 Atl. 392. In <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Culver, </em>34 Conn. 403, 405, where a wife gave her husband a power of disposal \u201cif he should want for his support to sell any part or the whole for his maintenance,\u201d we held that \u201cthe sale is to be proportioned to the extent of the necessity.\u201d In <em>Little </em>v. <em>Geer, </em>69 Conn. 411, 415, 37 Atl. 1056, the codicil gave to a wife \u201cthe privilege of using as much of the principal as she may desire for her comfort and maintenance,\u201d and the will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>gave the executors power to sell the estate and use the avails for the proper and comfortable'maintenance and support of the wife in case the income \u201cbe insufficient for her comfortable and proper maintenance.\u201d We held that \u201cthe widow is confined to what she may require 'for her comfortable and proper maintenance and support.\u2019 \u201d In <em>Russell </em>v. <em>Hartley, </em>83 Conn. 655, 78 Atl. 320, the will provided: \u201cAnd if in the judgment of said trustee she shall need more than the income thereof, then I authorize my said trustee to pay over to her from time to time such portion of the principal of said trust as he may deem necessary for her comfortable support.\u201d We held that the trustee\u2019s \u201cauthority to pay over the principal is limited by the purpose named, viz: 'for her comfortable support.\u2019\u201d We further held that the widow might in her discretion appropriate so much of the income as was \u201creasonable for her support as stated in the will.\u201d And we had previously determined that reasonable support under those circumstances meant a maintenance in a manner suitable to her station and condition of life under the circumstances and situation presented in each case. We distinguished, in <em>Reed </em>v. <em>Reed, </em>80 Conn. 401, 409, 68 Atl. 849, that case from <em>Little </em>v. <em>Geer, </em>69 Conn. 411, 415, 37 Atl. 1056, and held that in the first case there was nothing in the will \u201cto indicate an intention to limit the honest discretion of the widow in taking from the principal whatever she might think necessary for her comfortable support, or to evince solicitude that something should be left for his collateral relatives,\u201d while in the latter case the contrary appeared.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">So long as Mrs. Hooker, as the life tenant, exercised a discretion within the law and confined her demand upon the principal to so much as might be necessary for the support of herself and her children, her discretion could not be interfered with. This discretion the testa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>tor gave her as the life tenant, and that disposition of the estate which he made will be the guide for the trustee, and for the court, when called upon to advise the trustee, or to pass upon his administration of the trust. And when Mrs. Hooker resigned as such trustee, her successor assumed the trust charged with the same duties and vested with the same power and discretion as his predecessor in the trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">When a trustee vested with a discretion of this character is about to violate his trust, or has already done so, the law furnishes relief to the remainder interest. The trustee is, unless the will otherwise provides, under bonds (General Statutes, \u00a7 311) \u201cto safely and properly keep such estate to be delivered to the person entitled to receive it on the determination of the life estate therein.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">The trustee of Mr. Hooker is bound to account annually to the Court of Probate for his trust. So must every testamentary trustee unless excused by the will creating the trust. General Statutes, \u00a7 383. At the accounting, parties in interest may question any item of the account and the court must determine which payments from the principal, if any, shall be allowed, and which disallowed; and its decision must conform to the rule long since adopted by us as to what will be necessary support for the widow and her children in the light of the circumstances present. We pointed out another remedy for the remainderman in <em>Little </em>v. <em>Geer, </em>69 Conn. 411, 415 (37 Atl. 1056): \u201cSo long,\u201d said Andrews, C. J., \u201cas the widow conducts reasonably and in good faith, the amount she may appropriate for her own support must be left to her own discretion. If, however, she should indulge in wastefulness, or should seek to appropriate to her own use more of the estate than is reasonable for her support as stated in the will, then she may be restrained by a court of equity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>on the complaint of any of the remaindermen.\u201d <em>Russell </em>v. <em>Hartley, </em>83 Conn. 655, 78 Atl. 320.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">It follows from what has been said that the conclusion of the trial court, that Mrs. Hooker is the sole judge of what is a sufficient support for herself and children, and its holding that the existence of a finding of necessity to authorize the use of any of the principal for the life tenant\u2019s support was not required by the will, were erroneous. But that the conclusion of the trial court that so long as Mrs. Hooker exercises a sound and honest discretion in her demand upon the principal for the support of herself and children the court could not deprive her of that discretionary power, was correct, if the support was confined to that which was reasonably necessary for her station and condition of life. So too, the court was correct in ruling that Mrs. Hooker retained her discretionary power after her resignation. And it was correct in determining that the use of the principal by Mrs. Hooker was not conditioned upon proof that the income was insufficient for her support.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">The trustee of the life estate was bound to pay over to Mrs. Hooker upon her application such part of the principal as was necessary to furnish her reasonable and comfortable support. He was not required to await an order of court, otherwise the very purpose of the testator might have been defeated and his widow been deprived of the continued support from all of his estate if its use became necessary during the pendency of the court application.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-8\">The trustee took the precaution to apply to the court for authority to comply with Mrs. Hooker\u2019s request for a payment of $1,000 from the principal. The Superior Court has, on this appeal from the Court of Probate, rendered its judgment authorizing this payment; and we are now called upon to determine whether such payment, or any part of it, was necessary for Mrs. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>Hooker\u2019s comfortable support, judging this by her station and condition in life.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">The life tenant is bound to maintain the real estate, including the buildings, in a reasonable condition. The repairs of the barn, so far as the finding shows, come under this head, that of ordinary repairs, and their cost cannot be met by payment from the principal.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">The bathroom will be a permanent addition to the house, and it would appear to be a reasonable expense for the trustee himself to incur out of the principal.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-8\">Upon the finding, the income from the estate has not been sufficient for Mrs. Hooker\u2019s support for the past two years, and she was at the time of her application in debt for necessaries to the amount of $850. Mrs. Hooker has not lived extravagantly or wastefully, but prudently and with reasonable economy. She is under medical care, and under the circumstances as detailed in the finding we think the trial court was correct in its conclusion that \"the application of said Anna N. Hooker for $1,000 from the principal fund of said estate was made in good faith and is a reasonable request in view of all the circumstances and was within her discretion as life tenant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b483-9\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-10\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
