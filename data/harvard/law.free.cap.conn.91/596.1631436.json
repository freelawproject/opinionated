J., Roraback, Wheeler, Beach and Shumway, Js.</p>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b608-11\">In an action for personal injuries, a verdict for the plaintiff based solely upon his testimony respecting his exercise of due care, which is not only improbable in itself but is directly contradicted by all four of the other witnesses of the accident, two of whom were called by the plaintiff, may properly be set aside by the trial court as an unreasonable conclusion of the jury.</headnotes>\n<otherdate data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b608-12\">Argued April 11th\u2014</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A3I\">decided June 1st, 1917.</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b608-13\">' Action to recover damages for personal injuries alleged to have been caused by the defendant\u2019s negligence, brought to the Court of Common Pleas in New Haven County and tried to the jury before <em>Simpson, J.; </em>verdict for the plaintiff for $150, which the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>set aside as against the evidence, and appeal by the plaintiff.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"AUZ\">\n<em>No error.</em>\n</disposition>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b609-6\"><em>Robert J.

That of the only other witnesses, who profess to have been present upon the scene of the accident, and observers of what transpired, while not fully in accord with each other, were alike inconsistent with the plaintiff\u2019s story and with the exercise by him of reasonable care. These witnesses were four in number: two produced on behalf of the plaintiff and two on behalf of the defendant. The plaintiff\u2019s case, in so far as the element of care on his part is concerned, stands entirely upon his own testimony. That testimony, in so far as it touched the matter of vital importance, bears such marks of improbability, and is so opposed to that of the other witnesses, that the trial judge was justified in holding that it was so overwhelmingly disproved and discredited that the verdict of the jury, based upon an acceptance of it, could not have been arrived at reasonably.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-10\">There is no error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
