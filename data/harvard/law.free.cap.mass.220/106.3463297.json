The evidence before the master was not before the Superior Court and so is not before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">The facts found by the master are in substance as follows: On November 17, 1909, the defendant Bragg made a written agreement with the plaintiff and his two sons to sell to them a piece of land in Greenfield \"known as the 'Leonard Farm\u2019\u201d which was therein bounded and described. The price was $1,300, $100 of which was paid at the making of the agreement and the balance was to be paid in monthly instalments. The plaintiff and his sons entered under that agreement and paid the sum of $675 toward the purchase money. About three years later (in the autumn of 1912) the plaintiff\u2019s sons surrendered their rights in the contract to their father who alone continued to live upon the farm. The plaintiff relinquished his rights under the old agreement on the making of \u201can entirely new oral contract\u201d which he made with the defendant Bragg. This new contract was afterwards reduced to writing. This writing was in these words: \u201cGreenfield, Mass., April 1,1913. Agreement between J W Bragg &amp; German Noyse Said Noyse agrees to Pay said Bragg $1100 dollars with interest from date for the Leonard place so called &amp; is to pay $25.00 each month untill paid in full also Insurance &amp; Taxes I witness thereof we have set our Hand &amp; Seal J W Bragg G. P. Noyes.\u201d The plaintiff continued to occupy the farm under the new contract. He made \u25a0payments under the new contract amounting to $200. In October, 1913, he offered to make payment of a $25 instalment. The defendant refused to accept the money. At that time the plaintiff was not in default in any payment called for by the contract. \u201cIn November 1913,\u201d the defendant conveyed the farm to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>Queenie L. Purrington, one of the defendants in this suit. Queenie L. Purrington was the wife of the defendant\u2019s son. She was a volunteer under her husband. Her husband (as the master found) took with full knowledge of the fact that there was an outstanding contract between the defendant and the plaintiff. In fact he had tried to buy the farm from the plaintiff and on the plaintiff refusing to sell it to him he undertook to get a conveyance from the defendant in fraud of the plaintiff\u2019s rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">The defendant demurred to the bill and filed a motion to dismiss. A final decree in favor of the plaintiff was entered in the Superior Court. By the final decree the demurrer was overruled, the motion to dismiss was disallowed and the plaintiff was given the relief he asked for/ The decree is set forth in the note.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>One only among the many objections made by the defendant is well taken. But there are two matters not objected to by him in which the decree is wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">1. The objection that the plaintiff had an action at law to recover damages fat breach of agreement does not deprive equity of its jurisdiction to compel specific performance of the contract. <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Newhall, </em>115 Mass. 244, relied upon by the defendant was decided before St. 1877, c. 178 (now R. L. c. 159, \u00a7 1) was enacted. St. 1877, c. 178 (now R. L. c. 159, \u00a7 1) was enacted to avoid the conclusion which the court was forced to adopt in <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Newhall </em>and similar cases. See <em>Dole </em>v. <em>Wooldredge, </em>135 Mass. 140; <em>Boston &amp; Maine Railroad </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>177 Mass. 230. But even in <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Newhall </em>the jurisdiction of the court to compel specific performance of a contract for sale of real estate was recognized. See <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Newhall, ubi supra, </em>at page 248.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">2. The plaintiff had a right to act upon the defendant\u2019s refusal to accept the payment which he tendered in October. It was not necessary after that for the plaintiff to go through the nugatory act of making a further tender.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">3. The allegations of the bill are not uncertain, vague and indefinite.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">4. It is not necessary in a bill to compel specific performance of a contract to convey real estate to set forth any special reason why the plaintiff is entitled to relief in equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-9\">5. The issue of the statute of frauds does not seem to have been in the mind of the master when he made his findings. If there had been direct evidence that the defendant did not own two parcels of land in Greenfield, one known as the \u201cLeonard Farm\u201d and the other known as the \u201cLeonard Place,\u201d there would have been no question as to the identification of the land covered by the agreement of April 1, 1913. <em>Harrigan </em>v. <em>Dodge, </em>200 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>357, 359. See cases collected in <em>Desmurais </em>v. <em>Taft, </em>210 Mass. 560. The \u201cLeonard Farm\u201d was fully described in the agreement of November 17, 1909. Taking the agreement of April 1, 1913, in connection with the agreement of November 17, 1909, and the transactions between the defendant and the plaintiff found by the master, we are of opinion that the only fair inference from the facts stated in the report is that the \u201cLeonard Place\u201d referred to in the agreement of April 1, 1913, is the \u201cLeonard Farm\u201d referred to in the agreement of November 17, 1909. It follows that the statute of frauds was complied with.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">6. There were no loches on the part of the plaintiff. The master in his findings did not state the day in October when the tender refused by the defendant was made by the plaintiff. In his brief the defendant assumed that it was made on the thirty-first day of that month. The fraudulent conveyance to the defendant Purrington was made some time \u201cin November.\u201d It is stated that the deed to her was dated November 1. The defendant Purrington undertook to enforce her rights under that deed by suing out a writ to obtain possession of the premises on December 1, 1913. The present bill was filed on December 6, 1913. On these facts the plaintiff seems to have acted with reasonable promptitude. What is of more importance, no rights of any party intervened.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">7. A motion to dismiss a bill in equity is not the proper way of taking the objection that necessary parties defendant have not been joined. In addition to that the objection of non-joinder of necessary parties defendant in the case at bar was cured by the second amendment to the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">8. The final decree is wrong in depriving the defendant of the right which he had under the contract to leave his money at interest at six per cent until the purchase price was paid in monthly instalments of $25 a month.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">9. The amount of the taxes paid by the defendant Bragg for the year 1913 should have been stated in the decree and the new decree should state the amount of taxes for that year and those for the year 1914. It was proper in the decree to provide that papers should be passed at the registry of deeds when the transaction was closed by payment of the final sum due. The provision that the defendant should give forty-eight hours\u2019 notice is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>unreasonable. These provisions are not in conflict with the contract of April 1, 1913, but are proper in working out the rights of the parties under that contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-3\">10. There are two matters in the decree not objected to by the defendant which are prejudicial to him. He has taken an appeal from the decree and we think that they should be corrected.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">Under the agreement of April 1, 1913, the plaintiff is entitled to a deed which shall convey to him a good title to the \u201cLeonard Place\u201d subject to the rights of the New England Telephone and Telegraph Company which have been acquired by that company since the agreement and for which the plaintiff has accepted payment. The decree requires the defendant to give the plaintiff a warranty deed. In that respect it is wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">11. The other provision of the decree not objected to by the defendant but which is prejudicial to his rights is that the defendant is entitled to interest at six per cent upon the purchase money until it is finally paid in full and not merely six per cent \u201cto the date of the bringing of this action\u201d as provided in the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-9\">12. We find no error in the decree in the matter of insurance. It was found by the master that the premium on the policy of insurance on the property in the spring of 1912 was \u201ccharged against his [the plaintiff\u2019s] account\u201d and so was paid by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-11\">13. The defendant Purrington is a mere volunteer from one who had full notice and she has no rights which should be protected in the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-12\">14. The decree ought to have provided that the deed to the plaintiff should fully describe the land in the agreement of November 17, 1909, in place of providing that it should convey the premises mentioned in paragraph 5 of this decree. But the plaintiff, not having taken an appeal from the decree, is in the position of standing satisfied with it, and no change in that respect should be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-13\">15. The decree appealed from should be modified in the following particulars: <em>(a) </em>By striking out the word \u201cthereupon,\u201d being the second word of article 6 of the decree. (b) By striking out the word \"warranty\u201d in the same article of the decree, (c) By striking out the following words in the same article, to wit, \u201c and the taxes upon said premises for the year 1914; and upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>delivery to him of such deed the plaintiff shall then and there pay to the defendant Bragg the sum of the purchase price stated in the agreement between them, to wit, eleven hundred dollars plus interest thereon at the rate of six per centum per annum from April 1,1913, to the date of bringing this suit and the taxes paid by the said defendant Bragg for the year 1913, after deducting therefrom the sum of two hundred dollars, the sum of the payments heretofore made thereon.\u201d <em>(d) </em>For these words a provision should be substituted providing that the deed theretofore in article six directed to be made by the defendant should be delivered upon the plaintiff paying the balance of the purchase money in monthly instalments of $25 each with interest at six per cent and all sums now due for insurance and taxes and all sums hereafter falling due for insurance or taxes; the details of this portion of the decree to be settled in the Superior Court, <em>(e) </em>There should be stricken out from said article six of the decree the words \u201cas soon as reasonably may be hereafter\u201d and in place thereof there should be inserted \u201cupon payment of the last sum due under the contract of April 1, 1913.\u201d (f) The plaintiff is entitled to recover his costs up to the date of the amended decree, and the seventh article of the decree should be modified accordingly.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b138-4\">The case was submitted on briefs.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b138-5\"><em>W.
