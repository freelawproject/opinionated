Sargent, the Connecticut Mutual Life Insurance Company, and Emery B. Gibbs and Atherton N. Hunt, executors of the will of George E. Williams, alleging in substance that the plaintiff in April, 1909, delivered to Williams as general agent of the defendant company two notes, each for $250, payable to the order of the defendant company in one year from their date, and, to secure their payment, an assignment of the plaintiff\u2019s life insurance policy, Williams agreeing with him that the company would retain and would not negotiate .the notes or the policy; that Williams altered the notes by raising their amounts to $1,250 each and by erasing the name of the payee and delivered one of them to the defendant Sargent, the other remaining in his hands at the time of his death. The plaintiff prayed for an injunction against any action being brought upon the notes, that the notes be declared void and delivered to him and that the policy be delivered to the plaintiff upon the payment by him of such sum as the court might determine to be due from him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b472-6\">It appeared from the record that a cross bill was filed by the executors of the will of Williams.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b472-7\">The bill and\"cross bill were heard by <em>Pierce, </em>J., a commissioner\" having been appointed under Equity Rule 35 to take the testimony. The judge filed a memorandum of findings of fact and rulings of law which included the following:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b472-8\">The plaintiff was a master in the Boston Latin School, having \u201cthe strength and the weakness of a modern up-to-date, first-class school teacher; that is to say, he looked to be honest, rugged, vigorous, without stain or defect. His testimony showed him to be free of worldly experience, gullible and ill adapted to fence with the adroit, unscrupulous, well armored and well armed agent of a large insurance company.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b472-9\">On March 17, 1909, he wrote the Connecticut Mutual Life Insurance Company at their office in Boston to the effect that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>he desired a loan. In response thereto Williams, the general agent for the Insurance Company, called upon him at his room in the Boston Latin School building. Williams stated that he had called in response to the letter sent to the company by Stone. Stone replied that he desired to borrow $500, to which Williams answered that the company did not like to make loans on their policies for the reason that the borrowers were slow in repayment, and asked if he would be willing to have someone else loan the money, stating that he could arrange it. Stone replied that he was not willing to obtain it elsewhere; that he did not wish to have his policy in the hands of any one other than the company; that he could get it easily from friends, but desired to get it from the company because it would be easier for his wife to take care of in the event of his death. In other words, he refused absolutely to borrow from any one other than the Connecticut Mutual Life Insurance Company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b473-5\">Williams then said that if he insisted upon it the company was bound to make the loan and it was arranged that Stone should bring to the Latin School his policy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b473-6\">Within a few days Williams again came to Stone\u2019s room. Stone had the policy. Williams stated that it was advisable to have two notes of $250 rather than one of $500, because they were easier to renew than the single note. Thereupon Stone started to fill out two blank forms of notes presented to him by Williams for that purpose. After a moment of time, during which there was conversation relating to the filling out of the notes, Williams, while sitting at Stone\u2019s desk, in his immediate presence, with the assent of Stone, took the blanks and proceeded to fill in the blank places. When completed the two notes were handed to Stone, who read them and signed them. The notes were complete in all respects.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b473-7\">At the same time Stone signed an assignment of his policy without reading it and with its blanks unfilled. The assignment was absolute in form save that at the very end the words \u201cIn case of death all balance over notes to be paid to my estate\u201d appeared, thus disclosing that the assignment was given as security for the payment of notes and excluding the theory of a sale of Stone\u2019s interest.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b473-8\">The notes and assignment were delivered to Williams for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>delivery to the company, and a check for $475.95 was received by Stone through the mail about May 1, 1909.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b474-3\">Interest and premiums were paid by Stone by checks sent to the Boston office of the Connecticut Mutual Life Insurance Company as they severally became due, and receipts were duly sent therefor by Williams to Stone. Williams duly notified the company of the receipts of premiums, but never of the receipts of interest, and the company never directly or inferentially had any knowledge, or -information leading by inference to knowledge, that any money had been lent to Stone by it through Williams, or otherwise, or that any interest had been paid by Stone to it through Williams, or had been received by any one on such an account.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b474-4\">Of the two notes entrusted to Williams in April, 1909, for delivery to the payee, the Connecticut Mutual Life Insurance Company, Williams retained one in his own possession, and sold the other almost immediately after its receipt to Harry R. Stanley, Esquire, who in turn sold it to his sister, the defendant Helen Sargent. Stanley was her agent and had charge of her property as trustee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b474-5\">Both notes had been fraudulently altered by Williams in substantial and material ways. In the process of alteration he caused the date, the amount $250 in figures, the amount in writing, the name of the payee, and the rate of interest to be erased or obliterated in some manner and by some means not fully disclosed, and in place thereof made new and different figures thereon, inserted a new and changed time of payment and of amount to be paid, $1,250, and also, in the one he retained, a new and unauthorized name as payee, himself, and in the other he left blank the place designed for the insertion of the name of the payee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b474-6\">The note above described as retained in the possession of Williams was still in his possession at the time of his death, July 28, 1913.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b474-7\">\u201cIt is clear that in his lifetime Williams could not have sued Stone successfully to collect the note in its original or altered form. It is equally clear that there never existed as between Williams and Stone any contract, express or implied, relying upon which Williams at law or in equity could compel Stone to pay him any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>sum whatsoever. Stone told Williams in the most unmistakable way that he refused to become a borrower from any person or corporation other than the Connecticut Mutual Life Insurance Company, and with such an assertion no room is left at law or in equity for the growth of any implied obligation.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-5\">As regards the other note, when it was delivered or sold by Williams, even assuming that it was complete in other respects, it was incomplete as to the name of the payee; and the rights of Helen Sargent depend upon the real authority which Stone had in fact given in the matter. As Stone had given no authority, Sargent got none and was put upon inquiry of Stone to ascertain his rights and Stone\u2019s obligation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-6\">No money or money\u2019s worth passed from Sargent, or those under whom she directly claimed, to Stone, and she therefore had no rights at law or in equity to call upon him for the discharge of any express or implied obligation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-7\">In lending the money to Stone, Williams did not have any authority express or implied to act for the Connecticut Mutual Life Insurance Company. It was not a part of his duty so to do and was not an incident naturally attached to his position as general manager of an insurance office. Being outside of the ordinary duties appertaining to such a position, all persons dealing with him in relation to such a subject matter were bound at their peril to ascertain the limits of his authority.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-8\">A final decree was entered dismissing the cross bill, ordering that both of the notes be delivered to the plaintiff for cancellation and that the policy and the assignment be returned to him. The defendant Sargent appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b475-9\"><em>J. M. Hallowell, </em>for the defendant Sargent.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b475-10\"><em>H. T. Richardson, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b475-11\">Braley, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AvL\">The plaintiff\u2019s promissory note having been materially altered without his knowledge or assent by Williams, who among other changes erased the name of the payee leaving the space in blank, and raised the amount of the principal five fold, it is unenforceable according to its original tenor unless the defendant Sargent to whom after alteration it was transferred is a holder in due course. R. L. c. 73, \u00a7 141. But as the presiding judge has found that when delivered to her agents it was an incomplete instrument he is entitled to a return and cancellation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>of the note. R. L. c. 73, \u00a7 31. <em>Andrews </em>v. <em>Sibley, ante, </em>10. <em>Tower </em>v. <em>Stanley, ante, </em>429.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-3\">The plaintiff when he gave the note also executed an assignment, with the blank for the name of the assignee unfilled, of his policy of life insurance as collateral security, which was delivered by Williams to the defendant with the note in question. It is contended, that the plaintiff is estopped from recovering the policy unless he first pays the entire amount for which the defendant took it as security. But the assignment was not an unqualified transfer. The words \u201cin case of death all balance over notes to be paid to my estate\u201d appearing on the face are sufficient with the other evidence to warrant the judge\u2019s finding, that it was pledged for the payment of the note in its original form held by the defendant, as well as for another note of the plaintiff\u2019s retained by Williams, but declared void by the decree because fraudulently altered, from which the defendants, his executors, have not appealed. The policy is not a negotiable instrument, and if the assignment is considered apart from the notes the words quoted clearly indicate that Williams was not clothed with the absolute title, and the defendant was put upon inquiry as to the source and extent of his ownership. <em>Tuttle </em>v. <em>First National Bank of Greenfield, </em>187 Mass. 533. <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Puritan Trust Co. </em>211 Mass. 409, 420. 2 Pom. Eq. Jur. \u00a7\u00a7 710, 711. It never was an independent right to property capable of being transferred separately from the notes, so that one person could hold the principal obligation, and another person would hold the policy. <em>Whitaker </em>v. <em>Sumner, </em>20 Pick. 399. <em>White </em>v. <em>Bodge, </em>187 Mass. 449.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">The note having been uncollectible for the reasons stated, the lien on the policy has been discharged. <em>Jarvis </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>15 Mass. 389. <em>Leighton </em>v. <em>Bowen, </em>75 Maine, 504, 508. <em>Green </em>v. <em>Sinker, Davis &amp; Co. </em>135 Ind. 434. Nor under the doctrine of <em>Joslyn </em>v. <em>Wyman, </em>5 Allen, 62, as a condition to relief should the plaintiff in equity be required to pay the amount he received. As a borrower of money he is expressly found not to have made any contract express or implied with either Williams or the defendant. <em>Foote </em>v. <em>Cotting, </em>195 Mass. 55, 61.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">The policy as well as the note must be returned to the plaintiff, and the decree is affirmed with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">\n<em>Ordered accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
