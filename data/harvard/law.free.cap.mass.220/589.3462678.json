The material portions of the lease are quoted in the opinion. At the close of the evidence the plaintiffs asked the judge to make twelve rulings, of which the judge made the seventh, tenth and twelfth as quoted below, and refused to make any of the others including the third and fourth, which were as follows: \u201c3. That under the terms of the lease the defendant was bound on the expiration of the term to deliver and surrender to the plaintiffs the premises clean and in good repair, order, and condition.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b616-7\">\u201c4.

Were the premises in question left by the. defendant at the expiration of the lease declared on clean and in good repair, order and condition in all respects?\u201d The jury answered, \u201cNo.\u201d \u201c2. If question No. 1 is answered in the negative, what was the fair and reasonable cost in the most reasonably economical manner of cleaning the premises and putting them in good repair, order and condition in all respects after the termination of the tenancy of the defendant?\u201d The jury answered, \u201c$297.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b617-6\">\u201c3. Were the premises in question left by the defendant at the expiration of the lease declared on (January 1, 1913), clean and in as good repair, order and condition in all respects as they were in on January 1, 1912, at the beginning of the term covered by the lease?\u201d The jury answered, \u201cYes.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b617-7\">The fourth question became immaterial because it was required to be answered only in case the jury should answer the third question in the negative.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b617-8\">Upon receiving the answers of the jury the judge ordered a verdict for the defendant; and the plaintiffs alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b617-9\">The case was submitted on briefs at the sitting of the court in November, 1914, and afterwards was submitted on briefs to all the justices.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b617-10\"><em>L. A. Ford &amp; O. T. Russell, </em>for the plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b617-11\"><em>J. W. Spaulding &amp; P. M. Lewis, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b617-12\">Braley, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A4r\">The demised premises were occupied and used by the defendant for the manufacture and sale of paints, shellac, oils and similar compounds, and the answer of the jury to the third question establishes the fact that the basement and ground floors were in the same general condition at the end as at the beginning of the term.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-13\">But in addition to the covenant to maintain \u201cthe said premises, including the plumbing, in such repair, order and condition as the same are in at the commencement of said term or may be put in during the continuance thereof,\u201d the lessee further covenanted that it \u201cwill at the expiration of this lease remove all rubbish and all goods and effects of itself and of all persons claiming under it, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>and peacefully yield up to the lessors, or to those having their estate therein, the premises and all erections and additions made to or upon the same, clean and in good repair, order and condition in all respects.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">It is plain that under the first covenant the defendant was bound only to deliver the premises in the same good order and condition as at the date of the lease, reasonable use and wear excepted, and failure to do this would subject the lessee to damages, in a sum sufficient to put them in the required condition. <em>Watriss </em>v. <em>First National Bank of Cambridge, </em>130 Mass. 343, 345.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">The second covenant, however, is not repugnant to the first covenant. The defendant had been in occupation under previous leases during which the deposit on the floors of a thick, irremovable mucilaginous substance had accumulated and the lessee did no more than to covenant to restore the building to a rentable condition. By this construction all parts of the instrument are reconciled and full force and effect given to each covenant. <em>Ferguson </em>v. <em>Union Mutual Life Ins. Co. </em>187 Mass. 8, 10, and cases cited. <em>Ball </em>v. <em>Wyeth, </em>8 Allen, 275. <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Hayes, </em>199 Mass. 411.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">The jury having specially found that the lessee at the expiration of the lease failed to leave the premises \u201cclean and in good repair, order and condition in all respects,\u201d the verdict for the defendant was ordered improperly.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-8\">If the jury found the covenant to have been broken, the measure of damages was specially submitted to them, in accordance with the plaintiffs\u2019 seventh, tenth and twelfth requests, and their other requests for rulings as to damages, not having been argued, are to be treated as waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-9\">It follows that, while the exceptions nlust be sustained, a new trial is not called for and the plaintiffs are to have judgment for the amount found by the jury, with interest from the date of the writ. St. 1913, c. 716, \u00a7 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-10\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
