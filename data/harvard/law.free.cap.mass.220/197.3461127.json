Campbell and Inez E. Campbell of said Chelsea, nieces of said grantor, as tenants in common, unless otherwise directed either by written request made by the grantor to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>grantee during said grantor\u2019s lifetime or as the grantor may direct and appoint in her last will and testament. <em>Fourth; </em>in trust to convey in fee simple said premises to such person or persons as the grantor may by written request made to the grantee during her lifetime or by her last will and testament direct and appoint. Upon the conveyance of said premises in accordance with the terms of this instrument this trust shall thereupon immediately terminate and the grantee by the acceptance of this deed doth hereby signify his acceptance of this trust and doth hereby agree to faithfully discharge and execute the same according to the true intent and meaning of these presents.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b225-3\">At the close of the evidence the tenant asked the judge to find that the demandant had not proved a title in himself to the demised premises equal to a freehold estate, as required by R.

Fox, the wife of the tenant Edgar B. Fox. By the decree of the Probate Court dated December 12, 1910, on her petition under R. L. c. 153, \u00a7 33, it was adjudged that her husband had deserted her, and that she was living apart from him for justifiable cause. By virtue of \u00a7 36 of the statute she was thereafter free to convey her real property \u201cin the same manner and with the same effect\u201d as if she were sole.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">The deed by which she conveyed the property to the demand-ant \u201cand his heirs and assigns\u201d was in the ordinary quitclaim form and vested in him the legal title in fee, but upon certain trusts. So far as now directed he is to pay over the net income to her during her life, and upon her decease is to convey the property to her two nieces in fee simple. Plainly he has an estate of freehold sufficient to prosecute a writ of entry; and her motive in making the conveyance is immaterial. R. L. c. 179, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 4. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number><em>Packard </em>v. <em>Old Colony Railroad, </em>168 Mass. 92. <em>Cleveland </em>v. <em>Hallett, </em>6 Cush. 403. <em>Curtis </em>v. <em>Galvin, </em>1 Allen, 215. See <em>Fay </em>v. <em>Taft, </em>12 Cush. 448.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">The tenant\u2019s attack is directed against the validity and effect of the provisions in the deed by which Mrs. Fox may direct the trustee to convey the property to another during her lifetime, or to transfer it after her decease as she shall appoint by her last will. This does not purport to affect the nature of the estate conveyed to the trustee, but only to render defeasible the remainder in fee given to the nieces. <em>Whipple </em>v. <em>Fairchild, </em>139 Mass. 262. The power of revocation does not affect the present legal title in the demandant. <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Hackett, </em>12 Gray, 227.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">It is unnecessary to consider the validity of these provisions as against creditors of Mrs. Fox, or as affecting possible future rights of her husband Edgar B. Fox in the event of his surviving her. See <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Langmaid, </em>171 Mass. 309; <em>Kelley </em>v. <em>Snow, </em>185 Mass. 288; <em>McEvoy </em>v. <em>Boston Five Cents Savings Bank, </em>201 Mass. 50; <em>Russell </em>v. <em>Webster, </em>213 Mass. 491. No such issue is open to the tenant in these proceedings, especially in view of the statement in the decision of the Land Court that \u201cno evidence of fraud in the conveyance of the property was introduced;\u201d and we express no opinion thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
