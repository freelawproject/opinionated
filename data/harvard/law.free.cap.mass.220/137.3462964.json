On June 2, 1908, Feinberg was adjudicated a bankrupt. The State Bank of New York was a creditor of the bankrupt Feinberg, was scheduled as such, had notice of the bankruptcy proceedings and took part therein. Some time between Feinberg\u2019s adjudication and July 13, 1909, Feinberg made an offer of composition in the bankruptcy proceedings.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b164-7\">On September 16, 1908, the State Bank of New York brought an action in the Superior Court for the county of Suffolk against both Feinberg and Herschman to recover upon two promissory notes. The declaration was in two counts and contained an allegation that both counts were for the same cause of action. The notes thus declared on then had not been and never thereafter were proved in any bankruptcy proceedings. Counsel representing both Feinberg and Herschman entered an appearance for them in the action at law and on October 14, 1908, filed an answer, and continued to act therein until the withdrawal of their appearance as stated below.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b164-8\">On December 23, 1908, an involuntary petition in bankruptcy was filed against Herschman. On January 18, 1909, Herschman was adjudicated a bankrupt. The State Bank of New York had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>notice of the bankruptcy proceedings against Herschman and appeared and participated therein, but did not prove therein the notes on which the action then was pending against Feinberg and Herschman.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b165-3\">On July 13, 1909, the composition offer previously made by Feinberg in the bankruptcyproceedings against him was confirmed. On July 6, 1910, a composition offer previously made by Herschman in the bankruptcy proceedings against him was confirmed. On October, 13,1911, the counsel who had appeared in the action at law for Feinberg and Herschman withdrew their appearance. Neither Feinberg nor Herschman had any actual knowledge of this withdrawal of counsel. On October 17, 1911, Feinberg and Herschman were defaulted in the action at law. Neither Feinberg nor Herschman had any actual knowledge of this default.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b165-4\">In April, 1912, the State Bank of New York made a motion in the action at law to amend its declaration by strildng out the allegation that both counts were for the same cause of action. This motion was allowed <em>ex parte </em>as of November 6, 1911, and judgment was entered as of November 6,1911, on the notes against Feinberg and Herschman. Neither Feinberg nor Herschman had any actual knowledge of the motion to amend, nor of the judgment, until the commencement of the poor debtor proceedings mentioned below.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b165-5\">Subsequently execution issued on the judgment against Feinberg and Herschman. At no time from the commencement of the action at law until the entry of the judgment and the issuing of the execution did either Feinberg or Herschman make any plea or suggestion of bankruptcy or of their discharges in bankruptcy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b165-6\">On July 31, 1913, the State Bank of New York made an application to the Municipal Court of the City of Boston under the provisions of R. L. c. 168 and acts amendatory thereof and supplementary thereto for a certificate authorizing the arrest of Feinberg and Herschman on an execution issued on the judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b165-7\">Herschman, by a motion in writing, presented to the Municipal Court of the City of Boston substantially all the facts set forth in his present petition, and asked that court to dismiss the poor debtor proceedings against him. After hearing, the Municipal Court refused to dismiss the poor .debtor proceedings on</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b166-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>Herschman\u2019s motion and ordered Herschman to submit to an examination.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b166-3\">On September 4, 1914, Feinberg was defaulted in the poor debtor proceedings; a certificate of arrest issued, and Feinberg subsequently was arrested thereon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b166-4\">The case was argued at the bar in December, 1914, before <em>Rugg, </em>C.

Bankruptcy act, 1898, \u00a7 1 (12), \u00a7\u00a7 12,14, as amended by the U. S. Sts. of February 5, 1903, c. 487, and June 25, 1910, c. 412. <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Hudson, </em>105 Maine, 476. The creditor at whose instigation they are being prosecuted as poor debtors under B. L. c. 168, although scheduled and notified of the proceedings in which it participated, did not prove the notes on which it has obtained judgment in an action begun after adjudication. The petitioners retained counsel, who duly appeared of record, but after the composition had been effected withdrew their appearance, and upon default judgment, after the lapse of several months, was entered as of the date of default, and execution issued. It appears that neither petitioner had actual notice of the withdrawal or of the default or of the entry of judgment and issuance of execution until after the proceedings for their arrest were begun. While conceding, that as the notes were provable debts, further proceedings would have been stayed, if the discharge had been pleaded, the respondents contend that, if before verdict or default a discharge is obtained, failure to plead it is a waiver of the defence.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-9\">The petitioners, who upon the conceded facts were not negligent, and who were unrepresented, urge that a failure to plead a certificate of discharge before judgment is, under the circumstances, excusable in equity and it now may be set up. Or that under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>provisions of \u00a7 9 a that \u201ca bankrupt shall be exempt from arrest upon civil process except in the following cases: (1) When issued from a court of bankruptcy for contempt or disobedience of its lawful orders; (2) When issued from a State court having jurisdiction, and served within such State, upon a debt or claim from which his discharge in bankruptcy would not be a release, and in such case he shall be exempt from such arrest when in attendance upon a court of bankruptcy or engaged in the performance of a duty imposed by this act,\u201d they are immune from arrest. '</p>\n<p id=\"b167-3\">But this section very plainly refers only to the period covered by the pendency of the bankruptcy proceedings, during which jurisdiction is conferred on the bankruptcy court to protect the bankrupt from arrest on a provable debt until a discharge has been granted or refused. <em>Wagner </em>v. <em>United States, </em>104 Fed. Rep. 133. <em>In re Marcus, </em>104 Fed. Rep. 331. <em>In re Fife, </em>109 Fed. Rep. 880. <em>People </em>v. <em>Erlanger, </em>132 Fed. Rep. 883. <em>In re Adler, </em>144 Fed. Rep. 659. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Peters, </em>166 Fed. Rep. 613. <em>Turgeon </em>v. <em>Bean, </em>109 Maine, 189.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\">A discharge in bankruptcy, like the statute of limitations or the statute of frauds or a release under seal, to be effective must be pleaded. If at the time of adjudication or afterwards the bankrupt is sued on a provable debt, his sole remedy is to obtain a continuance, if necessary, and plead his discharge, and where this is done all further proceedings are stayed. <em>Dimock </em>v. <em>Revere Copper Co. </em>117 U. S. 559. <em>Boynton </em>v. <em>Ball, </em>121 U. S. 457.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">It accordingly must be held that, as the court had jurisdiction of the cause of action and of the parties and the petitioners did not interpose this defence, the judgment is not open to collateral attack, and may be enforced by arrest as well as by levy upon their goods, chattels or lands. <em>Dimock </em>v. <em>Revere Copper Co. </em>117 U. S. 559. <em>Lane </em>v. <em>Holcomb, </em>182 Mass. 360. <em>Hirsh </em>v. <em>Beard, </em>200 Mass. 569.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">If the provisions of our insolvency laws, that where the debtor obtains his discharge he is forever therefore exempt from arrest or imprisonment on account of any debt or demand provable against his estate, also had enumerated bankrupts, or if we had a statute providing that, if at any time after a year had elapsed since a bankrupt was discharged from his debts he might apply upon proof of his discharge for an order directing the judgment to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>cancelled of record, a different question would be presented. R. L. c. 163, \u00a7 95. <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Muir, </em>194 N. Y. 420.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">Nor are we'called upon to determine whether the petitioners, upon discovery of what had been done, could have had the judgment vacated by a petition for review under R. L. c. 193, \u00a7\u00a7 22-35, and then have pleaded their discharge, or whether, if the judgment had been obtained fraudulently, a court of equity would permanently enjoin the judgment creditor from attempting to enforce it. <em>Brooks </em>v. <em>Twitchell, </em>182 Mass. 443.
