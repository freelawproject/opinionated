J., Braley, De Courcy, &amp; Crosby, JJ.</p>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b415-11\"><em>Trading Stamps. Contract, </em>Validity. <em>Monopoly. Restraint of Trade. Equity Jurisdiction, </em>No enforcement of unlawful contract.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b415-12\">A corporation, which has issued trading stamps under contracts containing restrictions decided by this court in <em>Merchants Legal Stamp Co. </em>v. <em>Murphy, ante, </em>281, to be illegal and void under St. 1908, c. 454, \u00a7 1, cannot maintain a suit in equity to restrain a person, who with knowledge of the terms of such contracts bought the plaintiff\u2019s trading stamps from customers of the plaintiff, from buying and disposing of such stamps, where the defendant is not shown to have engaged in any fraud, deception or unfair competition.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b415-13\"><em>Whether </em>a corporation that has issued trading stamps under contracts that are illegal and void under St. 1908, c. 454, \u00a7 1, can be compelled to redeem such trading stamps that have been acquired in violation of the unenforceable terms of its contracts, here was referred to as a question that was not before the court.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b415-14\">Bill in equity, filed in the Supreme Judicial Court on May 20, 1914, by the same corporation which was the plaintiff in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number><em>Merchants Legal Stamp Co. </em>v. <em>Murphy, ante, </em>281, to restrain the defendant from transferring, buying, selling, dealing in or in any manner possessing or disposing of the plaintiff\u2019s trading stamps or trading stamp books.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b416-5\">The defendant\u2019s answer, among other matters, alleged that the plaintiff was maintaining an unlawful monopoly and that the contracts sought to be enforced by it were in restraint of lawful competition under St. 1908, c. 454, \u00a7 1.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b416-6\">The case was referred to Franklin T. Hammond, Esquire, as master, to whom the previous case mentioned above also had been referred. The only difference between the facts in this case and those in the previous case is pointed out in the opinion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b416-7\">The case was heard by <em>Sheldon, </em>J., upon the defendant\u2019s exceptions to the master\u2019s report. The justice made an interlocutory decree, ordering that the defendant\u2019s exceptions be overruled and that the master\u2019s report be confirmed. Later by order of the same justice a final decree was made ordering that the defendant be \u201cenjoined from transferring, buying, selling, dealing in, or in any manner possessing or disposing of the plaintiff\u2019s legal stamps or stamp books without the plaintiff\u2019s consent; and the defendant is directed to deliver to the plaintiff all legal stamps and stamp books belonging to the plaintiff now in the defendant\u2019s possession or control; and that the defendant pay to the plaintiff the sum of $1, as nominal damages, suffered by the plaintiff in the premises, and the sum of $18.46 as costs of suit, and that execution issue therefor.\u201d The defendant appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b416-8\"><em>J.
