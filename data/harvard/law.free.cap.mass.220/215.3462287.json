In April, 1912, the plaintiff called up the defendant on the telephone and asked it to send a wagon for a fur coat and muff of hers which she wished to have kept in cold storage. In consequence the defendant\u2019s teamster called at the plaintiff\u2019s house and took away the coat and muff. The defendant admitted that the coat and muff were delivered by the teamster to the person in charge of the department of its store in which furs were kept in cold storage. This was on April 23, 1912. In consequence of a communication by telephone which the plaintiff received in the evening of the same day she went the next morning to the defendant\u2019s store and saw there one Rosenthal. The defendant\u2019s evidence shows that Rosenthal was the first assistant in the fur department of the defendant company, was the agent of the defendant in direct charge of that department, and was the person authorized by the defendant to receive complaints as to the storage of furs. It appeared later in the evidence that what had been referred to as a communication by telephone was this: On the evening of the day when the furs were taken by the defendant\u2019s teamster somebody rang up the plaintiff on the telephone and asked her if she had lost any furs; she then began to question this person and he rang off. When the plaintiff called at the defendant\u2019s store (in consequence of what she had heard on the telephone the evening before) she saw Rosenthal and asked him if the fur coat had been delivered. Rosenthal at first said yes, and later said he would ring up the storage place and \u201cask if the furs were there.\u201d He did so and told the plaintiff that the furs were there. Thereupon the plaintiff said that she wanted to go and see the furs because she was nervous, because the coat was a present from her husband; Rosenthal then told her not to worry; that the tickets were mixed up and in a day or two she could call and see her furs. Thereupon she insisted upon seeing the furs then, but Rosenthal refused to let her do so. The plaintiff thereupon said to Rosenthal that;she had been to the storage place many times before, and if the tickets were mixed she could identify her coat. But Rosenthal put her off and told her to call in a day or two and he would take her upstairs. On the same day but after this interview the plaintiff received from the defendant a receipt for her coat and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>muff in which the two were valued at $300. The next day the plaintiff went again to the defendant\u2019s store, saw Rosenthal, and refused to accept the receipt on the ground that the valuation was too low; she then demanded the return of her coat and offered to pay whatever money they might \u201c claim for the short time it was there.\u201d But neither the coat nor the muff was given to her. At this time Rosenthal told her to keep the receipt \u201cfor the purpose of identifying the number upon it and her goods would be returned to her as soon as the numbers were identified.\u201d At some of these interviews Rosenthal told the plaintiff that the trouble was that \u201cthey had green help and the tickets had been mixed up,\u201d and it would take some time to straighten matters out and they would let her know about it. After that she called at the store many times and demanded her coat, but did not receive it; and this lasted \u201cover a period of several months.\u201d The plaintiff further testified that she never gave any valuation upon the merchandise and that she never agreed to permit the coat to stay with the defendant after receiving the telephone call on the first evening the coat was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">In August, 1912, the loss of these furs was reported to one Latz, the head of the defendant\u2019s fur department, and it was not reported to him until then. Lastly, although the defendant promised to let the plaintiff know, she never was told that her furs were missing until October, 1912.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">The plaintiff also testified that \u201cin the winter of 1912 they told her they did not have the coat and muff.\u201d We interpret this to mean, or the jury could have interpreted this to mean, that this was in the autumn of 1912. This action was brought on December 4, 1912. \u201cLater, after suit was brought, the muff was returned to\u201d the plaintiff, but no explanation ever was given by the defendant as to its statement made \u201cin the winter of 1912,\u201d that it did not at that time have the muff, and as to the fact that \u201clater\u201d on-the muff was returned to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">On these facts the plaintiff proved that she had delivered the coat and muff to the defendant as bailee for hire, and that she never had agreed to the valuation put upon them by the defendant. Under these circumstances she was entitled, \u2014 on proving that the defendant was negligent, \u2014 (see <em>Willett </em>v. <em>Rich, </em>142 Mass. 356) to recover the full value of the furs.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>If the jury did find these facts, they were well warranted in drawing the conclusion that Rosenthal tried to hide the real facts from the plaintiff and from his superiors, and they were justified in drawing from the facts the further conclusion that Rosenthal knew that he or some of his fellow servants were at fault in the matter. Not only were the jury warranted in drawing the conclusion that Rosenthal knew that he or his fellow servants were at fault, but they were warranted in drawing the further conclusion from Latz\u2019s actions that he knew that his people were at fault. Latz gave the plaintiff no notice of the loss of her furs before October, although he knew of the loss in August, and no explanation ever was given of the way in which the muff was found after the plaintiff had been told that it was not in the defendant\u2019s possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">It becomes necessary in view of the defendant\u2019s argument to state once more that a defendant, in arguing that the plaintiff has failed to make out a case, is not entitled to rely on evidence which he has introduced. The doctrine of <em>Lindeiibaum </em>v. <em>New York, New Haven, &amp; Hartford Railroad, </em>197 Mass. 314, ought to be familiar to the bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">The sixteenth ruling asked for by the defendant is taken from a case where the defendant was a gratuitous bailee. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>First National Bank in Westfield, </em>99 Mass. 605.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">The defendant is right in its contention that (as was decided in <em>Childs </em>v. <em>American Express Co. </em>197 Mass. 337) it is necessary for the party who has the burden of proof \u201cto remove the cause from the realm of speculation.\u201d In our opinion that was done by the plaintiff in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">We find nothing in the other cases cited by the defendant which requires special notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-9\">The entry must be</p>\n<p id=\"b245-10\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
