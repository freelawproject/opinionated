On the first ground it appeared that by a provision in the agreement of association a stockholder desiring to sell any common stock must offer it to the corporation at its book value as shown by the company\u2019s books at the time of stock talcing next preceding the date of the offer. It further appeared that the corporation was practically a \u201cone man\u201d company controlled by the individual respondent. On the second ground an \"auditor, after stating that the profits certified to by the corporation in the second year preceding the petition had been $12,000 and that in the year immediately preceding the petition they had been only $2,100, found that \u201cthis falling off is so large that a stockholder might well consider that it called for investigation.\u201d The justice who heard the case on the auditor\u2019s report made an order for the issuing of the writ of mandamus. <em>Held, </em>that the justice was warranted in ordering the issuing of the writ.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b250-9\">Upon a petition of a minority stockholder in a corporation for a writ of mandamus against the corporation and the holder of a majority of its stock, who also was its president and treasurer and controlled the corporation as practically a \u201cone man\u201d company, for a writ of mandamus commanding the respondents to permit the petitioner to inspect the books and records of the corporation, the fact, that the petitioner\u2019s request is connected with a controversy between bim and the individual respondent as to an alleged agreement of that respondent to buy back the petitioner\u2019s stock, will not prevent the corut from issuing the writ to enforce the right of inspection, if it appears that the petitioner is acting in good faith and that his purpose is not hostile to the interests of the corporation.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b250-10\">Petition, filed on September 1, 1914, by a minority stockholder in the Martin Manufacturing Company, a corporation organized under the laws of this Commonwealth engaged in the manufacture of textiles and particularly of lace curtains, for a writ of mandamus addressed to that corporation and to George J.

The justice refused to make this ruling, and ordered that a writ of mandamus should issue. The respondents alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b251-8\">The case was submitted on briefs.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b251-9\"><em>F.

The petitioner\u2019s alleged purpose in seeking to examine the books of account and deposit and the records of stock takings is (1) to ascertain the real value of his stock1 in order to determine whether to sell it, and if so for what price, and (2) to determine whether there has been mismanagement of the business, and to enable him to take proper proceedings for the benefit of the corporation and of his interest therein, if he discovers facts that justify such action.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-12\">In support of the second ground, it appears from the report of the auditor that according to the certificates of condition filed at the State House the corporation made a profit of $12,000 for the fiscal year ending June 1,1913, while for the year ending June 1, 1914, it made a profit of only $2,100. After setting forth these facts the auditor says: \u201cIt may well be that the falling off in earnings of this corporation during the last year is not at all due to mismanagement or waste; but, in my opinion this falling off is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>so large that a stockholder might well consider that it called for investigation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b252-3\">With reference to the first ground, the provision in the agreement of association regarding the disposition of shares of stock is important. According to this, if the petitioner desires to sell any of his common stock he must offer it to the corporation at the book value as shown by the company\u2019s books at the time of stock taking next preceding the date of the offer. This provision makes the stockholder particularly interested in the correctness of the company\u2019s bookkeeping. Further, the individual respondent, by virtue of his controlling interest in the stock, has full command of the business of what is practically a \u201cone man\u201d company, as well as the custody of its books, and the petitioner, as a minority stockholder, is placed at a disadvantage in the sale of his stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">It is urged that there has been a controversy between Butler and Martin as to an alleged agreement by Martin to buy back the petitioner\u2019s stock; and the auditor intimates that the petitioner\u2019s request to examine the books is connected with that disagreement. Probably it is the usual case that these applications are made by stockholders who are dissatisfied for some reason. That fact will not prevent the court from enforcing the right of inspection unless the purpose of the stockholder is hostile to the interests of the corporation, or his motive is to promote some ulterior purpose of his own apart from his interests as a stockholder. 42 L. R. A. (N. S.) 332, note. In this case it must be inferred from the fact that the single justice made an order for the writ to issue that he found that the petitioner is acting in good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">The common law right of inspection by a stockholder is a qualified and not an absolute one, and its enforcement by mandamus is discretionary with the court. It is clear however that on the facts presented the single justice was warranted in ordering that the writ should issue as prayed for. <em>Varney </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>194 Mass. 239.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">The statutory right of inspection provided by St. 1903, c. 437, \u00a7 30, is not involved in this case. See <em>Powelson </em>v. <em>Tennessee Eastern Electric Co., post, </em>380.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">The justice rightly declined to give the ruling requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
