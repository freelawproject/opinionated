The rescript issued by this court was as follows: \u201cIf within sixty days from the date of this rescript the petitioners shall make a motion to amend their petition by striking out from the instrument offered for probate as the last will and testament of Charles H. Pratt the signature between the <em>in testimonium </em>and attestation clauses, and a motion to that effect is finally allowed, the excep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>tians in this case will be overruled. \u2022 Otherwise the exceptions will be sustained.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b104-3\">Later the petitioners in each of the appeals filed in the Supreme Judicial Court a motion to amend the petition by striking out from the instrument offered for probate the signature between the <em>in testimonium </em>and the attestation clauses.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b104-4\">The motions to amend the petition were heard by <em>Hammond, </em>J. At the hearing the appellants asked the justice to make the following rulings:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b104-5\">\"1. This court has no jurisdiction to grant the motion of the petitioners.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b104-6\"><em>\u201c2. </em>This court has no right to allow a motion to strike out any portion of the original will.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b104-7\">The justice refused to make these rulings and made the following statement and ruling:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b104-8\">\"I rule that the motion under that rescript may be filed in this court; ... I think this motion is properly before this court. I have studied this case in its details to a great extent; I sat in the argument with the full bench; I read the evidence; I have a vivid recollection of it; I have a vivid recollection of the charge to the jury; and in the exercise of my discretion and such knowledge as I have obtained, including the arguments here to-day, I allow the motion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b104-9\">\"In this case I rule that this court has jurisdiction of the motion, and, having so ruled, in the exercise of my discretion the motion is granted.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b104-10\">The appellants excepted to the refusal of the justice to make the rulings requested, and also excepted to the ruling made by him .</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b104-11\">S. <em>L.

But, as the decree in the Supreme Judicial Court upon appeal as in the Probate Court must follow the allegations of the petition, which asked for the allowance of the will as it appeared on its face, an amendment became necessary before the instrument could be decreed to be the will of the testator. <em>Thomson </em>v. <em>Carruth, </em>218 Mass. 524.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-3\">If after verdict the decree of the Probate Court had been affirmed and the case had been remanded, the amendment would have been made in that court. <em>Crocker </em>v. <em>Crocker, </em>198 Mass. 401.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">The appeal, however, was still pending in the Supreme Judicial Court when the rescript went suggesting an amendment. That court had jurisdiction, therefore, to correct an error in the pleadings by allowing the petitioners to amend the petition in accordance with the evidence and the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">The second signature, as we have said, was affixed after the will had been duly executed and had become a completed instrument; and, although not made by a stranger, it is in the nature of an interpolation, which formed no part of the will itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">The rulings requested by the appellants were rightly refused and the order allowing the amendment is to stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
