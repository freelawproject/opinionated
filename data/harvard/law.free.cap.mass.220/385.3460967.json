Foss, they being the only children of his deceased daughter.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">The testator died. in 1866, leaving at that time thirty-four nephews and nieces, among whom were William A. Foss and Lucy C. Williams. William A. Foss died in 1893, and Lucy C. Williams died on August 10, 1913.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">The question presented relates to the construction of the thirty-fourth clause <footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> of the will, which provides for the disposition of the rest and residue of the estate. The construction of this clause of the will was before this court in <em>Sherburne </em>v. <em>Sischo, </em>143 Mass. 439, and is governed by it. That was a bill in equity for instructions as to the same clause in the will. The plaintiff in that case was the sole trustee under the will and after his decease the present plaintiff was duly appointed and is now the sole trustee under the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">In 1885, Lucy D. Sischo, a niece of the testator, died leaving Peninnah F. Sischo, her only child, fifteen years of age, surviving. It was contended that the income only of the trust fund was to be paid to the heirs until all the nephews and nieces had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>deceased, arid then the principal was to be distributed. That contention was not sustained by this court, but it was held that the testator had excluded his nephew, William A. Foss, from the benefits of his will, and that as an absolute estate was given to the heirs of the nephews and nieces respectively upon the decease of such nephews and nieces, the gift could not be cut down to a less estate by subsequent words inconsistent therewith, and that therefore the trust fund held for the benefit of Lucy D. Sischo then should be paid to her daughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-3\">The defendants Littel claim that the heirs at law of William A&lt; Foss became entitled to one thirty-fourth part of the trust fund at his death, which occurred in 1893, and that in computing the share to be paid to the heirs of Lucy C. Williams the plaintiff should allow for the payment of a share to the heirs of William A. Foss.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">The difficulty with this contention is that this court, in <em>Sherburne </em>v. <em>Sischo, </em>held that neither William A. Foss nor his heirs were entitled to share in the trust fund. The decision in that case was rendered about twenty-eight years ago; and at the date of the death of Lucy D. Sischo there remained twenty-nine nephews and nieces, including William A. Foss, surviving.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">An inspection of the original papers in that case shows that a final decree was entered by a single justice of this court, providing in part, \"that the plaintiff pay to the said Peninnah F. Sischo . . . one twenty-eighth part of the principal of said trust fund now in his hands.\u201d This decree was assented to by all parties in being and by a guardian <em>ad litem </em>who was appointed by the court and represented persons not ascertained or not in being.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">The decree clearly shows that in determining that one twenty-eighth part of the fund should be paid to the heir at law of Lucy D. Sischo, William A. Foss and those who might claim under him as his heirs were excluded from participation in any portion of the trust fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">In <em>Sherburne </em>v. <em>Sischo, </em>it is plain that not only the question whether any portion of the principal of the trust fund was to be paid over to the heir of the deceased niece at that time was involved, but the question as to what portion of the trust fund was to be so paid was also a material issue and necessarily in-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>valved in the determination of the questions raised. It cannot therefore be contended that the decision in that case or any part of 'it was merely dictum.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">In the meantime the number of nephews and nieces living at the date of the death of Lucy C. Williams has been reduced to eleven, exclusive of William A. Foss or his heirs.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">It would seem that, unless we are prepared to reverse the former decision rendered by this court as to the construction of the thirty-fourth clause of this will, the decree of the Probate Court must be held to be correct, and that the heirs of Lucy C. Williams should be paid one twelfth part of the principal of the trust fund; and that neither William A. Foss nor his heirs are entitled at the present time to any portion of, or have any interest in, the principal of the trust fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">We are not disposed to question the correctness of the construction placed upon the clause in question by this court in <em>Sherburne </em>v. <em>Sischo, </em>the principle upon which that decision rests being that where an absolute estate is given by bequest or devise in clear and unmistakable language it cannot be cut down to a lesser estate by a subsequent provision inconsistent with the gift. <em>Bassett </em>v. <em>Nickerson, </em>184 Mass. 169, 176. <em>Knight </em>v. <em>Knight, </em>162 Mass. 460. <em>Joslin </em>v. <em>Rhoades, </em>150 Mass. 301. <em>Kelley </em>v. <em>Meins, </em>135 Mass. 231.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">In <em>Bullard </em>v. <em>Chandler, </em>149 Mass. 532, at page 536, this court, in affirming the soundness of this rule, cites as an authority therefor <em>Sherburne </em>v. <em>Sischo, </em>143 Mass. 439. If we doubted the correctness of the construction heretofore placed upon this clause of the will by this court, we should hesitate to reverse it except for most impelling reasons. Since the former decision sixteen nephews and nieces have died, and after each such death the trustee, undoubtedly acting in accordance with the former decision, has made a division of the principal of the trust fund. To reverse that decision which has been acted upon by the trustee for a period of about twenty-eight years would without doubt result in confusion and uncertainty, which ought to be avoided except for urgent reasons. <em>Southard </em>v. <em>Southard, </em>210 Mass. 347, 359.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-9\">\u2022 !. During all the years that have elapsed since that decision was rendered, it has been followed and so far as appears never has been questioned by William A. Foss, or by his heirs, until this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>time. It is contended by the heirs of Lucy C. Williams that the heirs of William A. Foss were represented in the former suit by a guardian <em>ad litem, </em>who was appointed by order of the court, that therefore they were parties to that proceeding, and that the decision therein is as to them <em>res judicata. </em>There is much force in this contention, but we prefer to rest our decision upon the broad ground that the interpretation of the thirty-fourth clause of the will adopted in <em>Sherburne </em>v. <em>Sischo, </em>both upon principle and authority, is correct and should be followed and affirmed in this case.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b415-5\"><em>F.
