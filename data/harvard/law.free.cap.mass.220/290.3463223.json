It appeared that the injury that resulted in King\u2019s death was sustained when he was working for one Deguio, who was a subcon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>tractor under a contract with the Boston Brick Company, a corporation, which was a subscriber insured in accordance with the provisions of the workmen\u2019s compensation act. The report of the Industrial Accident Board contained the following finding: \u201cKing was a laborer, he was not hired to do any particular job of work, but was hired by the day, like many men who are employed in day labor, and although the evidence shows, and we find, that he was hired for a single day, the evidence does not show that his employment might not have continued for a longer period, provided he and his employer agreed thereto. In other words, we are not satisfied, on the evidence, that King might not have worked for Deguio for a longer period than a day, provided there was work for him to do and the terms were mutually satisfactory. It seems to us that the burden is upon the insurer to bring King within the exception, and we are not satisfied that the burden of proof has been sustained in this respect. We therefore find and rule that the employment of Bang was not casual.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b317-5\">The insurer asked the board to make certain rulings, of which the fifth was as follows: \u201c5. Bang\u2019s employment by the Boston Brick Company if any existed was casual. Bang\u2019s employment by the Boston Brick Company if it existed at all was a casual employment and not in the usual course of the trade and business of the alleged employer.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b317-6\">The board refused to make this ruling, and made the following finding: \u201cAs to the fifth request, we find that King\u2019s employment was not casual, and that the usual course of the Boston Brick Company was to deliver as well as manufacture bricks, and at the time of his injury King was [employed] in the usual course of the trade and business of the Boston Brick Company.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b317-7\">The board found that the employee King was in the employ of Deguio, subcontractor of the Boston Brick Company, at the time of his injury; that the injury arose out of and in the course of his employment; that Deguio was required by the terms of his contract to deliver bricks to the customers of the Boston Brick Company, the latter being a subscriber and insured under the act; that the insurer was required under the provisions of St. 1911, c. 751, Part III, \u00a7 17, to pay compensation to the widow of the employee, Catherine King, at the rate of $6.50 a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>week for a period of three hundred weeks from October 8, 1913, the date of the injury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b318-3\">The report of the board concluded with these words: \u201cAt the request of the insurer excerpts from the transcript of the evidence are attached hereto.\u201d After the attestation of the report came the following statement: \u201cThe following excerpts from the transcript of the evidence are attached at the request of the insurer:\u201d Here followed a copy of certain portions of the evidence before the Industrial Accident Board with an attestation by the secretary of the board that the copy was a true one.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b318-4\">By order of the judge a decree was entered in accordance with the finding of the Industrial Accident Board, awarding to Catherine King as the dependent widow of Arthur King for the period of three hundred weeks from October 8, 1913, a weekly compensation of $6.50.

It would follow under St. 1911, c. 751, Part III, \u00a7 17, and \u00a7\u00a7 6, 7 of Part II, that the dependent, the employee\u2019s widow, would be entitled to the compensation awarded. But, as the accident happened while \u00a7 2 of Part V, since amended by St. 1914, c. 708, \u00a7 13, was in force, the insurer contends, that, not only was the further finding that the employee\u2019s service was not casual unwarranted, but the ruling that the burden of proof rested on it to show the scope of his employment was wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-8\">If it be assumed that the \u201cexcerpts from the transcript of the evidence\u201d attached to the decision at the insurer\u2019s request state all the evidence on this question, the employment was but for a single day. Under the most favorable interpretation for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>dependent there was no agreement or understanding express or implied extending the service beyond the close of the day\u2019s work, and the present case cannot be distinguished in principle from <em>Gaynor\u2019s Case, </em>217 Mass. 86, and <em>Cheevers\u2019s Case, </em>219 Mass. 244, where it was held that, the employment being casual, the employee did not come within the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">The assumption, however, cannot be made. It is only \"excerpts\u201d which are contained in the record, and it being impossible to say as matter of law that there was no evidence warranting the finding, the fifth ruling requested could not have been given. <em>Bentley\u2019s Case, </em>217 Mass. 79, 80.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">The burden of proof, however, did not shift. <em>Carroll </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>200 Mass. 527. The dependent was required to satisfy the board that the employee\u2019s service was such as to entitle her to compensation for his death. <em>New Bedford </em>v. <em>Hing-ham, </em>117 Mass. 445. <em>Thackway </em>v. <em>Connelly &amp; Sons, </em>3 B. W. C. C. 7. <em>Barnabas </em>v. <em>Bersham Colliery Co. </em>3. B. W. C. C. 216. The contrary ruling having been erroneous we are obliged to reverse the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
