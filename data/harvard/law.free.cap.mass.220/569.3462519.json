The railroad com-pony in 1847 constructed its railroad across the street so as to pass under it \u201cat a height of about forty feet under said way,\u201d necessitating by reason of methods employed a wide excavation some one hundred and fifty feet in width at the top of the excavation and narrowing at the bottom to a space sufficient for its track. A structure of masonry was built in the form of an arch about one hundred feet in length and high enough for the operation of the railroad therein, and the earth was replaced over the masonry arch up to the height of the original way and the surface of the way made passable for a width of about twenty-four feet with guard rails at the top of the slopes, \u201csaid twenty-four feet being the width of the top of the embankment.\u201d The width at the narrowest part of the present roadway at the crossing is less than twenty-one feet, the guard rails or fences having been moved toward the centre of the roadway about three feet owing to the washing away of the banks.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b597-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>The commissioners further found \u201cthat no decree was obtained at the time of making the alterations in the way; that the construction of said crossing as carried out was unauthorized; that the way by reason of the unauthorized work performed was narrowed, and is now some twelve feet narrower than the original way; that it appears that the railroad does not cross the public way so as not to obstruct it; that the construction and operation of said railroad as carried out and maintained constitutes an unlawful obstruction of said way, and has been and is an unnecessary interference with the public travel thereon; that no decree was obtained permitting the narrowing of said way.\u201d The commissioners therefore made \u201ca decree prescribing what repairs shall be made by the corporation at the crossing, the time within which they shall be made, and do now order the corporation to pay the costs of the application and of said repairs.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b597-3\">The decree was as follows: \u201cThe roadway over the crossing of the location of the said railroad shall be graded to the lines shown in red upon the above mentioned plan at the height of the present roadway, and the guard rails erected so as to give thirty-three feet in width across said railroad location. Twenty-two feet in width thereof in the centre shall be a roadway properly crowned, drained and graded, and five and one half feet on each side is to be reserved for sidewalk purposes, with the sidewalk actually constructed on the southwesterly side. \u2022</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b597-4\">\u201cAnd the said corporation shall build such retaining walls or other structures as are necessary to maintain the slopes at an angle thirty-three and one half degrees with the horizon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b597-5\">\u201cThe repairs shall be completed before June 1, 1906.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b597-6\">Evidence upon which some of the findings were made is stated in the opinion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b597-7\">On July 15, 1906, the selectmen of Holliston brought a bill in equity against the railroad company seeking specific performance of the decree of the county commissioners.

The Milford branch of the Boston and Albany Railroad, now leased to the New York Central and Hudson River Railroad Company, passes under Highland Street, a public way in the town of Hollis-ton. The selectmen of Holliston brought a petition under R. L. c. Ill, \u00a7 132, alleging that the railroad so crossed Highland Street as to narrow and obstruct it. The county commissioners, after due notice and hearing, made certain findings and ordered the petitioner to make specified repairs at the crossing, restoring Highland Street within the railroad location to the width of thirty-three feet.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">The petitioner contends that the record of the proceedings of the county commissioners discloses an error of law in their determination that the fence erected on the westerly side of Highland Street is an obstruction of the way. This objection is based mainly on the argument that the fence had stood so long that the commissioners were bound to adopt it as the true westerly boundary of the way by virtue of R. L. c. 53, \u00a7 1. The commissioners have found that it was constructed within forty years, namely in 1882. Hence they were not compelled to take it as the true limit, of the way unless \u201cthe boundaries thereof are not known and cannot be made certain by the records or by monuments.\u201d They set forth in their answer the following facts, among others, on which they found that the way had been narrowed, namely: That the fence on the easterly side of the street constituted one monument which fixed the easterly boundary; that there were old walls and fences at various points along both lines of Highland Street which indicated that this ancient road always had been two rods wide; that witnesses who had known the road at a time before the railroad was built testified that then there had been no narrowing of the road at the point where the railroad afterwards crossed; that records were presented to them showing a widening and straightening of portions of the road July 17, 1847, the effect of which was to make those portions correspond to the two rods\u2019 width of the rest of the road; and that the railroad location plan, filed January 3, 1848, showed the street to be of uniform width. It does not appear that objection was made to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>the competency of any of the evidence admitted by the commissioners, nor were they asked to certify the evidence upon which they made their findings of fact. As the case stands, their finding that the way is now some twelve feet narrower than the original way is conclusive. <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Quincy, </em>11 Cush. 487. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Old Colony &amp; Fall River Railroad, </em>14 Gray, 93. <em>Tewksbury </em>v. <em>County Commissioners, </em>117 Mass. 563. <em>Ward </em>v. <em>Aldermen of Newton, </em>181 Mass. 432. <em>Banaghan </em>v. <em>County Commissioners, </em>213 Mass. 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-3\">Such a narrowing of the street, and the maintenance of a fence within its true limits, well may be found to constitute an obstruction of the way, by rendering it inconvenient for travel. And it was exclusively within the province of the commissioners to determine the fact that an obstruction existed, and that it was due to the encroachments of the petitioner. <em>Selectmen of Holliston </em>v. <em>New York Central &amp; Hudson River Railroad, </em>195 Mass. 299, 305. In this connection it is to be remembered that the obligation not to obstruct a highway, created by R. L. c. 111, \u00a7 124 (formerly Rev. Sts. c. 39, \u00a7 66), is a continuing one. Even if no sanction or approval of the county commissioners or of the town authorities was required when this crossing was constructed, and its original construction was valid (see St. 1846, c. 271, \u00a7 1), nevertheless, if the crossing later became an obstruction, proceedings could be brought to require the making of changes. <em>Dickinson </em>v. <em>New Haven &amp; Northampton Co. </em>155 Mass. 16. <em>Selectmen of Holliston </em>v. <em>New York Central &amp; Hudson River Railroad, </em>195 Mass. 299, 304.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-4\">It is further contended that the work prescribed by the decree of the county commissioners is an alteration, rather than repairs, and that as matter of law the cost cannot be placed wholly upon the petitioner. This objection apparently was disposed of in the equity suit (195 Mass. 299), wherein the court said at page 306: \u201cThe decree being sufficiently full and exact, and the board not having exceeded their jurisdiction, no sufficient reason is shown why specific performance should not be decreed.\u201d And even regardless of the effect of that decision, we cannot say as matter of law that the work at the crossing prescribed in the decree of the county commissioners was an alteration and not \u201crepairs\u201d within the scope of R. L. c. 111, \u00a7 132, \u2014 the cost of which must be borne by the railroad corporation. The question does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>involve the distinction between general and specific repairs (see <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Fall River, </em>144 Mass. 579), but between \u201crepairs\u201d under \u00a7 132 and an \u201calteration\u201d under \u00a7 134. The term \u201calteration\u201d is used technically in the legislation upon the subject of highways as indicating a change of location in an intermediate section of an existing way, the establishment of a new section in \u25a0 substitution of a part of the old way. As was said in <em>Bigelow </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>169 Mass. 390, 393, \u201cA technical alteration is the substitution of one way for another.\u201d To the same effect see <em>Bliss </em>v. <em>Deerfield, </em>13 Pick. 102, 106; <em>Gloucester </em>v. <em>County Commissioners, </em>3 Met. 375, 379; <em>Goodwin </em>v. <em>Marblehead, </em>1 Allen, 37; <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Wyman, </em>9 Gray, 186, 189. Without attempting to lay down a general definition of these words as used in the statute which would be applicable to all cases that may arise, we are of opinion that the work here ordered by the commissioners was not an \u201calteration.\u201d It called for no change in the course or limits of the original location of Highland 'Street. It prescribed repairs within the highway location that presumably were reasonably adapted to prevent an unnecessary interference with public travel over the crossing. <em>Selectmen of Westborough, petitioner, </em>169 Mass. 495.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-3\">The case of <em>Nichols </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Maine Railroad, </em>174 Mass. 379, relied on by the petitioner, involved an order for alterations and not repairs. The petition of the selectmen to the county commissioners set forth a case under Pub. Sts. c. 112, \u00a7 129 (now R. L. c. 111, \u00a7 134), and asked for relief under that section; and the decree of the commissioners ordered certain \u201calterations\u201d to be made at the expense of the railroad company.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">\n<em>Petition dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
