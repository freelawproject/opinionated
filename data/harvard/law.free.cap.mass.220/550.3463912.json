The value of these tracts did not consist so much in the land itself as in its \u201csentimental value ... as a sight seeing place,\u201d or in the lake except \u201cas an attraction to such a property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">Between these two parcels and extending beyond them down the other side of the mountain was the Whitbeck land. This land and the two parcels taken were in respect to ravines, ledges and general roughness of surface topographically similar; however there was no pond upon the Whitbeck land and it was without value as a mere sight seeing place. But because of its wood and timber, and because of its connection with \u25a0 other properties, it had a greater value as land and a less value due to location than the parcels taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">After the introduction of the bill but before its enactment, one Collins obtained from Whitbeck, the owner of the Whitbeck parcel, an option of purchase for the purpose of showing to the Legislature the price for which the land could be bought. In October, 1908, following the enactment of the statute, Collins, now a member of the commission, exercised his option and the land was conveyed to the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-8\">At the hearing upon this petition for the assessment of damages under \u00a7 4 of the act the respondent offered to show the price it paid, which was that named in the option, but the evidence was excluded <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> and the respondent excepted.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b578-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>The case was submitted on briefs.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b578-8\"><em>H. C. Attwill, </em>Attorney General, <em>A. E. Seagrave, </em>Assistant Attorney General, for the Commonwealth.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b578-9\"><em>J. F. Noxon &amp; R. G. Dodge, </em>for the petitioner.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">We are of opinion that there was such dissimilarity between the Whitbeck property and the two parcels of the petitioner as to justify if it did not require the exclusion of the testimony. Nor can we say that the optional price procured for the admitted purpose of influencing legislation was so indubitably fair as to be a reasonable test of market value.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">\u201cQuestions which arise \u00a1as to the competency of evidence of this character must be left largely to the discretion of the presiding judge.\u201d <em>Burley </em>v. <em>Old Colony Railroad, </em>219 Mass. 483, 485. <em>Paine </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>4 Allen, 168.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b577-9\"> By <em>Fox, </em>J., who presided at the trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
