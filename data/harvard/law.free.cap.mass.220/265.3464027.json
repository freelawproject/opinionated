MacAusland, to wit, the sum of $200.25, and which sum I still retain. Further than that I decline to answer this interrogatory on the ground that it is immaterial unless I am required so to do by the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b293-12\">Interrogatory 6.

The trustee appealed from the order directing him further to answer interrogatories 4, 5, 6 and 9, and further answered interrogatory numbered 1 as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b294-6\">\u201cNow comes the trustee in the above entitled action and in answer to interrogatory number 1 says that on July 11, 1912, execution issued in the case of Edric R. Taylor <em>v. </em>Boston &amp; Maine R.R. in favor of the plaintiff for the sum of $12,500 as debt or damage and $350 as costs of suit and that on July 12, 1912, the alleged trustee in this case received into his possession the above amounts in satisfaction of said execution, and the alleged trustee further says that long before the bringing of the plaintiff\u2019s writ he had, with the consent of the defendant Taylor, or his agent, appropriated his own fees as counsel in said case to his own use from the total amount received in satisfaction of said execution, and the alleged trustee further says that prior to the bringing of the plaintiff\u2019s writ he had, with the consent of the principal defendant, Taylor, or his agent, paid out of said amount so received the fees of associate counsel and other necessary expenses incurred in the preparation and trial of said case of Edric R. Taylor <em>v. </em>Boston &amp; Maine R.R.; and the alleged trustee further says that long before the bringing of the plaintiff\u2019s writ the entire balance remaining in the hands and possession of the alleged trustee was paid over in full to the principal defendant Taylor, or his agent, with the sole exception of the sum of $200.25 which was left by defendant Taylor, or his agent, in the hands and possession of the alleged trustee for the purpose of paying to the plaintiff in this action one half of his bill for services rendered in the case of Edric R. Taylor <em>v. </em>Boston &amp; Maine R.R., therefore, the alleged trustee says that at the time of the service of plaintiff\u2019s writ on him he had in his hands and pos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>session the sum of $200.25 which belonged to the principal defendant Taylor, but that other than this he had not at that time any other goods, effects or credits of the principal defendant in \u2022his hands or possession.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b295-5\">The plaintiff thereupon moved that the trustee be defaulted for failure to comply with the order of the court as to further answers, and the motion was granted and the trustee was defaulted. The trustee appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b295-6\">On motion of the plaintiff, judgment in the action was ordered entered for him by <em>Pierce, </em>J. From 'this order no appeal was taken.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b295-7\"><em>C. Toye, J. L. Keogh &amp; S. A.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"A3a\">If it be assumed in favor of the trustee that his appeal is properly here and is not entered prematurely, no error of law is disclosed. The trustee filed, by leave of court after verdict in favor of the plaintiff against the defendant, an answer that he had no funds. Then the plaintiff filed nine interrogatories to the trustee, to which no answers were returned until a special order of the court had been made. Then the trustee answered two of the interrogatories in full, answered three others, incompletely as the plaintiff contended, and refused to answer the remaining four. Thereupon, the court ordered further answers to be made and the trustee complied with the order in part, but still refused to answer four interrogatories and appealed from an order of the court directing him to make answer. For such refusal the trustee was defaulted, and from this he appealed. The court had the power to order the default entered, provided the interrogatories were proper and required an answer from the trustee as matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-10\">It appeared from the answers filed that the trustee collected a judgment in favor of the principal defendant amounting to $12,850, of which $200.25 remained in his hands, and that he had paid out the entire balance for attorneys\u2019 fees and other expenses and to the principal defendant. The interrogatories which were not answered were designed to elicit a detailed statement of what the trustee had done with the amount collected on the execution, and where it had been deposited pending the set<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>tlement. The plaintiff, having traced a large sum of money into the hands of the trustee, had a right to inquire as to the state of the account in some detail. He was not 'obliged to accept as fina.1 the bald -assertion of the trustee that he had settled with the principal defendant and had paid out all that was due him. <em>Nutter </em>v. <em>Framingham &amp; Lowell Railroad, </em>131 Mass. 231. The plaintiff justly might ask to know more explicitly the facts upon which that conclusion rested. <em>Brennan </em>v. <em>McInnis, </em>173 Mass. 471, 474. All the interrogatories were directed to that end. They were not in the nature of cross-examination, nor calculated to contradict any answers given. The answers of the trustee must be accepted and cannot be contradicted, and he cannot be subjected to cross-examination. But, on the other hand, he can be required to testify in answer to interrogatories, as can a witness called upon the stand, with reasonable minuteness as to the subject under investigation. It is doubtful whether an answer could have been required as to some details specified in interrogatory 8 touching other funds with which the receipts collected from the execution might have been commingled. But doubtless a part of it was proper. In view of the general peremptory refusal to answer this interrogatory as well as others, there is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">\n<em>Default of trustee to stand.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
