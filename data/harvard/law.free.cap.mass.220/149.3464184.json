The only question of law arises from the refusal of the trial judge to grant a request for a ruling to the effect that the plaintiff could not recover on count one of his declaration. That count was to recover a balance due on a <em>quantum meruit </em>for work and labor performed by the plaintiff for the defendant. The plaintiff testified that the defendant employed him and said, \u201cI will pay you well and will satisfy you.\u201d Manifestly this evidence was enough to require a submission to the jury of the question whether that was the .contract. Whether the plaintiff\u2019s account was correct and whether the receipt by him of numerous payments on account raised an inference of a different contract than that testified to by him were issues of fact. These exceptions appear to be frivolous.
