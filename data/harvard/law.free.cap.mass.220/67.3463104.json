The defendant also filed a cross bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b94-6\">The defendant was the successor in title of one Arthur Binney, to all of whose rights and obligations he had succeeded. A copy of the indenture referred to above was annexed to the bill. Omitting the attestation clause and the signatures, it was as follows: \u201cThis indenture made this first day of June, A. D. 1889 by and between Arthur Binney and Hannah H. Draper, both of Boston in the County of Suffolk and Commonwealth of Massachusetts, witnesseth; That, whereas, the said Arthur Binney and Hannah H. Draper are owners as tenants in common of a certain strip or parcel of land situated on the southwesterly side of Bower Street in that-portion of Boston formerly Roxbury, said parcel of land having a frontage of ten feet on said street and a depth of ninety-seven feet, for a full description of said parcel of land reference may be had to deed of said Arthur Binney to said Hannah H. Draper of even date herewith and to be recorded with Suffolk deeds; and, whereas, the said Arthur Binney and Hannah H. Draper propose to use said strip of land as a passage-way, from said Bower Street to the lands adjoining said strip, they do hereby <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>covenant and agree each with the other for themselves, their heirs and assigns that the whole of said strip of land shall be forever kept open as a passage-way, as aforesaid, to be used in common by the said parties to this agreement, their heirs and assigns forever. It being mutually understood and agreed that the cost of constructing said passage-way and keeping the same in repair shall be shared equally by the parties to this agreement, their heirs and assigns.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b95-5\">The case was heard by <em>Wait, </em>J., who made the following memorandum of decision:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b95-6\">\u201cMrs. Draper and Arthur Binney made an agreement, a copy of which is annexed to the bill, with regard to the use of a strip of nine hundred and seventy square feet owned by them in common. Shortly thereafter Mrs. Draper, in connection with building upon her land, prepared the surface of the strip for use. The natural grade of the land made its use, as so laid out, impossible for teams, owing to its height above Bower \u201cStreet. To use the way for teams requires that it be cut down. Such change of grade would be advisable, though it would involve placing Mrs. Draper\u2019s houses in such a position that they would need further support.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b95-7\">\u201cVarnerin, who holds through mesne conveyances from Binney, cut down his land, and proposed to grade the passageway so that teams could reach the rear part of it. His use of his premises was a reasonable and proper one. The changes desired by him are reasonable, and without change of grade in the passageway it will now be practically impossible for Varnerin to derive any benefit whatsoever from his ownership in the nine hundred and seventy square feet strip.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b95-8\">\u201cI find that the plaintiff constructed the passageway in question under the provisions of the agreement, and that the natural grade of the premises was somewhat changed at that time, in order to render the strip serviceable as a way to the plaintiff\u2019s houses.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b95-9\">\u201cThe surface has never been graded with a view to a use of the passageway most beneficial for the premises of the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b95-10\">\u201cAgainst the protest of the plaintiff, the defendant has dug away earth in the passageway and intended to change very materially the grade of the way, both natural and as constructed by the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b96-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>\u201cUnder the law as laid down in <em>Killion </em>v. <em>Kelley, </em>120 Mass. 47, I feel constrained to order the cross bill dismissed, and a decree for the plaintiff on the original bill restraining encroachment, and requiring the return of the premises to the condition existing before the acts of the defendant, as nearly as may be.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b96-3\">By order of the judge a final decree was entered ordering that the cross bill be dismissed; that the defendant to the original bill be restrained from mating or permitting to be made any further encroachment upon the passageway described in the bill; that the defendant be ordered to restore the passageway, as nearly as might be, to the condition in which it existed before the excavation made by him, such restoration to take place on or before August 20,1914; that, if it should become necessary for the defendant to construct a retaining wall, such retaining wall should be constructed in a good and workmanlike manner and of sufficient thickness, not less than twenty inches at the base, to withstand all pressure reasonably to be expected to be exerted against it; that it might be placed entirely on the ten foot strip, provided it should not be so placed or, constructed as to interfere with or obstruct the use of the entire ten foot strip as a passageway; and that all reasonable care and precaution should be used in the construction of such retaining wall to avoid unnecessary delay and unnecessary injury to the plaintiff\u2019s property and to her pipes in the ten foot strip.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b96-4\">Varnerin, as the defendant in the original suit and as the plaintiff in the cross suit, appealed from the final decree.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b96-5\">The case was submitted on briefs.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b96-6\"><em>G.
