L. c. 147, \u00a7 22; and where, on conflicting evidence, a judge who heard the case found that the plaintiff knew that at some time he must sign an assent if he wanted to be a party to the assignment and that probably a time limit for assent was fixed in the instrument, but refused to give such assent until after the sixty days limitation had expired, believing that he possessed means of compelling a more advantageous settlement from the debtor, and that, although the plaintiff never had nor saw a copy of the assignment, the assignee did nothing to conceal from him the exact time limited for his assent, the suit must be dismissed.</headnotes>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b148-10\">De Courcy, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ALa\">On December 27 or 28, 1911, Harry M. Lamb made a common law assignment of all his property to the defendants, in trust for the benefit of his creditors. By its terms only those creditors were entitled to share in the benefits of the instrument who should \"execute these presents, or otherwise accept the same in writing to the satisfaction of the said parties of the second part [the assignees] within sixty days from the date hereof, or within such further time, if any, as said parties of the second part shall allow in and by a writing,\u201d etc. A notice of the assignment <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> was sent by the assignees to the plaintiff on December 28, 1911; but it did not assent thereto during the sixty days. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>plaintiff did forward a written consent on March 6,1912,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> but the defendants then declined to allow it to be a party to the assignment; and this suit was brought to compel them to do so.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b149-7\"><em>W.

The defendants did nothing to conceal from the plaintiff the exact time limited for its assent, and copies of the assignment were on file at the office of the city clerk of Boston,<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> and in the registry of deeds at East Cambridge.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">On the facts as found it is settled by our decisions that the plaintiff is not entitled to the relief it asks for. <em>National Bank of Commerce </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>179 Mass. 415. <em>Moulton </em>v. <em>Bartlett, </em>195 Mass. 33.
