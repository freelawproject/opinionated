That the defendant, the next day, falsely and fraudulently represented to the plaintiff, that all the foregoing requirements had been fulfilled, and on the faith of the defendant\u2019s representations, the plaintiff was induced to purchase said claim, and for that purpose delivered to the defendant $11,500, to pay for the same. That each of said representations was false. That the claim was rejected, and will not be paid. That the defendant did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>not procure for the plaintiff a good and sufficient title thereto:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b508-5\">This action was brought to recover back the money thus paid by the plaintiff. The defendant, by his answer, denied each and every allegation, of the complaint, in respect to any false or fraudulent representations Whatever, made by him to the plaintiff, or any fraud committed, or attempted by him, in regard to the purchase by the plaintiff of the claim named in said complaint. 2d. He alleged that the plaintiff purchased said claim in violation of the laws of the United States, and knowing that said purchase was contrary to said laws. 3d. He alleged that said claim was and is a good and valid claim.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b508-6\">On the opening of the case for the plaintiff, at the circuit, the presiding justice dismissed the complaint, on the defendant\u2019s motion, upon the ground that the contract of purchase was in violation of the law of congress, which forbids any transfer of a claim upon the United States until after the allowance of the claim, the ascertainment of the amount due, and the issuing of a warrant for its payment. <em>(Brightly\u2019s Big. </em>132, \u00a7 2.)</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b508-7\"><em>Edmonds &amp; Field, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b508-8\">I. Although the defendant was not the owner of the claim, yet, if he made the representations, knowing them to be false, with intent to defraud, whereby the plaintiff was induced to part with his money and sustained damage, an action will lie. 1. Where deceit and damage are both found, an action will lie. <em>(Pasley </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>3 <em>T. R,. 56. Addington </em>v. <em>Allen, 11 Wend. </em>404. <em>Chester </em>v. <em>Dickerson, 52 Barb. </em>356.) 2. The knowledge of a party of the falsity of his representations, is itself sufficient evidence of a fraudulent intent. <em>(Bennett </em>v. <em>Judson, </em>21 <em>N. Y. </em>240. <em>Marsh </em>v. <em>Falker, </em>40 <em>id. </em>566.) This was the case that the plaintiff was prepared to make out, but he was not permitted to do so, because that any transfer of the claim would be void.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b509-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>II. The learned judge, at the circuit, misunderstood the action. If it had been, as he supposed, an action to enforce the assignment or transfer, he might have been right in, ruling as he did. But that was not the action. On the other hand, it was purely an action to recover back money obtained by false pretences. 1. Like the case of <em>Catts </em>v. <em>Phalen, </em>(2 <em>How. U. S. </em>381,) the money was paid and received oil the, false assertion of a fact, and the contract which the law raises between them is not founded on the void fact, but on the obligation to refund the money which had been received by falsehood and fraud, by the assertion of a fact which never took place. 2. The distinction is between an action affirming a void contract and one dis-affirming it. The latter is our case, and can be maintained. <em>(See Baldwin </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>10 <em>N. Y. </em>232, <em>and eases there cited.)</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b509-5\">III. This is simply an action for the deceit, where, on account of the deceit, and without inquiring whether the contract can be enforced, the party deceived rescinds the contract and seeks to recover his money back. ( <em>White </em>v. <em>Merritt, </em>7 <em>N. Y. </em>352. <em>Nickley </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>22 <em>Barb. </em>652. <em>Case </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>24 <em>Wend. </em>102.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b509-6\">IV. For such a deceit, an action will lie, whether the contract can be enforced or not. <em>(Benton </em>v. <em>Pratt, </em>2 <em>Wend. </em>385.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b509-7\"><em>B. C. Thayer, </em>for the respondent.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b509-8\">I. The laws of the United States make any assignment of any claim against the United States, or any order, or power of attorney, for the payment of such claim, absolutely null and void, unless the same be made \u201c after the allowance of such claim, the ascertainment of the amount due, and the issuing of a warrant for the payment thereof.\u201d (1 <em>Brightly\u2019s Dig. title Claims, p. </em>132.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b509-9\">II. It is well settled that a representation, in order to be the foundation of an action for deceit, must not only be false, but it must be material. How it was utterly imma<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>terial,.so far as the plaintiff\u2019s title to the claim against the government could be affected thereby, whether the representations made by the defendant in regard thereto were true or false. All assignments thereof, previous to the issuing of the warrant for the payment thereof, were utterly void; and if all the representations, alleged to have been made by the defendant were true, and the assignment thereof to the plaintiff was in all respects as formal as possible, yet the same was, in the hands of the plaintiff, a mere waste paper. It could not possibly have been more entirely worthless if those representations were (as claimed) wholly false. It follows, therefore, that this action cannot be maintained. Whether the plaintiff could maintain an action, for money had and received, to recover back his money, it is not necessary now to inquire, but it is very clear that he cannot be allowed to recover in this penal action. He has not suffered a particle of injury in consequence of any false representation by the defendant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b510-5\">III. The plaintiff parted with his money in pursuance of an unlawful agreement and undertaking; And whether the undertaking be considered as unlawful, because it was prohibited by statute, or as contrary to public policy in providing for the exercise of an improper influence upon a public judicial officer, or as a fraudulent combination against the rights of the owner and assignor of the claim, or as unlawful and fraudulent for all these reasons, as it doubtless was, in either case the plaintiff is not entitled to any relief, either at law or in equity. ( <em>Warburton </em>v. <em>Akin, </em>1 <em>McL. </em>460. <em>Randall </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>2 <em>Black. </em>588. <em>Nellis </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>20 <em>Wend. </em>24. <em>Bolt </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>3 <em>Paige, </em>154. <em>Perkins </em>v. <em>Savage, </em>15 <em>Wend. </em>412.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b510-6\">IV. The plaintiff was therefore properly nonsuited, and the order dismissing the complaint should be affirmed, and judgment directed in favor of the defendant.</p>\n<court data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b511-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>[First Department, General Term, at New York,</court>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Aor\">January 1, 1872.</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b511-4\"><em>By the </em>Court, Geo.
