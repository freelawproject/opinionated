About four inches above the surface, a hole, an inch or more in diameter, was cut, for the escape of the water from the curb.. The water never overflowed the curb, nor rose above the hole, hut ran, 'constantly, from the hole, in larger or smaller volume, as the season varied. <em>Sold </em>that the natural outlet and watercourse from this spring having been always through the plaintiff\u2019s land, the defendant had an easement there, for the flow of that water.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b130-10\"><em>Sold, also, </em>that it was the defendant\u2019s watercourse, and if, by reason of the improvement of the spring, an additional quantity of water was made to pass through it, at certain seasons of the year, to the plaintiff\u2019s injury, it was <em>damnum absque, injuria, </em>within the principle of <em>Waffle </em>v. <em>N.

On the trial, at the circuit, the plaintiff' was nonsuited, and judgment entered as security. A motion to set aside the nonsuit, and for a new trial, on a case and exceptions, was made at special term, and denied. Judgment was entered thereon for'. $72.22 costs, and the plaintiff appealed from both judgments to the general term. .</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b131-5\"><em>Bipsom, &amp; </em>Terry, for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b131-6\">I. The exception to the evidence of Josiah Salter, the defendant\u2019s witness, as to whether a certain ditch on the plaintiff\u2019s premises, testified to by the witness as having tumbled in, would have discharged all the water that comes there, was well taken. 1. It was not proved that the witness was qualified, as .an expert, to testify on that subject. It was a question which could only be accurately answered by an engineer, or by one accustomed to hydraulics. At least, the facts as to size of ditch and quantity of water should have been given, and the jury could have judged as well as the witness. 2. It was immaterial and irrelevant, not bearing on the point as to whether the defendant had or had not injured the plaintiff\u2019s lands and crops. <em>(Morehouse </em>v. <em>Mathews, </em>2 <em>N. Y. </em>514. <em>Harpending </em>v. <em>Shoemaker, </em>37 <em>Barb. </em>270. <em>Teall </em>v. <em>Barton \u00a7 Williams, </em>40 <em>id. </em>137.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b131-7\">II. The nonsuit was improperly granted. There being conflicting evidence, the case should have gone to the jury, unless, assuming the facts to have been with the plaintiff* the law was against him. The nonsuit must have been upon the ground that the law was against the plaintiff. The court virtually decided, as matter of law, that the defendant had a right, to do what the plaintiff alleged he had done, the proof thereof being assumed by the nonsuit. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>Assuming that water had, prior to the digging of the well or sinking of the curb, issued from the spot, (about which the testimony was conflicting,) it should have been allowed to flow in its usual quantities, channel and course. The defendant had no right so to disturb the spring, if there was one, as to cast unusual quantities of water on' to the plaintiff\u2019s land to its detriment. <em>(Belknap </em>v. <em>Trimble, </em>3 <em>Paige, 577. Haight </em>v. <em>Price, </em>32 <em>N. Y. </em>241.) The plaintiff would have no cause of complaint if the defendant had allowed the water fo flow, as it had before the .curb was put in; his complaint is, that by disturbing the spot he opened hidden springs,- and collected them in such a way as to cast over on the plaintiff\u2019s land excessive and destructive quahr titles of water. There is no ease in our courts, directly bearing upon such a case as the present; but it is submitted that the general principles of .law sustain the plaintiff\u2019s case. The Pennsylvania cases of <em>Kauffman </em>v. <em>Griesimer, </em>(26 <em>Penn. </em>407,) <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Riddle, (id. </em>415,) and the case of <em>Dickinson </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>(7 <em>Allen, </em>19, 22,) sustain .the plaintiff\u2019s case.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b132-5\"><em>F.

The owner of the upper field has a natural easement to have the water which falls upon, or rises from' below the surface of his own land, flow upon the field below. <em>(Washburn on Easements, </em>355. <em>Angell on Watercourses, Perkins, 6th ed., </em>\u00a7 108, <em>a, et seq.

The moral precept, <em>\u201cSic utere tuo ut alienum non Icedas,\u201d </em>does not prevent a farmer from cleaning out an old spring on his premises, and putting a \u201c.gum\u201d in it. <em>(Auburn and Cato Plank Road Co. </em>v. <em>Douglass, </em>5 <em>Seld. </em>444. <em>Bellows </em>v. <em>Sackett, 15 Barb. </em>96. <em>Ellis </em>v. <em>Duncan, </em>21 <em>id. </em>230. <em>Carhart </em>v. <em>The Auburn Gas Light Co., </em>22 <em>id. </em>297. <em>Pixley </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>v. <em>Clark, </em>32 <em>id. </em>268.) There being no dispute about the facts, and'no request by the plaintiff to go to the jury upon any pivtended.question of fact, the order refusing a new trial, and the judgment, should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b133-5\"><em>By the Court, </em>Johnson, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A3kb\">The plaintiff\u2019s counsel did not ask the court to submit the case to the jury, at the close of the testimony. He contented himself with excepting to the decision granting a nonsuit. The nonsuit was granted, as appears by the case, on the ground that upon the whole case the defendant had done nothing that he had not the legal right to do upon his own premises, \u00e1s owner thereof. I have been unable to find any adjudged case like this in its facts, or bearing any near analogy to it. Had it been the case described in the complaint, of digging a pit, well, or fountain, by the defendant, and opening and exposing divers springs by such excavation, which filled up the pit or well, and overflowed the \u25a0 same, and ran from thence upon the plaintiff\u2019s premises, where the water from such springs had not been accustomed to flow, and did not naturally go, I should have no doubt that it would give a right of action to the plaintiff, should he be injured thereby. The case would fall within the maxim, \u201c <em>Sio utere tuo ut alienum non Icedas.\u201d </em>-But no such case is made by the evidence on either side. There was, and had been, as far .back as any one appears to have had any knowledge of the premises, a living spring upon the defendant\u2019s premises at the place where he made his excavation, surrounded by a wet, marshy piece of ground, where cattle were accustomed to be watered, and water obtained for use. This was immediately adjacent to the plaintiff\u2019s land, which lay below the defendant\u2019s.. The natural outlet and watercourse for this marsh and spring, was over the plaintiff\u2019s land, and naturally could go nowhere else.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">This the plaintiff does not deny, but substantially admits, though he does not admit that it was at all times a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>flowing spring. The defendant, in order to make a more .convenient and suitable place for watering his stock, dug out this spring to a depth of two or three feet below the surface, and placed therein a curb made from the trunk of a hollow tree, between two and three feet in diameter, and five or six feet in length. The top of the tube was placed nearly two feet above the surface of the ground, and about four inches above the surface, a hole was cut, an inch or more in diameter, for the escape of the water from the curb. The water never overflows', the curb, nor rises above the hole, but runs constantly from the hole in larger or smaller volume, as the season varies. There was a conflict of evidence in regard to the fact whether more water flowed from this curb, and upon the plaintiff\u2019s land, now, than flowed formerly from the spring and marshy place before the excavation; and had the right of action depended upon this question, the case should have been submitted to the jury. But in my opinion the right of action \"does not turn upon that question, nor upon the question whether the plaintiff\u2019s land is more or less injured by the escape of the water through it.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">The natural outlet and watercourse from this spring having been always through the plaintiff\u2019s land, the defendant had an easement there for the flow of that water. It was his watercourse, and if by reason of the improvement of this spring, an additional quantity of water was made to pass through it at' certain seasons of the year to the plaintiff\u2019s injury, it was <em>damnum absque </em>injuria, within the principle of <em>Waffle </em>v. <em>N. Y. Cent. R. R. Co., </em>(58 <em>Barb. </em>413.)</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">' The case is quite different in principle from that of drainage of falling or standing water, which has no natural outlet, upon' the lands of another. But even there, a party may. lawfully drain his lands into a natural watercourse without being liable to an action for the consequential injury to those living upon the' banks of such stream. I am <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>prepared to hold that every owner of land has the right to clean out and tube or wall up a natural spring upon his own land, for his own use and convenience, when he does not thereby change the natural course of the flow of the water therefrom, and makes no change to the injury of another, except what may result from an increased flow of water in the natural channel and outlet of-such spring. It is not such a wrongful'use of the easement, or abuse of the right, as will give a right of action to the owner of the servient estate. It is a question simply as to whether an unlawful or improper use has been made of the natural easement by the defendant. In the view I have taken, no unlawful use has been made, and the case was properly decided at the circuit, upon the plain facts. The case might very properly have been submitted to the jury, and probably would have been, had the request been made by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel. But as no such request was made, and the law was properly applied to the facts established by the evidence, the exception to the decision is not well taken.</p>\n<court id=\"b135-6\">[Fourth Department, General Term, at Syracuse,</court>\n<decisiondate id=\"Al4\">November 13, 1871.</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">The judgment must therefore be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"AeA\"><em>Mullin, </em>P.
