The argument is made now, as it was before, that there never was any liability on the bond, but we are still of the opinion that liability exists for any loss plaintiff sustained by reason of Mansberger\u2019s default on the main contract. The only new question presented is whether the verdict, on which judgment was entered, is excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-9\">An auditor for defendant made a thorough examination of plaintiff\u2019s books, and testified that the maximum amount of liability shown thereby was the sum of $27,626.49. There were disputed items not shown, or imperfectly shown, on the books amounting to $2,236.-90. The District Judge authorized the jury to allow interest on the amount plaintiff was required to use in the completion of the contract over and above the amounts it received in current payments. This item of interest at the legal rate amounted to $4,486.08. If the disputed items and tins amount of interest be added to the maximum amount estimated by the auditor, the total would be greater than the verdict. But it is apparent that plaintiff recovered something on the disputed items, as the verdict is in excess by $660 of the aggregate of these amounts. It cannot therefore be said that the verdict is excessive, unless plaintiff was not entitled to recover interest on its invested capital. Clearly, we 'think, interest should have been allowed. If the condition of the bond had not been broken, plaintiff would have had the use of its money. Interest is the compensation allowed by law, or fixed by the parties, for the use or detention of money. Kishi v. Humble Oil Co. (C. C. A.) 10 F.(2d) 356.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-11\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
