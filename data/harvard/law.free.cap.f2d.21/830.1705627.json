In the search of a dwelling made by consent, no search warrant is necessary. Gatterdam v. U. S., C. C. A. 6, 5 F.(2d) 673, 674. As to whether such consent was freely given, there was a question of fact. The court found as a fact that consent,-was given and without, any duress.; this conclusion was amply supported by the evidence; no question of law thereon remains for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-32\">We cannot think that the statute of 1921 (U. S. Code, tit. 18, \u00a7 53 [18 USCA \u00a7 53]) intended to penalize a search to which the householder voluntarily agreed, much less, to make inadmissible evidence thus found. See U. S, v. Lindsly (D. C.) 7 F.(2d) 247.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-33\">Such possession as was here shown may constitute an offense separate from manufacture or sale (Albrecht v. U. S., 273 U. S. 1, 47 S. Ct. 250, 71 L. Ed. 505); and by the terms of the act (section 33, National Prohibition Act [27 USCA \u00a7 50; Comp. St. \u00a7 10138%t]), possession of liquor is prima facie evidence that it was kept for the purposes of sale, and hence that a nuisance was being maintained.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-34\">Regardless of the confession to which objection was made, the evidence made guilt practically indisputable.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
