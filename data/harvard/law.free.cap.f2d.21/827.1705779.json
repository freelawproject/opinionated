Criminal Code, \u00a7 37 (18 USCA \u00a7 88); Williamson v. United States, 207 U. S. 425, 447, 28 S. Ct. 163, 52 L. Ed. 278; Anderson v. United States (C. C. A.) 260 F. 557; United States v. Eisenminger (D. C.) 16 F.(2d) 816. The allegations of the count show that what the accused confederated and agreed among themselves to do was to transport intoxicating liquors from Savannah, Ga., to Chicago, 111. Those allegations do not show that the liquor agreed to be transported was to he fit for use for beverage purposes. They are consistent with the conclusion that what the accused agreed to transport was liquor not fit for use for beverage purposes. There are liquors which are intoxicating, but not fit for use for beverage purposes, which are not subject to the provisions of the National Prohibition Act. Section 4, tit. 2, 41 Stat. 309 (27 USCA \u00a7 13). The allegations of fact contained in the count in question could be sustained by proof that the accused agreed to transport from Savannah, Ga., to Chicago, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>HI., liquors which were intoxicating, but not fit for use for beverage purposes or subject to the provisions of the National Prohibition Act. The failure of the allegations of the count to show that the liquors agreed by the accused to be transported were liquors subject to the provisions of the National Prohibition Act as to transportation was a failure to allege an essential element of the offense which the count undertook to charge was conspired to be committed. Brauer v. United States (C. C. A.) 299 F. 10. The averments of the count fell short of showing that the conduct charged had the elements required to make it a crime against the United States. Hilt v. United States (C. C. A.) 279 F. 421; United States v. Eisenminger, supra. We conclude that the count in question was defective and subject to demurrer on the above set out ground. It follows that the ruling under consideration was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-4\">Because of that error, the judgment is reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
