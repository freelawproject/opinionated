An affidavit for attachment contains a sufficient statement of the na: ture of the plaintiff\u2019s claim, if in appropriate terms it refers to the petition and on examination the petition discloses such a cause arising on contract as would justify the issue of an attachment.</p><p id=\"b537-12\">Taber &amp; Clapp, for the defendant in error,</p><p id=\"b537-14\">This is a proceeding in error to reverse the judgment .of the court of common pleas of this county. The suit below was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>by the defendant in error, the National Supply Company, against the plaintiff in error, the American Manufacturing Company, to recover unliquidated damages to the amount of four thousand dollars, upon the breach of a certain contract alleged to have been entered into between the parties. The American Manufacturing Company, being a non-resident, was brought into court by proceedings in attachment, and the only ground of claimed error before us is, that the court below erred in'holding sufficient the affidavit for said attachment.</p><p id=\"b538-4\">\u25a0It is claimed that this affidavit is defective in that it does not with sufficient clearness state the nature of the plaintiff\u2019s claim. In this respect the affidavit says, \u201cThat the nature of the plaintiff\u2019s claim in this action is a demand arising upon contract, as is set forth in the petition filed herein.\u201d No attack is made upon the affidavit for any alleged insufficiency in other respects. It is not claimed that it does not sufficiently state a proper ground for the attachment \u2014 the non-residence of the defendant corporation \u2014 nor that it fails in any of the other averments required by the statute. It is insisted, however, that it does not sufficiently state the nature of the plaintiff\u2019s claim, and that its reference to the allegations of the petition, to reinforce and supply whatever may be lacking in the affidavit, is not permissible.</p><p id=\"b538-5\">An affidavit for an attachment may properly be divided into two essential parts. One is a statement of the nature of the claim, in order to show that it is a case in which an attachment may issue. The other is a statement of the ground of the attachment sought in the particular case. There are numerous grounds for an attachment; one of which is, that the defendant is a foreign corporation \u2014 or a non-resident of this state. This affidavit says both that the American Manufacturing Company is a non-resident of the state of Ohio and that it is a foreign corporation. The last clause of Section 5521, stating the grounds of attachment, provides that:</p><p id=\"b538-6\">\u201cAn attachment shall not be granted on the ground that the defendant is a foreign corporation or a non-resident of this state, for any claim other than a debt or demand arising upon contract, judgment or decree, or for causing death or a personal injury, by a negligent or wrongful act.\u201d</p><p id=\"b539-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>Section 5522 provides what are the requisites of the affidavit, as follows:</p><p id=\"b539-5\">\u201cAn order of attachment shall be made by the clerk of the court in which the action is brought, in any case mentioned in the preceding section, when there is filed in his office an affidavit of the plaintiff, his agent or attorney, showing: (1) The nature of the plaintiff\u2019s claim.\u201d</p><p id=\"b539-6\">Then there are certain other matters in regard to the justice of the claim and of the existence of one of the grounds for the attachment as provided in the preceding section. The statute does not provide that there shall be any especial form of stating the nature of the claim. Indeed, it does not say, in terms, that the affidavit shall state the nature of the claim, but it says that the affidavit shall show it \u2014 that is, that an affidavit shall be filed showing the nature of the plaintiff\u2019s claim. This affidavit \u2014 as has been once before said by this court in another case \u2014 is not directed to the court, but is rather for the information of the clerk and to authorize the clerk to issue the process in an attachment proceeding. In a case which I decided while on the common pleas bench <em>(Hoover &amp; Woodward </em>v. <em>Haslage, </em>5 Nisi Prius Reports, p. 90) I held that:</p><p id=\"b539-7\">\u201cIt is unnecessary, in an affidavit for attachment, to allege the facts constituting the cause of action on which the attachment is based. The plaintiff is required to state only the \u2018nature of the claim.\u2019 An affidavit which states that the action is \u2018upon a.book account for merchandise sold to said defendant, amounting to $471.47,\u2019 is in this respect a substantial compliance with the statute, and sufficient.\u201d</p><p id=\"b539-8\">This ease was affirmed by the circuit court; but, as no special emphasis was laid by the circuit court in its decision of the case upon the question of the sufficiency of the affidavit, in this statement of the nature of the claim, I will make no special reference to it further than to cite it, <em>infra.</em></p><p id=\"b540-4\">\u201cThe statute does not require the nature of the indebtedness to be described with any degree of particularity. The affidavit states the nature and amount of the indebtedness; and that is all that the law requires to be stated in regard to it.\u201d</p><p id=\"b540-6\">\u201cUnder the attachment law of 1827, which requires that the amount and nature of the indebtedness should be specified in the affidavit, it is sufficient to state that the non-resident is justly indebted to the plaintiff! in the sum of $-by his certain instrument in writing signed by him.\u201d</p><p id=\"b540-9\">In the ease at bar, we have an averment as to the justice of the claim \u2014 that the plaintiff ought to recover the sum of $4,000, and that the claim is one arising on contract, with the other reference \u25a0 already recited, to the petition for more specific information as to the character of the action. The Illinois court in the case just cited, says:</p><p id=\"b540-10\">\u201cThe proceeding must be considered as one against a nonresident debtor, and all the forms of the statute appear to have been complied with, unless the affidavit upon which the attachment was sued out should be defective in not sufficiently specifying the nature of the indebtedness. The statute requires that the plaintiff in the attachment shall specify in his complaint, on oath or affirmation, the amount and nature of the indebtedness of the defendant. The deposition sets out that Phelps is justly indebted unto the plaintiff 'in the sum of fourteen hundred dollars by his certain instrument of writing signed by him\u2019; and the question is thus presented for determination whether this is the description of specification intended by the statute. It would seem at a first examination of the object of the act, that there was not that compliance with its spirit in the specification given, as its framers intended, but when it is recollected that the plaintiff has filed his declara<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>tion, in which the entire canse of action is fully set forth, the objection loses its force.\u201d</p><p id=\"b541-4\">The ease of <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Chandler, </em>29 Louisiana Annual, p. 88, is a ease in which the affidavit for attachment was held to be aided by the averments of the petition. Probably in that case the affidavit was one upon the same sheet, or written with the petition itself, but I fail to see that that makes any substantial difference. The decision of the court was, in this respect, as follows:</p><p id=\"b541-5\">\u201cThe petition sets out clearly and distinctly a cause of action <em>ex contractu </em>a debt alleged to be due to plaintiff by defendant, and it charges that defendant is a non-resident. The affidavit is that \u2018all the allegations of the foregoing petition are true.\u2019 There can be no question as to the .sufficiency of this affidavit to authorize the order, and to maintain the writ of attachment.\u201d</p><p id=\"b541-6\">It does not seeni to be disputed by counsel for plaintiff in error that if the petition had been sworn to absolutely and the affidavit had then referred to it and made the petition a part of the affidavit, with such reference, that it might be used in aid of the affidavit-to determine the nature of the proceeding; but it is contended that in the case at bar the petition is not sworn to absolutely and that the affidavit does not expressly make the petition a part of it, although it says that the case is one arising on a contract, \u201cas is set forth in the petition filed herein.\u201d</p><p id=\"b541-8\">\u201cAverments in the petition in an action may, by express reference, be incorporated in an affidavit for attachment.\u201d</p><p id=\"b542-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>It is our view that this affidavit, while not quite so specifically-drawn as it might well have been, is still sufficient, if an examination of the petition to which'it refers discloses such a case arising on a contract as would .justify the issue of an attachment against a non-resident debtor. We think that tho petition discloses such a case. It is a case for unliquidated damages, but it is a case arising on a contract.</p><p id=\"b542-5\">\u201cAn attachment will lie on the ground that the defendant is a non-resident of the state under R. S. 5521, subs. 1 and 9, and constructive service may be obtained by publication, in an action for special damages for breach of land contract notwithstanding the fact that such damages are unliquidated.\u201d</p><p id=\"b542-7\">\u201cNegligence of a railway company by which a passenger is injured, may be made the basis of an action upon the company\u2019s contract to carry the passenger, or in tort, at the passenger\u2019s election,\u201d and \u201calthough the case was clearly one for unliquidated damages, the cause of action was one arising upon contract within the meaning of the attachment statute before referred to.\u201d \u2019</p><p id=\"b542-9\">Our conclusion is, that this ease is one in which an attachment is authorized; the affidavit discloses the fact that the defendant was a non-resident corporation and the other grounds for an attachment, and that there was brought to the knowledge of the clerk, before the issuing of the order of attachment, the nature of the plaintiff\u2019s claim with sufficient precision to justify the clerk in the issuance of the writ. We think that the court below did not err in overruling the motion to discharge the attachment, and the judgment below will be affirmed.</p><p id=\"b542-11\"><em>Taber &amp; Clapp, </em>for defendant in error.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"
