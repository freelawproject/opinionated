Crockett v. John H. Michael.</parties>\n<decisiondate id=\"b23-12\">Decided, December 19, 1906.</decisiondate>\n\n\n\n<judges id=\"b24-5\">Swing, J.; Jelke, J., and Giffen, J., concur.</judges>\n<summary id=\"b24-6\">This case should be reversed on the authority of <em>The Venn Duzen Gas \u00e9 Gasoline Go. </em>v. <em>SchcUes, </em>61 O. S., 298. At page 809, the court says:</summary>\n\n\n<attorneys id=\"b24-9\"><em>David Davis, </em>for the plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b24-10\"><em>Robertson &amp; Buchwaller, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<opinion><p id=\"b23-9\">OBEDIENCE OF A SERVANT TO AN ORDER INVOLVING DANGER. _</p><p id=\"b23-13\"><em>Master and Servant </em>\u2014 Negligence\u2014Servant <em>Injured while Executing an Order Involving Danger </em>\u2014 Liability <em>of Master.</em></p><p id=\"b23-14\">Where a servant is injured while endeavoring to execute an order involving obvious danger to himself, the question whether or not he was justified in obeying the instructions given him by the master is one which should be left to the jury.</p><p id=\"b23-15\">' The plaintiff while employed in the wagon factory of the defendant was directed by the defendant,, in person, to assist in taking the \u201ctaps\u201d or burrs from the axles of a wagon and raise it to the second floor on the elevator. The taps were removed, and the wagon was then run onto the elevator which was raised by a rope running over pulleys. When five or six feet high one of the wheels, having no tap or burr to hold it on, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>came off and fell to the floor. Plaintiff was struck by it and his leg was broken. TIis suit was for damages, based <em>on </em>the alleged negligence of the master. The trial judge granted a motion to take the case from the jury.</p><p id=\"b24-7\">\u201cThe clear result of the best considered cases is that when an order is given a servant by his superior to do something within his employment, apparently dangerous, and in obeying*he is injured from the culpable fault of the master, he may recover, unless obedience- to the order involved such obvious danger that no man of ordinary prudence would obey it; .and this is a question of fact for the jury to determine under proper instructions, and not of law for the court.\u201d</p><p id=\"b24-8\">It was certainly negligence of the master to order the taps taken off the axles before elevating the wagon as shown by the evidence. Whether the plaintiff was justified in executing the order of Michael, the master, with a knowledge of the obvious danger, was a fact which the court should have left to the jury.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"
