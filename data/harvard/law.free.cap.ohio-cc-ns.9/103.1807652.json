J., and Swing, J., concur.</judges>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<attorneys id=\"b112-11\"><em>C. W. Baker </em>and <em>II. C. Busch, </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b112-12\"><em>John W. Peck, </em>for defendant in error.'</attorneys>\n<opinion><p id=\"b111-6\">QUESTIONS IN APPROPRIATION PROCEEDINGS.</p><p id=\"b111-10\"><em>Eminent Domain </em>\u2014 Separate <em>Trials as to Separate Parcels Appropriated \u2014Doss of Future Business </em>\u2014 Admissibility <em>in Evidence of Plans of Building and Machinery\u25a0 </em>\u2014 Plans <em>must be Attached to Bill of Exceptions </em>\u2014 Value <em>of Switch Trade on the Property </em>Condemned\u2014 <em>Evidence of Values as Fixed by Compromise with Other </em>Oioners\u2014 <em>Error Proceedings.</em></p><p id=\"b111-11\">1. A property owner who has submitted without exception to a joint trial for the assessment of damages for various properties appropriated for railway purposes, can not be heard,to complain in the reviewing court that he was not given a separate trial.</p><p id=\"b111-13\">2. The amount of monthly sales and of freight transported over a switch track are incompetent as evidence, where offered for the purpose of proving loss of future business.</p><p id=\"AQG\">3. Plans of a building and of machinery are probably admissible, but whether or not their exclusion was prejudicial can not be determined where the plans are not attached to the bill of exceptions.</p><p id=\"b111-19\">In this case a large amount of property was appropriated for railway- purposes in a single action. As to many parcels agreements were reached, between the time of the filing of the peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>tion and return of the verdict, whereby the amount to be paid to 'the owners was fixed. The value of the property of the present plaintiff was determined by the jury, and the plaintiff being dissatisfied with the award prosecuted error.</p><p id=\"b112-5\">The question whether the condemnation proceedings should have been separate as to each individual property owner does not arise upon the record made, the Cincinnati Iron Store Co. interposing no objection in the trial court.</p><p id=\"b112-6\">The amount of the annual sales of the company and the value of the goods transported monthly over the switch track on the company\u2019s premises were sought to be shown evidently for the purpose of proving the loss of future business, which is too remote, uncertain and speculative to be allowed. <em>Railway </em>v. <em>Railway, </em>30 O. S., 604.</p><p id=\"b112-7\">The plans of the proposed beam or crane, if not those of the office building, were probably admissible evidence under the authority of <em>Railway Co. </em>v. <em>Longworlh, </em>30 O. S., 108; but neither set of plans being attached to the bill of exceptions the court can not determine whether their exclusion was prejudicial. <em>Palmer </em>v. <em>Yarrington, </em>1 O. S., 253.</p><p id=\"b112-8\">In proving the value of a switch track upon the premises sought to be condemned the cost of transporting by trucks the same amount of merchandise as that handled over the switch is not competent evidence. Evidence of sales by other lot owners made by compromise is inadmissible upon re-examination, although on cross-examination the witness has been asked concerning voluntary sales in the vicinity.</p><p id=\"b112-9\">The question and answer objected to on page 52 of the bill of exceptions were not prejudicial, nor that on page 112.</p><p id=\"b112-10\">Notwithstanding the wide difference between the values fixed by the witnesses for the trustees and those testified to by the company\u2019s witnesses, none of which was binding upon the jury, we think they arrived at a fair and just valuation, and finding no error in the record the judgment will be affirmed.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"
