A motion was made before the justice to discharge the attachment, which motion the justice overruled. Thereupon the defendant took an appeal to the court of common pleas. In that court the judge gave judgment discharging the attachment. Error is prosecuted to this court to reverse the judgment of the court of common pleas.</p><p id=\"b623-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>We are of the opinion that error does not lie to this court from the judgment of the judge of the court of common pleas.</p><p id=\"b623-4\">It is not the final judgment of the court of common pleas in an action pending therein. The statute, Section 6494, Revised Statutes, permits an appeal to the court or a judge, and it is intended that the question should be decided m three days by either, and when decided, the decision is to be sent to the justice and by him is to be entered as the final judgment in that matter-in the justice\u2019s court; and said property, moneys and credits are to be disposed of as directed in said judgment \u2014 that is, by the judgment of the justice. The judgment of the justice is the only final judgment in the action and the onl'r one to which error may be prosecuted.</p><p id=\"b623-5\">This court in a former case, which was not reported, so held. That case is referred to in 3 C. C. \u2014 N. S., 366.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"
