A motion'by defendant for a directed verdict in his favor, submitted after plaintiff has rested, is in the nature of a demurrer to the evidence, and calls for a decision vital to the controversy; and an effort by plaintiff to dismiss without prejudice comes too late, if delayed until after defendant\u2019s motion for a verdict has been granted.</p><p id=\"b73-14\">Error to the Court of Common Pleas.</p><p id=\"b73-15\">The plaintiff in error was plaintiff in the court of common pleas of this county, suing the Pope Motor Car Company and the Baker Motor Vehicle Company. He asserts in substance that on or about September 5, 1903, said defendants entered into a contest of speed of automobiles on grounds leased by the Cleveland Automobile Club, and while engaged in said contest they so negligently operated their respective automobiles and . drove them at so high a rate of speed that they lost control of them, with the result that they collided, whereupon the car owned by the Baker Motor Vehicle Company was hurled with frightful force and velocity across the track, which it left and crashed through a fence bounding said track and into a crowd of spectators. The plaintiff was one of them, and while in a proper place afid one which under ordinary eir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>cumstances was safe, he was struck by the car so leaving the track and received severe injuries. lie alleges damages and asks judgment for the same against both defendants.</p><p id=\"b74-5\">Issue was taken on these claims and the case proceeded to trial. After the introduction of evidence by the plaintiff he rested his case, whereupon both defendants moved for a verdict. These motions were considered by the court and passed upon, as disclosed by the bill of exceptions, as follows (I quote the language of the trial judge) :</p><p id=\"b74-6\">\u201cThis motion is sustained as to the Pope Motor Car Company for default of proof of its having entered a car. That must be sustained.. There is nothing to show that this car was operated by anybody in the employ of the Pope Motor Car Company, and that it owned the car. I find there is no negligence shown against either of these companies, and the motion as to both will be sustained.\u201d</p><p id=\"b74-8\">\u201cI am perfectly satisfied from this deposition and from the claim made here that the Pope Motor Car Company did not enter this car and did not control it. I think there is no doubt about that, but it now develops that a local company, unknown to us, until we appeared in this trial, did enter it and control it.</p><p id=\"b74-9\">\u201cI have no objection to the granting of this motion as to the Pope Motor Car Company, because they did not enter and did not control it, but I do not want that motion granted as to the Baker Company, because this plaintiff has a right to bring his action against the party that did enter and control jointly with the Baker. I am asking that as to the Baker Company this action may be dismissed without prejudice.\u201d</p><p id=\"b74-10\">After some discussion the court took the matter under advisement until the following morning. At that time, on the convening of the court counsel for the plaintiff said:</p><p id=\"b74-11\">\u2018 \u2018 The plaintiff now, before any other order is made or found, dismisses this case as to the defendants, without prejudice.\u201d</p><p id=\"b74-12\">And the jury having been called by' the court, counsel for plaintiff renewed his attempt to dismiss in the following words:</p><p id=\"b75-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>\u201cIf the court pleases, before any direction to the jury is given in this case, the plaintiff dismisses the same as to both the defendants, without prejudice.\u201d</p><p id=\"b75-5\">The court thereupon refused to enter the dismissal and directed a verdict for the defendants, which was at once returned by the jury.</p><p id=\"b75-6\">To the refusal of the court to enter the dismissal of the case without prejudice, and to the direction given to the jury, plaintiff excepted, and filed his motion for a new trial, asserting as ground therefor not only the refusal to enter the dismissal of the action, but also the instruction to the jury to find for the defendants.</p><p id=\"b75-7\">AVhile, as appears from the foregoing statement, the plaintiff expressly conceded the correctness of the court\u2019s ruling on the motion to instruct the jury to find for the Pope Motor Car Company, his attempt to dismiss his action without prejudice to another was made to apply to both defendants. I will not spend time in discussion whether any distinction is now to be drawn between their relative rights as to such dismissal. It is very clear, however, that the court\u2019s action in charging the jury to find for the Pope Company can not now be relied on as ground for new trial, if the case was still in court for any charge at all.</p><p id=\"b75-8\">And as to both defendants we need not tarry long to consider the court\u2019s action in sustaining their motions, so far as it is affected by the sufficiency or insufficiency of the evidence. The bill of exceptions, as we read it, <em>does </em>not purport to contain all the evidence which had been offered by the plaintiff before resting; and, as I am informed by my present associates, this court has repeatedly held that it will not presume error of the court below under such circumstances; in other words, that even under the scintilla rule the reviewing court can not determine that there was an issue of fact proper to be submitted to the jury, Avhere such court has not before it the evidence and all of it bearing on such issue.</p><p id=\"b75-9\">The remaining question, and that on AA'hieh most emphasis has been placed in argument, is that raised by plaintiff\u2019s effort <em>to </em>dismiss his action against the defendants Avithout prejudice.</p><p id=\"b76-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>Referring to Section 5314 of the Revised Statutes, we find the provision relied on by the plaintiff as sustaining his contention of error, as follows:</p><p id=\"b76-4\">\u201cAn action may be dismissed without prejudice to a future action. 1. By the plaintiff, before the final submission of the case .to the jury, or to the court, when the trial is by the court. \u2019 \u2019</p><p id=\"b76-5\">It is urged that the trial here was to the jury and that there was no \u201cfinal submission of the ease\u201d until the jury had been charged by the court. On the other hand, it is contended that when the plaintiff had rested his ease, and a motion was addressed to the court by the defendants, raising an issue vital to the determination of the action, the ease was thereby submitted to the court, and that an effort by the plaintiff to dismiss after the court had announced its opinion and had sustained the motions, was too late.</p><p id=\"Ac\">It can not be denied that the plaintiff\u2019s contention has the support of respectable authority outside of the state: but it should not be adopted unless it is in harmony with the spirit as well as the letter of our statute. An aid to the proper construction of the law may be found in the evident purpose of its\u2019 enactment and its limitations. That justice should not fail because of technical defects in the preparation and presentation of an action, the right is given to the plaintiff to dismiss and begin anew; but the exercise of this right is limited to a period prior to the final submission of the ease. Why this limitation? If the plaintiff- has failed in his action by reason of lack of evidence on its first trial, why may he not have repeated retrials at his discretion until he obtains his due? Manifestly because the rights of defendants are involved. They can not justly be subjected to unnecessary loss of time and expense of litigation, to enable the plaintiff to readjudicate his claims after a competent tribunal has once decided them. The motion in this case, presented by the defendants, called for a decision of the court which was vital to the controversy. It was in the nature of a demurrer to the evidence, and we see no reason, when we look to the spirit and purpose of this statute, why it should not be treated much as a demurrer to a petition-would be; a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>submission to the court of the question whether the case presented by the plaintiff in evidence as in the other case by petition, would warrant a judgment.</p><p id=\"b77-6\">\u201cWhere a ease is submitted to the court on a demurrer to the answer, the ground of the demurrer being that the answer does not contain a defense, and the demurrer is overruled, the plaintiff can not, without the leave of the court, dismiss his action without prejudice. The submission of the case on the demurrer is a final submission of the ease within the meaning of Section 372 of the code (now R. S. 5314), unless leave is obtained to reply or amend.\u201d</p><p id=\"b77-7\">It may be noted in passing that no appeal was made to the court in the case at bar to withdraw a juror and permit the plaintiff on a retrial to fortify his case by additional evidence. Such a procedure would seem somewhat analogous to the amending of a pleading, after demurrer, for insufficiency; a procedure altogether discretionary with the court to grant or refuse.</p><p id=\"b77-8\">On page 457 of the opinion in <em>Beaumont </em>v. <em>Fletcher, supra, </em>it is said as a ground for the holding which I have quoted :</p><p id=\"b77-9\">\u201cThe legal consequence of the overruling of the demurrer was a judgment of dismissal.\u201d</p><p id=\"b77-10\">So, in this case, the legal consequence of the court\u2019s ruling on defendant\u2019s motion was a judgment of dismissal; but, as in the case cited, without preservation of a right to prosecute another suit.</p><p id=\"b77-11\">The case of <em>Crowley </em>v. <em>Chamberlain &lt;&amp; Co., </em>6 0. D., Reprints, 377, decided by the Hamilton District Court in 1880 and undisturbed and unquestioned so far as we are informed by any subsequent Ohio decisions, is more directly in [joint. The facts were substantially as in' the case at bar, arid the court, sustaining the Superior Court of Cincinnati, held that there was no error in refusing permission to the plaintiff to dismiss his action without prejudice.</p><p id=\"b78-5\">Without further discussion, it is sufficient to say that our view sustains the opinion and judgment of the trial court and the judgment will be affirmed.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"
