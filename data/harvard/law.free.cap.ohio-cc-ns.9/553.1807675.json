Stanfeal was convicted under Section 7033-1, Revised Statutes, of barbering on Sunday, and sentenced to pay a fine of fifteen dollars and costs. It is urged that by the commitment he is denied the right to secure the fine and costs to be paid, as provided by Section 1536-793, Revised Statutes. While it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>is true that this omission maltes the penalty more oppressive than is warranted by statute, yet it is only an irregularity which may be corrected by proceedings in error, but not by <em>habeas corptis. Ex parle Joseph Van </em>Hagan, 26 O. S., 426.</p><p id=\"b562-4\">Section. 7033-1, Revised Statutes, is not unconstitutional and void, because of the failure to provide therein a maximum penalty. The power of the court in administering the law is limited by Section 9, Article I, of the Constitution of the state. <em>Frise </em>v. <em>Slate, </em>23 Fla., 267; <em>In re Yell, </em>107 Mich., 228.</p><p id=\"b562-5\">Where a person is convicted under Section 7033-1, Revised Statutes, and ordered to be committed until the fine imposed and costs taxed are paid or he be otherwise discharged according to law, it is not error on <em>habeas corpus </em>to direct the mayor issuing the process to amend the mittimus by providing that the fine and costs may be secured to.be paid. <em>The People, ex rel, </em>v. <em>Killy, </em>97 N. Y., 212; <em>In re Charles Harris, </em>68 Vt., 243.</p><p id=\"b562-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"
