S., 587-592.</summary>\n\n\n\n<summary id=\"b72-9\">Judgment affirmed. Same entry in the case of <em>Scully, Administrator, </em>v. <em>The City of Cincinnati el al </em>and <em>Burnet </em>v. <em>The City of Cincinnati et al </em>(4289 and 4290).</summary>\n<attorneys id=\"b72-10\"><em>John C.

Schindel, </em>for defendants in error.</attorneys>\n<opinion><p id=\"b71-15\">Nine annual installments of a lien for a street assessment remained unpaid at the time of the appropriation by the city for park purposes of the property so assessed. In making its order of distribution of the amount assessed by the jury as compensation to the land owners, the court below -retained a sufficient sum to satisfy the claim of the city for the unpaid assessments, Eium this older an appeal was tateu,</p><p id=\"b72-6\">Section 1536-110, Revised Statutes, provides that, \u201cThe jury shall be sworn to make the whole inquiry and assessment,\u201d and the record shows that they assessed the compensation to be paid for the several lots to the owner or <em>owners </em>of each particular lot.</p><p id=\"b72-7\">Whether or not the city was an owner by reason of its lien upon the real estate for unpaid assessments is immaterial, as its claims were adverse to the lot owners, and the adjustment of such claims is provided for by Section 1536-111, Revised Statutes.</p><p id=\"b72-8\">If no such adjustment were had in this proceeding, the lien would be merged in the higher title of the fee thereby acquired. The city was entitled to only the present value of the annual assessments; but the lot owners having declined to plead further, after demurrer overruled, will be deemed 'to have waived such defense.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"
