Cincinnati township and the city of Cincinnati were at that time co-extensive, and the village of Winton Place was adjacent thereto.</summary>\n<summary id=\"b332-17\">On April 12, 1904, that part of Millcreek township embracing the village was annexed to Cincinnati township.</summary>\n\n\n<summary id=\"b333-5\">The repealing sections, 91 O.

Darby, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<opinion><p id=\"b332-8\"><em>Justices of the Peace </em>\u2014 Section 568, <em>as Amended, </em>Unconstitutional\u2014 <em>Original Statute in Force </em>\u2014 Annexation <em>of Territory </em>\u2014 Justice <em>Located in, Serves Out Term </em>\u2014 Number <em>of Justices can only be Increased, How.</em></p><p id=\"b332-11\">2. By reason of annexation and by force of the last part of Section 568, a justice of the peace is authorized to perform the duties of his office in the township to which the territory in which he resides has been annexed, but only until the end of the term of three yars for which he was elected.</p><p id=\"b332-13\">3. In such a case no new office of justice of the peace is created for which a successor should be elected and qualified; it is only by application to and determination by the probate judge of the county, in accordance with the provisions in the first part of Section 568, that the number of justices of the peace can be permanently increased.</p><p id=\"b333-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>From and after April 12, 1904, the defendant exercised the duties of justice of the peace in Cincinnati township the same as if he had been elected therefor. This action was commenced to determine by what right, if any, the defendant holds the office of justice of the peace for Cincinnati township.</p><p id=\"b333-4\">Section 568, Revised Statutes, is, by reason of the exception in favor of certain counties, unconstitutional and void.</p><p id=\"b333-6\">Although defendant\u2019s term of three years expired April 16, 1906, he claims the right to hold over until his successor is elected and qualified, by virtu\u00e9 of Article XVII, Section 3, of the Constitution as amended November 7th, 1905, which provides as follows:</p><p id=\"b333-7\">\u201cEvery elective officer holding office when this amendment is adopted shall continue to hold such office for the full term for which he was elected and until his successor 'shall be elected and qualified as provided by law.\u201d</p><p id=\"b333-8\">The demurrer to the answer presents the question whether there is any lawful authority to elect a successor to the defendant as justice of the peace of Cincinnati township. He avers in his answer \u201cthat there are now five and no more persons in said Cincinnati township performing and exercising the office, and duties of justice of the peace,\u201d but he. does not aver that this number was authorized or judicially determined under Section 568 or any other section of the Revised Statutes, except by reason of the annexation of territory, and by force of Section 568 one additional justice is created. This section, however, only provides that he shall execute the duties of his office in the township to which the same is attached in the same manner as if he had been elected for such township, and while the annexation of territory may afford a sufficient reason for increasing the number of justices in a township, the question must, upon application and after public notice, be determined by the probate judge of the county.</p><p id=\"b334-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>His continuance in office in the township to which it was attached was intended, under this section, only to complete the term of three years for which he was elected and not to create an office for which a successor should be elected and qualified. The demurrer to the answer will therefore be sustained.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"
