At the conclusion of plaintiff\u2019s testimony each defendant moved the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>court for judgment, which motion by Cunningham was granted and judgment rendered in his favor. The motion of the city was overruled; but the court of its own motion decided that the petition did not constitute a good cause of action against the city, and after withdrawing a juror continued the cause to enable the plaintiff to prepare an amended petition if she so desired.</p><p id=\"b463-4\"><em>Held: </em>No judgment against the city, nor final order within the meaning of Section 6707, Revised Statutes, was rendered by the court. It does not appear that any of the orders made \u2018\u2018in effect determined -the action and prevented a judgment. <em>\u2019\u2019 </em>The city may upon the final hearing of the cause succeed in its defense. The record therefore discloses no ground for a proceeding in error by the city, and its petition in error will be stricken from the files. <em>Holbrook </em>v. <em>Connelly, </em>6 O.
