Sayles\u2019 Civ. Stats., arts. 2171, 2172, 2173, 2384; Huffman v. Schmidt, 65 Texas, 585; Pressler v. Wilke, 84 Texas, 345; The State v.

Under this is comprehended a survivor in community, for he is after all, with certain well defined distinctions, an administrator. The manage-ment of community property is treated as an administration. Sayles\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>Civ.

Acts of 1876, p. 124, sec. 116; p. 285, sec. 6; Rev. Stats., Final Title, sec. 19. The statute does not in terms provide any such commission. It is allowed only \u201c upon the actual cash receipts of each executor, administrator, or guardian.\u201d Nowhere, either in the original enactments- or in the Revised Statutes, is the survivor in community termed an administrator, but always the words <em>\u201c </em>survivor in community\u201d are used to describe and distinguish such partnership survivor or trustee from an executor, administrator, or guardian.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">The case comes neither within the letter nor the spirit of the statute. There was a partition ordered upon the application of the heirs, as provided in the statute, but the commission in question was claimed upon sales previously made, without the supervision of the Probate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-9\">We conclude that the judgment should be reversed and here rendered for appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-10\">\n<em>Reversed and rendered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
