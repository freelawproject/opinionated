Tort \u2014 Actual and Exemplary Damages. \u2014 Mendere owned and with his family occupied a house built upon his lot adjoining a lot owned by Nolan. Nolan constructed a shed or livery stable for stock upon his own lot, and without Mendere\u2019s consent and against his protest cut holes in the walls of Mendere\u2019s house, which was built near the dividing line, and made it a part of the shed. In \u2022addition to causing actual damages, Nolan acted wantonly and without regard to Mendere\u2019s rights, and greatly disturbed him and his family. <em>Held, </em>a verdict and judgment in favor of Mendere for $100 actual and $135 exemplary damages \u2022are sustained by the evidence.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b229-7\">2.

The court erred in the second charge given to the jury, in this, that after reciting the facts which would justify the finding of exemplary damages, the said charge contains this language, \u201c then you should find for the plaintiff what in law are termed exemplary damages, as punishment, in such reasonable sum as you may see proper,\u201d whereas it was a matter of discretion with the jury to find the damages or not, and not a matter of right upon the part of the plaintiff.

The verdict of the jury for exemplary damages is contrary to the law and the evidence, because there is no sufficient evidence to show that the defendant acted through malice or with gross negligence, or in such a manner as to show a reckless disregard of the rights of plaintiff. 1 Suth. on Dam., 824; Hays v.

If the jury believed from the evidence that appellant cut holes or drove plugs in the wall of appellee without his consent, or that he caused it to be done, and that the wall was thereby damaged; and if they believed in so doing appellant acted willfully and maliciously, or with gross negligence, or in such a way as to show an utter and reckless disregard of the rights of appellee, then it was proper for the court to charge the jury that they should find for appellee exemplary damages in such reasonable sum as they saw proper.

If appellant cut holes or drove plugs in appellee\u2019s wall without his consent, or caused it to be done, and not only refused to desist when warned that it would ruin appellee\u2019s wall, but ordered his employes to go on with the work, and the wall was damaged thereby, he would be liable for exemplary damages.

Appellant constructed a shed or livery stable for stock upon his own lot, and without appellee\u2019s consent, and against his protest, cut holes in the wall of his house and made it a part of appellant\u2019s shed, whereby the wall was damaged and injured to the full extent of the actual damages found by the jury. In addition to the actual damage, appellant acted wantonly and without regard to the appellee\u2019s rights, and greatly disturbed him and his family, to such an extent that the verdict for punitory or vindictive damages is fully sustained by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">Appellee brought suit for damages, and there was a verdict and judgment for appellee for $100 actual damages and $135 exemplary damages, from which this appeal was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\"><em>Conclusions of Laic. </em>\u2014 1. The first assignment of error complains of that part of the charge of the court which instructs the jury upon the question of exemplary damages, as follows: \u201cIf you believe that the defendant cut holes or drove plugs in the wall of plaintiff, or that he caused this to be done, and that the wall was thereby damaged; and if you believe in so doing the defendant acted willfully and maliciously, or with gross negligence, or in such a way as to show an utter and reckless disregard of the rights of plaintiff, then you should find for plaintiff what in law are termed exemplary damages, by way of punishment of defendant, in such reasonable sum as you may see proper.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b230-9\">Appellant objects to the use of the word <em>should </em>in the above charge as error, and insists that the word <em>may </em>was necessary and was the only proper word in that connection; and insists that the use of the word <em>should </em>was equivalent to a direct instruction to find for plaintiff exemplary damages. In the case of Mayer, Kahn &amp; Freiberg v. Duke, 72 Texas, 445, Judge Gaines, commenting upon this exact question, on page 453 says: \u201cWe are aware that it is usual to instruct the jury in cases calling for a charge upon the subject, that they \u2018 may \u2019 give exemplary damages, provided they find a certain state of facts proved by the evidence. * * * Yet, it seems to me, in many cases, at least, it would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>not have been error for them to have gone further and instructed the juries that they should find exemplary damages, if they found the facts proved which warranted such damages.\u201d</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b231-9\">Delivered January 10, 1894.</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">We think the facts of this case justify the charge, and there was no error in giving it.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">2. The only remaining assignment presented in the brief of appellant is, that the verdict of the jury is contrary to the law and the evidence, because there is not sufficient evidence to authorize a finding for exemplary damages. We think the evidence was amply sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
