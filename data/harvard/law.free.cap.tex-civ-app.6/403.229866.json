Damages \u2014 Special Exceptions. \u2014 In a suit against a telegraph company. plaintiff alleged that by reason of the delay in the transmission of the message, another message costing 40 cents was sent, inquiring about the delay, which plaintiff was compelled to pay, and by reason of said delay a hack was sent by L. A. L. Lampkin, a relation of plaintiff, to take plaintiff\u2019s family to Harwood, and defendant is responsible for the same in the sum of $5. <em>Held, </em>that the sending of the hack would not be such damages as might reasonably have been contemplated would result from the failure to deliver the message with dispatch. and as was the natural and proximate result of such neglect of duty, and' the exception should have been sustained thereto. This error can be cured by remittitur. It might have been anticipated by the company that if it failed to-deliver the message promptly inquiry would be made by telegram in regard to-it, and this would cost something, and would be a proper element of damages.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b430-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>Texas Civil Appeals Reports. <em>\\_4tli District,</em></headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b430-4\">2.

Damages were also claimed for expenses incurred by a relative sending another message and a hack, for the expenses of which it was alleged the defendant became liable. The cause was tried by a jury, resulting in a verdict and judgment for plaintiff for $750, from which judgment this appeal is taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\"><em>Conclusions of Fact. </em>\u2014 1. Appellee\u2019s wife\u2019s father, J. L. Lampkin, being sick at Harwood, about eighteen miles from Lockhart, where plaintiff and his wife then resided, J. L. Norwood, acting for appellee and his wife, delivered to appellant\u2019s agent at Harwood, at 6:10 o\u2019clock p. m., August 1, 1891, for transmission by telegraph at Lockhart, Texas, the following message:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-12\">\u201cHarwood, Texas, August 1.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-13\">\n<em>\u201cTo I. E. Jobe, Lockhart, Teams:</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-14\"><em>\u201c </em>Mr. Lampkin is worse. Come down at once.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-15\">\u201c J. L. Norwood.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-16\">For the transmission of which message he paid appellant\u2019s agent for appellee 25 cents. The message was written on one of appellant\u2019s blanks, upon which was printed the following: \u201c Form number 1. The Western Union Telegraph Company. The company transmits and delivers messages only on conditions limiting its liability, which have been assented to by the sender of the following message. Errors can be guarded against only by repeating a message back to the sending station for comparison, and the company will not hold itself liable for errors or delays in transmission or delivery of unrepeated messages, beyond the amount of tolls paid thereon, nor in any case where the claim is not presented in writing within sixty days after the message is filed with the company for transmission. This is an unrepeated message, and is delivered by request of the sender under the conditions named above.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b431-17\">2. The relationship between plaintiff\u2019s wife and J. L. Lampkin, and. the serious illness of the latter, were known to appellant\u2019s agent at Harwood when the telegram was delivered her for transmission.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-18\">3. To transmit the message over appellant\u2019s wires to its destination it was necessary to telegraph it to San Antonio, thence to San Marcos, and from there to Lockhart. The message was received by appellant\u2019s agent in Lockhart at 8:20 p. m., August 1, 1891, but was not delivered to appellee until near 10 a. m. on the following day. I. E. Jobe was well known in Lockhart, and resided near appellant\u2019s telegraph office, and by the exercise of ordinary care and diligence the message could have been delivered within a few minutes after it was received by appellant\u2019s agent in that town, but such care and diligence was not used by appellant\u2019s servants in its delivery.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>4. J. L. Lampkin was on his deathbed when the message was delivered for transmission to appellant\u2019s agent at Harwood, and died at 10 o\u2019clock a. m., August 2, 1891.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">5. That by reason of the delay in the delivery of the message to appellee, his wife was prevented from reaching his father\u2019s bedside until after his death, by reason of which she suffered great mental anguish.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\"><em>Conclusions of Law. </em>\u2014 The petition alleged that plaintiff\u2019s wife\u2019s father, J. L. Lampkin, being ill at Harwood, eighteen miles from Lockhart, J. L. Norwood, acting for plaintiff and his wife, delivered to defendant\u2019s agent at 4:30 p. m., August 1, 1891, the following message:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-7\">\u201cHarwood, Texas, August 1.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-8\">\u201cTo <em>I. E. Jobe, Lockhart, Texas:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-9\">\u201c Mr. Lampkin is worse. Come down at once.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-10\">\u201c J. L. Norwood.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b432-11\">That defendant had notice of the relationship-of plaintiff\u2019s wife, and \u201cthat it was absolutely necessary that plaintiff should get the message in the shortest possible time.\u201d That defendant did not deliver it until 10:30 a. m., August 2, 1891. That plaintiff lived and did business as a merchant in Lockhart. That if the message had been delivered promptly, plaintiff\u2019s wife could and would have been with her father in three hours after receipt of message. That the father died at 10:15 a. m., August 2, 1891. That immediately after receiving the message, plaintiff\u2019s wife left for Harwood in a private conveyance.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-12\">\u201c That by reason of the delay in the transmission of said message, another message, costing the sum of 40 cents, was sent to plaintiff, inquiring about delay, and he was compelled to pay for the same; and by reason of said delay a hack was sent by L. A. L. Lampkin, a relation of plaintiff, from Luling to Lockhart, to take plaintiff\u2019s family to Harwood, and defendant is responsible for the same in the sum of $5; * * * and he pleads all these items as damages occasioned by the carelessness and neglect of defendant in transmitting and delivering said telegram.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b432-13\">The defendant specially excepted to the petition, upon the ground that the allegations as a basis for the recovery of the items $5 and 40 cents as actual damages are not sufficiently specific to put defendant on its defense against the same, or to authorize recovery; that the necessity of said expenditures and the special circumstances rendering them recoverable, are not set forth, and the same do not appear to be the natural and proximate result of the negligence complained of.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-14\">The action of the court in overruling this exception is complained of as error. We think this assignment is well taken as to the item of 85 claimed for the hack. The appellant can be held liable only for such damages as it might have reasonably contemplated would result from its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>failure to deliver the message with reasonable dispatch, and as were the natural and proximate result of such neglect of duty. At the time the message was delivered to the company, or at any time before its delivery to appellee, it could not have been reasonably contemplated by the agents \u2022of appellant that appellee\u2019s relatives had sent or would send a hack from Luling to Lockhart for his family, and there was no allegation to the effect that appellee\u2019s agent, or any one else, had informed the company or its agents that a hack had been or would be sent for appellee\u2019s family; nor can we see how the sending of the hack as alleged would naturally and proximately flow from a breach of appellant\u2019s duty. It might have been reasonably anticipated by the company that if it failed promptly to deliver this message, inquiry would be made by telegram in regard to it, and that an inquiry by such means would cost something; and we think the exception to that part of the petition claiming damages for the cost of such a telegraphic inquiry was not good.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">The matter in the petition to which the exception was urged was not directly submitted to the jury in the court\u2019s charge. But it was not withdrawn. And as the appellee testified, that \u201c he heard that L. A. L. Lampkin sent a hack from Luling to Lockhart for his family, and it was worth \u00a74 for a hack from Luling to Lockhart,\u201d and the court having instructed the jury if they found certain facts to find for plaintiff such damages as you deem just and proper under all the evidence, the jury might have considered the item as an element of damages, and included it in its verdict. We think, however, that this error can be cured by a remittitur.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">The appellant also pleaded that there was an error in the address in the message as it was received in Lockhart, which was caused without its fault, and that its agent at Lockhart, on account of the error, did not and could not know for whom it was intended. That when received its office was closed, and that on account of its being compelled, on the morning of the 2nd day of August, 1891, for a short time to surrender the use of its lines to the use of the Missouri, Kansas &amp; Texas Railway \u25a0Company in conducting and directing its trains, there may have been some delay in the discovery of the error and delivery of the message. The part of the answer by which appellant sought to excuse the delay upon the ground that its wires were surrendered to the railway company was excepted to by appellee, and the exception sustained. Upon the authority of Telegraph Company v. Rosentreter, 80 Texas, 406, we hold this was not error.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">The appellant pleaded, that at the time the contract for the transmission of the message was entered into, it was stipulated that appellant should not be liable for damages in any case where the claim is not presented in writing within sixty days after sending the message, and that ^appellee\u2019s claim was not presented either within that period or ninety <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>days. An exception was made by appellee, and sustained by the court, to the answer pleading this stipulation as a defense. We think the exception was properly sustained. \u201c No stipulation in any contract requiring notice to be given of any claim for damages as a condition precedent to the right to sue thereon shall ever be valid, unless such stipulation is reasonable; and any such stipulation fixing the time within which such notice shall be given at a less period than ninety days shall be void.\u201d Acts 22nd Leg., sec. 2, p. 20. We do not believe that the act from which-the quotation is made is violative of article 3, section 35, of our Constitution. The stipulation requiring the notice to be given within a less period than ninety days is void, and no notice whatever was necessary as a condition precedent to the institution of the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">No notice being required, the ruling of the court upon evidence offered-by appellee to prove that notice such as was stipulated was given within ninety days, and the refusal of the court to give the special charge relating to such testimony asked by appellant, are immaterial, and in no way affected the merits of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">J. E. Lampkin, a son of the deceased, was allowed to testify, over appellant\u2019s objections, as follows: \u201c We had sent messages to Lockhart in February and March, 1891, to Mrs. Ray and Mrs. Jobe about father\u2019s-condition.\u201d This testimony was admissible as a circumstance to show that appellant\u2019s agent knew at the time she received the message for transmission of the relationship existing between the deceased and appellee\u2019s wife. And as it was the fact of sending such messages which was sought to be established as a circumstance to prove such knowledge, it was unnecessary to produce the original message for the purpose of proving it.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">Witnesses were allowed to testify, over appellant\u2019s objections, as to-how appellee\u2019s wife seemed to be affected by reason of her failure to get-the message in time to reach her father before his death. In a case like this, where similar testimony was offered, our Supreme Court said: &lt;\u2018As-the jury would be instructed that they might in assessing damages include her mental anguish in their estimate, it was doubtless thought that, evidence of mental condition * * * might be given. As juries may from their own knowledge and experience of human nature estimate damages proceeding from that cause without any evidence, it is not important to produce it, and when produced it ought not, as a general rule, to have a controlling effect; and yet we are not able to see why the fact that mental anguish was felt and was exhibited by speech or otherwise may not be proved for what it may be worth. It at least furnishes no ground for-setting aside a verdict that might be sustained without any evidence as-to the existence or degree of mental pain.\u201d Tel. Co. v. Adams, 75 Texas, 535.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-10\">The quotation from the decision applies as well to the expression of appellant\u2019s wife, \u201c Words of mine are inadequate to describe my feelings,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>and to her statement, \u201c While I suffered great mental pain on account of not being with my father in his last moments, and with the remainder of his family at that time in their affliction, yet I suppose that any other-child who was devoted to a father and desired to be with him in his last hours, would suffer as much as I did,\u201d which were also admitted in evidence over appellant\u2019s objections.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b435-10\">Delivered February 7, 1894.</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">It does not appear that the jury was influenced in their verdict by the remarks of appellee\u2019s counsel in his opening address. The remarks were improper, but the other counsel for appellee, in his closing address, strenuously insisted to the jury that it was their duty to banish from their minds-such effect, if any, such remarks may have had upon them.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">We think the charge of the court fully and correctly instructed the jury as to the law applicable to the case, and that there was no error in the court\u2019s refusal to give any of the special charges asked by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">If the appellee will enter a remittitur in this court by February 7, 1894, of $5 on the judgment recovered1 in the court below, the judgment will be affirmed and the costs of this appeal taxed against appellee; otherwise the judgment will be reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">\n<em>Appellee to remit \u00a75 and pay costs;</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b435-9\">\n<em>Then affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b435-11\">Justice Fly did did not sit in this case.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b435-12\">ON MOTION FOR REHEARING.</p>\n<author id=\"b435-13\">NEILL, Associate Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"Ajc\">As counsel for appellant question the correctness of our first, second, third, and fourth conclusions of fact, we will give the testimony upon which they are based. As to the first: J. L. Norwood,'plaintiff\u2019s agent who sent the message, swore that the message-copied in our conclusion is the message in exact words dictated by him-to appellant\u2019s agent at Harwood; that it is just what he dictated to her; that he had never heard of any firm of I. E. Jobe &amp; Co., and did not tell appellant\u2019s operator to address the message to I. E. Jobe <em>&amp; </em>Co.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-15\">This message had to be transmitted via San Antonio, from there to San Marcos, and from thence to Lockhart, its destination. When the message was received at San Marcos by appellant\u2019s agent there, it was just as it is-set out in our conclusion. At least appellant\u2019s operator there testified thatitwas; for she says: \u201c The message was addressed to I. E. Jobe, Lock-hart, Texas. I received the message just like the copy above set out [the one copied in the court\u2019s conclusion], and I forwarded it. It is and was addressed to I. E. Jobe, Lockhart. I received it by sound. That is my usual and only way of receiving a message.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b435-16\">On the other hand, appellant\u2019s operator at Harwood swore that she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>wrote the message just as Mr. Norwood dictated it to her, and she wrote it just as it now is (referring to a message which she identified as the original), \u201c I. E. Jobe &amp; Co.; \u201d and the agent at San Antonio testified that the message he received there was addressed to I. E. Jobe &amp; Co., and that he wired it to San Marcos, addressed just as he received it.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">This is the substance of the testimony in relation to our first conclusion of fact, and we believe that it is reasonably sufficient to support it. There can be no question, however, about the telegram being directed to either \u201cI. E. Jobe\u201d or \u201cI. E. Jobe &amp; Co.,\u201d and we concur with the district judge in his instruction to the jury, that \u201cunder the circumstances in this case, it would not matter whether it was directed to one or the other.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">As to our second conclusion, which is, that \u201c The relationship between plaintiff\u2019s wife and J. L. Lampkin, and the serious illness of the latter, were known to appellant\u2019s agent at Harwood when the telegram was delivered her for transmission.\u201d The evidence upon which we base it is as follows: J. E. Lampkin, a son of deceased, testified: \u201cI know and then knew [referring to date of message] the manager of defendant\u2019s office at Harwood. It was Miss Dean Ri\u00f3hardson. She knew our family, and knew the condition of my father. She knew the relations existing between John Lampkin [his father] and Mrs. Jobe. Harwood is a very small place, and people all know each other.\u201d Appellee\u2019s wife was at her father\u2019s house in July, 1891, which was during his last illness. Miss Richardson does not say that she did not know the relationship existing between the deceased and Mrs. Jobe. On direct examination her testimony was, \u201cI did not know Mr. I. E. Jobe, nor his wife.\u201d But on cross-examination she said, \u201cI had heard that Mr. Lampkin, the man who died at Harwood, had a daughter whose name was Mrs. Jobe, also one named Mrs. Ray, but I did not know them at the time.\u201d The very last sentence of her testimony is, \u201c When the message was received from J. L. Norwood I knew Mrs. Jobe, plaintiff\u2019s wife, was a daughter of John Lamp-kin.\u201d She of her own motion wrote the note on the message: \u201cHave asked San Antonio to use every effort to get this message through to-night to Lockhart, as Mr. Lampkin may not live until to-morrow. B.\u2019 \u2019 This shows she knew the importance of getting the message to Lockhart the night she received it for transmission. The voluntary interest that it manifested she felt in the matter is a circumstance to be considered in determining whether she knew of the relationship between the parties; and when it is taken in connection with the evidence quoted, and the fact that she did' not deny knowledge of such relationship, we think that this couft is fully warranted in its conclusion. A different conclusion on our part would, in our opinion, be an invasion of the province of the jury, who must have found as we have to have rendered the verdict for appellee. The verdict is reasonably supported by the evidence, and we conceive it our duty to sustain it.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>As to our third conclusion of fact: It is complained of because it ignores, in finding that the message arrived at Lockhart at 8:20 p. m., August 1,1891, the fact that when it so arrived it was by reason of erroneous transmission addressed to John Lampkin. If such is a \u201c fact,\u201d we think it should be \u201c ignored,\u201d for in our opinion it could only be a \u25a0\u201cfact\u201d through the negligence of appellant\u2019s agents in transmitting it, for which appellant would be responsible. Electric wires may play some strange tricks, but it does not \u201cstand to reason\u201d that a message properly sent from San Marcos, as appellant\u2019s agent there testifies, addressed to \u201cI. E. Jobe,\u201d would be so changed in its transmission to Lockhart as to arrive there addressed to \u201c John Lampkin.\u201d The jury didn\u2019t believe that, and we don\u2019t either. If appellant\u2019s agents were not guilty of negligence in transmitting the message, it was received at Lockhart addressed to I. E. Jobe; and by the exercise of reasonable care the appellant could have delivered it to appellee within a few minutes after its receipt. If on account of appellant\u2019s negligence, it was not received as a message addressed to I. E. Jobe until the next morning, the appellant is responsible for the consequences of such negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">As to our fourth conclusion of fact (we suppose counsel mean the fifth, for their objections relate to that, and are not germane to the fourth), we reiterate, \u201c that by reason of the delay in delivering the message to the appellee, his wife was prevented from reaching her father\u2019s bedside until after his death; \u201d and supplement it by now finding, from the evidence, as a conclusion of fact, \u201c that if the message had been delivered with due diligence, appellee\u2019s wife could and would have been present at her father\u2019s bedside before his death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">Now as to our conclusions of law: It is complained of in the motion, that we erred in not sustaining appellant\u2019s third assignment of error, and in failing to reverse the case on account of the alleged error. To have sustained this assignment, we would have to overturn an unbroken line of decisions of our Supreme Court, establishing the principle that mental anguish is an element of damages deemed to be within the contemplation of a telegraph company, as a natural and probable result of its neglect to deliver with reasonable dispatch a message such as appellant undertook to transmit in this case. We do not think counsel for appellant ought to expect us to do this. Its counsel admit in their brief, that \u20181 This assignment is not well taken, so long as this court adheres to the rule permitting recovery of damages for mental anguish in cases of this character.\u201d We adhere to this rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">The sixth ground of appellant\u2019s motion attacks the opinion of the court for its failure to sustain appellant\u2019s fifth assignment of error. As the matters to which that assignment relates are not fully set out in the opinion, we will here make a full statement of them. Appellant alleged in its answer, \u201c That in order to provide the public with telegraphic service <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>at Lockhart, it was necessary for defendant\u2019s lines and offices to be used in common with the Missouri, Kansas &amp; Texas Railway Company\u2019s road business; that said railroad company ran freight and passenger trains over its road between Lockhart and San Marcos; that on the morning of August 2, 1891, appellant\u2019s agents at Lockhart were compelled for a short, time to surrender the use of said lines to the safely conducting and directing trains between said points, and to give their time to said trains-on arrival, so that it was unreasonable for them to give the whole of their time to the delivery of said message; but the interest of the public and its safety in connection with trains required a portion of their time,, whereby it may be, but it is not admitted, some little delay in discovering the error and delivery of said message occurred; but that defendant says that it not only used due care, but used every possible diligence in-getting said message into hands of plaintiff, who, as defendant\u2019s agent at Lockhart believed, was entitled thereto.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">Appellant excepted to that \u201c portion of the answer which endeavors to, excuse its delay upon the ground that the wires were surrendered to the Missouri, Kansas &amp; Texas Railway Company on the morning of August 2,. 1891, upon the ground that it was not sufficient in law to excuse delay in defendant.\u201d The District Court sustained the exception, and appellant\u2019s fifth assignment of error questions the correctness of its holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">In the Western Union Telegraph Company v. Rosentreter, 80 Texas, 417, the court says: \u201cWe do not think the law contemplates that a telegraph company, charged with the duty of faithfully serving the public to all reasonable extent, shall escape responsibility for its failure to-perform that duty by such a shallow pretense, after it has received the telegram and made a contract for its transmission.\u201d But in this case the answer does not even aver that it could not have reasonably discharged its duty both to the railway company and appellee. It says that appellant\u2019s agents on the morning of August 2, 1891, were compelled for a short time to surrender the use of its lines, etc. It does not even allege that the \u201cshort time\u201d elapsed before the message was delivered that morning. But suppose that the inference should be indulged in that it did; what then is the consequence averred of its surrender for the \u201c short time ?\u201d It is, \u201c so that it was unreasonable for them\u201d (the agents) \u201cto give the whole of their time to the delivery of said message.\u201d Of course it was. But the answer fails to allege that in order to deliver the message it would have been necessary for appellant\u2019s agents to devote the whole of the time to the delivery of the message. Such an allegation-could not have been truly made. A little messenger boy could have delivered it in ten minutes. But the negligence for which appellant was responsible was its failure to deliver the message on the night it arrived; and no showing of its inability to deliver it sooner next morning than it did would be a defense to such negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>We deem it unnecessary to add anything to our original opinion in regard to the stipulation in the contract, to the effect that appellant should not be liable for damages if appellee failed to present his claim therefor within sixty days after sending the message. If Acts of Twenty-second Legislature, section 2, page 20, mean anything, the stipulation was absolutely void, and no notice was required as a condition precedent to .suit. The stipulation being void, the action of the court in ignoring it in its charge, complained of in appellant\u2019s twentieth assignment of error, was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">In considering the correctness of a charge, reference must be had to the pleadings and evidence. The appellant in its answer sought to justify its failure to deliver the message with reasonable dispatch upon the ground, \u2018 \u2018 that by reason 'of the interruption of its lines or the working thereof, in some occult manner unknown to defendant, but to which the science and business of telegraphy is inevitably subject, and without any fault of defendant, its servants, or agents, said message became changed, etc. It then introduced evidence to show that \u201c the interruption of its lines,\u201d etc., was caused by a heavy gale, sudden atmospheric change, and lightning.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">The charge of the court relating to this part of the evidence is: \u201cIf you find from the evidence that defendant received and transmitted said message with ordinary care and dispatch, or in case it did not, that delay was not occasioned for the want of the use of proper care and diligence on its part, or on the part of the agents or its employes, but was occasioned by some action of the elements or other cause over which defendant could not have control, then you will find for defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">It will be seen from a glance that this charge does not, as contended \u25a0by appellant, \u201climit its defense and right to excuse by vis major, or causes over which it could not possibly have control.\u201d It excuses appellant if it used \u201cordinary care\u201d in transmitting the message.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-9\">It is strenuously contended, that this court erred in not sustaining appellant\u2019s twenty-second assignment of error, and in not reversing the judgment of the District Court for error in the second paragraph of its \u25a0 charge, and in failing to instruct the jury as requested in its special charge number 4. The second paragraph of the charge complained of is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-10\">\u201c2. In passing upon the fact as to whether or not the defendant company was guilty of negligence in transmitting and delivering the dispatch in question, you may consider the hour at which it was delivered to the agent at Harwood, if you find that it was delivered at all, and the hour at which it was received by the plaintiff at Lockhart, and whether such time between receipt and delivery was reasonable time for a dispatch to pass over defendant\u2019s lines from one point to the other. By the word <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>negligence as used here, is meant the absence in any case of such care and skill as under the circumstances ought reasonably be exercised.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">Special charge number 4 asked by appellant is: \u201cThe defendant has the right to establish reasonable rules and regulations for the conduct of his business, and to establish reasonable office hours consistent with the reasonably sufficient service of the public; and if you find that the defendant had established such office hours at any or all of its offices through or by which said message had to be transmitted or handled in order for defendant to transmit and deliver the said message, and that the sender of said message had notice of such office hours, and sent such message subject to and with the understanding that it would probably be delayed by reason of such office hours, and that the delay, if any, in delivery thereof, or the delay, if any, in discovering the mistake in transmission, was occasioned by the intervention during the night while closed under such reasonable rule as to hours for keeping its office open and for closing the same, then any delay so occasioned is not chargeable as negligence to defendant. And if you find that during defendant\u2019s office hours, after the opening of its office for business, said message was delivered within a reasonable time, you will find for defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">There was no evidence to which this charge was applicable, or that would have made it proper for the court to have given it to the jury. The message was received by appellant\u2019s agent at Harwood for immediate transmission, and she forwarded it at once to San Antonio. So no delay could have been caused by its being delivered for transmission at Harwood after office hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">It was received at San Antonio on the same day, at seventeen minutes \u25a0 past 6 o\u2019clock p. m. There is no evidence tending to show that appellant\u2019s office at San Antonio is not open at all hours. The message reached San Marcos from San Antonio at seventeen minutes past 7 p. m. on same day. The evidence shows, from appellant\u2019s office hours there, that its office must have been open all night after the message was received; for Miss Wilson, one of its operators there, testified: \u201c Mr. Collins, the manager of the office at San Marcos, goes on duty at 7 a. m., and retires at 7 p. m. My hours are from 7 p. m. to 7 a. m.\u201d The message was transmitted from San Marcos to Lockhart, and reached there at 8:20 p. m., August 1, 1891. The office hours at Lockhart are from 6 o\u2019clock a. m. until the arrival of the last train, which is due at 9:15 p. m. So after the message was received at Lockhart, appellant had an hour, lacking five minutes, within office hours in which to deliver it. But the company\u2019s failure to deliver it with reasonable dispatch is not placed upon the ground that it did not have time within its office hours to do so, but upon its not being properly addressed. This we have already considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-9\">If, as is held by our Supreme Court in Western Union Telegraph Company v. Neel, 86 Texas, 368, a party who contracts with a telegraph com-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>pony for the transmission of a message is bound by reasonable regulations established by it for the conduct of its business, it seems to us, when the regulation is the establishment of certain hours in which to transmit its. business, that the company is alike bound by such regulation, and it is its duty to deliver the message within the time established, if it can reasonably do so. Contracts are mutually binding, and if the sender of a message is bound by the regulations of the company, the company is also bound by them. The company had nearly an hour of the time established by its regulation to make delivery of the message, and it made no effort whatever within that time to do so.</p>\n<otherdate id=\"b441-9\">Delivered February 7, 1894.</otherdate>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">The seventh paragraph of the court\u2019s charge is not obnoxious to the objection urged against it in the twenty-eighth assignment of error. The charge expressly required the jury to find <em>\u201c </em>that the message was sent for the purpose of enabling Mrs. Jobe to be with her father in his last hours of his life,\u201d and that this fact was known to the agent of said company, before it could find a verdict for plaintiff. If it was sent for that purpose, and the purpose was known to appellant\u2019s agent, there was no use in giving the agent notice of the purpose. Nor are we in conflict on this point with the decision of the Court of Civil Appeals of the First District in the case of Western Union Telegraph Company v. Kerr, 4 Texas Civil Appeals, 280. The facts in that case are essentially different from those in the case under consideration. In that case Dr. Henderson delivered to the agent of the company the following message for transmission: \u201c To Dr. J. C. Jones, Gonzales, Texas: Come at once, if able, to see Dr. Kerr. (Signed) J. M. Henderson.\u201d The message was not delivered until next day. The wife of Dr. Kerr sued the company to recover compensation for mental anxiety and suspense experienced by herself as the result of the failure of Dr. Jones to arrive as she expected. There was no allegation nor proof that the agent of the company knew that Dr. Henderson was acting as the agent of Mrs. Kerr, or that the telegram was intended for her benefit. And the court properly held that neither the pleadings nor evidence showed a cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">We do not believe that appellant has shown in its motion any error requiring a reversal of the judgment of the court below. Therefore the motion for rehearing is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">\n<em>Motion overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b441-10\">Justice Fly did not sit in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-11\">Writ of error refused by Supreme Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
