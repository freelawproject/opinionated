The court below sustained a demurrer interposing-the one year statute of limitations, and dismissed the suit, from which-judgment of dismissal this appeal is prosecuted.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">We think the trial court correctly held this case to come within article-3202 of our Revised Statutes. This article, in prescribing the actions that shall be commenced in one year, makes the following classification:-</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-6\">\u201c1. Actions for injuries done to the person of another.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-7\">\u201c 2. Actions for malicious prosecution, or for injuries done to the character or reputation of another by libel or slander.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-8\">\u201c 3. Actions for damages for seduction or breach of promise of marriage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-9\">\u201c 4. Actions for injuries done to the person of another, where death ensued from such injuries.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b646-10\">The next article (3203), prescribing the actions to be commenced within two years, makes the following classification:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-11\">\u201c 1. Actions of trespass for injury done to the estate or the property of another.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-12\">\u201c2. Actions for detaining the personal property of another, and for converting such personal property to one\u2019s own use.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-13\">\u201c3. Actions for taking or carrying away the goods and chattels of another.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-14\">1 \u2018 4. Actions for debt, where the indebtedness is not evidenced by a contract in writing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-15\">\u201c5. Actions upon stated or open accounts, other than such mutual and current accounts as concern the trade of merchandise between merchant and merchant,- their factors or agents.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b646-16\">We think, when we construe these articles together, and in connection with the subsequent provisions of the statute prescribing longer periods in specified cases, the intention of the Legislature is manifest to make a distinction between that class of cases in which the injury is to <em>the person </em>and those in which it is to the <em>estate </em>or property of the one complaining; and that when so considered, mental suffering caused by negligence in failing to deliver a telegraphic message must be classed as an injury to the <em>person, </em>in the sense in which this word is used in the first subdivision of article 3202 quoted above. We think the clear and forcible exposition of these two articles of our statute made by the present Chief Justice of our Supreme Court in Bear Bros. &amp; Hirsch v. Marx &amp; Kempner, 63 Texas, 298, must lead to this conclusion. Also, see Railway v. Roemer, 1 Texas Civ. App., 191.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-17\">The judgment appealed from will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-18\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
