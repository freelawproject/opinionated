Vendor\u2019s Lien \u2014 Proof of Notice Necessary Against Subsequent Vendee. \u2014 In a suit to foreclose a vendor\u2019s lien against a subsequent vendee of the land, plaintiff alleged that defendant purchased with notice of the lien. Defendant answered by general denial, and plaintiff gave no evidence showing such notice. <em>Held, </em>that a judgment of foreclosure against defendant could not stand.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b46-7\">2. Same \u2014 Notice to Produce \u2014 Secondary Evidence. \u2014 Plaintiff\u2019s petition charged that the deeds conveying the land to defendant retained the vend- or\u2019s lien, and notified defendant to produce the deeds on the trial. <em>Held, </em>that a failure to so produce them rendered secondary evidence admissible, but did not prove their contents, or that they recited a vendor\u2019s lien retained.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b46-8\">Appeal from Jack. Tried below before Hon. J. W. Patterson.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b46-9\">This suit was brought by appellant against W. J. S. Chipman, W. L. Anderson, and V. Gayle, on a note executed by said Anderson, and to foreclose a vendor\u2019s lien on land. The petition alleged, that Chipman sold and conveyed the land to W. L. Anderson; that Anderson conveyed by deed to V. Gayle; that both deeds retained the vendor\u2019s lien; that defendants were notified to produce same on trial, or secondary evidence would be used to prove the same; that Chipman had sold and endorsed the note before its maturity to Perryman; and that Gayle had bought the land from Anderson with full notice of the vendor\u2019s lien so retained. On the trial, Anderson and Chipman failed to appear, and judgment was rendered against them by default; and judgment of foreclosure was rendered against Gayle, from which he alone appeals.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b46-10\"><em>Nicholson &amp; Nicholson, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AR\">1. Unless Gayle had notice from Anderson\u2019s deed or otherwise that there was an outstanding vendor\u2019s lien note against the land he purchased, the court erred in adjudging that a lien existed, and foreclosing the same.

The note sued on shows that it was given for the purchase money of the land in question. The law itself fixes the vendor\u2019s lien on the land, and this note and its lien is not shown to have ever been discharged. The presumption of law is, that when the vendor\u2019s lien or other equity, specific or implied, is once shown to exist against land, a party purchasing same takes it subject thereto, until the fact is averred and proven by him that he is an innocent bona fide purchaser without notice and for value. Lincoln v. Purcel, 73 Am. Dec., 196; Anketel v. Converse, 91 Am. Dec., 115; Ellis v. Temple, 94 Am. Dec., 200; Byns v. Fowler, 54 Am. Dec., 271; Johnson v. Toulmin, 52 Am. Dec., 219; Nantz v.

This lien arose from the sale and conveyance of said land to W. L. Anderson, who afterwards conveyed same to appellant. It does not appear that it was expressly reserved either in the note or the deed. It was, then, strictly a vendor\u2019s lien \u2014 a creature of equity, implied to secure unpaid purchase money. The legal and superior title passed by deed to the respective vendees. This is the effect both of the allegations and proof on the part of the appellee, who sought to have appellant bound by the judgment as a subsequent vendee, by alleging that he purchased with notice. Appellant plead the general issue only, and offered no proof. We find no evidence in the record that appellant had such notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">The consequence of a failure to produce a deed at the trial upon proper notice from the opposite party is to make secondary evidence of its contents competent, and not to prove the contents as alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-8\">Because appellee failed to prove that appellant acquired the land with notice of the alleged vendor\u2019s lien, the judgment foreclosing that lien against appellant can not stand. McAlpine v. Burnett, 23 Texas, 649. The judgment will therefore be reversed and the cause remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-9\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
