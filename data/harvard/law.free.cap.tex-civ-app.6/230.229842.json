The petition failed to show what relation Gorman bore to the railway company, whether as passenger, employe, or trespasser, or that he had any right to be on top of the car, or that the railway company\u2019s servants knew or ought to have known that he was there, or owed him any duty whatever. The defective allegations of the petition are not aided by the answer. <em>Held, </em>it was error to overrule the general demurrer to the petition.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b256-5\">Appeal from Lamar.

There was no averment that defendant knew plaintiff was on top of the car, nor that defendant ought to have known he was there; and the petition not only did not state a cause of action, but was without certainty in any particular, and only calculated to mislead and bewilder defendant in a proper defense.

The petition states a cause of action, and is not subject to a general demurrer. The office of a general demurrer is to test the sufficiency of the cause of action. Under a general demurrer the petition is liberally construed. Presumptions of law may aid a petition, and do in this case. Defective allegations in a petition are aided by the allegations of the answer.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b256-9\">2. Fault or contributory negligence is matter of defense to be alleged and proved by the defendant. Contributory negligence is an act of omission or commission wrongful in itself, and is a question of fact, and was strictly within the province of the jury to determine it; for under the rule of decision in our State, an act not in violation of a statutory requirement would have to be palpably reckless to authorize the court to declare it negligent.

It is not shown what relation appellee bore toward appellant which would authorize him to recover. If he was a passenger, then the allegation that he was on the top of a car discloses such a suspicion of contributory negligence as would necessitate some explanation of his position. Railway v. Bennett, 76 Texas, 155.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-9\">If he was an employe of the company, and his duty called him to that position, this should have been set out. If he was there as a trespasser, and voluntarily placed himself on top of a car, without alleging any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>knowledge of appellant\u2019s servants that he was there, it would not be contended that he could recover. It is not shown by the petition that appellee had any right to be on top of the car, or that appellant\u2019s servants-knew or ought to have known that he was there, or owed him any duty whatever. In the language of the Supreme Court in the Mayton v. Railway case, 63 Texas, 78: <em>\u201c </em>The petition lacks an element which is essential to all good pleading \u2014 certainty to a common intent. It does not inform the defendant of the issue which is to be met.\u201d</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b258-8\">Delivered January 31, 1894.</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">Under the allegations of the petition, the defendant could safely admit all therein stated to be true, and still it would not authorize a recovery. The defective allegations of the petition are not aided by the answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">The other errors assigned are not such as will probably arise on another trial. For the error of the court in overruling the demurrer, the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
