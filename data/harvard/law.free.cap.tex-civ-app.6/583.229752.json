L. McKnight was under the age of twenty-one years at the time of the levy, and was living with his father, and that his disabilities had never been removed; and therefore the property was liable for the debts of J. W. McKnight. Rev. Stats., art. 3361a, secs. 1-4; 10 Am. and Eng. Encycl. of Law, 615, note 2; Gordon v. Gilfoil, 99 U. S., 178; Louisiana Code, art. 367, et seq.; Allison v. Watson, 36 La.

In this suit the-minor recovered a judgment, from which this appeal is taken, for the-value of the mule.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-9\">The only question is, whether the mule belonged to the plaintiff or to his father.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-10\">It is settled by the great weight of authority, that such an agreement as that which was made in this case between parent and child is valid, and entitles the child to the earnings which are the results of his own labor. But it is contended, that in this State an infant can only be emancipated by decree of a court in accordance with the statute. We can see nothing in the statute which conflicts with the general rule. The statute provides for the removal of the minor\u2019s disabilities, which could not be done by the act of the father. The parent by his agreement only relinquishes his own rights over the child. Schoul. Dom. Rel., 267a, 268; Schuster v. Bauman Jewelry Co., 79 Texas, 183.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-11\">The judgment is correct and will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
