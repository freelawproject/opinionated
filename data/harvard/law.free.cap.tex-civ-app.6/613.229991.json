The verdict of the jury requires findings of fact as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">The plaintiff, Mrs. O\u2019Niell, was during the years 1890 and 1891 a widow with several children, engaged in the business of keeping a boarding house in Fort Worth, Texas. The appellants were a mercantile firm doing business in that city.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">Mrs. O\u2019Niell was indebted to one C. A. Hall; the latter owed the appellants, Burton, Lingo &amp; Co., the sum of $35.18, besides interest. The appellants claimed that Hall had given them an order on Mrs. O\u2019Niell, which she had verbally accepted. This fact, however, of verbal acceptance she denied. As a consequence the appellants instituted suit against her in a Justice Court. In this suit she prevailed, as well in the Justice Court as in the County Court of Tarrant County, to which it was appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">Pending this litigation, which originated on October 21, 1890, and ended January 31, 1891, one Nash sued Hall, and caused the issuance of a writ of garnishment upon Mrs. O\u2019Niell as garnishee. On a judgment obtained by Nash against her as such garnishee, she paid into court the money which she owed Hall. She was not indebted to the appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-9\">In the spring of 1890 the appellants became members of an association having an office in Chicago, known as the \u201c Sprague Bad Debt Collecting Association.\u201d They were awarded a membership in this association in consideration of $10 paid as an initiation fee. They were furnished by this association with certain notices and circulars, to be used in the enforcement of the collection of claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-10\">Pending the litigation against her, Mrs. O\u2019Niell received through the mail the following communications:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-11\">\u201c Office of Spbague\u2019s Bad Debt Collecting Agenct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-12\">\u201c Branch Offices in all Large Cities. 19-38.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-13\">\u201cChicago, January 12, 1891.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-14\">\n<em>11 Mrs. O\u2019Niell:</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-15\">\u201cA claim has been reported to us of $36.99, owed by you to Burton, Lingo <em>&amp; </em>Co;, of Fort Worth, Texas, who is a subscriber to this agency.

Call on or write the party to whom the account is due, and make some kind of settlement immediately.

This agency keeps a record of all persons who are reported as delinquent debtors. This record is for the good and protection as well as a guide for business men in extending credit, and contains only the names of those who do not try to meet their obligations. Business men are advised of new names of delinquents that are placed on record. No one can afford to be reported as delinquent. Do not correspond with us, but settle this matter with the party to whom the account is due, whose name was given in our former letter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b642-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>These letters were enclosed in open envelopes, endorsed either \u201c Sprague\u2019s Bad Debt Collecting Agency, Chicago,\u201d or \u201c Sprague\u2019s Collecting Agency.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">They were sent by the authority of the appellants, and before reaching the hands of the appellee they were read by several persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\"><em>Opinion. </em>\u2014 The general demurrer to the petition was properly overruled.. The letters in question, which were set out in the petition, were libellous per se. They naturally impute dishonesty to the appellee; they immediately tend to detract from her reputation for integrity and fair dealing. It was not necessary, therefore, as appellants contend, that special damages should be alleged. Odgers on Libel and Slander, 291; Muetze v. Tuteur, 20 Am. St. Rep., 115; McAllister v. Free Press Co., 15 Am. St. Rep., 348; Bradstreet Co. v. Gill, 72 Texas, 115.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">Our conclusions of fact indicate that we are unable to concur with appellants in their contention that the letters in question were inadmissible in evidence, because there was no testimony connecting the defendants with their publication. Thus the witness Tevis testifies, that he heard Mr. Burton, who was supervisor of the business of the firm, instruct Mr. Menifee, their bookkeeper and manager of their collections and sales, to send out notices of the character mentioned; that the witness personally knew that names were being sent out by Burton, Lingo <em>&amp; </em>Co. to Sprague\u2019s Bad Debt Collecting Agency at Chicago. The witness George Wray testified, that in 1891 he saw blank circulars of the Sprague Bad Debt Collecting Agency in the desk of appellant\u2019s bookkeeper at their office, the circulars being similar to the letter of January 31, 1891.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">The testimony of the witness Mr. Burton, managing partner of the defendants\u2019 firm, indicates that the firm began their connection with the collecting agency in the spring of 1890, and continued it until the spring of 1891, and that while he did not direct the sending of the particular circulars in question to Mrs. O\u2019Niell, he yet does not contradict the statement of the witness Tevis with reference to the instructions given by him to the bookkeeper, Menifee; and he further states that he does not know how the name of Mrs. O\u2019Niell reached the Sprague association, unless it was furnished by himself or some member of his firm, or by his bookkeeper. He further states, that under the arrangement between his firm and the Sprague association, the \u201c agency were to send letters to the parties whose accounts were sent to them in doing this collecting,\u201d and that at the time that he entered into the arrangement with the agency their representative explained to him their system and work.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-9\">It will also be noted that these circulars were sent to the appellee during the pendency of the litigation for the collection of the claim, and that they ceased with that litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-10\">The bookkeeper, Menifee, was not called upon to testify; and if, as is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>probable, the name of the appellee was by him furnished to the collecting agency, we think that the evidence justifies the conclusion that in thus, acting he was within the general scope of his authority arising out of the instructions given him by his superior, Mr. Burton.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b643-8\">Delivered March 21, 1894.</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">It appears that the appellee\u2019s counsel, in addressing the jury, used the following language: \u201cYou should bring in a verdict in such an amount as will teach men that when they have debts to collect they should go into the courts of their own county, where there is an honest judge and an honest jury, and not try to collect their claims by sending to a widow woman such scandalous libels through a nameless agency at Chicago.\u201d This language was used over the protest of appellants\u2019 counsel that it was unauthorized by the pleadings and the evidence, as there was no claim in the petition for exemplary damages. Without reference to the question of punitive damages, w\u00e9 think that the language was justified by the character of the cause of action relied upon by the plaintiff, and by the testimony which was introduced in support of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
