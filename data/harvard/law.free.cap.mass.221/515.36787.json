We take the case on that basis. Their defence is that the promises, agreements and warranties relied upon by the plaintiff and which the plaintiff says were broken when the bonds and stocks were sold at public auction, were promises, agreements and warranties which contradicted the notes; but we are of opinion that that is not so. We are of opinion that the promises, agreements and warranties alleged in the declaration were agreements collateral to the note. They were in effect that they would renew the note until the funds of the corporation were sufficient to enable it to pay the plaintiff the principal of the bonds which was more than the amount of the note. An agreement to renew a note is a collateral agreement and not an agreement which contradicts the note. For cases where the principle of collateral agreements has been applied, see <em>Willis </em>v. <em>Hulbert, </em>117 Mass. 151; <em>Carr </em>v. <em>Dooley, </em>119 Mass. 294; <em>McCormick </em>v. <em>Cheevers, </em>124 Mass. 262; <em>Craffam </em>v. <em>Pierce, </em>143 Mass. 386; <em>Ayer </em>v. <em>R. W. Bell Manuf. Co. </em>147 Mass. 46; <em>Durkin </em>v. <em>Cobleigh, </em>156 Mass. 108; <em>Cole </em>v. <em>Hadley, </em>162 Mass. 579; <em>Drew </em>v. <em>Wiswall, </em>183 Mass. 554.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">This count of the declaration is not well drawn. But it sets forth a cause of action. On the whole it is not so badly drawn that the defendants should be allowed to escape the liabil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>ity there set forth because it is not set forth with more formality.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-3\">The entry must be: Judgment reversed so far as the fifth count is concerned. The case to stand for trial on the fifth count.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
