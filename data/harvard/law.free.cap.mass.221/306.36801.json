It appeared that the defendant was not insured under the provisions of the workmen\u2019s compensation act. In regard to the happening of the accident the plaintiff testified: \u201cBefore I get hurt I go with my truck and going to take a load to the boat and then I went on the stage . . . and two fellows piling boxes on the dock and I started to go down the boat on the stage and the plank go down to the water and two fellows piling the boxes and the box turn over and striked me in the head and face and back.\u201d Being asked, \u201cDo you know how high that pile of boxes was?\u201d He answered, \u201cWell, I cannot tell how high but a guess, \u2014 it is a big box, it is higher than my head. I cannot tell, but such like that I guess. I cannot tell you how high. . . . Big boxes. ... It is more big, about three feet high and four or five feet long. I don\u2019t measure them. . . . Yes, I see the men piling them, but I don\u2019t know their name.\u201d There was nothing to show what caused the box to fall on the plaintiff. At the close of the plaintiff\u2019s testimony the judge ordered a verdict for the defendant; and the plaintiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b331-6\"><em>P.
