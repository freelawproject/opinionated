L. c. 91, \u00a7\u00a7 113, 114, with taking clams from flats in the city of Boston from which the taking of clams was prohibited by the commissioners on fisheries and game at the request in writing of the State board of health.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b348-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>The case was tried before <em>Dana, </em>J., upon an agreed statement of facts, material portions of which are described in the opinion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b348-5\">The defendant offered to prove that the flats from which he took clams were not contaminated, and that the clams so taken were clean and wholesome, and fit for food.

The defendant asked for the following rulings:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b348-7\">\u2018\u20181. That upon the foregoing facts the Commonwealth has failed to make out a case against the defendant, and that he is entitled to a verdict of not guilty.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b348-8\"><em>\u201c2. </em>That no \u2018period of time\u2019 has been prescribed during which the taking of clams from the flats referred to is intended to be prohibited.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b348-9\">\u201c3. That the acts of the State board of health and of the commissioners on fisheries and game are not in compliance with the requirements of R. L. c. 91, \u00a7\u00a7 113, 114, in that the prohibition attempted to be made runs for all time, and not for a prescribed period of time, as required by law, and such acts are therefore void.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b348-10\">\u201c4. That it does not appear that there has been any valid or legal prohibition of the taking of clams from the flats described.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b348-11\">\u201c5. That the defendant may prove, as a complete defence to this complaint, that the flats from which said clams were taken by him were not contaminated and that the clams so taken were clean and wholesome, and fit for food.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b348-12\">The rulings were refused.

L. c. 91, \u00a7\u00a7 113, 114.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-16\">The general right of the inhabitants from the earliest times to take, within the flats and tidal waters of the Commonwealth, shell fish for the use of their families, while made subject to legislative regulations as to quantity, has never been denied. <em>Dill </em>v. <em>Wareham, </em>7 Met. 438,446, 447. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>13 Allen, 541. <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Delano, </em>155 Mass. 10. R. L. c. 91, \u00a7\u00a7 100, 101, 102. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>But when in the course of time the density of population had so increased that certain portions of such waters and flats became impregnated with sewage or deleterious substances from manufacturing establishments which affected and poisoned the imbedded shell- fish, the Legislature, apparently for the protection and preservation of the public health, enacted the St. of 1901, c. 138, now R. L. c. 91, \u00a7 113, authorizing the State board of health upon complaint to delimit the contaminated area, and authorizing the board to request in writing the commissioners on fisheries and game to prohibit the taking therefrom of oysters, clams, quahaugs and scallops. The commissioners upon receiving the request are required to prohibit the taking of shell fish from the waters thus designated during such period of time as the board shall have prescribed, although by the St. of 1907, c. 285, clams and quahaugs may be taken for bait only, by any person having a permit in writing from the local board of health. See also St. 1911, c. 411, \u00a7 10. By \u00a7 114, upon the issuance and publication of the order of prohibition its violation is made a misdemeanor punishable by fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">The statute is a valid exercise of the authority given by c. 1, \u00a7 1, art. 4 of the Constitution, to enact \u201call manner of wholesome and reasonable orders, laws, statutes, and ordinances\u201d even if legislative functions to determine whether the conditions referred to in the statute exist are conferred upon the State board of health without giving to parties who may be interested an opportunity to appear and be heard. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sisson, </em>189 Mass. 247, 252.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">But the defendant contends, that as the order, which must define not only the location of the prohibited territory but the duration of the prohibition, is dependent upon the terms of the \u201crequest,\u201d the order for the violation of which he has been convicted is void because the request is unlimited in time.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">The \"period of time\u201d is to be defined in connection with the subject matter and purpose of the statute, the wording of which assumes that the contamination ultimately may cease and the fishery may be resumed safely. It being impossible except from observation and experience to determine when this condition will appear, the board is only required to name definitely the date from which the prohibition is to begin, although it may remain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>in force until the board are satisfied that its continuance is no longer necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-3\">It moreover is only when the defendant has been deprived arbitrarily of taking uncontaminated shell fish for the sustenance of his family that he can complain of an invasion of his constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">The proceedings shown by the record having been in conformity with the statute, th\u00e9 defendant\u2019s first four requests properly were denied, and the fifth, not having been argued, is to be treated as waived. By the terms of the report the verdict is to stand, and it is</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
