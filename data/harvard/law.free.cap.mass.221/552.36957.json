Writs dated April 17, 1914.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b576-11\">In the Superior Court the cases were tried together before <em>McLaughlin, </em>J. The alleged contract was contained in a correspondence between the parties, the material portions of which are quoted in the opinion, where also the other material facts are stated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b576-12\">At the close of the plaintiffs\u2019 evidence, the judge ruled that upon all the evidence the plaintiffs were not entitled to recover, and ordered a verdict for the defendant in each case. Thereupon the judge reported the cases for determination by this court. If the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>ruling and the ordering of the verdicts were wrong, judgment was to be entered for the plaintiff in the first case in the sum of $450 and for the plaintiff in the second case in the sum of $900; otherwise, judgments were to be entered for the defendant on the verdicts.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b577-5\"><em>L.

After they had called his attention to the decline in market value of the stock, he wrote them from the company\u2019s office, on March 26, 1913, \u201cany time you feel real worried, why come out and you can get your money to the value you paid for the stock from me.\u201d To which they replied, on March 27, 1913, \u201cFor the present ... we will not take advantage of your willingness to protect us, but will wait to see if the value of the preferred drops any further, for if this continues, we would not care to retain our small holdings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AvX\">If this had been an unconditional acceptance the transaction would have been closed and the plaintiffs, upon delivery of the certificates, properly indorsed, would have been entitled to the amount invested. It was not, however, until August 26,1913, after a receiver for the company had been appointed, that they accepted the offer and notified the defendant of their readiness to deliver the stock, but he refused performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-9\">While the offer to buy was evidently for the purpose of protecting them from loss on the investment, and was not intended by the defendant as a purely business transaction, the words, \u201c any time,\u201d do not cover an unlimited period to be measured by the alternating hopes or fears of the plaintiffs, but must be construed as limited to a reasonable time. <em>Holland </em>v. <em>Cheshire Railroad, </em>151 Mass. 231, 236. And, the facts not being in dispute, this was a question of law for the court. <em>Holbrook </em>v. <em>Burt, </em>22 Pick. 546, 555. The plaintiffs, with knowledge of the fluctuating financial condition of the company, and the corresponding decline in the market price of the stock, having remained inactive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>for five months, we are of opinion that under these circumstances the presiding judge correctly ruled that the option had expired. <em>Park </em>v. <em>Whitney, </em>148 Mass. 278.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-3\">We find nothing in the remaining contents of these letters that calls for discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">By the terms of the report, judgment on the verdict is to be entered for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
