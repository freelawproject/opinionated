It is sufficient that the witnesses should attest and subscribe the will in the presence of the testator.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b510-4\">Appeal from a decree of the Probate Court for the county of Barnstable allowing the will of Esther G. Newcomb, late of Orleans.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b510-5\">The case was heard by <em>Loring, </em>J. The evidence is described in the opinion. At the close of the evidence the appellant asked the justice to make the following rulings:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b510-6\">\"1. The will was not witnessed by three competent witnesses to the execution and signature by the testatrix.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b510-7\"><em>\u201c2. </em>That the will was not witnessed by three witnesses in conformity with the requirements of the statutes, in that the signature of Margaret Phee who signed the will in .behalf of the testatrix could not be legally a witness to the execution of the will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b510-8\">\u201c3. The will was not executed by Margaret Phee for the testatrix at her express direction on the evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b510-9\">\"4. It does not appear that the testatrix at the time of the alleged execution of the will identified the instrument as her will or requested the witnesses to sign the document as her last will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b510-10\"><em>\u201c5. </em>In order to make the execution of a will valid when executed and signed by a third person as in this case, there must be an express direction coming from the testatrix, and it is not sufficient proof of such direction to show that there was an assent of the testatrix by a nod or motion of the head, and the suggestion of a person in the room at that time that another person signed the will for the testatrix which is assented to by a nod or approval as shown by the evidence is not sufficient evidence of express direction.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b510-11\">\u201c6. That on all the testimony there is not sufficient evidence to warrant a finding and decree that the will was duly executed or that it was executed by Margaret Phee by the express direction of the testatrix.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b510-12\">The justice refused to make any of these rulings, and found and ruled as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b511-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>\"I find that the instrument now presented as the will of Mrs. Newcomb was duly signed by Miss Phee in her presence and by her express direction, and was attested and subscribed in her presence by three witnesses all of whom were competent witnesses for that purpose.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b511-5\">\u201cI am of the opinion that the person who signs the name of a testator by his express direction is a competent attesting and subscribing witness and I refuse the first and second requests for rulings asked for by the contestants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b511-6\">\u201cI find that the deceased\u2019s hands were so crippled with rheumatism that it had been and was hard for her to write; and that in addition, when the time came for her to sign her name to the instrument now propounded as her will she was physically in a very weak condition; that a pen was offered to her and she said 'Oh dear\u2019 and thereupon she was asked if she would like Miss Phee to sign her name. To this she nodded her head and said 'Yes/ Therefore I refuse the third and fifth requests for rulings.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b511-7\">\u201cI refuse the fourth request for ruling as not being good in law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b511-8\">''And the sixth in that it is not correct, having reference to the evidence in this case.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b511-9\">The justice made an order for a decree affirming the decree of the Probate Court and remanding the case to that court for further proceedings; and the appellant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b511-10\">The case was submitted on briefs.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b511-11\"><em>C.

Morse, </em>for the petitioner, the appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b511-13\">Braley, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Afh\">The evidence is ample to show that the instrument offered for probate had been prepared by the express direction of the testatrix to whom the final and complete draft had been read preparatory to its execution. If by reason of physical weakness although possessed of testamentary capacity she was unable to affix her name, the R. L. c. 135, \u00a7 1, provides that the will may be signed by the testator \u201cor by a person in his presence and by his express direction.\u201d The power to make this disposition of her property having been conferred sol\u00e9ly by statute, the first question raised by the appellant\u2019s exceptions is, whether the will was executed in accordance with the requirement. <em>Brettun </em>v. <em>Fox, </em>100 Mass. 234, 235.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>It is plain on the testimony recited in the record, that the single justice was warranted in finding, that the scrivener who drew the will, having informed the testatrix of the presence of the witnesses and that it was ready for her signature, asked her, \u201cCan you sign your name?\u201d and, upon her whispered response \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said in substance, \u201cIf you are not able to sign your name, the nurse Margaret Phee can sign for you. Is this agreeable to you?\u201d and the testatrix \u201cnodded her head and said \u2018Yes.\u2019\u201d It necessarily followed from this unambiguous answer, that the testatrix intended and directed that the document before her should be executed in her behalf as her will.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">But, if the execution was valid the statute also requires that a will must be attested and subscribed in the presence of the testator by three or more competent witnesses, and the second question relates to the competency of Margaret Phee to act also as a witness. R. L. c. 135, \u00a7 1. It is not contended that she had any actual pecuniary interest by which she would have been disqualified. <em>Hawes </em>v. <em>Humphrey, </em>9 Pick. 350, 356, 357. R. L. c. 135, \u00a7 3. And the argument of counsel for the appellant in effect is, that she could not attest her own signature. But what had been done became by force of the statute the act of the testatrix. It was her will which the witnesses attested even if her name was written by the delegated hand of one of them. <em>In re Clark, </em>2 Curt. Eccl. 329. <em>Riley </em>v. <em>Riley, </em>36 Ala. 496, 500. <em>Robins </em>v. <em>Coryell, </em>27 Barb. 556. <em>Scott </em>v. <em>Hawk, </em>107 Iowa, 723; 4 Prob. Rep. Ann. 255; 70 Am. St. Rep. 228. See <em>In re Butler\u2019s estate, </em>14 Prob. Rep. Ann. 395, 406.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">It also was unnecessary, as the appellant further urges, that she should have formally requested the witnesses to attest the will. The statute was satisfied when they subscribed in her presence, and no publication was required. <em>Nickerson </em>v. <em>Buck, </em>12 Cush. 332. <em>Tilden </em>v. <em>Tilden, </em>13 Gray, 110. We accordingly find no error in the rulings at the trial, and the exceptions must be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
