It appeared that the lumber was not shipped within the time agreed upon and that time was of the essence of the contract, but it also appeared that there was incorporated in the contract a provision that \u201call agreements are contingent upon strikes, accidents, delays of carriers and other delays beyond our control.\u201d It was found by an auditor, whose decision of facts was agreed to be final, that the delays were not occasioned by any act or omission of the plaintiff but that the delays in the various shipments were occasioned solely by carriers other than the carrier by which the final shipments by the plaintiff to the defendant were made and were due to causes beyond the control of the plaintiff. <em>Held, </em>that the plaintiff was entitled to recover the full price of the lumber delivered to and accepted by the defendant.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b588-11\">In an action to recover the price of lumber sold and delivered by the plaintiff to the defendant, in which special damages were claimed by the defendant in \u25a0 recoupment on the ground that by reason of delays in the deliveries of the ship<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>ments of the lumber a third person to whom the defendant had resold the lumber had suffered loss in consequence of the delay, where it appeared that the defendant had paid nothing to such third person on account of such alleged damages and that no action had been brought and no specific demand had been made upon the defendant for such damages, it was <em>said </em>that it was not necessary to base the denial of the defendant\u2019s right to recoupment on that ground; because it also appeared that under the express terms of the contract between the parties the plaintiff had proved an excuse for his failure to deliver the lumber within the agreed time.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b589-4\">Contract to recover the price of certain lumber sold and delivered by the plaintiff to the defendant.

Higgins,\u2019 Esquire, as auditor, <em>\u201cto </em>hear the parties, to examine their vouchers and evidence, to state the accounts, and make report thereof to-the court; his findings as to facts to be final, and his report to be filed within fourteen days.\u201d The auditor filed a report, in which-, he found the facts that are stated in the opinion. Later the case was heard by Jennet/, J., without a jury, upon the auditor\u2019s report- and the plaintiff\u2019s motion for the entry of judgment thereon..The defendant asked the judge to make the following rulings:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b589-7\">\u201c6. The defendant is entitled to damage by reason of the failure of the plaintiff to perform its contracts or one of them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b589-8\">\"7. The defendant is entitled to recover as special damage-such sum as shall be considered sufficient to meet all future claims which may be made against it by reason of its resale of the merchandise purchased from the plaintiff to its customer [which was], in contemplation of the parties at the time the contract was made.;</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b589-9\">\u201c8.' The natural consequences of delay and stoppage \u00f3f work- and payment of wages and expenses arising therefrom and the loss from not having the work finished at the time it otherwise would have been, are the proper subjects for the recovery of damages.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b589-10\">\u201c9. The defendant has sustained the burden on it to show that it is entitled to recover damages from the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b589-11\">\u201c10. The words \u2018delays of carriers\u2019 in the contract mean delays of the Ocean Steamship Company, which was the carrier <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>which brought the lumber from the place of shipment, as set forth in the contracts, to the consignee, the defendant.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b590-3\">The judge refused to make any of these rulings, and ordered that judgment should be entered for the plaintiff according to the findings contained in the auditor\u2019s report. The defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b590-4\"><em>J. E. Eaton &amp; E. T. McKnight, </em>for the defendant, submitted a brief.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b590-5\"><em>W. S. McCallum &amp; G.

It is settled by the report that the lumber was not shipped within the period agreed upon, and that time was of the essence of the contract. The defendant\u2019s orders, however, were accepted on the express stipulation that \u201call agreements are contingent upon strikes, accidents, delays of carriers and other delays beyond our control,\u201d and this provision became embodied in the contract between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">On the facts as found the delay was not occasioned by any act or omission of the plaintiff. The Durden-Coleman Lumber Company, in order to expedite deliveries, divided the defendant\u2019s orders among ten mills and used every effort to perform the contract in accordance with its terms. It appears that stormy weather rendered it impossible promptly to team the logs from the woods to some of the mills, and from other mills to the cars, and that there was delay in getting cars from the railroad companies to carry the lumber from the mills to the steamboat wharf at Savannah. But the auditor finds that the delays in the various shipments were occasioned solely by other carriers than the Ocean Steamship Company, and were due to causes beyond the control of the plaintiff. This makes out an excuse for the failure of. the plaintiff to deliver the lumber within the agreed time. All of it, with the exception of twenty-one pieces for which allowance was made, was accepted by the defendant and was used by its vendee. The plaintiff is entitled to recover the amount found due by the auditor with interest from January 8, 1913, the date of demand for payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">In view of the findings of fact the judge rightly refused to give , the defendant\u2019s requests. Those numbered 7 and 8 relate to special damages, based on the claim that the Fred S. and A. D. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>Gore Corporation \u2014 to whom the defendant resold the lumber \u25a0\u2014suffered loss on account of the delays in shipment. Aside from the fact that the defendant has paid nothing to the Gore Corporation on account of such alleged damage, and that no action has been brought nor specific demand made upon it therefor (see <em>Graham, </em>v. <em>Middleby, </em>213 Mass. 437, 443), plainly such a claim must fall to the ground with the defendant\u2019s demand for general damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-3\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
