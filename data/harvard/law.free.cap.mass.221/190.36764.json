Flower a degree as a Doctor of Chiropractic, without the authority of a special act of the General Court granting the power to give degrees, in violation of R. L. c. 208, \u00a7 75.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b214-10\">On appeal to the Superior Court a motion to quash the complaint was denied, and the defendant was tried before <em>Aiken, </em>C. J. The evidence is described in the opinion. At the close of the evidence the defendant asked the Chief Justice to make the following rulings:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b214-11\">\"1. To affix to a name the letters \u2018D.C.,\u2019 which stand for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>\u2018Doctor of Chiropractic/ under the first half of R. L. c. 208, \u00a7 75, is not an offence, because the letters \u2018D.C/ do not represent any degree authorized by law, that is, issued by any institution of learning authorized by an act of the Massachusetts Legislature to issue degrees.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b215-3\">\u201c2. To give a certificate, naming the holder as a \u2018Doctor of Chiropractic\u2019 or \u2018D.C./ is not to confer a degree, because neither the name \u2018Doctor of Chiropractic\u2019 nor the letters \u2018D. C.\u2019 stand for any degree conferred by any institution of learning authorized to issue degrees by any act of the Massachusetts Legislature.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b215-4\">\u201c3. It is against all the rules for the construction of legislative enactments, especially penal statutes, that the same word shall have two meanings in the same sentence. In the first half of section 75, the word \u2018degree\u2019 means degrees authorized by law. In the latter portion of the same sentence the word \u2018degree\u2019 as interpreted by the complaint against the defendant, must mean a degree not authorized by law. In other words, if the defendant should grant the degree \u2018M.D.\u2019 it would clearly be an indictable offence under section 75 because it granted an authorized degree without being legally authorized so to do. Therefore it cannot be indicted for granting the title \u2018D.C.\u2019 because in so doing it confers a title not recognized by law as a degree, unless the court shall give to the same word two meanings in the same sentence. That is to say, that in the first half of section 75 the word \u2018degree\u2019 means degree authorized by law. In the second half it must mean, in order to hold the defendant, unauthorized by law.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b215-5\">The Chief Justice refused to make any of these rulings, and submitted the case to the jury, who returned a verdict of guilty. The defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b215-6\">The whole of R.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AyK\">This is a complaint wherein the defendant corporation is charged with granting the degree of Doctor of. Chiropractic without authority and contrary to the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">There was at the trial no controversy touching the fact that the defendant issued a certificate in which it was stated amongst other matters that \u201cAlfred H. Flower, M.D., having satisfactorily completed the prescribed Courses of Study in the New England College of Chiropractic, passed the examinations and met all other requirements for graduation, has been declared a Doctor of Chiropractic.\u201d This certificate was signed by seven persons, all of whom wrote after their names the letters \u201cD.C.,\u201d five also adding letters indicative of well recognized degrees such as B.S., M.D., D.D.S.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">Flower, called as a witness by the Commonwealth, after stating that the degree of Doctor of Medicine had been conferred upon bim by another institution, to the question \u201cHave you a degree of Doctor of Chiropractic?\u201d replied, \u201cYes; that is what it claims, I believe.\u201d He further testified that the New England College of Chiropractic conferred that degree on him and that at the same time the degree was conferred upon perhaps a dozen other persons; and that.the ceremony was similar to any college or high school graduation upon a commencement day. Officers and members of the faculty of the defendant testified in substance that the letters \u201cD.C.\u201d stood for Doctor of Chiropractic, but that it was not a degree. It is not contended that the defendant was authorized by any special or general act of the Legislature to confer degrees. It requires no discussion to demonstrate that the evidence of the witness Flower, if believed, warranted a finding by the jury that Doctor of Chiropractic was treated as a degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">The provision of R. L. c. 208, \u00a7 75, material to the present prosecution is, \"... Whoever, without the authority of a spe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>cial act of the General Court granting the power to give degrees, offers or grants degrees as a school, college or as a private individual, . . . shall be punished. . . .\u201d Its obvious purpose is to suppress the kind of deceit which arises from the pretence of power to grant academic degrees, and to protect the public from the evils likely to flow from that variety of misrepresentation and imposition. The earlier part of the section deals with the simulated possession of educational distinctions, including college degrees. The section as a whole is an effort to punish the issuing and holding of sham degrees from colleges and other educational institutions. It aims to ensure to the people of the Commonwealth freedom from deception, when dealing with those who put forward professions of educational achievement such as ordinarily is accompanied by a collegiate degree from an institution authorized to grant it and to make certain that those who use such symbols have had the opportunity of being trained according to prevailing standards in some school of recognized standing, under teachers of reputation for learning. <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Lanckton, </em>19 Pick. 288, 291.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-3\">The statute should be interpreted in the light of its design to effectuate its purpose so far as the words used reasonably construed permit of this result. Considered historically and according to present practice, there are three general grades of such degrees, namely, \u2014 Bachelor, Master and Doctor; although by some institutions intermediate distinctions are granted. In common speech as well as in university parlance, \u201cDoctor\u201d as a prefix to a person\u2019s name signifies an academic distinction founded upon having received a degree. The same is true when other initials in combination with D. are written after the name, as D.D., LL.D., Ph.D., M.D. It is not to be assumed that the statute was intended to relate only to such degrees as were in use at the time it was enacted. It is comprehensive in its terms and includes whatever properly may be described as a degree at any time. It is possible that institutions authorized to grant degrees may establish and grant the degree here in question. \u201cDoctor\u201d is used commonly to indicate skill in the general subject of medicine. Doubtless one purpose of the Legislature in enacting the statute was to protect the public from the imposition and suffering which might follow the indiscriminate use of a title conveying the implication of skill to treat disease by those who have pursued no adequate course <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>of study to qualify them. \u201c Chiropractic \u201d is a new word. But it has been held in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zimmerman, ante, </em>184, that one practicing it maybe found to be practicing medicine. \u201cDegree,\u201d as used in this statute, is any academic rank recognized by colleges and universities having a reputable character as institutions of learning, or any form of expression composed in whole or in part of words recognized as indicative of academic rank, alone or in combination with other words, so that there is conveyed to the ordinary mind the idea of some collegiate, university or scholastic distinction. While this definition may not include all instances, it is sufficiently accurate for the present case. The ordinary diploma of public or private schools, simply certifying to the completion of a course of study, does not contravene the statute. But when a title like \u201cDoctor,\u201d commonly associated with unusual skill acquired by academic or professional study in schools or colleges, is conferred either separately or associated with other words, the statute is violated. The conferring of a title made up of the word \u201cDoctor\u201d and a word relating to the healing art may be found to be the granting of a degree within the meaning of the statute. The word \u201cDoctor\u201d in connection with an unusual and high sounding word would be quite as likely to impose upon the ignorant and credulous as the false use of the conventional Doctor of Medicine.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-3\">As thus construed, the word \u201cdegree\u201d is used with a consistent meaning throughout the section and effectuates the design of the statute to protect the public against imposition. It follows that the three requests for instructions presented by the defendant rightly were denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
