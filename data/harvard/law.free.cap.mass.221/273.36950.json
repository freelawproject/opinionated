Writ dated October 9, 1912.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b298-5\">In the Superior Court the case was tried before <em>Quinn, </em>J. The defendant offered in evidence the deposition of one Jennison, then a resident of Los Angeles in the State of California, who was the motorman that was operating the car of the defendant at the time of the accident. The interrogatories to this witness, which with the answers to them were admitted by the judge against the plaintiff\u2019s exceptions, that were taken informally as stated in the opinion, were as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b298-6\">Interrogatory 11. \u201cDid the horse appear to be frightened at any time before the accident?\u201d Answer, \u201cIt did not.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b298-7\">Interrogatory 12. \u201cDid you have any intimation that the horse was likely to become frightened or to shy at the car? \u201d Answer, \u201cI did not.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b298-8\">Interrogatory 13. \u201cDid the driver of the team do anything to warn you that his horse was, or was about to become frightened? \u201d Answer, \u201cHe did not.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b298-9\">Interrogatory 14. \u201cState whether or not there was any unusual or unnecessary ringing of the gong or blowing of the whistle at any time prior to the accident as alleged in the plaintiff\u2019s declaration.\u201d Answer, \u201cThere was none.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b299-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>\"The case was submitted to the jury under proper instructions and a verdict was rendered for the defendant.\u201d The plaintiff alleged exceptions, and the sentence last quoted is taken from the bill of exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b299-3\"><em>W. R. Bigelow, (L. L. Green </em>with him,) for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b299-4\"><em>P. F. Drew, (W. U. Friend </em>with him,) for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b299-5\">Pierce, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A65\">It is alleged in the bill of exceptions that while the plaintiff was driving a horse attached to an express wagon along Main Street in Cochituate it became \"frightened by the loud and continuous ringing of a gong on a car operated by an employee of the defendant coming up behind him,\u201d and that as a result the horse shied, throwing the plaintiff out of the wagon and injuring him.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">The mere ringing of a gong on an electric car in a public street is not in itself negligence. <em>Henderson </em>v. <em>Greenfield &amp; Turner\u2019s Falls Street Railway, </em>172 Mass. 542. When the noise of such ringing is alleged to have frightened a horse, the plaintiff, to recover damages for injury resulting therefrom, must establish that the noise was unusual, unnecessary and likely to frighten horses, or that the motorman knew or ought to have known of the manifestation of fright in season to make reasonable effort to diminish it and failed so to do; <em>Ellis </em>v. <em>Lynn &amp; Boston Railroad, </em>160 Mass. 341; or that the motorman in the use of the gong was reckless or wanton to a degree that indicated disregard of the plaintiff\u2019s safety in the street. <em>Aiken </em>v. <em>Holyoke Street Railway, </em>184 Mass. 269.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">The case was submitted to the jury \u201cunder proper instructions,\u201d and a verdict was rendered for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">During the course of the trial the defendant offered in testimony interrogatories numbered 11, 12, 13, 14, and the answers thereto contained in a deposition. The plaintiff objected to the introduction of this testimony on the ground that the questions were leading and called for conclusions. The testimony was admitted and exceptions thereto were saved, although informally taken. Exceptions were saved to all the questions because leading.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-9\">The admission of leading questions in this Commonwealth rests in the discretion of the presiding judge and is not subject to revision or exception. <em>Moody </em>v. <em>Rowell, </em>17 Pick. 490, 498. <em>York </em>v. <em>Pease, </em>2 Gray, 282, 283. <em>Green </em>v. <em>Gould, </em>3 Allen, 465. <em>Francis </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number><em>Rosa, </em>151 Mass. 532, 535. And, were it to be held that the exercise of such discretion is to be confined to reasonable limits, there is nothing to justify the conclusion that such bounds were overstepped in the present case. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dorr, </em>216 Mass. 314, 318.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">Moreover, as to interrogatories 11, 12 and 13 the witness\u2019s personal knowledge of the horse\u2019s manifestation of fright was or might be a material issue, \u2014 an issue quite distinct and distinguishable from that reasonable cause to know which a jury may impute to a man placed as this man was. <em>Jeddrey </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Northern Street Railway, </em>198 Mass. 232. <em>Ahearn </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>194 Mass. 350.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">The objection that the answers to the questions involve conclusions of fact is not tenable. So far as they do, such result is not objectionable because any canon of evidence is violated. The principle upon which such testimony is admissible is clearly stated in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sturtivant, </em>117 Mass. 122, and <em>Whittier </em>v. <em>Franklin, </em>46 N. H. 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
