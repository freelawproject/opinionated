The so called assignment, being a triparty agreement, viz., an agreement between Thomas Carder, assignor, Joseph Walker, assignee and creditor, and certain other creditors of said Carder, it would not take effect and be binding until signed by all the parties in interest, and if Cropper had not assented to said assignment and had made his attachment by trustee process before the contract of assignment was fully executed, it is not binding upon Cropper and the verdict should be for Cropper.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b147-6\">\u201c2. If Thomas Carder made this assignment for the benefit of a portion of his creditors only, whom he intended to prefer, and intentionally omitted other creditors, including said Cropper, and if Walker supposed that the assignment included all of Carder\u2019s creditors, then the assignment is not a valid contract of assignment because there was a misunderstanding between Carder and Walker upon a material point as to the purpose and effect of the contract of assignment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b147-7\">\"3. If Carder was insolvent when he made this assignment, then such assignment is repugnant to the spirit and provisions of the bankruptcy act, so called, and is void as against all creditors not assenting to it, because the insolvency laws and the bankruptcy act require an equal distribution of the estate of an insolvent among all his creditors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b147-8\"><em>\u201c4. </em>If Cropper did not assent to this assignment, and if Carder did not intend to include him in this assignment, then the assign.ment is not binding upon Cropper and the verdict should be in his favor.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b147-9\">The judge refused to make any of these rulings, and gave to the jury certain instructions that were requested by Walker. The jury returned a verdict for Walker in each of the cases; and Cropper alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b147-10\">The cases were submitted on briefs.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b147-11\"><em>H. N. Joyner, </em>for Cropper.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b147-12\"><em>W. A. Burns, J. B. Cummings &amp; J. M. Rosenthal, </em>for Walker.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b147-13\">Carroll, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A2q\">These two actions were tried together. The question in each case is the validity of a common law assignment for the benefit of creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-14\">On January 18, 1913, Thomas Carder, while insolvent, made an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>assignment under seal \u201cof all goods, wares, merchandise, . . . and all book accounts\u201d to Joseph Walker, a creditor to whom he was indebted in the sum of $3,500, as trustee for the benefit of his creditors. On January 20 of the same year Walker signed the instrument as trustee and at the same time signed as a creditor, releasing his claim against Carder in these words, \u201chereby release the said Thomas Carder from all claims and demands of every name and nature, owing from said Carter to us.\u201d Seven other creditors of the assignor became parties to the deed of assignment and release, \u201csome of them signed immediately,\u201d although one of them did not sign until two months afterwards. Each of the defendants was indebted to the assignor and the amount of the indebtedness was not in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">The conveyance of the debtor\u2019s property was founded on a valuable consideration. He was indebted to the assignee. The instrument was under seal, and by executing the deed of assignment the assignee became bound by its terms. Such an assignment is valid against subsequent attaching creditors, and the case is governed by <em>Reddy </em>v. <em>Raymond, </em>194 Mass. 367.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">The deed of assignment became effective as soon as it was executed by the assignor and by the trustee who was a creditor. It was not necessary to have the consent of all the creditors in order to make it legal; <em>Everett </em>v. <em>Walcott, </em>15 Pick. 94; and it was not contended that the assets in the hands of the assignee were sufficient to satisfy the claims of assenting creditors. <em>Douglas </em>v. <em>Simpson, </em>121 Mass. 281.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">The evidence of Carder that he understood the assignment to be for the benefit of some of his creditors, and not for the benefit of all, even if the evidence was admissible, does not affect the true meaning and construction of the document. The rights of all the parties were governed by the written instrument and its construction was for the court. In the absence of some statutory prohibition, a debtor has the common law right to make an assignment for the benefit of some or all of his creditors, and when fully executed it can be set aside only by proceedings in bankruptcy. \u201c It is true that the assignment could have been avoided by proceedings in bankruptcy seasonably begun or by attaching creditors before it has been fully executed; not however because it was necessarily in fraud of creditors, but in the former case be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>cause it is the policy of the law to take the distribution of bankrupt estates into its own hands, and in the latter case because until executed by one or more creditors the deed was ineffectual and the property remained the property of the debtor and was attachable as such. \u201d Morton, J., in <em>Reddy </em>v. <em>Raymond, </em>194 Mass. 367, 369. See <em>Banfield </em>v. <em>Whipple, </em>14 Allen, 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">It was not necessary to give notice of the assignment to the debtors of the assignor. <em>Thayer </em>v. <em>Daniels, </em>113 Mass. 129. <em>Putnam </em>v. <em>Story, </em>132 Mass. 205. <em>Kingman </em>v. <em>Perkins, </em>105 Mass. 111.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">While continued possession by the assignor of the goods conveyed to the assignee oftentimes is sufficient evidence of fraud, it is not conclusive under the circumstances disclosed by the evidence. <em>Rice </em>v. <em>Cunningham, </em>116 Mass. 466, 470.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">The instructions of the presiding judge were sufficient and accurate and the requests of Cropper were properly refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
