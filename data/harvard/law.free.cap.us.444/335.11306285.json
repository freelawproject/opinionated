By its bill of complaint as initially filed, Ohio asked that the Court declare and establish that the boundary line between the two States is \u201cthe low water mark on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>northerly side of the Ohio River in the year 1792.\u201d Leave to file the bill of complaint was granted. 384 U. S. 982 (1966). In due course, Kentucky filed its answer and a Special Master was appointed. 385 U. S. 803 (1966). In its answer, Kentucky alleged that the boundary fine is the current low-water mark on the northerly side of the Ohio River.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">Ohio later moved for leave to file an amended complaint that would assert, primarily, that the boundary between Ohio and Kentucky is the middle of the Ohio River, and, only alternatively, is the 1792 low-water mark on the northerly shore. That motion was referred to the Special Master. 404 U. S. 933 (1971). The Special Master held a hearing and in due course filed his report recommending that Ohio's petition for leave to amend be denied. 406 U. S. 915 (1972). Upon the filing of Ohio's exceptions and Kentucky\u2019s reply, the matter was set for hearing. 409 U. S. 974 (1972). After argument, the Special Master\u2019s recommendation was adopted, Ohio\u2019s motion for leave to amend was denied, and the case was remanded. 410 U. S. 641 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">The Honorable Robert Van Pelt, who by then had been appointed Special Master following the resignation of his predecessor, thereafter filed his report on the case as shaped by the original pleadings. That report was received and ordered filed. 439 U. S. 1123 (1979). Kentucky lodged exceptions to the report, and Ohio filed its' reply. Oral argument followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">The Special Master recommends' \"that this Court determine that the boundary between Ohi\u00f3 and Kentucky \u201cis the low-water mark on the northerly side of the Ohio River as it existed in the year 1792\u201d; that the boundary \u201cis not the low-water mark on the northerly side of the Ohio River as it exists today\u201d; and that such boundary, \u201cas nearly as it can now be ascertained, be determined either a) by agreement of the parties, if reasonably possible, or b) by joint survey agreed upon by the parties,\u201d or, in the absence of such an agreement or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>survey, after hearings conducted by the Special Master and the submission by him to this Court of proposed findings and conclusions. Report of Special Master 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">We agree with the Special Master. Much of the history concerning Virginia\u2019s cession to the United States of lands \u201cnorthwest of the river Ohio\u201d was reviewed and set forth in the Court\u2019s opinion concerning Ohio\u2019s motion for leave to amend its 1966 complaint. 410 U. S., at 645-648. Upon the denial of Ohio\u2019s motion, the case was left in the posture that the boundary between the two States was the river\u2019s northerly low-water mark. The litigation, thus, presently centers on where that northerly low-water mark is \u2014 is it the mark of 1792 when Kentucky was admitted to the Union, ch. IV, 1 Stat. 189, or is it a still more northerly mark due to the later damming of the river and the consequent rise of its waters?</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">It should be clear that the Ohio River between Kentucky and Ohio, or, indeed, between Kentucky and Indiana, is not the usual river boundary between States. It is not like the Missouri River between Iowa and Nebraska, see, <em>e. g., Nebraska </em>v. <em>Iowa, </em>143 U. S. 359 (1892), or the Mississippi River between Arkansas and Mississippi. See <em>Mississippi </em>v. <em>Arkansas, </em>415 U. S. 289 (1974), and 415 U. S. 302 (1974). See also <em>Iowa </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>147 U. S. 1 (1893); <em>Missouri </em>v. <em>Nebraska, </em>196 U.S. 23 (1904); <em>Minnesota </em>v. <em>Wisconsin, </em>252 U. S. 273 (1920); <em>New Jersey </em>v. <em>Delaware, </em>291 U. S. 361 (1934); <em>Arkansas </em>v. <em>Tennessee, </em>310 U. S. 563 (1940). In these customary situations the well-recognized and accepted rules of accretion and avulsion attendant upon a wandering river have full application.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">A river boundary situation, however, depending upon historical factors, may well differ from that customary situation. See, for example, <em>Texas </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>410 U. S. 702 (1973), where the Court was concerned with the Sabine River, Lake, and Pass. And in the Kentucky-Ohio and Kentucky-Indiana boundary situation, it is indeed different. Here the boundary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>is not the Ohio River just as a boundary river, but is the northerly edge, with originally Virginia and later Kentucky entitled to the river\u2019s expanse. This is consistently borne out by, among other documents, the 1781 Resolution of Virginia\u2019s GenerabAssembly for the cession to the United States (\u201cthe lands northwest of the river Ohio\u201d), 10 W. Hening, Laws of Virginia 564 (1822); the Virginia Act of 1783 (\u201cthe territory ... to the north-west of the river Ohio\u201d), 11 W. Hening, Laws of Virginia 326, 327 (1823); and the deed from Virginia to the United States (\u201cthe territory ... to the northwest of the river Ohio\u201d) accepted by the Continental Congress on March 1, 1784, 1 Laws of the United States 472, 474 (B. &amp; D. ed. 1815). The Court acknowledged this through Mr. Chief Justice Marshall\u2019s familiar pronouncement with respect to the Ohio River in <em>Handly\u2019s Lessee </em>v. <em>Anthony, 5 </em>Wheat. 374, 379 (1820):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-4\">\u201cWhen a great river is the boundary between two nations or states, if the original property is in neither, and there be no convention respecting it, each holds to the middle of the stream. But when, as in this case, one State is the original proprietor, and grants the territory on one side only, it retains the river within its own domain, and the newly-created State extends to the river only. The river, however, is its boundary.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">The dissent concedes as much. <em>Post, </em>at 342. The dissent then, however, would be persuaded by whatever is \u201cthe current low-water mark on the northern shore.\u201d <em>Post, at </em>343. But it is far too late in the day to equate the Ohio with the Missouri, with the Mississippi, or with any other boundary river that does not have the historical antecedents possessed by the Ohio, antecedents that fix the boundary not as the river itself, but as its northerly bank. <em>Handly\u2019s Lessee, </em>in our view, supports Ohio\u2019s position, not the dissent\u2019s. If there could be any doubt about this, it surely was dispelled completely when the Court decided <em>Indiana </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>136 U. S. 479 (1890). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>There Mr. Justice Field, speaking for a unanimous Court, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-5\">\u201c[Kentucky] succeeded to the ancient right and possession of Virginia, and they could not be affected by any subsequent change of the Ohio River, or by the fact that the channel in which that river once ran is now filled up from a variety of causes, natural and artificial, so that parties can pass on dry land from the tract in controversy to the State of Indiana. Its water might so depart from its ancient channel as to leave on the opposite side of the river entire counties of Kentucky, and the principle upon which her jurisdiction would then be determined is precisely that which must control in this case. <em>Missouri </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>11 Wall. 395, 401. Her dominion and jurisdiction continue as they existed at the time she was admitted into the Union, unaffected by the action of the forces of nature upon the course of the river.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-6\">\u201cOur conclusion is, that the waters of the Ohio River, when Kentucky became a State, flowed in a channel north of the tract known as Green River Island, and that the jurisdiction of Kentucky at that time extended, and ever since has extended, to what was then low-water mark on the north side of that channel, and the boundary between Kentucky and Indiana must run on that line, as nearly as it can now be ascertained, after the channel has been filled.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 508, 518-519.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">The fact that <em>Indiana </em>v. <em>Kentucky </em>concerned a portion of the Ohio River in its Indiana-Kentucky segment, rather than a portion in its Ohio-Kentucky segment, is of no possible legal consequence; the applicable principles are the same, and the holding in <em>Indiana </em>v. <em>Kentucky </em>has pertinent application and is controlling precedent here. The Court\u2019s flat pronouncements in <em>Indiana </em>v. <em>Kentucky </em>are hot to be rationalized away so readily as the dissent, <em>post, </em>at 343-345, would have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>them cast aside. Kentucky\u2019s present contentions, and those of the dissent, were rejected by this Court 90 years ago.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">We are not disturbed by the fact that boundary matters between Ohio and Kentucky by the Court\u2019s holding today will turn on the 1792 low-water mark of the river. Locating that line, of course, may be difficult, and utilization of a current, and changing, mark might well be more convenient. But knowledgeable surveyors, as the Special Master\u2019s report intimates, have the ability to perform this task. Like difficulties have not dissuaded the Court from concluding that locations specified many decades ago are proper and definitive boundaries. See, e. <em>g., Utah </em>v. <em>United States, </em>420 U. S. 304 (1975), and 427 U. S. 461 (1976); <em>New Hampshire </em>v. <em>Maine, </em>426 U. S. 363 (1976), and 434 U. S. 1 (1977). The dissent\u2019s concern about the possibility, surely extremely remote, that the comparatively stable Ohio River might \u201cpass completely out of Kentucky\u2019s borders,\u201d <em>post, </em>at 343, is of little weight. Situations where land of one State comes to be on the \u201cwrong\u201d side of its boundary river are not uncommon. See <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Omaha Indian Tribe, </em>442 U. S. 653 (1979); <em>Owen Equipment </em>&amp; <em>Erection Co. </em>v. <em>Kroger, </em>437 U. S. 365, 369, n. 5 (1978); <em>Missouri </em>v. <em>Nebraska, </em>196 U. S. 23 (1904).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">Finally, it is of no little interest that Kentucky sources themselves, in recent years, have made reference to the 1792 low-water mark as the boundary. Informational Bulletin No. 93 (1972), issued by the Legislative Research Commission of the Kentucky General Assembly, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-7\">\u201cKentucky\u2019s North and West boundary, to-wit, the low water mark on the North shore of the Ohio River as of 1792, has been recognized as the boundary based upon the fact that Kentucky was created from what was then Virginia.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 3.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-8\">See also the opinion of the Attorney General of Kentucky, OAG 63-847, contained in Kentucky Attorney General Opinions 1960-1964. See also <em>Perks </em>v. <em>McCracken, </em>169 Ky. 590, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>184 S. W. 891 (1916), where the court stated that the question in the case was \u201cwhere was the low water mark at the time Kentucky became a State.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">The exceptions of the Commonwealth of Kentucky to the report of the Special Master \u00e1re overruled. The report is hereby adopted, and the case is remanded to the Special Master so that with the cooperation of the parties he may prepare and submit to the Court an appropriate form of decree.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b487-6\">Mr. Justice Powell,</author>\n<p id=\"Ad1S\">with whom Mr. Justice White and Mr. Justice Rehnquist join, dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">The Court today holds that the present boundary between Ohio and Kentucky is the low-water mark of the northern shore of the Ohio River when Kentucky was admitted to the Union in 1792. This curious result frustrates the terms of the Virginia Cession of 1784 that first established the Ohio-Kentucky border, ignores Mr. Chief Justice Marshall\u2019s construction of that grant in <em>Handly\u2019s Lessee </em>v. <em>Anthony, 5 </em>Wheat. 374 (1820), is contrary to common-law rules of riparian boundaries, and creates a largely unidentifiable border. Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b487-9\">In 1784, the Commonwealth of Virginia ceded to the United States all of its territory \u201cto the northwest of the river Ohio.\u201d 1 Laws of the United States 472, 474 ( B. &amp; D. ed. 1815). As this Court recently observed, the border question \u201c \u2018depends chiefly on the land law of Virginia, and on the cession made by that State to the United States.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ohio </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>410 U. S. 641, 645 (1973), quoting <em>Handly\u2019s Lessee </em>v. <em>Anthony, supra, </em>at 376. The 1784 Cession was construed definitively in <em>Handly\u2019s Lessee, </em>a case involving a dispute over land that was connected to Indiana when the Ohio River was low, but which was separated from Indiana when the water was high. The Court held that since the 1784 Cession required that the river remain within Kentucky, the proper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>border was the low-water mark on the northern or northwestern shore. Consequently, the land in issue belonged to Indiana.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">Mr. Chief Justice Marshall, writing for the Court, pointed out that Virginia originally held the land that became both Indiana and Kentucky. Under the terms of the Virginia Cession, he stated: \u201cThese States, then, are to have <em>the </em>[Ohio] <em>river itself, wherever that may be, for their boundary.\u201d </em>5 Wheat., at 379 (emphasis supplied). The Chief Justice found support for that conclusion in the original Cession:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-6\">\u201c[W]hen, as in this case, one State [Virginia] is the original proprietor, and grants the territory on one side only, it retains the river within its own domain, and the newly-created State [Indiana] extends to the river only. The river, however, is its boundary.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">Such a riparian border, the Chief Justice emphasized, cannot be stationary over time. He wrote: \u201cAny gradual accretion of land, then, on the Indiana side of the Ohio, would belong to Indiana. . . .\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 380. This rule avoids the \u201cinconvenience\u201d of having a strip of land belonging to one State between another State and the river.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-8\">\u201cWherever the river is a boundary between States, it is the main, the permanent river, which constitutes that boundary; and the mind will find itself embarrassed with insurmountable difficulty in attempting to draw any other line than the low water mark.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 380-381.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-9\">Because the boundary between Ohio and Kentucky was established by the same events that.drew the line between Indiana and Kentucky, the holding in <em>Handly\u2019s Lessee </em>should control this case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Ohio River must remain the border between the States and within the domain of Kentucky. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number><em>only </em>way to ensure this result is to recognize the current low-water mark on the northern shore as the boundary.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">The approach taken by the Court today defeats the express terms of the Virginia Cession and ignores the explicit language of Mr. Chief Justice Marshall in <em>Handly\u2019s Lessee.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The Court\u2019s holding that the boundary forever remains where the low-water mark on the northern shore of the river was in 1792, regardless of the river\u2019s movements over time, may produce bizarre results. If erosion and accretion were to shift the river to the north of the 1792 low-water mark, today\u2019s ruling would place the river entirely within the State of Ohio. The river would thus pass completely out of Kentucky\u2019s borders despite the holding in <em>Handly\u2019s Lessee </em>that the Ohio \u201c[R]iver itself, wherever that may be, [is the] boundary.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 379. The river would not be the boundary between the two States nor would Kentucky as successor to Virginia \u201cretai[n] the river within its own domain\u201d as Mr. Chief Justice Marshall declared that it must. <em>Ibid. </em>Similarly, if the river were to move to the south of the 1792 line, Ohio would be denied a shore on the river. Sensible people could not have intended such results, which not only would violate the plain language of the 1784 Cession, but also would mock the congressional resolution accepting Ohio into the Union as a State \u201cbounded ... on the South by the Ohio [R]iver.\u201d Ch. XL, 2 Stat. 173.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">The Court, like the Special Master, disregards the teaching of <em>Handly\u2019s Lessee. </em>Instead,- the Court relies heavily on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>decision in <em>Indiana </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>136 U. S. 479 (1890), where Mr. Justice Field wrote that with respect to Kentucky\u2019s northern border, the State\u2019s \"dominion and jurisdiction continue as they existed at the time she was admitted into the Union [1792], unaffected by the action of the forces of nature upon the course of the river.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 508; <em>ante, </em>at 339. Kentucky argues, with some force, that the Court in 1890 found no change from the 1792 boundary because that case concerned the abandonment of a channel by the river, the sort of avul-sive change in course that ordinarily does not alter riparian boundaries. There is no sign of an avulsive change in the length of the Ohio River at issue in this case. Moreover, <em>Indiana </em>v. <em>Kentucky </em>went on to find that Indiana had acquiesced in Kentucky\u2019s prescription of the land at issue. There has been no showing before us that Kentucky has acquiesced to Ohio\u2019s claim that the 1792 low-water mark establishes the entire boundary between the two States. See n. 3, <em>infra. </em>Absent such a showing, I do not believe the holding in <em>Indiana </em>v. <em>Kentucky </em>should be applied here.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">In any event, the force of Mr. Justice Field\u2019s opinion as a precedent may be questioned on its face. The decision cannot be reconciled with <em>Handly\u2019s Lessee </em>or with any normal or practical construction of Virginia\u2019s Cession in 1784. Indeed, the Court\u2019s opinion is essentially devoid of reasoning. After reproducing the passages in <em>Handly\u2019s Lessee </em>that establish that Kentucky must retain jurisdiction over the river, Mr. Justice Field states abruptly that, nevertheless, the boundary should be set at the low-water mark \u201cwhen Kentucky became a State.\u201d 136 U. S., at 508. Mr. Justice Field apparently was unaware that, in effect, he was overruling the case on which he purported to rely. His conclusion is based simply on the startling view that when Kentucky \u201csucceeded to the ancient right and possession of Virginia\u201d in 1792, the new State received a boundary that \u201ccould not be affected by any subsequent change of the Ohio River.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number><em>Ibid. </em>The opinion offers no further explanation for its holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">Of course, Kentucky did succeed to Virginia\u2019s rights in 1792. After the Cession of 1784, Virginia was entitled to have the river within its jurisdiction and to have the northern low-water mark as the boundary between it and that part of the Northwest Territory that became Ohio and Indiana. Kentucky\u2019s entry into the Union could not, without more, replace those rights with the immutable boundary found by Mr. Justice Field. Neither Mr. Justice Field in 1890 nor the State of Ohio in this litigation pointed to any suggestion by Congress in 1792 that it intended such a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">Today\u2019s decision also contravenes the common law of riparian boundaries. In a dispute over the line between Arkansas and Tennessee along the Mississippi River, this Court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-8\">\u201c[W]here running streams are the boundaries between States, the same rule applies as between private proprietors, namely, that when the bed and channel are changed by the natural and gradual processes known as erosion and accretion, the boundary follows the varying course of the stream.\u201d <em>Arkansas </em>v. <em>Tennessee, </em>246 U. S. 158, 173 (1918).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-9\">See <em>Bonelli Cattle Co. </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>414 U. S. 313 (1973). This rule has an intensely practical basis, since it is exceedingly difficult to establish where a river flowed many years ago. Physical evidence of the river\u2019s path is almost certain to wash away over time, and documentary evidence either may not survive or may not be reliable.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-10\">The Court suggests that the Ohio-Kentucky boundary should not be determined by reference to previous river boundary decisions because the border in this case is not \u201cthe river itself, but ... its northerly bank.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 338. This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>contention contradicts Mr. Chief Justice Marshall\u2019s statement, quoted by the Court, that with respect to Kentucky\u2019s northern border, \u201c\u2018[t]he river, however, is its boundary.\u2019\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>In addition, the Court does not explain why established principles of riparian law are inapplicable simply because the northern low-water mark, not the center of the river, is the boundary. Since both lines shift over time, it is only sensible to adopt the common-law view that borders defined by those lines will move with them.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">IY</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">Following today\u2019s decision, all boundary matters between Ohio and Kentucky will turn on the location almost 200 years <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>ago of the northern low-water mark of the Ohio River. This cumbersome and uncertain outcome might be justified if it were dictated by unambiguous language in the Virginia Cession. But since the Court's decision is not only unworkable but also does violence to that deed as it has been construed by this Court, I cannot agree with its ruling today.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b488-10\"> Both parties to this litigation agree that the boundary between Kentucky -and Ohio is controlled by the same legal and historical considerations that define the boundary between Indiana and Kentucky.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b489-8\"> Mr. Chief Justice Marshall, the author of <em>Handly\u2019s Lessee, </em>would seem a particularly reliable interpreter of the 1784 Cession. The Chief Justice was not only a practicing lawyer in Richmond in 1783 and 1784, but also served as a member of the General Assembly of Virginia that approved the Cession. 1 A. Beveridge, The Life of John Marshall 202-241 (1919).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b492-7\"> The Court seeks support for today\u2019s decision from a recent statement by the Legislative Research Committee of the Kentucky General Assembly and a 1963 opinion of the Kentucky Attorney General. <em>Ante, </em>at 340. Although both documents refer to the 1792 low-water mark as the proper boundary, they are hardly authoritative pronouncements that should control our outcome. Indeed, other legislative and judicial statements refer to the northern low-water mark without any mention of the 1792 line. See 57 Stat. 248 (interstate Compact between Indiana and Kentucky defining the boundary as the \u201clow-water mark of the right side of the Ohio River\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Henderson County, </em>371 S. W. 2d 27, 29 (Ky. App. 1963) (Kentucky\u2019s boundary is \u201cnorth or northwest low watermark of the Ohio River\u201d); <em>Louisville Sand &amp; Gravel Co. </em>v. <em>Ralston, </em>266 S. W. 2d 119, 121 (Ky. App. 1954) (\u201c \u2018our state boundary is along the north bank of the Ohio river at low-water mark,\u201d\u2019 quoting <em>Willis </em>v. <em>Boyd, </em>224 Ky. 732, 735, 7 S. W. 2d 216, 218 (1928)).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">Under the doctrine of prescription and acquiescence, it may be proved that one party has recognized through its actions a riparian boundary claimed by another party. See <em>Michigan </em>v. <em>Wisconsin, </em>270 U. S. 295, 308 (1926). That question, however, is one of fact. The Special Master did not request evidence from the parties on this issue, so it is not properly before us now. We cannot decide such a question on the basis of particular shards of evidence that may come to our attention. In view of the conflicting evidence on the claim ofi prescription and acquiescence, the correct course would be to return this litigation to the Special Master for findings of fact on that question.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
