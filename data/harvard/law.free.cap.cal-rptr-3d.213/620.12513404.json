We conclude the record supports the trial court's implied findings that (1) Espinoza was lawfully arrested on reasonable cause to believe she had been driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI), (2) Espinoza refused to submit to and failed to complete a chemical test as required under the implied\n   consent law, and (3) Espinoza was afforded a fair hearing before the Department. Therefore, we conclude the superior court correctly denied Espinoza's petition, and we affirm the judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Investigation and Arrest.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At 1:40 a.m., on May 15, 2013, Sergeant Temple of the California Highway Patrol (CHP) was on routine patrol in the City of Riverside when he observed Espinoza driving a grey Hyundai and holding a cellular phone to the left side of her face. Espinoza appeared to be in the middle of a conversation, but when Espinoza saw Temple she lowered the phone from her ear. Temple activated his emergency lights, and Espinoza pulled over and stopped approximately two feet from the curb.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Temple approached and contacted Espinoza through her open driver's side window. Temple informed Espinoza that he had stopped her for talking on her phone while driving and asked for her driver's license. Espinoza handed Temple her driver's license and apologized for using her cellular phone while driving. While speaking to Espinoza, Temple smelled a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from the interior of Espinoza's vehicle. Temple asked Espinoza where she was coming from, and Espinoza responded she had been at a local bar. When Temple asked Espinoza if she had been drinking, Espinoza said she drank one cocktail but had not had anything else to drink for two hours. Espinoza's speech appeared to be normal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Temple asked Espinoza to step out of her vehicle, but Espinoza declined to cooperate. Espinoza informed Temple that she was a public defender; that she did not wish to perform any field sobriety tests or to step out of her vehicle; and citing\n   <em>\n    McNeely\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   a recently decided United States Supreme Court case, Espinoza said she would not submit to a blood test. When Temple again asked Espinoza to step out of her vehicle, Espinoza once again declined. Espinoza asked Temple to issue her a citation for the cellular phone violation (see Veh. Code,\n   <sup>\n    2\n   </sup>\n   \u00a7 23123, subd. (a) ), and said she would call a friend to come pick her up and take her home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   As Temple requested an additional officer to respond and conduct a DUI investigation,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Espinoza stepped out of her vehicle. Espinoza again informed Temple that she would not perform any field sobriety tests. While standing on the sidewalk, Espinoza crossed her legs, lost her balance, and stumbled a bit. As Espinoza spoke, Temple smelled a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage on Espinoza's breath. Temple also saw that Espinoza's eyes were red.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Officer Gonzalez of the CHP then arrived on the scene. Temple told Gonzalez what he had observed, identified Espinoza, and directed Gonzalez to conduct a DUI investigation. When Gonzalez walked up to Espinoza, he immediately smelled a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage on Espinoza's person and on her breath. Gonzalez also saw that Espinoza had red, bloodshot, and watery eyes. Espinoza was standing\n   normally, and she was not swaying or moving about. Gonzalez asked Espinoza if she had been drinking, and Espinoza replied she had a drink two hours earlier. Espinoza then told Gonzalez that she was a Riverside County public defender and knew her rights; that she did not want to have any problems with her work; that Gonzalez should not ask her any field sobriety questions because she would not answer them and would not perform any field sobriety tests; and again cited\n   <em>\n    McNeely\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   As she did with Temple, Espinoza asked that Gonzalez issue her a citation for the cellular phone violation and said she would have a friend come and pick her up. Espinoza began to look at her cellular phone, and she fumbled and dropped her keys. As she spoke, Espinoza repeated herself several times within a short period of time that she would rather be issued a citation and have a friend come pick her up. Espinoza did not slur her speech and she was coherent, but she was crying and very emotional the whole time Gonzalez spoke to her. Gonzalez did not detect any mental impairment while talking to Espinoza. Gonzalez asked Espinoza to cooperate or he would arrest her for DUI based on his and Temple's observations. Espinoza refused to cooperate and said she could call a supervisor from her office to come pick her up.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Based on his own observations of Espinoza and based on Temple's observations, Gonzalez concluded Espinoza had been driving while under the influence of alcohol and placed her under arrest. Espinoza became emotional and upset. Gonzalez admonished Espinoza pursuant to the implied consent law that she had to submit to a blood or breath test. Espinoza told Gonzalez she would take a blood test \"pursuant to\n   <em>\n    McNeely\n   </em>\n   .\" Gonzalez told Espinoza that her refusal to submit to a chemical test would result in her license being suspended for one year. Gonzalez then transported Espinoza to the county jail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   At the jail, Espinoza refused to submit to a chemical test. Using a DS 367 form (\"AGE 21 AND OLDER OFFICER'S STATEMENT\"), Gonzalez advised Espinoza that: (1) she was suspected of driving under the influence of alcohol and, therefore, had the right to choose a blood or breath test; (2) refusal to submit to or failure to complete a blood or breath test would result in her license being suspended for one year or revoked for two or three years; (3) refusal to submit to or failure to complete a blood or breath test could be used against her in court and would result in a fine and imprisonment if she was convicted of DUI; (4) she did not have the right to have an attorney present when deciding whether to submit to a chemical test and when choosing which test; and (5) if she was incapable of completing one of the two test options, she had to submit to the other.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Espinoza told Gonzalez she would submit to a blood test, but only if the officer obtained a \"subpoena,\" \"pursuant to\n   <em>\n    McNeely\n   </em>\n   \" from the on-duty judge, compelling her to submit to a blood test. Gonzalez understood Espinoza to mean she would submit to a blood test if he first got a warrant. Gonzalez told Espinoza that her willingness to submit to a blood test with a warrant would be treated as a refusal. Gonzalez also told Espinoza that, after the decision in\n   <em>\n    McNeely\n   </em>\n   , the policy of the CHP was to obtain warrants for forced blood draws only in felony DUI cases,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and that no warrant would be requested in Espinoza's case. No warrant was obtained, so no\n   blood test was taken. In addition, Espinoza did not submit to a breath test. Espinoza was then booked into jail on suspicion of DUI. Gonzalez personally served Espinoza with notice that her driver's license was suspended or revoked, and forwarded the DS 367 form and his DUI investigation report to the Department.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Administrative Per Se Hearing.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Espinoza requested an administrative hearing to review the order suspending her driver's license, during which Temple and Gonzalez testified to the facts just stated. Espinoza introduced the expert testimony of Felix D'Amico, a retired sheriff's sergeant and drug recognition expert. D'Amico testified he reviewed the reports prepared by the arresting officer and the mobile video audio recording (MVAR) taken from Gonzalez's police vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   D'Amico testified he observed no \"bad driving\" on Espinoza's part, although she was talking on a cellular phone, and that Espinoza had no problem getting out of her vehicle and walking to the curb. Contrary to Temple's account, D'Amico testified that after viewing the MVAR, he concluded Espinoza parked no more than 12 inches from the curb when she was stopped, and there was nothing wrong with the way she parked. D'Amico testified Espinoza did not slur her speech, she had no problem answering the officers' questions, and she was coherent. With regard to Gonzalez's testimony that he observed no mental impairment, D'Amico testified a person cannot be under the influence of alcohol if he or she is not mentally impaired. D'Amico testified he observed no mental impairment because Espinoza had no problem answering the officers' questions and, although she refused to submit to any tests, she did not argue with or show animosity toward the officers. D'Amico also testified that Espinoza was standing straight, she was not swaying, she did not have an unsteady gait, and she did not fall down.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   D'Amico testified bloodshot eyes do not necessarily indicate a person is under the influence of alcohol because there are many reasons why a person's eyes may become bloodshot. D'Amico testified odor of an alcoholic beverage on a person's breath merely indicates the person had alcohol in his or her mouth at some point and does not indicate the person actually swallowed the alcohol. D'Amico opined that Espinoza was not under the influence of alcohol and, therefore, Officer Gonzalez did not have probable cause to lawfully place Espinoza under arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The hearing officer examined D'Amico. D'Amico testified that if a person merely puts alcohol in his or her mouth but does not swallow it, the alcohol will dissipate entirely in about 20 minutes. If Espinoza had merely placed alcohol in her mouth but had not swallowed it, the alcohol would have dissipated during the stop and investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In her notification of findings and decision, the hearing officer sustained the one-year suspension of Espinoza's driver's license. The hearing officer found: (1) Gonzalez had reasonable cause to believe Espinoza drove under the influence of alcohol; (2) Espinoza was lawfully arrested; (3) Espinoza was told her driver's license would be suspended or revoked if she refused to submit to or failed to complete a chemical test; and (4) Espinoza refused to submit to or failed to complete a chemical test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In her findings of fact, the hearing officer concluded Officer Gonzalez had probable cause to lawfully arrest Espinoza for DUI based on the objective symptoms of bloodshot and watery eyes and the odor of an alcoholic beverage, and based on the additional facts that Espinoza refused to perform field sobriety tests and admitted to consuming alcohol. The hearing officer\n   also concluded Gonzalez correctly admonished Espinoza under the implied consent law that her license would be suspended or revoked if she refused to submit to or failed to complete a chemical test. With respect to Espinoza's refusal to submit to a chemical test, the hearing officer concluded Espinoza's conditional submission under\n   <em>\n    McNeely\n   </em>\n   was a refusal. The hearing officer concluded\n   <em>\n    McNeely\n   </em>\n   only applies to forced blood draws, and Gonzalez did not request a forced blood draw. In addition, the hearing officer concluded Espinoza \"adamantly refused all other test[s].\" The hearing officer found that Temple and Gonzalez were credible witnesses, and found D'Amico's testimony to be biased and entitled to little weight.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   PROCEEDINGS IN THE SUPERIOR COURT\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   After being served with the Department's administrative per se findings and decision, Espinoza filed a petition for writ of review and administrative mandamus in the superior court challenging the hearing officer's decision. In her points and authorities in support of the petition, Espinoza argued: (1) she was not lawfully arrested because Gonzalez lacked reasonable cause to believe she was under the influence of alcohol; (2) she had a right under\n   <em>\n    McNeely\n   </em>\n   to force the police to obtain a warrant before they drew her blood and, therefore, her conditional consent to a blood test did not amount to a refusal; and (3) the hearing officer's complete disregard of D'Amico's expert testimony and a number of errors on the face of the hearing officer's decision showed the decision was not made in accordance with due process. The Department filed an answer and opposition to the petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   At the hearing on Espinoza's petition, the superior court stated its tentative decision was to deny the petition. Espinoza's counsel argued that Espinoza had met her burden of showing the administrative decision was contrary to the weight of the evidence because it contained numerous factual errors. Counsel also argued the administrative hearing was a \"farce\" because the hearing officer completely disregarded Espinoza's expert witness for no good reason. The court took the matter under submission after hearing argument from the Department.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The court subsequently entered an order denying the petition. Neither party requested a statement of decision (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 632 ), so the trial court did not issue written findings. Thereafter, the trial court entered a judgment in favor of the Department and against Espinoza. The judgment dissolved the stay on Espinoza's license suspension and awarded the Department its costs. The Attorney General served Espinoza with a notice of entry of the judgment, and Espinoza timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Applicable Law.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   As pertinent here, the implied consent law provides that drivers who are arrested on suspicion of DUI are deemed to have consented to chemical testing to determine their blood-alcohol concentration (BAC). (\u00a7 23612, subd. (a)(1)(A);\n   <em>\n    Troppman v. Valverde\n   </em>\n   (2007)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3158645\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/40/1121/#p1129\">\n    40 Cal.4th 1121\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1129-1130,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=57%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20306\">\n    57 Cal.Rptr.3d 306\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=156%20P.3d%20328\">\n    156 P.3d 328\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) Testing for BAC is incidental to a lawful arrest for DUI and at the direction of the peace officer having reasonable cause to believe the motorist drove under the influence of alcohol in violation of section 23152. (\u00a7 23612, subd. (a)(1)(C).) The motorist\n   must be admonished that failure to submit to or failure to complete a chemical test will result in a fine, mandatory imprisonment if the motorist is subsequently convicted of DUI under sections 23152 or 23153, and suspension of his or her driver's license. (\u00a7 23612, subd. (a)(1)(D).) A motorist arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol \"has the choice of whether the test shall be of his or her blood or breath and the officer shall advise the person that he or she has that choice. If the person arrested either is incapable, or states that he or she is incapable, of completing the chosen test, the person shall submit to the remaining test.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . subd. (a)(2)(A).) If both blood and breath tests are unavailable, the motorist must submit to a urine test. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . subds. (a)(1)(A), (a)(2)(A), &amp; (d)(2).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The administrative per se procedure is the means by which the Department suspends or revokes a motorist's driver's license for driving under the influence or for refusing to submit to a chemical test under the implied consent law. \"The procedure is called 'administrative per se' because it does not impose criminal penalties, but simply suspends a person's driver's license as an administrative matter upon a showing the person was arrested for driving with a certain blood-alcohol concentration, without additional evidence of impairment. [Citation.] The express legislative purposes of the administrative suspension procedure are: (1) to provide safety to persons using the highways by quickly suspending the driving privilege of persons who drive with excessive blood-alcohol levels; (2) to guard against erroneous deprivation by providing a prompt administrative review of the suspension; and (3) to place no restriction on the ability of a prosecutor to pursue related criminal actions.

During this interim period, arrestees who would eventually be convicted of an intoxication-related driving offense were permitted to continue driving and, possibly, endangering the public. Moreover, without administrative per se laws, persons with extremely high blood-alcohol concentration levels at the time of arrest could escape license suspension or revocation by plea bargaining to lesser crimes or entering pretrial diversion. Thus, by providing for an administrative license suspension prior to the criminal proceeding, the law affords the public added protection. [Citation.]\" (\n   <em>\n    MacDonald v.

(\u00a7\u00a7 13353, subd. (c), 23612, subds. (e), (f).) The officer must take possession of the motorist's California driver's license and immediately forward to the Department a copy of the completed notice of suspension or revocation and the driver's license taken from the motorist. (\u00a7 23612, subds. (f), (g)(1).) Upon receipt of the notice of suspension or revocation and the officer's sworn statement that the officer had reasonable cause to believe the motorist drove under the influence of alcohol in violation of section 23152, the Department shall suspend the motorist's driver's license for one year or\n   revoke the motorist's driver's license for two or three years if the motorist falls within certain DUI recidivist statutes. (\u00a7 13353, subd. (a)(1)-(3).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The Department must also conduct a review of the record, including the officer's sworn statement, to determine whether the following facts are true: (1) the officer had reasonable cause to believe the motorist drove under the influence of alcohol in violation of section 23152; (2) the motorist was lawfully detained; (3) the motorist refused to submit to or failed to complete a chemical test after being requested by a peace officer; and (4) the motorist was admonished that his or her driving privilege would be suspended or revoked if he or she refused to submit to or failed to complete a chemical test.

Espinoza exhibited some of the classic, objective symptoms of intoxication, including having red, bloodshot, and watery eyes, and having a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage on her breath. Based on a strong odor of alcohol on Espinoza's breath (detectable in the open air during the entire investigation and not just inside the passenger compartment to Espinoza's vehicle), the officers were not required to believe Espinoza when she said she had not had a drink for two hours.

Although Espinoza appeared to be standing straight and did not slur her words, she stumbled when standing on the sidewalk and she fumbled and dropped her keys. Espinoza was emotional and cried the entire time she spoke to Gonzalez, and she repeated herself numerous times. In addition, when Espinoza pulled over, she\n   parked approximately two feet away from the curb.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Espinoza's crying, her initial refusal to get out of her vehicle, her complete refusal to answer field sobriety questions or to perform field sobriety tests, and her repeated requests to be let off with a citation, were additional factors a reasonable officer could properly consider when determining whether there was probable cause to believe Espinoza drove while under the influence of alcohol. Viewing these facts in their totality, we conclude substantial evidence supports the superior court's implied finding that Espinoza was lawfully arrested based on probable cause of DUI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   In arguing Gonzalez did not have probable cause to arrest her, Espinoza places much weight on Gonzalez's testimony that, when he spoke to Espinoza, he observed no mental impairment. That Espinoza appeared coherent and had no problems communicating with Gonzalez was certainly some evidence that Espinoza was not under the influence. But because we find substantial evidence to support probable cause to arrest Espinoza for DUI, we must affirm the trial court's implied finding.

But, even assuming that was the true basis for the arrest, Gonzalez's subjective reasons for arresting Espinoza are irrelevant. When determining whether there was probable cause for an arrest and, therefore, that the arrest was lawful, the sole question is whether a\n   <em>\n    reasonable officer\n   </em>\n   in the same position would\n   <em>\n    objectively\n   </em>\n   conclude there was probable cause to arrest.

Although Espinoza had a constitutional right to be free from a warrantless,\n   <em>\n    coerced\n   </em>\n   search of her blood incident to her lawful arrest, she had no such right with respect to a breath test. When Espinoza was told the policy of the CHP was to obtain warrants for forced blood draws only in felony DUI cases, and that a warrant would not be obtained in her case, Espinoza was required to choose a breath test.

In the first case, Birchfield accidentally drove his vehicle off the road and was seen by a state trooper trying unsuccessfully to drive out of a ditch. When the state trooper approached, he smelled a \"strong whiff of alcohol\" on Birchfield, saw that Birchfield had bloodshot and watery eyes, and observed that Birchfield spoke with a slur and struggled to remain steady on his feet. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at p. ---- [136 S.Ct. at p. 2170 ].) Birchfield agreed to take field sobriety tests, but performed poorly on each.

Birchfield consented to a roadside breath test (a preliminary alcohol screening test), which showed Birchfield had a BAC of 0.254 percent. (\n   <em>\n    Ibid\n   </em>\n   . )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   After placing Birchfield under arrest for DUI, the state trooper advised Birchfield of his obligation under the North Dakota implied consent law to submit to further BAC testing, and that refusal to submit to a test would result in criminal penalties.

(\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at pp. ---- [136 S.Ct. at pp. 2170-2171 ].) Birchfield appealed his conviction, arguing the Fourth Amendment prohibited the state from criminalizing his refusal to submit to a blood test. Citing\n   <em>\n    McNeely\n   </em>\n   's favorable discussion of implied consent laws, the North Dakota Supreme Court rejected Birchfield's challenge.

When police officers arrived, a witness identified a man (Bernard) in his underwear as the driver. Bernard admitted to drinking, but denied that he was the driver and refused to submit to field sobriety tests. The officers smelled alcohol on Bernard's breath and saw that his eyes were bloodshot and watery, so they arrested Bernard for DUI. (\n   <em>\n    Ibid\n   </em>\n   . ) At the police station, the police informed Bernard that his refusal to submit to BAC testing, as required under the Minnesota implied consent law, was a criminal offense. When asked to submit to a breath test, Bernard refused. He was charged with refusing to submit to a BAC test, but the state trial court dismissed the charges, concluding the warrantless breath test Bernard refused to take was not permitted under the Fourth Amendment. (\n   <em>\n    Birchfield\n   </em>\n   , at p. ---- [136 S.Ct. at p. 2171 ].) The Minnesota Supreme Court reversed, concluding a warrantless breath test is permissible under the Fourth Amendment as a search-incident-to-arrest.

When the police officer walked up to Beylund's vehicle, the officer saw an empty wine glass in the center console and\n   smelled alcohol. The officer asked Beylund to step out of his vehicle, and as he did so, Beylund struggled to keep his balance. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at p. ---- [136 S.Ct. at p. 2172 ].) The officer arrested Beylund for DUI and transported him to a nearby hospital. The officer then read Beylund the North Dakota implied consent advisory, and told Beylund that his refusal to submit to a BAC test was a crime. Beylund submitted to a blood test, which showed he had a BAC of 0.250 percent. (\n   <em>\n    Ibid\n   </em>\n   . ) Beylund's driver's license was suspended for two years after an administrative hearing. (\n   <em>\n    Ibid\n   </em>\n   . ) He challenged that decision, arguing his consent to the blood test was coerced by the officer's warning under the implied consent law that refusal to submit to the test was a crime. The North Dakota Supreme Court rejected the challenge, concluding the penalty of license suspension for refusing to submit to a blood test was constitutional and that Beylund's consent was voluntarily given because the implied consent advisory was not misleading. (\n   <em>\n    Ibid\n   </em>\n   . )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The United States Supreme Court granted writs of certiorari in those three cases and consolidated them \"in order to decide whether motorists lawfully arrested for drunk driving may be convicted of a crime or otherwise penalized for refusing to take a warrantless test measuring the alcohol in their bloodstream.\" (\n   <em>\n    Birchfield\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 579 U.S. at p. ---- [136 S.Ct. at p. 2172].) The high court noted that success for the three petitioners depended \"on the proposition that the criminal law ordinarily may not compel a motorist to submit to the taking of a blood sample or to a breath test unless a warrant authorizing such testing is issued by a magistrate. If, on the other hand, such warrantless searches comport with the Fourth Amendment, it follows that a State may criminalize the refusal to comply with a demand to submit to the required testing, just as a State may make it a crime for a person to obstruct the execution of a valid search warrant.

First, the physical intrusion of a breath test is almost negligible because it does not require piercing of the skin and entails minimal inconvenience. (\n   <em>\n    Birchfield\n   </em>\n   , at p. ---- [136 S.Ct. at p. 2176 ].) Second, breath tests are only capable of revealing a person's BAC, and no sample remains for the police to possess. A blood sample, in contrast, can be stored and potentially reveal highly personal information about the person. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at p. ---- [136 S.Ct. at p. 2177 ].) Finally, the court concluded participation in a breath test is unlikely to enhance the embarrassment inherent in an arrest, and the act of blowing into a breathalyzer is not inherently embarrassing and normally takes place in private. (\n   <em>\n    Ibid\n   </em>\n   . )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   In contrast, the court concluded a blood test does implicate significant privacy concerns.

Unlike a breath test, a blood test requires piercing the skin and extracting a part of the body. (\n   <em>\n    Ibid\n   </em>\n   . ) \"And while humans exhale air from their lungs many times per minute, humans do not continually shed blood. It is true, of course, that people voluntarily submit to the taking of blood samples as part of a physical examination, and the process involves little pain or risk. [Citation.] Nevertheless, for many, the process is not one they relish. It is significantly more intrusive than blowing into a tube.\" (\n   <em>\n    Ibid\n   </em>\n   . ) Finally, unlike a breath test, a blood test provides the police with a sample they may store and potentially test for many things other than BAC, which may result in anxiety for the person forced to submit to the blood test. (\n   <em>\n    Ibid\n   </em>\n   . )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   As for the governmental need at issue, the court reaffirmed that \"[t]he States and the Federal Government have a 'paramount interest ... in preserving the safety of ... public highways.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Birchfield\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 579 U.S. at p. ---- [136 S.Ct. at p. 2178], quoting\n   <em>\n    Mackey v.

(\n   <em>\n    Birchfield\n   </em>\n   , at p. ---- [136 S.Ct. at p. 2178 ].) The court noted the states and the federal government had enacted drunk driving and implied consent laws to reduce those fatalities and injuries.

The Supreme Court reached a different conclusion about blood tests. \"Blood tests are significantly more intrusive, and their reasonableness must be judged in light of the availability of the less invasive alternative of a breath test.\" (\n   <em>\n    Ibid\n   </em>\n   . ) \"Because breath tests are significantly less intrusive than blood tests and in most cases amply serve law enforcement interests, we conclude that a breath test, but not a blood test, may be administered as a search incident to a lawful arrest for drunk driving. As in all cases involving reasonable searches incident to arrest, a warrant is not needed in this situation.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at p. ---- [136 S.Ct. at p. 2185 ].)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The Supreme Court next rejected the state's argument that warrantless blood tests incident to arrest are justified based on a motorist's implied consent. (\n   <em>\n    Birchfield\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 579 U.S. at p. ---- [136 S.Ct. at p. 2185].) \"It is well established that a search is reasonable when the subject consents [citation], and that sometimes consent to a search need not be express but may be fairly inferred from context [citations]. Our prior opinions have referred approvingly to the general concept of implied-consent laws that impose civil penalties and evidentiary consequences on motorists who refuse to comply. [Citations.] Petitioners do not question the constitutionality of those laws, and nothing we say here should be read to cast doubt on them. [\u00b6] It is another matter, however, for a State not only to insist upon an intrusive blood test, but also to impose criminal penalties on the refusal to submit to such a test. There must be a limit to the consequences to which motorists may be deemed to have consented by virtue of a decision to drive on public roads.\" (\n   <em>\n    Ibid\n   </em>\n   . ) Therefore, the court concluded a motorist may not be deemed to consent to a blood test on pain of criminal prosecution. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at p. ---- [136 S.Ct. at p. 2186 ].)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Finally, the Supreme Court applied its legal conclusions to the three cases before it. (\n   <em>\n    Birchfield\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 579 U.S. at pp. ---- [136 S.Ct. at pp. 2186-2187].) The court held Birchfield could not be forced to submit to a warrantless blood test incident to his arrest. Because the record did not indicate that a breath test would not have satisfied the state's interest in testing Birchfield's BAC, and there were no exigent circumstances to support a warrantless blood test, the court held Birchfield was threatened with an unlawful search and reversed his conviction for refusing to submit to a blood test. (\n   <em>\n    Ibid\n   </em>\n   . ) In contrast, the Supreme Court held a warrantless breath test was a permissible search incident to Bernard's arrest. \"[T]he Fourth Amendment did not require officers to obtain a warrant prior to demanding the [breath] test,\n   <em>\n    and Bernard had no right to refuse it\n   </em>\n   .\" (\n   <em>\n    Ibid\n   </em>\n   . italics added) Lastly, the court vacated Beylund's license suspension because the North Dakota Supreme Court had erroneously concluded the state could compel both blood tests and breath tests incident to arrest. (\n   <em>\n    Ibid\n   </em>\n   . ) The Supreme Court remanded the case for a determination of whether Beylund's consent to the blood test was freely and voluntarily given in light of the inaccuracy of the officer's advisement.

But the legality of\n   <em>\n    civil\n   </em>\n   penalties for refusing to submit to a warrantless blood test was not squarely presented in\n   <em>\n    Birchfield\n   </em>\n   , and we remain somewhat doubtful whether the high court would approve of a civil license suspension predicated solely on a motorist's refusal to submit to a warrantless\n   <em>\n    blood\n   </em>\n   test. Rather than decide whether Espinoza's license could be lawfully suspended based solely on her refusal to submit to a warrantless blood test, we conclude her license was lawfully suspended because she did not submit to a warrantless breath test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The police could not force Espinoza to submit to a blood test against her will unless they obtained a warrant or showed there were exigent circumstances that justified a warrantless search. (\n   <em>\n    Birchfield\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 579 U.S. at p. ---- [136 S.Ct. at p. 2174] ;\n   <em>\n    McNeely\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 569 U.S. at pp. ----, ----, ---- [133 S.Ct. at pp. 1561, 1563, 1568].) Consequently, we assume without deciding, that Espinoza could refuse to submit to a warrantless blood test unless the police obtained a warrant, and that, without more, her refusal to do so could not result in her license being suspended. (See\n   <em>\n    Birchfield\n   </em>\n   , at pp. ---- [136 S.Ct. at pp. 2185-2186 ].)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   However, as the Supreme Court clearly held in\n   <em>\n    Birchfield\n   </em>\n   , the Fourth Amendment does not prohibit the police from forcing a motorist to submit to a warrantless\n   <em>\n    breath\n   </em>\n   test incident to his or her arrest, the motorist has no right to refuse to submit to a breath test or to condition his or her submission on the police obtaining a warrant, and the motorist's refusal to submit to the breath test may be the basis of criminal penalties. (\n   <em>\n    Birchfield\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 579 U.S. at pp. ----, ---- [136 S.Ct. at pp. 2184, 2186].) In light of that clear holding, we conclude refusal to submit to a breath test incident to arrest may also be the basis of imposing civil penalties under the implied consent law, including suspension or revocation of the motorist's driver's license.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Gonzalez properly informed Espinoza that she had the obligation under section 23612 to submit to a blood\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   a breath test; that if she was incapable of completing one of those tests, she had to choose the other; and that failure to submit to or to complete a chemical test would result in her driver's license being suspended or revoked. When Espinoza said she would submit to a blood test if Gonzalez first obtained a warrant, Gonzalez told Espinoza that the policy of the CHP was only to obtain warrants for forced blood draws in felony DUI cases and that a warrant would not be obtained in Espinoza's case. Under the facts of this case, a blood test was simply unavailable. (Cf.\n   <em>\n    White v.

Once Espinoza stated unequivocally that she would not submit to a blood test unless Gonzalez obtained a warrant, and Gonzalez made it clear a warrant would not be forthcoming and, therefore, that a blood test would not be performed, Espinoza had an affirmative obligation to submit to and complete a breath test.

Espinoza's license was not suspended merely because she invoked her right under\n   <em>\n    McNeely\n   </em>\n   to be free from a warrantless blood test, but because she refused to submit to and complete a chemical test. Had Espinoza voluntarily submitted to and completed a breath test, we would agree that her refusal to submit to a warrantless blood test, by itself, would not be a lawful basis for her license suspension. Instead, Espinoza purported to consent to a blood test if Gonzalez obtained a warrant and then failed to consent to a breath test when she learned a warrant would not be forthcoming.

When Gonzalez informed Espinoza that, under the CHP's policy, he would not obtain a warrant and that a forced blood test would not be administered, Gonzalez in fact honored Espinoza's rights under\n   <em>\n    McNeely\n   </em>\n   . Under\n   <em>\n    Birchfield\n   </em>\n   , however,\n   Espinoza had no negative right to be free from a warrantless breath test incident to her lawful arrest for DUI.

We conclude the superior court's implied finding that Espinoza obtained a fair hearing is supported by the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   With respect to D'Amico's testimony, the parties use a considerable amount of space in their briefs discussing whether the\n   <em>\n    hearing officer\n   </em>\n   correctly found that D'Amico was biased and what if any weight the hearing officer should have given to D'Amico's expert testimony. Regardless of whatever deference the superior court was required to accord the hearing officer's credibility findings (see Gov. Code, \u00a7 11425.50, subd. (b) ), on appeal we are only concerned with the\n   <em>\n    superior court's\n   </em>\n   findings. (2 Cal. Administrative Mandamus,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , Appeal From Superior Court Judgment, \u00a7 16.51, pp. 16-36 to 16-37 [\"When reviewing cases in which a trial court used the independent judgment test, the appellate court focuses on the findings made by the superior court.\"].) We are not free to reweigh the evidence, and we must resolve all conflicts in the evidence in favor of the superior court's judgment. (\n   <em>\n    Arthur\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 184 Cal.App.4th at p. 1205,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=109%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20384\">\n    109 Cal.Rptr.3d 384\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) Appellate courts must generally defer to the superior court's resolution of questions of witness credibility. (\n   <em>\n    Schneer v. Llaurado\n   </em>\n   (2015)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6053854\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/242/1276/#p1285\">\n    242 Cal.App.4th 1276\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1285,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=195%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20858\">\n    195 Cal.Rptr.3d 858\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) By denying Espinoza's petition, the superior court impliedly rejected the contention that she did not receive a fair hearing and impliedly found D'Amico's testimony-that Gonzalez did not have probable cause to arrest Espinoza-lacked credibility and/or was entitled to little or no weight. We may not revisit or reweigh that implied resolution of credibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   With respect to the errors in the hearing officer's ruling, we must reject Espinoza's argument. Although the decision addressed an argument Espinoza did not actually make at the administrative hearing regarding reasonable suspicion to perform a traffic stop, and it contained some minor errors (e.g., the hearing officer referred to Espinoza as the \"Respondent\" instead of the appellant in the hearing and as a \"District Attorney\" instead of a public defender, and the hearing officer referred to the decision in\n   <em>\n    Missouri v. McNeely\n   </em>\n   as \"\n   <em>\n    DMV v. McNealy\n   </em>\n   \"), they hardly demonstrate a lack of due process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Finally, we do not agree with Espinoza's assertion that the decision shows the hearing officer applied the wrong legal standard when it found Gonzalez had probable cause to arrest Espinoza for DUI. The hearing officer clearly articulated her conclusion that, based on Gonzalez and Temple's observations of Espinoza, \"Officer Gonzalez had reasonable cause to believe that Respondent was driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol.\" This was the correct standard and, as we conclude\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   , the record supports the superior court's implied finding that Gonzalez had reasonable cause to arrest Espinoza for DUI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   V.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   DISPOSITION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   The judgment is affirmed.

The same Fourth Amendment probable cause standard applies in civil cases arising from an arrest or seizure. (See\n    <em>\n     Luchtel v.
