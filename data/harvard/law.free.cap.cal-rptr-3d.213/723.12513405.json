She contends that she did not voluntarily and knowingly waive her right to remain silent when she spoke to the police after having been advised of her rights under\n   <em>\n    Miranda v. Arizona\n   </em>\n   (1966)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12046400\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/384/436/\">\n    384 U.S. 436\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12046400\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/384/436/\">\n    86 S.Ct. 1602\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12046400\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/384/436/\">\n    16 L.Ed.2d 694\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   ), and that the trial court erred in admitting her statements made during the police interrogation and in refusing to excise from the evidence presented to the jury a statement by the interrogating detective. She also contends the sentence imposed constitutes constitutionally prohibited cruel and unusual punishment. We shall affirm the conviction but conclude this is the rare case in which there is merit to defendant's constitutional challenge to the sentence imposed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The record contains extensive testimony from numerous witnesses describing the incident that culminated in the shooting that rendered the victim a quadriplegic. However, a detailed recitation of the evidence is unnecessary in view of the issues raised on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In brief, the shooting occurred after midnight on August 19, 2012, during the course of defendant's 19th birthday party, outside the Richmond home where she lived with her parents. Although there was conflicting evidence as to what precipitated the incident, it is undisputed that a confrontation occurred between defendant's father (who like others had been drinking at the party) and the victim Oscar Barcenas and his friend Miguel Magdaleno. The father and others were outside in front of the house when Barcenas and Magdaleno\n   drove by in a truck and (for disputed reasons) exited the truck and engaged in a physical confrontation with defendant's father. Defendant emerged from the house, observed the two men hitting and pushing her father and, according to defendant, pushed her when she attempted to separate the\n   men. Defendant testified that she saw her father on the floor with \"his face full of blood,\" she was scared, she said, and yelled at the two men to leave and they threatened to return, telling her they were gang members. Defendant was handed a gun by her boyfriend\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and approached the truck to which Barcenas and Magdaleno had retreated preparing to leave, and fired one shot into the cab of the truck, piercing Barcenas's spinal cord.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   About a half hour after police responded to the scene, defendant approached an officer and, as the officer testified without objection, acknowledged that she had shot the victim. As the officer was handcuffing her, she explained that \"she was defending her father and that's why she shot the subject in the vehicle.\" At trial she testified that as she was standing next to the driver's side of the truck, Barcenas \"was coming outside of the truck towards me.\" She continued, \"He looked like he just turned around from looking in his center console. When I turned around, he was already coming out. I was scared.\" She said she shot \"[b]ecause I seen him come out the car and I thought he had something, he was gonna do something to me. I was already scared because he was saying that he's in a gang, and that's really scary to me.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Over defendant's objection, the recording of her interrogation by two detectives at the police station that began at 6:50 that morning was played for the jury. At one point during the questioning, defendant stated that when Barcenas and Magdaleno returned to the truck \"and they're like, 'Oh I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry,' I was like, 'What the fuck do you mean you're sorry?' ... [\u00b6] ... [\u00b6] ... I was like 'What the hell?' I was like, 'How are you gonna say you're sorry after you come and beat someone's dad not knowing what the fuck is going on?' I was like, 'Fuck that.' And then they were just like, man. They were just saying some of this ignorant stuff. They got on my nerves. And then I just shot the dude. I was like what the hell? Like 'cause he was gonna-he was, like, he was gonna come back outside so I was scared. I was like, 'What the hell?' I just shot him cause he was gonna come back and argue with me.\" Later in the interrogation: \"like we're at the point where I was-where I grabbed-where my hand started shaking. 'Cause like I got mad. Like I got mad and I knew like, I never did nothing to anyone before. But like they were being really ignorant. Like ... [\u00b6] ... I don't know why people. And I usually talk about ... people being ignorant. But my anger got to me. [\u00b6] ... [\u00b6] Like in desperation and I didn't want them to come back outside and keep doing stuff.\" When asked why she shot the victim, defendant answered: \"Because I was mad. Like I was telling you I was [upset] (unintelligible) he was saying sorry. And the more he said sorry the more he got me mad. 'Cause like it doesn't make sense for you to come\n   hit somebody and say you're sorry and I don't know what you're doing. I knew he was like threatening me, and everything. So I was like, 'What the hell are you talking about.' That's when he was gonna come outside, so I'm guessing he was gonna do something to me. So I just shot him. Like I didn't want anything to happen to me.\"\n   Towards the end of the interrogation, defendant volunteered, \"It was easily self defense. That's what I chose to do.\" This prompted additional questions and then the following exchange:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   \"Q. So you decided to take it into your own hands?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   \"A. I blacked out, like honestly my temper is ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   \"Q.

Who told you getting pissed off, grabbing a gun, and shooting someone is self defense? Who told you that?\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In an amended information, defendant was charged with attempted murder (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 187, 664 ),\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   shooting at an occupied vehicle (\u00a7 246), aggravated mayhem (\u00a7 205), and mayhem (\u00a7 203). On each charge the amended information alleged that defendant had personally and intentionally discharged a firearm causing great bodily injury (\u00a7 12022.53, subd. (d)). As to the attempted murder and shooting at an occupied vehicle charges, the amended information alleged that defendant had personally inflicted great bodily injury (\u00a7 12022.7, subd. (b)). The jury found defendant not guilty of attempted murder but guilty of the lesser offense of attempted voluntary\n   manslaughter, of shooting at an occupied vehicle and of mayhem.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court sentenced defendant to prison for a term of 27 years to life: the mitigated term of two years on the mayhem conviction plus 25 years to life for the firearm enhancement. Sentence on the other charges was imposed and stayed under section 654.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant has timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    The recording of defendant's interrogation was properly admitted.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Defendant first challenges the admissibility of her recorded statements on which the prosecution relied in disputing her claim of self defense. The interrogation in which these statements were made took place in the police station some six to seven hours after the shooting. Defendant had been taken to the station from the scene and apparently had been dozing in the interrogation room before the detectives arrived. At the outset one of the detectives advised defendant of each of her rights specified in the standard\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warning, asking her whether she understood that right and as to each right defendant responded that she did. Without explicitly asking defendant whether she waived those rights the detectives proceeded with the questioning and defendant unhesitantly\n   answered. Defendant's in limine motion to exclude her statements made during the interrogation on multiple grounds, including that the implicit waiver of her\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights was not made voluntarily and knowingly, was denied\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and a recording of the interrogation was subsequently played to the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On appeal, defendant renews her contention that the recording should not have been admitted because she did not voluntarily and knowingly waive her\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights. The recording was not admissible unless defendant's waiver was voluntary and knowing. (\n   <em>\n    People v. Duff\n   </em>\n   (2014)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4001068\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/58/527/#p551\">\n    58 Cal.4th 527\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 551,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=167%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20615\">\n    167 Cal.Rptr.3d 615\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=317%20P.3d%201148\">\n    317 P.3d 1148\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) \"In reviewing the trial court's denial of a suppression motion on\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   and involuntariness grounds, ' \" 'we accept the trial court's resolution of disputed facts and inferences, and its evaluations of credibility, if supported by substantial evidence. We independently determine from the undisputed facts and the facts properly found by the trial court\n   whether the challenged statement was illegally obtained.' \" ' [Citations.] Where, as was the case here, an interview is recorded, the facts surrounding the admission or confession are undisputed and we may apply independent review.\" (\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In arguing that defendant's waiver was not voluntary and knowing, defendant points to the facts that she \"was barely 19 years old at the time of the interrogation,\" she had \"no prior experience with law enforcement or the criminal justice system,\" she \"was emotionally distraught throughout the entire interview and may have been suffering from shock,\" and it is \"at best uncertain whether [she] slept or had anything to eat or drink in the five and a half hours between the time that she was arrested (at approximately 1:30 a.m.) and the time that the interrogation began (at approximately 7:00 a.m.).\" However, despite the characteristics of youth that courts have recognized in the numerous cased cited by defendant, defendant had graduated from high school and was an adult and employed at the time of the shooting. Waivers from much younger persons have been upheld. (E.g.,\n   <em>\n    People v. Nelson\n   </em>\n   (2012)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6050802\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/53/367/#p375\">\n    53 Cal.4th 367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 375,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=135%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20312\">\n    135 Cal.Rptr.3d 312\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=266%20P.3d%201008\">\n    266 P.3d 1008\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    People v.

At the section 402 hearing, one of the interrogating detectives testified that at the time defendant appeared to be coherent, not \"in pain or anything like it,\" was not defiant, did not appear hungry and when asked responded she would like some water that was provided her, and appeared to understand all the questions that were put to her. After watching the video recording of the interrogation, the trial court concluded defendant's statement \"was knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily made\" and that not \"anything that I have in front of me even approaches [the] level\" of a constitutional violation. This court has also watched the video recording and in the exercise of our independent judgment reaches the same conclusion. Defendant gave no indication that she did not understand the\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights that were read to her, and that she said she understood. Although soft-spoken, she appears to have been fully awake and alert. At no point did defendant indicate any reluctance to answer the detectives' questions. The record contains no evidence\n   that she did not waive her rights knowingly and voluntarily. There was no error in admitting the recording of her interrogation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    The court did not err in failing to excise the detective's statements from the recording.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Defendant contends that even if the recording of the interrogation was properly admitted, the court erred in failing to excise the detective's statements near the conclusion of the interview that the shooting was \"not self defense. Who told you getting pissed off, grabbing a gun, and shooting\n   someone is self defense? Who told you that?\" The issue was raised by the court at the end of the section 402 hearing, leading to an extended discussion with counsel concerning how the defense might properly respond. During the exchange defendant's attorney indicated that she preferred the remarks to be stricken. However, the court suggested instructing the jury that the statement was not to be considered as evidence and counsel stipulated to the following instruction: \"Statements made by police officers while conducting out-of-court interviews are not evidence. These statements can be viewed as interview techniques and do not express the personal views or opinions of those police officers.\" The stipulation was read to the jury before the recording of the interview was played, and was repeated in the final jury instructions, at which point the court added: \"So if it's a situation with the officers, something the officers have testified to, do keep in mind what sounds like an opinion expressed during that interview is not to be considered by you, because of the stipulation, as an opinion. So I wanted to clarify that point for all of you.\" Whether or not the objection was forfeited by entry of the stipulation, as the Attorney General contends, any possible prejudice from inclusion of the detective's remarks was cured by the court's instruction. (\n   <em>\n    People v. Ervine\n   </em>\n   (2009)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3899216\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/47/745/#p776\">\n    47 Cal.4th 745\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 776,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=102%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20786\">\n    102 Cal.Rptr.3d 786\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=220%20P.3d%20820\">\n    220 P.3d 820\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [\"we presume the jury faithfully followed the court's limiting instruction\"].) When the detective who made the statement during the interrogation testified at trial, he expressed no such opinion. And although the prosecutor referred to the statement in closing argument, he did so to suggest that the statement had prompted defendant to change her story, and made no argument that the detective had expressed an opinion that should be considered. There is no reason to believe that the jury did not follow the court's instruction in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Defendant's sentence constitutes cruel and unusual punishment.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Defendant contends that her sentence of 27 years to life constitutes cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the state and federal constitutions. \"Whether a punishment is cruel or unusual is a question of law for the appellate court, but the underlying disputed facts must be viewed in the light most favorable to the judgment.\" (\n   <em>\n    People v.

Mayhem, particularly when committed with a fire arm, necessarily involves a high risk of harm, and the injury to the victim in this case could not be more extreme. Moreover, the Attorney General emphasizes that defendant committed the offense while angry, and when the victim and his friend had returned to their vehicle and had apologized. Nonetheless, as the jury's verdict reflects, this was not an offense that defendant had calculated. She was provoked, having observed the attack on her father and heard what she understood as a threat by intruding gang members to return. She was handed the gun by her boyfriend only moments before using it to shoot the victim. Defendant undoubtedly over-reacted to the situation, for which she must be punished, but the offense resulted from a moment of impaired judgment in response to the victim's provocation. There was absolutely no planning involved. The jury found defendant not guilty of attempted murder and that she shot the victim in the heat of passion. The court imposed mitigated base terms on two of the counts and the midterm on the voluntary manslaughter count. Despite the severity of the victim's injuries, as the Supreme Court recognized in\n   <em>\n    Lynch,\n   </em>\n   \" 'there are rational gradations of culpability that can be made on the basis of injury to the victim.' \" (\n   <em>\n    In re Lynch, supra\n   </em>\n   , 8 Cal.3d at p. 426,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=105%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20217\">\n    105 Cal.Rptr. 217\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=503%20P.2d%20921\">\n    503 P.2d 921\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)

Defendant had just turned 19 at the time of the offense. She had no prior criminal record, was living with her family and was employed and helping to support the family. According to the probation report, \"the defendant has been a help to her parents, has graduated high school, has no prior criminal history and had been working.\" Should she be released at any time, the report states, \"her goal is to return to college and study cosmetology.\" According\n   to one of her former teachers she \"is a girl with a very high potential in life.\" According to another, she \" 'was a very hard worker, very family oriented and talked about her parents and family a lot.' The defendant never got into any fights or had discipline problems at school.\" Defendant's good character and general obedience to the law was attested to by numerous reference letters and statements to the court at the sentencing hearing. The record contains no contrary evidence. Defendant's interview with the probation officer was brief \"due to the lack of criminal behavior by the defendant.\" As the jury found in acquitting her of attempted murder, her state of mind when she committed the offense was not pursuit of an illicit objective, but agitation caused by her victim's provocation. Defendant certainly is not the type of \"criminal[ ] misusing guns to terrorize, injure and kill their victims\" for whom the mandatory firearm enhancement was intended. (Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 4 (1997-1998 Reg. Sess.) as amended April 28, 1997.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   There are at least two aspects of the sentence itself that are significant in evaluating whether the punishment is cruel or unusual. As was true of the sentence considered in\n   <em>\n    Dillon,\n   </em>\n   despite the \"broad factual spectrum\" of circumstances in which section 12022.53, subdivision (d) may apply, \"the Legislature has provided only one punishment scheme\" for the use of a firearm causing death or great bodily injury in the commission of any of the offenses specified in the statute. (\n   <em>\n    People v.

And in some of these cases, \"this Procrustean penalty may violate the prohibition of the California Constitution against cruel or unusual punishments.\" (\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   ) As noted above, the crime here was hardly typical of the gun violence to which the enhancement statute was primarily directed. Secondly, there is some merit to defendant's contention that she \"has been punished more severely for a\n   lesser-related crime (mayhem) than she could have been punished for the greater crime of attempted voluntary manslaughter.\" The 25-year-to-life enhancement required by section 12022.53, subdivision (d) does not apply to manslaughter or attempted manslaughter. (\u00a7 12022.53, subd. (a).) The enhancement was imposed only because the prosecution chose to charge defendant not only with attempted murder, leading to her conviction of the lesser offense of attempted manslaughter, but also with mayhem, normally an inevitable consequence of such a shooting. The situation here may be distinguishable from the facts in\n   <em>\n    People v. Schueren\n   </em>\n   (1973)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2299798\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-3d/10/553/\">\n    10 Cal.3d 553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=111%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20129\">\n    111 Cal.Rptr. 129\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=516%20P.2d%20833\">\n    516 P.2d 833\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   on which defendant relies, but it is nonetheless true that voluntary manslaughter is punishable by a sentence of three, six or eleven years (\u00a7 193, subd. (a)), while mayhem is punishable by a sentence of only two, four, or eight years (\u00a7 204), yet the mandatory enhancement applies only to the offense with the lower base term. In that sense, application of the mandatory enhancement\n   to defendant's sentence may fairly be characterized as \"unusual\" in the constitutional meaning of the term.

(a)), rape of a minor (\u00a7 264, subd. (c)), and many other arguably more serious offenses involving intentional acts causing extreme harm. \"[I]f among [the criminal penalties prescribed in the jurisdiction] are found more serious crimes punished less severely than the offense in question, the challenged penalty is to that extent suspect.\" (\n   <em>\n    In re Lynch, supra,\n   </em>\n   8 Cal.3d at p. 426,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=105%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20217\">\n    105 Cal.Rptr. 217\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=503%20P.2d%20921\">\n    503 P.2d 921\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   While comparison of the penalty imposed by California for the use of a gun causing harm to the penalty imposed by other states for like conduct is perhaps of limited significance (see\n   <em>\n    People v.

At a minimum, \"if the challenged penalty is found to exceed the punishments for the offense in a significant number of [other] jurisdictions, the disparity is a further measure of its excessiveness.\" (\n   <em>\n    In re Lynch, supra,\n   </em>\n   8 Cal.3d at p. 427,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=105%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20217\">\n    105 Cal.Rptr. 217\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=503%20P.2d%20921\">\n    503 P.2d 921\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Detailed comparison of the facts in this case with those in which the courts have rejected claims of cruel and unusual punishment is of limited value.

For example, in\n   <em>\n    People v.
