The issue to be briefed and argued is limited to the following: Is Penal Code section 473, subdivision (b), as amended by Proposition 47, ambiguous as to the manner in which the \"identity theft exception\" applies? If so, do the voter materials make clear that the identity theft conviction must be transactionally related to the forgery count(s) in order to exclude forgery from misdemeanor treatment under section 473, subdivision (b) ?\n    </p>\n   </opinion>\n  </casebody>\n </body>\n</html>\n"
