Lempke <em>v. </em>Peterson, 1 <em>City Ct. R., </em>15. The defence is that the defendant had no knowledge of the conditional agreement under which Woolf held the property, and that the plaintiff having neglected to file such agreement \u2018with the conditions and reservations therein,\u2019 those providing that title to the fixtures should remain in the plaintiff until they were paid for became inoperative and void. <em>Laws, </em>1884, chap. 315. There would be force in this objection but for the fact that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>act cited does not apply to \u2018household goods\u2019 <em>(Laws, </em>1885, chap. 488; <em>Laws </em>1886, chap. 495), and \u2018 gas fixtures \u2019 are \u2018 household goods \u2019 within the proper meaning of that term. They were sometimes comprehended by the term \u2018 furniture,\u2019 which means \u00a3 that which furnishes or whatever is added to the interior of a house for use or convenience,\u2019 Bell <em>v. </em>Colding, 27 <em>Ind., </em>179; Crossman <em>v. </em>Baldwin, 49 <em>Conn., </em>491; <em>Burrill's Law Diet., </em>p. 33, and includes brass work, knobs, window shutters, etc. <em>(Worc. Dic.). </em>In Shaw <em>v. </em>Lenke, 1 Daly, 487, \u00a3 gas fixtures \u2019 are included in the term \u00a3 articles of furniture movable in their nature, although attached by screws, nails, brackets, etc. See also, Lawrence <em>v. </em>Kemp, 1 <em>Duer, </em>363 ; McKeage <em>v. </em>Hanover Fire Ins. Co., 16 <em>Hun, </em>239, affd., 81 <em>N. Y., </em>38. In Camagy <em>v. </em>Woodcock, 2 <em>Mundf. Va. R., </em>234, the phrase \u2018 household goods \u2019 is defined as more comprehensive than \u2018furniture,\u2019 including everything in and about the house that has usually been held and enjoyed therewith, and would tend to the comfort and accommodation of the householder. See also, 9 <em>Am. &amp; Eng. Enc. of Law, </em>782, <em>note </em>3; Paton <em>v. </em>Sheppard, 10 <em>Sim., </em>186 ; Manning <em>v. </em>Purcell, 2 <em>Sim. </em>&amp; <em>G., </em>284. The expression \u2018household goods,\u2019 includes every article of personal property in the house or on the premises, intended for ornament, use or consumption (Dayton <em>v. </em>Tillow, 1 <em>Robt., </em>21), even coal and wood provided for the use of the family. <em>In re </em>Fraser, 92 <em>N. Y., </em>239. Those articles do not lose their generic character by being placed in a saloon or store, unless the intention to exclude them - from the operation of the term \u2018 household goods \u2019 is made apparent, and that is not so here. It is the species of property rather than the temporary use made of it that determines its true character under the statute. So considered it follows that \u2018 gas fixtures \u2019 are by force of the Acts of 1885 and 1886, <em>supra, </em>taken out of the operation of the Acts, 1884, <em>supra, </em>requiring conditional sale agreements to be filed. The Acts of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>1885 and 1886 were passed in the interest of those who sell <em>\u2018 </em>household goods \u2019 on the installment plan, and must be liberally construed to effectuate their purpose. The objection that a duplicate copy of the agreement was not delivered to Woolf was not made at the trial, when it might have been obviated, and cannot be raised for the first time now (cases cited in 33 State R., 425.)</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b218-6\"><em>Hess, Townsend &amp; McClelland, </em>for appellant, argued:\u2014</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">That gas fixtures as they were placed and in use were not household goods. The evidence shows that they were chandeliers purchased for and used in a liquor saloon. The affidavit df the purchaser, Albert E. Woolf, upon the mortgage in evidence, shows that he resided at No. 1081 Lexington avenue. Aside from the authorities hereinafter cited it seems self-evident that goods, in order to be household goods, must be used in, or in some way connected with a household. <em>Bouvier </em>defines \u201c household\u201d as follows : \u201c Those who dwell under the same roof and constitute a family.\u201d <em>Webster </em>defines the same word as \u201c belonging to the house and family; domestic.\u201d In 21 <em>Albany Law Journal, </em>page 83, see note of case Calhoun <em>v. </em>Williams, it is said: \u201cThe term :household\u2019 literally means the inmates of the house, the family ; those whom the house holds.\u201d Merchandise, in order to be household furniture, must in some way be used by, or relate to a family. The authorities are clearly to the effect that certain articles may be household goods, or not, depending upon the use to which they are applied. For example, plate used in a family passes under a devise or conveyance of \u201c household goodsbut plate not used in a family will not so pass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>See <em>Bouvier\u2019s Law Dictionary, </em>title \u201c Household furniture,\u201d and cases cited. A shotgun will so pass if it is kept for the defence of the house. <em>Matter of </em>Frazer 92 <em>N. Y., </em>246. If otherwise it will not pass. <em>American and English Encyclopedia of Law, </em>volume 9, title <em>\u201c </em>Household,\u201d note 3. In Dayton <em>v. </em>Tillou 1 Rob. 21, Robertson, J., after stating that \u201c household goods\u201d * # * fairly embraces articles commonly used in a family, says (see on page 28): \u201c A testator may, however, render other things household goods or household furniture by his use of them. Books belonging\u2019 to a well-filled library, wines in a well-stored cellar, paintings and statues in a large gallery, curiosities of an extensive museum, numerous specimens belonging to a well-selected mineralogical or other collection may not be or may be household goods or furniture, according to their connection with the owner\u2019s residence and his own and his family\u2019s habitual use of or access to them.\u201d In <em>American and English Encyclopedia of Law, </em>vol. 9, title 1, <em>\u201c </em>Household,\u201d the following propositions are stated as settled by the authorities cited: <em>\u201c </em>Household furniture, etc., includes only what is in domestic use and not articles which are in the way of testator\u2019s trade or business.\u201d <em>\u201c </em>Where a man owned a hospital, in a town other than that of his residence, which he employed, under contracts with the naval commissioners, in entertaining the sick and wounded of the navy, the furniture of this hospital was not included in the expression <em>\u2018 </em>household goods \u2019 as used in an exception in a marriage settlement with his wife, by which she renounced her claim upon his property.\u201d \u201c Beds and furniture used by the testatrix in a boarding-school kept by her, and in which she lived, passed under her will as household furniture, but the schoolroom furniture, as the desks, etc., would not have passed.\u201d <em>\u201c </em>Liquors, bar furniture and beds for guests in an inn are not household goods, within the meaning of the rule that it is not a badge of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>fraud to permit household goods levied upon in execution to remain in the debtor\u2019s possession.\u201d It seems clear, therefore, from the authorities cited that articles which may be <em>\u201c </em>household goods \u201d when used in the family for its comfort and convenience, are not household goods when used for other purposes. The case of Dayton <em>v. </em>Tillou, above cited, is very nearly in point. In that case Thomas Reilly at one time was the keeper of a public house where he resided with his family. The house was furnished, and, in addition to the furniture, there was a collection of curiosities kept there as an attraction for guests. Subsequently he leased the public house with the furniture and removed with his family to another residence which was furnished. Some of the furniture, pictures and curiosities were removed by him to his residence and others were left at the public house temporarily, to be removed when he desired. Upon the death of Mr. Reilly he bequeathed to his wife \u201c all the household goods and household furniture of every kind and description.\u201d It was held that under the bequest his wife took the furniture in the house which he occupied and such pictures and curiosities as were left temporarily at the public house, to be removed at his pleasure ; but she did not take the furniture, pictures or curiosities which were designed to be left for use at the public house. The court held that she was entitled: 1st. To the articles which had been removed from the public house to his own home and used in his family. 2d. To the articles which he had left at the public house temporarily, intending to remove them to his home, and which were not used as ornaments of the public <em>barroom; </em>and says (see on page 29): \u201c The silver plate mentioned in the inventory annexed to the answer which had not been used in the testator\u2019s private residence, curiosities not found there, large vessels suitable only for a hotel, as well as billiard tables, with, their appurtenances, used at the hotel, do not pass under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>the bequest.\u201d The case last cited will be found to fully support the defendant\u2019s contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>\u201c If the construction aforesaid be correct the verdict in favor of the plaintiff was properly directed, and the motion for a new trial must be denied.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b221-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number><em>Abram Kling, </em>for respondent, argued :\u2014</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">The language of the statute which provides \u201cThat the contracts for the sale of household goods shall not be required to be filed, has reference to gas fixtures sold by the plaintiff to Woolf. In 9 <em>American and English Encyclopedia of Law </em>(note 3), 782, the word household goods is defined to be \u201c all articles of household of a permanent nature, articles which are not consumed in their use and enjoyment, and which are used in, or acquired by the testator for his house.\u201d In Camagy <em>n. </em>Woodcock, 2 <em>Munf. </em>(Va.), 234, the word household goods is defined as a wider term than furniture, including everything in and about the house that has usually been held and enjoyed therewith, and would tend to the comfort and accommodation of the householder. In Dayton <em>v. </em>Tillou, 1 <em>Robt., </em>21, the word household goods has been defined by the general term of this court as embracing pictures, statues and a collection of curiosities were embraced in the words household goods. In ifclie <em>Matter of </em>Fraser, 92 N. <em>Y., </em>the Court of Appeals held: \u201c That coal and wood for use of the family and a shot-gun came under the term of household property.\u201d In Paton <em>v. </em>Shepperd, 10 <em>Sim., </em>186, tenant\u2019s fixtures in a leasehold house, occupied by the testator, were held to pass as household furniture. In Manning <em>v. </em>Purcell, 2 <em>Sim. &amp; G., </em>284: A tavern-keeper whose dwelling-house is remote from his tavern, but whose family frequented the latter as much as the former, by the use of the term \u201c household furniture \u201d in his will, passes the furniture of the tavern. In Richardson <em>v. </em>Hall, 124 <em>Mass. Courts, </em>the Supreme Court held \u201cthat bronze statuary and pictures were included in the terms household property.\u201d If the plaintiff furnished Woolf with lamps instead of \u201c gas fixtures \u201d there can be no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>question that they would have been regarded as household goods, and under the statute gas fixtures must be considered as necessary for the benefit of a householder as lamps. The law of 1886 was enacted for the benefit of the person who sold household goods, which would have been such goods or chattels which \u00ednay be used for household purposes, and must be liberally construed, and as these fixtures are to illuminate the house, it must under decisions cited <em>supra </em>be so regarded. The fact that a party buying household goods uses them for purposes other than the household, does not deprive the owner of the property of his right and protection which the statute affords him.</p>\n<author id=\"pAtr\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"AHf\">The judgment and order should be affirmed, with costs, upon the opinion filed by the trial judge on denying defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
