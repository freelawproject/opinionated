No notice of trial was served after issue joined on the amended answer. The defendants objected to proceeding before the referee at the opening of the trial, on the ground that the issues to be tried were not made until a date subsequent to the order of reference. The referee proceeded with the trial and rendered a report in the plaintiff\u2019s favor. <em>Held, </em>that defendants were debarred from raising this question by their own laches in not seeking relief by motion to vacate the order of reference and proceedings held before the referee, prior to the presentation of their defence.</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b489-7\">Before Freedman, P.

The judgment thus to be entered was for the sum found by the referee, with interest thereon from April 2 to April 9, and the costs and disbursements, in all $40.53, less than the amount of the judgment entered by the clerk. The entry of the judgment should be corrected accordingly. A careful examination of the case discloses no error requiring a reversal. The judgment, entered as ordered, to be corrected, is affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">Freedman, P. J., and Gildersleeve, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
