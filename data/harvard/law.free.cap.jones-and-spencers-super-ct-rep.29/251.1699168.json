NEWHALL, Respondent <em>v. </em>WILLIAM H. APPLETON, et al., Appellants.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b289-5\">\n<em>Contracts\u2014Canvasser\u2019s commissions on orders obtained for publications \u2014Acceptance shown by reception and, entry on the firm, books.</em>\n</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b289-6\">In an action to recover commissions claimed to be earned by plaintiff as a canvasser of the defendants\u2019 publications, the principal contention was the construction to be placed upon the words of the contract, which was oral. The plaintiff testified to the effect that in a conversation with the head of defendants\u2019 serial department it was agreed that he was to receive $4 \u201can order for each order that he took\u201d for the publications other than the cyclopedia, and \u00a715 \u201c an order \u201d for the cyclopedia. Blank subscription papers were supplied by the defendants to the plaintiff, who procured the signatures to the papers of a number of persons in Texas and Louisiana and forwarded the same by mail to the defendants. The plaintiff produced evidence tending to show that the subscription papers so signed were \u201c orders \u201d within the meaning of the contract, upon acceptance of which he was entitled to the agreed commissions. The defendants contended that the expression \u201cfour dollars an order\u201d had a well settled meaning in the business and was so understood by the parties to the contract, viz.: that the commission was to be regarded as earned only after the subscriber had taken and paid for two parts or numbers of the work subscribed for. The referee refused to find to this effect but did find that upon acceptance by the defendants of the orders, the commissions became due, and that defendants did so accept the orders. <em>Held, </em>that no error was committed by the referee in so ruling. If the referee erred in finding that the agreement in question was that the plaintiff should be paid when his orders were delivered to defendants and accepted by them, he only erred in finding that an acceptance by defendants was a part of the agreement, and such an error could not prejudice defendants. There was evidence that an order became a good order upon acceptance by defendants, and such acceptance was shown, as in the present case, by the reception of the orders and entry thereof in the firm books.</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b289-7\">Before Sedgwick, Ch.
