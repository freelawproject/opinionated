Upon the case as presented on this appeal the court would not be justified in interfering with the decision of the referee on the ground that his findings were against the weight of evidence. Nor is there any merit in the claim that some of the facts found by the referee are not supported by the evidence. The facts being so found from the evidence, they support the conclusion of law based thereon, in conformity with which the judgment was entered.</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b271-10\">Before Freedman, P.

The conflict between the witnesses of the respective parties was quite marked, and the result depended upon the credibility of the witnesses.
