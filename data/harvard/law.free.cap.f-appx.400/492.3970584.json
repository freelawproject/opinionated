BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b519-18\">In 2005, Peeler applied for SSI benefits due to back problems and a hip replacement. Peeler alleged that he was disabled as of March 15,1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-19\">After a hearing, the ALJ evaluated Peeler\u2019s claim using the five-step sequential process. With regard to the first three steps, the ALJ found that Peeler: (1) had not engaged in substantial gainful employment in the past fifteen years; (2) had severe impairments of \u201cstatus post left hip replacement,\u201d \u201cstatus post broken right ankle with internal fixation\u201d and \u201cstatus post left wrist internal fixation,\u201d but that these impairments did not meet or medically equal one of the listed impairments in the regulations; and (3) had the residual functional capacity (\u201cRFC\u201d) to perform \u201ca wide range of sedentary work activities.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> With regard to Peeler\u2019s residual functional capacity, the ALJ found that Peeler (1) could stand and walk for less than two hours of an eight-hour day; (2) could sit for six to eight hours with the ability to alternate positions; (3) could occasionally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>use his left hand for performing gross manipulation with no limitation on his capacity for f\u00edne dexterity or reaching; (4) could not climb, balance or crouch; (5) could occasionally twist, stoop and kneel; (6) could not be exposed to unprotected heights or hazardous machinery. At the fourth step, the ALJ found that Peeler had no past relevant work.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">As to the fifth step, the ALJ noted Peeler\u2019s age of 41, which qualified him as a \u201cyounger individual\u201d under the regulations, limited education, and RFC. The ALJ acknowledged that Peeler\u2019s ability to perform the full range of sedentary work had been \u201cimpeded by additional limitations.\u201d The ALJ nonetheless found that jobs existed in significant numbers in the national economy that Peeler could perform.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">To this end, the ALJ relied upon the hearing testimony of Dr. Howard Feld-man, a vocational expert (\u201cVE\u201d). In response to a hypothetical question from the ALJ, Dr. Feldman testified that a person of Peeler\u2019s age, educational background and physical limitations (listed above) could perform some sedentary jobs. Dr. Feldman identified cashier II, Dictionary of Occupational Titles (\u201cDOT\u201d) \u00a7 211.462-010, of which there were 18,124 positions in the local economy and over 3 million in the national economy. Dr. Feldman explained that the cashier II job was listed as light work in the DOT, but in his opinion, \u201cwell over 50 percent would be sedentary in nature.\u201d Dr. Feldman explained that he relied on his own knowledge to determine the fifty percent figure and that the DOT did not describe individual jobs, but represented a \u201cconglomeration of jobs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">Additionally, Dr. Feldman identified as sedentary, unskilled jobs someone like Peeler could perform: (1) ticket or toll taker, DOT \u00a7 211.462-038, of which there were 701 such jobs in the local economy and 100,000 in the national economy; and (2) bench assembler, DOT \u00a7 706.684-022,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of which there were 7,245 in the local economy and over a million in the national economy.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">The ALJ\u2019s order stated that \u201c[pjursuant to SSR 00 \u2014 4p, the vocational expert\u2019s testimony is consistent with the information contained in the Dictionary of Occupational Titles.\u201d Based on Dr. Feldman\u2019s testimony, the ALJ found that Peeler was not disabled at step five of the sequential evaluation process. The Appeals Council denied review.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-9\">Peeler filed this action in the district court. The case was referred to a magistrate judge, who granted the Commissioner\u2019s motion for summary judgment and affirmed the ALJ\u2019s decision. Peeler filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-10\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"Aqr\">A. Sequential Evaluation</p>\n<p id=\"b520-11\">Under the five-step sequential evaluation used to determine whether the claimant is disabled, the ALJ considers: (1) whether the claimant is engaged in substantial gainful activity; (2) if not, whether the claimant has a severe impairment; (3) if so, whether the severe impairment meets or equals an impairment in the Listing of Impairments in 20 C.F.R. pt. 404, subpt. P, app. 1; (4) if not, whether the claimant has the RFC to perform his past relevant work; and (5) if not, whether, in light of the claimant\u2019s RFC, age, education <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>and work experience, the claimant can \u201cmake an adjustment to other work\u201d that exists in significant numbers in the national economy. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.920(a)(4), (c)-(g): <em>see also Phillips v. Barnhart, </em>357 F.3d 1232, 1237 (11th Cir.2004). If the claimant proves that he cannot do his past relevant work at the fourth step, the burden shifts to the Commissioner to show, at the fifth step, that the claimant can make an adjustment to other work available in the economy. <em>Jones v. Apfel, </em>190 F.3d 1224, 1228 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">B. Fifth Step \u2014 Existence of Work</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">On appeal, Peeler does not challenge the ALJ\u2019s findings as to the first four steps. Instead, Peeler argues that the ALJ committed legal error at the fifth step. Specifically, Peeler contends the ALJ could not rely on Dr. Feldman\u2019s testimony as to the number of sedentary, unskilled jobs in the national economy Peeler could perform because Dr. Feldman\u2019s testimony conflicted with the DOT.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">At the fifth step, the Commissioner shows that work exists in the national economy when \u201cit exists in significant numbers either in the region where [the claimant] live[s] or in several other regions of the country.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.966(a). In determining whether unskilled, sedentary, light or medium work exists in the national economy that the claimant can perform, the ALJ can \u201ctake administrative notice of reliable job information available from various governmental and other publications,\u201d such as the DOT, which is published by the Department of Labor. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 416.966(d)(1).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b521-11\">The ALJ can also use a VE. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 416.966(e) (stating that the VE can be used to determine \u201cwhether [the claimant\u2019s] work skills can be used in other work and the specific occupations in which they can be used,\u201d as well as for other \u201csimilarly complex issue[s]\u201d); <em>see also Foote v. Chater, </em>67 F.3d 1553, 1559 (11th Cir.1995) (explaining that when the claimant has non-exertional impairments, the Commissioner demonstrates that the claimant can perform other jobs through VE\u2019s testimony); <em>Allen v. Sullivan, </em>880 F.2d 1200, 1202 (11th Cir.1989) (explaining that the ALJ relies on VE testimony to show the existence of work in the economy when the claimant cannot perform a full range of work at a given level of exertion).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-12\">While the DOT \u201cprovides occupational information on jobs in the national economy,\u201d it \u201cis not comprehensive\u201d nor \u201cthe sole source of admissible information concerning jobs.\u201d <em>Jones, </em>190 F.3d at 1230 (quotation marks omitted). Consequently, \u201cthe ALJ should supplement DOT data with local information detailing jobs in the regional community.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Furthermore, \u201cwhen the VE\u2019s testimony conflicts with the DOT, the VE\u2019s testimony \u2018trumps\u2019 the DOT.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1229-30. If the hypothetical question posed by the ALJ contains all the claimant\u2019s impairments, the VE\u2019s testimony of other jobs the claimant can perform <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>constitutes substantial evidence to support the Commissioner\u2019s decision. <em>Id. </em>at 1229.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">C. Peeler\u2019s Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">Here, Dr. Feldman described the jobs of toll collector, bench assembler and over fifty percent of cashier II jobs as sedentary. The DOT classifies these three jobs as light work. <em>See </em>Dep\u2019t of Labor, <em>Dictionary of Occupational Titles </em>(\u201cDOT\u201d), \u00a7\u00a7 211.462-010 (cashier II), 211.462-038 (toll collector), 706.684-022 (bench assembler) (rev. 4th ed.1991). The ALJ did not err in relying on Dr. Feldman\u2019s testimony even if it conflicted with information in the DOT because under our precedent Dr. Feldman\u2019s testimony trumps the DOT. <em>See Jones, </em>190 F.3d at 1229-30.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">Peeler points to Social Security Ruling 00 \u2014 4p (\u201cSSR 00 \u2014 4p\u201d), which provides that \u201c[njeither the DOT nor the [VE\u2019s testimony] automatically \u2018trumps\u2019 \u201d when there is a conflict between the two and instructs the ALJ to \u201celicit a reasonable explanation for the conflict before relying on the VE [testimony]....\u201d SSR 00-04p, 2000 WL 1898704 (Dec. 4, 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">However, as to cashier II jobs, ALJ complied with SSR 00-4p and obtained a reasonable explanation for any conflict with the DOT.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> When Dr. Feldman identified cashier II jobs as sedentary jobs Peeler could perform, the ALJ confirmed that Dr. Feldman\u2019s testimony adhered to the descriptions in the DOT. Dr. Feldman then acknowledged that the jobs were \u201clisted as light in the DOT\u201d and explained that it was his opinion that over fifty percent of the cashier II jobs could be performed at the sedentary level. Dr. Feldman further explained that any discrepancy between his description and the DOT was based on his knowledge and necessary because the DOT does not describe specific jobs, but conglomerations of jobs. Notably, SSR 00-4p supports Dr. Feldman\u2019s explanation, stating that the DOT provides descriptions about occupations, not each of the numerous jobs represented in an occupation and that a VE \u201cmay be able to provide more specific information about jobs or occupations than the DOT.\u201d SSR 00-4p.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b522-10\">The ALJ posed a hypothetical question to Dr. Feldman that included all of Peeler\u2019s impairments. In response, Dr. Feld-man identified work that existed in the national economy that someone like Peeler could perform. The ALJ did not commit legal error in relying upon Dr. Feldman\u2019s testimony even if it conflicted with the DOT. Thus, Dr. Feldman\u2019s testimony constituted substantial evidence that Peeler was not disabled. <em>See Jones, </em>190 F.3d at 1229.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b519-11\">.
