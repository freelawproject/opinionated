On appeal, Prince argues that his sentence is unreasonable because the district court erred in disregarding the Chapter Seven Guideline range and in not considering the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-15\">We review the district court\u2019s ultimate sentence imposed upon revocation of supervised release for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Sweeting, </em>437 F.3d 1105, 1106-07 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-16\">In reviewing sentences for reasonableness, we perform two steps. <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1190 (11th Cir.2008). First, we must \u201c \u2018ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence \u2014 including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>The district court need not discuss each \u00a7 3553(a) factor. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005). Rather, \u201c[t]he sentencing judge should set forth enough to satisfy the appellate court that he has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising his own legal decisionmaking authority.\u201d <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 356, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">If we conclude that the district court did not procedurally err, we must consider the \u201c \u2018substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard,\u2019 \u201d based on the \u201c \u2018totality of the circumstances.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1190 (quoting <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586). This review is \u201cdeferential,\u201d requiring us to determine \u201cwhether the sentence imposed by the district court fails to achieve the purposes of sentencing as stated in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788. \u201cThe weight to be accorded any given \u00a7 3553(a) factor is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court, and we will not substitute our judgment in weighing the relevant factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d 823, 832 (11th Cir.2007) (internal quotation and brackets omitted). We will remand for resentencing only if we are \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1191 (citation and internal quotation omitted). The burden is on the defendant to show that the sentence was unreasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-9\">Prince has not established that his sentence is procedurally or substantively unreasonable. As the record shows, the district court correctly calculated Prince\u2019s Chapter 7 sentencing range as 8 to 14 months\u2019 imprisonment, which Prince does not dispute on appeal, based on his original sentencing criminal history category of VI and a Grade C supervised release violation. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 7Bl.l(a)(3), 7B1.4(a) (table). Prince\u2019s 24-month sentence did not exceed the 24-month statutory maximum for his underlying Class C felony. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1), 3583(e)(3). Although Prince\u2019s sentence exceeded the advisory sentencing range set out in the Chapter 7 policy statements, the district court was not required to sentence Prince within that range. <em>See United States v. Silva, </em>443 F.3d 795, 799 (11th Cir.2006) (explaining that the recommended ranges are advisory and that the court, while required to consider the ranges, is not bound by them). Here, the district court expressly considered the advisory guideline range when it noted that a guideline sentence was not an appropriate sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-10\">Further, the court explicitly said that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Specifically, the court considered Prince\u2019s \u201cvery disturbing criminal history,\u201d which reflected Prince\u2019s history and characteristics as well as the need to protect the public from further crimes from him. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(C). In addition, the district court hoped that this 24-month sentence would get Prince\u2019s \u201cattention,\u201d which would deter Prince from committing criminal acts in the future. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-11\">Finally, nothing in the record suggests that the district court impermissibly considered the alleged violent robbery and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>burglary contained in the original revocation petition. For starters, the allegation was deleted from the revocation petition. Moreover, the district court did not discuss this allegation before revoking Prince\u2019s supervised release or imposing sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">Because Prince has not established that the district court abused its discretion in imposing his 24-month above-guideline sentence, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b574-10\">. Under 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3583(e), a district court may consider the following \u00a7 3553(a) factors in revoking a term of supervised release: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need for the sentence imposed to afford adequate deterrence; (3) the need to protect the public; (4) the need to provide the defendant with educational or vocational training or medical care; (5) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (6) the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>Commission; (7) the need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to victims. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), (a)(2)(D), and (a)(4)-(a)(7).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
