Wilson also moves to amend his appellate brief. To the extent that the motion to amend constitutes Wilson\u2019s amended brief, the motion is granted; to the extent that the motion seeks permission to file an additional brief or memorandum of law, the motion is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"912\">*912</page-number>Wilson argues that he is entitled to a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) based on Amendments 706 and 711 to the United States Sentencing Guidelines. However, because he was held accountable for more than 4.5 kilograms of cocaine base, Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines, as amended by Amendment 711, both of which modified the sentencing ranges applicable to crack cocaine offenses, did not change his sentencing range. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(l); <em>see also id. </em>cmt. n. 10(D)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b938-4\">Wilson also argues that he is entitled to a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) based on the district court\u2019s incorrect drug quantity determination and the fact that the jury did not make a finding concerning the drug quantity attributed to him at sentencing. However, a motion under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) \u201cis not a second opportunity to present mitigating factors to the sentencing judge, nor is it a challenge to the appropriateness of the original sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d 1007, 1011 (5th Cir.1995). Furthermore, this court has recognized that <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), did not alter the mandatory character of \u00a7 lBl.lO\u2019s limitations on sentence reductions. <em>United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 238 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 517, 175 L.Ed.2d 366 (2009). Therefore, these claims are not cognizable in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>See Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d at 1011; <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 674 (5th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 3462, 177 L.Ed.2d 1064 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b938-9\">In light of the foregoing, Wilson has not shown that the district court abused its discretion in denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>See id. </em>at 672.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-12\">AFFIRMED; MOTION TO AMEND BRIEF GRANTED TO EXTENT THAT MOTION CONSTITUTES AMENDED BRIEF AND DENIED TO EXTENT THAT MOTION SEEKS PERMISSION TO FILE NEW BRIEF OR MEMORANDUM OF LAW.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b937-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
