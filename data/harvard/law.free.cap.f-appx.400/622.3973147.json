On March 17, 2003, Edwards was sentenced to a total term of imprisonment of 192 months. On appeal, Edwards argued that the sentencing court improperly applied a two-level adjustment for a leadership role in the criminal activity, and a two-level adjustment for obstruction of justice. The judgment of conviction and sentence was affirmed by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. <em>See United States v. Giddings, </em>107 Fed.Appx. 420, 424-25 (5th Cir.2004) (court\u2019s two-level enhancement for Edwards\u2019 leadership role not erroneous where evidence showed that he \u201cmanaged\u201d many of the drivers who transported marijuana).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-23\">Edwards petitioned the United States Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari, which was granted. On February 28, 2005, the Supreme Court vacated and re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>manded the case for further consideration in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) (Sentencing Guidelines are advisory only). <em>See Edwards v. United States, </em>543 U.S. 1181, 125 S.Ct. 1409, 161 L.Ed.2d 177 (2005). On remand, the Fifth Circuit reinstated its judgment affirming the conviction and sentence. Reviewing for plain error because Edwards did not raise an objection to the constitutionality of his sentence before the sentencing court, the Fifth Circuit held that Edwards failed to show that the sentencing court would have reached a different result under an advisory rather than a mandatory scheme. \u201cIndeed, while the Guidelines permitted a sentence as low as 188 months, the court sentenced Edwards to 192 months confinement.\u201d <em>United States v. Edwards, </em>132 Fed.Appx. 535, 536 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">On June 26, 2006, Edwards filed a motion to vacate sentence under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. The sentencing court denied the motion and declined to issue a certificate of appealability. Although the Fifth Circuit granted Edwards a certificate of ap-pealability on the issue whether the trial court improperly commented on the evidence during jury instructions, and whether Edwards\u2019 trial counsel was ineffective in failing to object to those comments, ultimately the court affirmed the order denying Edwards\u2019 section 2255 motion. <em>See United States v. Edwards, </em>280 Fed.Appx. 409, 421 (5th Cir.2008) (trial court\u2019s instructions to jury did not amount to improper comment on disputed facts). Edwards filed a petition for writ of certiorari in the United States Supreme Court, which was denied on April 28, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">On November 16, 2009, Edwards filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, in United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania, the district where he presently is confined. Edwards claimed that the enhancement he received for his leadership role violates his constitutional rights because he was never indicted for a leadership role in the criminal activity, and the jury did not find beyond a reasonable doubt that he had a leadership role in it. Edwards sought to have his sentence reduced by 5 years and 11 months. In an order entered on March 3, 2010, the District Court dismissed the habeas corpus petition for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-8\">Edwards appeals. Our Clerk granted him leave to appeal <em>informa pauperis </em>and advised him that the appeal was subject to summary dismissal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) or summary affirmance under Third Cir. LAR 27.4 and I.O.P. 10.6. He was invited to submit argument in writing, but he has not done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-9\">We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Under Third Circuit LAR 27.4 and I.O.P. 10.6, we may summarily dispose of an appeal when it clearly appears that no substantial question is presented by the appeal. Our review is plenary. <em>United States v. Thompson, </em>70 F.3d 279, 280-81 (3d Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-10\">We will summarily affirm the order of the District Court because no substantial question is presented by this appeal. As explained by the District Court, a motion to vacate sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 is the exclusive means to challenge collaterally a federal conviction or sentence. <em>See Davis v. United States, </em>417 U.S. 333, 343-44, 94 S.Ct. 2298, 41 L.Ed.2d 109 (1974). Under the explicit terms of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, unless a section 2255 motion would be \u201cinadequate or ineffective,\u201d even a habeas corpus petition cannot be entertained by a court. <em>See Application of Galante, </em>437 F.2d 1164, 1165 (3d Cir.1971). Section 2255 is not inadequate or ineffective simply because Edwards is prevented by the gatekeeping requirements of the statute, see 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(h), from liti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>gating his <em>Apprendi </em>claim, <em>see Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000) (holding that \u201c[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d), in a second or successive section 2255 motion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cIt is the efficacy of the remedy, not the personal inability to use it, that is determinative.\u201d <em>Cradle v. United States ex rel. Miner, </em>290 F.3d 536, 538-39 (3d Cir.2002) (per curiam) (citing <em>Garris v. Lindsay, </em>794 F.2d 722, 727 (D.C.Cir.1986)). Moreover, the safety valve provided under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 is narrow, <em>see In re: Dorsainvil, </em>119 F.3d 245, 251 (3d Cir.1997). In <em>Dorsainvil, </em>we held that a petitioner could seek relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, but the circumstances here are different. <em>Apprendi </em>did not declare certain conduct not criminal that previously was regarded as criminal, and thus <em>Dorsainvil </em>does not apply. <em>Okereke v. United States, </em>307 F.3d 117, 120 (3d Cir.2002) <em>(Apprendi </em>dealt with sentencing and did not render conspiracy to import heroin, the crime for which [petitioner] was convicted, not criminal). As such, the District Court was without jurisdiction to entertain Edwards\u2019 federal habe-as corpus petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we will summarily affirm the order of the District Court dismissing Edwards\u2019 habeas corpus petition for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b650-8\">.
