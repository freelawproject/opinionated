He argues that the district court plainly erred by relying on only the presentence report to conclude that one of his prior convictions was a crime of violence warranting a 16-level sentence enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). Because Espinoza-Lazo did not object in the district court to the application of the 16-level <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"927\">*927</page-number>enhancement, we review this issue for plain error. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 361 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 192, 175 L.Ed.2d 120 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b953-7\">A district court may not rely on the PSR\u2019s characterization of a prior offense. <em>United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 274 (5th Cir.2005). However, we previously granted the Government\u2019s motion to supplement the appellate record with certified state court records of Espinoza-Lazo\u2019s prior offense. The indictment and judgment show that Espinoza-Lazo was convicted of burglary of a habitation with intent to commit theft, a violation of Texas Penal Code \u00a7 30.02(a)(1). We have previously held that such a conviction qualifies as a crime of violence for purposes of a \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii) enhancement. <em>United States v. Garcia-Mendez, </em>420 F.3d 454, 456-57 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b953-8\">Because the record as supplemented supports the district court\u2019s determination that Espinoza-Lazo had a prior conviction that warranted application of the 16-level enhancement, he has not shown that the district court\u2019s error in relying on the PSR affected his substantial rights. <em>See United States v. Martinez-Cortez, </em>988 F.2d 1408, 1415-16 &amp; n. 37 (5th Cir.1993). Accordingly, Espinoza-Lazo has not established plain error. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-,-, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1429, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b953-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b952-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
