He argues that the district court (1) abused its discretion in finding that he violated conditions of his supervised release, and (2) erred in sentencing him to 23 months\u2019 imprisonment upon revocation of the release. Because the gov-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>ernraent proved by a preponderance of the evidence that McCall violated conditions of his supervised release, and because the statutory maximum term of imprisonment for McCall\u2019s violations is correctly calculated as 24 months \u2014 not one year as he asserts \u2014 we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">\n<em>I. Revocation of Supervised, Release</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">McCall argues that the district court abused its discretion when it decided to disregard the prior statements of his girlfriend, Adrianna Johnson, who testified at McCall\u2019s January 5, 2010, preliminary hearing that he was not the person who shot her.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">We review a district court\u2019s revocation of a term of supervised release for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Velasquez Velasquez, </em>524 F.3d 1248, 1252 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam) (citation omitted). Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3), a district court may revoke a term of supervised release if it finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant violated a condition of the release. <em>United States v. Sweeting, </em>437 F.3d 1105, 1107 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam). We generally decline to review a district court\u2019s determinations as to a witness\u2019s credibility. <em>See United States v. Copeland, </em>20 F.3d 412, 413 (11th Cir.1994) (per curiam) (\u201cThe credibility of a witness is in the province of the factfinder and this court will not ordinarily review the factfin-der\u2019s determination of credibility.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">The district court did not abuse its discretion when it decided to disregard Johnson\u2019s prior testimony and police statement. Her testimony at the preliminary hearing was inconsistent with her police statement identifying McCall as the shooter; she even recanted that testimony later in the same preliminary hearing. Another witness\u2019s testimony at the revocation hearing established that Johnson was \u201ca compulsive liar.\u201d Moreover, because Johnson did not testify at the revocation hearing, the district court had no opportunity to assess her credibility. Given these factors, the district court did not abuse its discretion when it disregarded Johnson\u2019s prior statements altogether.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-9\">The district court properly credited the testimony and sworn statements of Ophelia Smith, who identified McCall as the shooter after witnessing the shooting in Johnson\u2019s apartment. Smith\u2019s testimony was consistent with the sworn statement she gave the police soon after the shooting and the photographic evidence of bullet holes in Johnson\u2019s apartment. In light of the district court\u2019s finding that Smith\u2019s testimony was credible, the government proved by a preponderance of the evidence that McCall violated the conditions of his supervised release when he possessed a firearm and shot his girlfriend. Thus, the district court did not abuse its discretion in revoking McCall\u2019s supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-10\">\n<em>II. Imposition of 23-Month Sentence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b524-11\">McCall further argues that the district court erred in sentencing him to 23 months\u2019 imprisonment. Under his interpretation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e), his maximum sentence is properly calculated as 12 months\u2019 imprisonment. He argues that the offenses relevant to calculating the length of his sentence are the two non-felonies that resulted in his second term of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-12\">Ordinarily, we review <em>de novo </em>a sentence imposed pursuant to the revocation of a term of supervised release, <em>United States v. Mazarky, </em>499 F.3d 1246, 1248 (11th Cir.2007), but where an appellant argues for the first time on appeal that his sentence exceeds the statutory maximum, as McCall does here, we will review only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>for plain error.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. Nash, </em>438 F.3d 1302, 1304 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam) (\u201cWe review the terms of a supervised release for abuse of discretion, but where the defendant fails to object at the district court, we reverse only for plain error.\u201d). \u201cTo establish plain error, a defendant must show there is (1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights.\u201d <em>United States v. Moriarty, </em>429 F.3d 1012, 1019 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">Here, the district court made no error, plain or otherwise, because it correctly calculated the statutory maximum term of imprisonment as 24 months. Upon revoking a term of supervised release, a court may:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-6\">require the defendant to serve in prison all or part of the term of supervised release authorized by statute <em>for the offense that resulted in such term of supervised release </em>... except that a defendant whose term is revoked under this paragraph may not be required to serve on any such revocation ... more than 2 years in prison if such offense is a Class C or D felony....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3) (emphasis added). Contrary to McCall\u2019s interpretation, the imposition of penalties for violations of conditions of a supervised release is based on the offense conduct <em>that resulted in the original conviction, </em>not the offense conduct that triggered a new term of supervised release. <em>See Johnson v. United States, </em>529 U.S. 694, 701, 120 S.Ct. 1795, 146 L.Ed.2d 727 (2000) (\u2018We ... attribute postrevocation penalties to the original conviction.\u201d). The conduct that resulted in McCall\u2019s original conviction was a Class C felony \u2014 the possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). Thus, under \u00a7 3583(e)(3), the maximum term of imprisonment following revocation of McCall\u2019s supervised release is two years. Accordingly, we find that the district court did not err in imposing a 23-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-10\">\n<em>III. Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b525-11\">The district court (1) did not abuse its discretion in finding that McCall violated conditions of his term of supervised release, and (2) properly sentenced him to 23 months\u2019 imprisonment upon revocation of the release.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b525-8\">. McCall has abandoned any argument as to the reasonableness of his sentence because he failed to offer argument on this issue in his initial brief. <em>See United States v. Jernigan, </em>341 F.3d 1273, 1283 n. 8 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
