This court is now presented with Hickman\u2019s appeal from the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for reduction of sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). He argues that the denial was improper because the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>trict court erroneously believed that it was prevented from giving Hickman the benefit of the amended guidelines based on the fact that he was sentenced as a career offender. Hickman also challenges the validity of the career offender guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-5\">Hickman \u201cwas not sentenced based on a sentencing range that was subsequently lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>United States v. Anderson, </em>591 F.3d 789, 791 &amp; n. 8 (5th Cir.2009) (internal quotations and citation omitted). The district court was correct in concluding that Hickman was not eligible for a reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See id. </em>at 790-92. The instant \u00a7 3582 motion is not a proper vehicle for Hickman\u2019s argument regarding the career offender guidelines. <em>See United States v. Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d 1007, 1011 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b925-6\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. The Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED, and its alternate request for an extension of time in which to file a brief is DENIED. Hickman\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel is also DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b924-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
