The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed his conviction and sentence. Although Kilgore never filed a motion to vacate under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, he did file two challenges to his conviction and sentence under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, alleging that his conviction was null and void.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-25\">After the district court in Maryland dismissed his motions, Kilgore filed another \u00a7 2241 habeas petition in the district court in South Carolina, where he was incarcerated. When Kilgore was transferred to a correctional institution in Florida, his petition was reassigned to the district court in the Middle District of Florida, where it was denied with prejudice. Kilgore now appeals the denial of his \u00a7 2241 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-26\">The availability of habeas relief under \u00a7 2241 presents a question of law that we review <em>de novo. Cook v. Wiley, </em>208 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>1314, 1317 (11th Cir.2000). Typically, collateral attacks on the validity of a federal conviction or sentence must be brought under \u00a7 2255. <em>Sawyer v. Holder, </em>326 F.3d 1363, 1365 (11th Cir.2003). A provision of \u00a7 2255 known as the savings clause, however, permits a federal prisoner, under limited circumstances, to file a habeas petition pursuant to \u00a7 2241. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2241(a), 2255(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">A \u00a7 2241 petition may only be entertained under \u00a7 2255\u2019s savings clause if the petitioner establishes that the remedy provided for under \u00a7 2255 is \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e). The savings clause applies to a claim when: (1) that claim is based upon a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision; (2) the holding of that Supreme Court decision establishes that the petitioner was convicted for a nonexistent offense; and (3) circuit law squarely foreclosed such a claim at the time it otherwise should have been raised in the petitioner\u2019s trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>Wofford v. Scott, </em>177 F.3d 1236, 1244 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">After a review of the record, we conclude that the district court properly dismissed Kilgore\u2019s petition because he failed to show that his claim was based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision. His inability to make this showing denies him access to \u00a7 2255\u2019s savings clause and relief under \u00a7 2241. We, therefore, affirm the district court\u2019s order dismissing Kilgore\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"A-P\">. Because we affirm on this ground, we do not address the district court\u2019s conclusion that Kilgore\u2019s petition was successive or an abuse of the writ.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
