Lewis filed a pro se motion for a reduction of his sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) in which he sought a modification of his sentence due to a retroactive amendment to the Sentencing Guidelines for crack cocaine offenses. Lewis appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion. The Government has filed a motion for dismissal or summary affirmance or, alternatively, for an extension of time within which to file a brief. The district court\u2019s denial of Lewis\u2019s motion is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Anderson, </em>591 F.3d 789, 790-91 &amp; n. 6 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b926-7\">Lewis\u2019s guideline range was not derived from the quantity of crack cocaine involved in the offense, but rather from his career offender status. \u201cThe crack cocaine guideline amendments do not apply to prisoners sentenced as career offenders.\u201d <em>Anderson, </em>591 F.3d at 791. Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that a reduction was not permitted under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See id. </em>Lewis\u2019s argument that the district court had the discretion to reduce his sentence in light of <em>Booker, </em>also is unavailing. <em>See United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 238 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 517, 175 L.Ed.2d 366 (2009); <em>see also Anderson, </em>591 F.3d at 791.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-10\">Lewis also argues that he had a right to counsel in the district court. In <em>United States v. Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d 1007, 1010-11 (5th Cir.1995), this court held that a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) movant had no right to the appointment of counsel in the district court. This court recently reaffirmed Whitebird\u2019s reasoning. <em>See United States v. Hereford, </em>385 Fed.Appx. 366 (5th Cir.2010). Further, because Lewis was not eligible for relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) due to his career offender status, the proceedings in the district court did not involve the potential for resentencing. Thus, appointment of counsel was not warranted under the interests of justice. <em>Cf. United States v. Robinson, </em>542 F.3d 1045, 1052 (5th Cir.2008) (appointing counsel in the interests of justice due to complexity of \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion).</p>\n<p id=\"b926-13\">Lewis has not shown error in either the denial of his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion or the denial of his request for counsel in the district court. Accordingly, the Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. The Government\u2019s alternative motion is DENIED as unnecessary.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b926-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
