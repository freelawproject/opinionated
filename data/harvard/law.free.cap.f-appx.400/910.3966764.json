He was convicted of possession with intent to distribute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number>crack cocaine within 1000 feet of a school and carrying a firearm during the commission of a drug trafficking crime. By moving to proceed IFP, Starks is challenging the district court\u2019s certification decision that his appeal was not taken in good faith because it is frivolous. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b937-5\">Starks did not file a notice of appeal within the ten-day appeal period in Rule 4(b)(1) of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure. This court remanded the case to the district court for a determination of whether the untimely filing of the notice of appeal was due to excusable neglect or good cause. The district court determined that Starks had not shown that the untimely notice of appeal was due to excusable neglect or good cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-6\">This court can dismiss an appeal if the appeal \u201cis frivolous and entirely without merit.\u201d 5th Cir. R. 42.2. Because Starks did not file a timely notice of appeal, the district court did not err in enforcing the time limitations set forth in Rule 4(b), and this court may not reverse its decision to do so. <em>See United States v. Leijano-Cruz, </em>473 F.3d 571, 574 (5th Cir.2006). Because the instant appeal is without arguable merit, Starks\u2019s motion for leave to proceed IFP on appeal is DENIED, and the appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b936-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
