He also contends <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>that the new evidence he provided proves that he had a well-founded fear of persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">Lopez, a native and citizen of Colombia, legally entered the United States in 2001 as a nonimmigrant visitor. After being charged with remaining in the United States for longer than permitted, Lopez sought asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under United Nations Convention Against Torture. In his asylum application Lopez states he was a member of the Liberal Party and that he had been persecuted by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). In support of his application he submitted various letters from his family and community members stating that he had been targeted by the FARC.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">In 2005 the IJ denied Lopez\u2019s application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the CAT.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The IJ found that Lopez\u2019s testimony, asylum application, and other evidence failed to establish past persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution based on a statutorily-protected ground. Specifically, the IJ concluded that Lopez\u2019s testimony was not credible because of inadequately explained discrepancies between his testimony, his asylum application, and the documents he provided. The BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision denying Lopez\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">In 2007 Lopez filed a motion to reopen his case based on new evidence consisting of a copy of a death certificate for his brother-in-law\u2019s \u201cviolent\u201d murder and a copy of an unverified letter from the FARC claiming responsibility for that murder and threatening Lopez and his family. The BIA reopened Lopez\u2019s case and remanded it to the IJ for him to consider the new evidence. After considering it, the IJ again denied Lopez\u2019s application because the new evidence did not rebut the IJ\u2019s previous adverse credibility determination, and Lopez did not otherwise establish that he was entitled to relief. The BIA affirmed. Lopez filed this petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-11\">\u201cWhere the BIA issues a decision, we review that decision, except to the extent that it expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion.\u201d <em>Chen v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1228, 1230 (11th Cir.2006). \u201cInsofar as the BIA adopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as well.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, the BIA followed the IJ\u2019s reasoning. Accordingly, we review the decisions of the BIA and the IJ. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b492-12\">We review the factual findings under a \u201chighly deferential\u201d substantial evidence test whereby we \u201cmust affirm the BIA\u2019s decision if it is \u2018supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u2019 \u201d <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1283-84 (11th Cir.2001) (quoting <em>Lorisme v. INS, </em>129 F.3d 1441, 1444-45 (11th Cir.1997)). Put another way, we will reverse the BIA and IJ only upon finding that the record compels reversal. <em>See Fahim v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>278 F.3d 1216, 1218 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-13\">To establish eligibility for asylum, an applicant \u201cmust, with specific and <em>credible </em>evidence, establish (1) past persecution on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion; or (2) a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of a statutorily-protected ground.\u201d <em>Chen, </em>463 F.3d at 1231 (11th Cir.2006) (emphasis added). If the IJ determines that the applicant is not credible, the IJ \u201cmust offer specific, cogent reasons for the finding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If the IJ makes an adverse credibility determination, \u201c[t]he burden then shifts to the [applicant] to show that the IJ\u2019s credibility decision was not supported by \u2018specific, cogent reasons\u2019 or was not based on substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Forgue v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282 (11th Cir.2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">In this case, the BIA and IJ provided specific, cogent reasons for the adverse credibility determination. These included (1) conflicting stories from Lopez and his mother about whether a person tried to escape on foot or by motorcycle after an alleged FARC attack against Lopez, thus casting doubt on Lopez\u2019s veracity, and (2) a letter submitted by Lopez from his neighbor in Colombia stating that Lopez was being targeted because he would not financially support the FARC, contradicting Lopez\u2019s claim that the FARC never sought money from him. Because the BIA and IJ made an explicit adverse credibility determination, the burden shifts to Lopez to show that the finding was not supported by specific, cogent reasons or was not based on substantial evidence. Lopez has failed to meet this burden. The new evidence he submitted does not relate to the discrepancies relied upon by the BIA and IJ in making the adverse credibility determination. Even if his brother-in-law was targeted and killed by the FARC \u2014 something that is not proven by the death certificate \u2014 that would not explain why Lopez and his mother have differing accounts of the alleged FARC attack against Lopez or why his neighbor claimed that the FARC sought financial assistance from Lopez. And even if the letter claiming responsibility for the brother-in-law\u2019s death and threatening Lopez had been verified, it would not reconcile the inconsistencies. The record as a whole reveals that the BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s determination was based on substantial evidence. Thus, the record viewed in the light most favorable to the agency and with all reasonable inferences in its favor does not compel us to grant the petition. <em>See Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1027 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">Additionally the record, including the new evidence, does not compel us to conclude that Lopez qualifies for asylum because of a well-found fear of persecution based on a statutorily-protected ground. Lopez must demonstrate that the fear \u201cis both subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable.\u201d <em>Ruiz v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1257 (11th Cir.2006). \u201cThe subjective component can be proved \u2018by the applicant\u2019s credible testimony that he or she genuinely fears persecution,\u2019 while the objective component \u2018can be fulfilled either by establishing past persecution or that he or she has a good reason to fear future persecution.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1289). Even assuming that Lopez\u2019s fears are credible and genuine, the record does not compel us to reverse the reasonable finding of the BIA and IJ that the fear of persecution stemmed more from general violence directed at the populace instead of from a statutorily-protected ground. The new evidence that the FARC is allegedly targeting Lopez, and evidence of his brother-in-law\u2019s violent death, is consistent with Lopez\u2019s neighbor\u2019s letter stating the FARC is persecuting Lopez failing to cooperate financially, which is not a statutorily-pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>tected ground. <em>Id. </em>at 1258 (\u201c[E]vidence that either is consistent with acts of private violence or the petitioner\u2019s failure to cooperate with guerillas ... does not constitute evidence of persecution based on a statutorily protected ground.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">Because Lopez did not meet the standard of proof for asylum relief he cannot meet the higher standard for eligibility for withholding of removal. <em>See Sepulveda v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1232-33 (11th Cir.2005) (explaining that standard for withholding of removal is more stringent than the standard for asylum relief).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b491-14\">. Lopez\u2019s asylum application also sought derivative relief for his wife, Luz Marina Lopez Murcia, and daughter, Wendy Nathaly Lopez Lopez, both of whom are listed as petitioners in this appeal. Also listed as a petitioner is Lopez's adult son, Yango Ricardo Lopez, who filed a separate application for asylum, but later elected to consolidate his case with his father's.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b492-8\">. The IJ dismissed the CAT claim because it does not extend to entities, such as FARC, that the government is unable to control. In his appeal to the BIA Lopez did not challenge the IJ's denial of his eligibility for CAT relief. As a result, he did not exhaust his administrative remedies relating to that claim and we lack jurisdiction to consider it. <em>See Amaya-Artunduaga v. United States Att'y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250-51 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
