Ladd moves for permission to appeal in forma pauperis (IFP) and he requests appointment of appellate counsel. The district court has certified that the appeal is not in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, 117 F.3d </em>197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b868-18\">Ladd argues that he has a constitutional right to counsel in seeking \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief; the district court should have held a hearing; and the court abused its discretion by denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-22\">Ladd had no right to appointment of counsel or to be present at a hearing in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding. <em>See United States v. Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d 1007, 1010-11 (5th Cir.1995); Fed. R.Crim. P. 43(b)(4). The denial of Ladd\u2019s \u00a7 3582 motion was not an abuse of discretion, as the district court based its decision on the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors. <em>United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 237-38 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 517, 175 L.Ed.2d 366 (2009). Ladd has failed to show that he will raise a nonfrivolous issue on appeal. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, his motions for IFP and appointment of counsel are DENIED. Because the appeal is frivolous, it is DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b868-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
