On appeal, Nicoll argues that: (1) the district court committed reversible error when it failed to conduct a hearing <em>sua sponte </em>on the issue of his competency to enter a guilty plea; and (2) the district court plainly erred in convicting him under \u00a7 922(g) because the statute violates the Commerce Clause, in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>United States v. Lopez, </em>514 U.S. 549, 115 S.Ct. 1624, 131 L.Ed.2d 626 (1995), and the Second Amendment, in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>District of Columbia v. Heller, </em>554 U.S. 570, 128 S.Ct. 2783, 171 L.Ed.2d 637 (2008) and <em>McDonald v. Chicago, </em>561 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 3020, 177 L.Ed.2d 894 (2010). Nicoll further argues that, in sentencing him, the district court erred by: (1) applying a four-level enhancement to his base offense level, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6), for having a firearm in connection with another felony offense; (2) permitting an individual whose wife was killed in a car crash caused by Nicoll to make a statement during his sentencing hearing; and (3) imposing an above-guideline sentence that was procedurally and substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-16\">I. FAILURE TO CONDUCT A COMPETENCY HEARING <em>SUA SPONTE</em></p>\n<p id=\"b495-17\">Nicoll first argues that the district court erred in failing to conduct a competency hearing <em>sua sponte. </em>We review a district court\u2019s failure to order a competency hearing <em>sua sponte </em>for an abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>468 F.2d 819, 820 (5th Cir.1972).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b495-18\">A district court shall order a hearing <em>sua sponte </em>\u201cif there is reasonable cause to believe that a defendant may presently be suffering from a mental disease or defect rendering him mentally incompetent to the extent that he is unable to understand the nature and consequences of the proceedings against him or to assist properly in his defense.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4241(a). We have held that a trial court must conduct a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>competency hearing <em>sua sponte </em>when it has a bona fide doubt regarding the defendant\u2019s competence. <em>Tiller v. Esposito, </em>911 F.2d 575, 576 (11th Cir.1990). \u201cThe legal test for competency is whether the defendant had sufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding and whether he had a rational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings against him.\u201d <em>United States v. Nickels, </em>324 F.3d 1250, 1252 (11th Cir.2003) (quotations omitted). We consider</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AjA\">three factors in determining whether the trial court violated the defendant\u2019s procedural due process rights by failing to hold <em>sua sponte </em>a competency hearing: (1) evidence of the defendant\u2019s irrational behavior; (2) the defendant\u2019s demeanor at trial [or during the plea hearing]; and (3) prior medical opinion regarding the defendant\u2019s competence to stand trial [or enter a plea].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b496-4\"><em>Tiller, </em>911 F.2d at 576. We \u201cfocus[ ] on what the trial court did in light of what it knew at the time of the trial or plea hearing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cBecause legal competency is primarily a function of defendant\u2019s role in assisting counsel in conducting the defense, the defendant\u2019s attorney is in the best position to determine whether the defendant\u2019s competency is suspect.\u201d <em>Watts v. Singletary, </em>87 F.3d 1282, 1288 (11th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">Applying these standards to the facts of the present case, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in failing to hold a hearing sua <em>sponte </em>to determine whether Nicoll was competent to plead guilty. There is no evidence in the record that Nicoll behaved irrationally at the plea hearing. He unequivocally answered every question the district court asked and he never expressed any confusion with the proceeding. Moreover, Ni-coll informed the district court that he had received a general equivalency diploma, had taken additional classes since receiving his diploma, and read, wrote and understood the English language. Although Nicoll informed the district court that he had been diagnosed and received treatment for bipolar disorder and depression, he also informed the court that he last received treatment three years prior and was no longer taking medication. After learning of Nicoll\u2019s past diagnoses, the court received assurances from Nicoll that he was of a clear mind, was thinking appropriately, was not under the influence of any substances, and understood the plea proceeding and its significance. Further, Nicoll\u2019s attorney, who was in the best position to determine whether a question existed concerning Nicoll\u2019s competency, declined to make any further inquiries at the end of Nicoll\u2019s plea colloquy. <em>See Watts, 87 </em>F.3d at 1288</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">Nicoll argues that the district court should have <em>sua sponte </em>ordered a competency hearing based on a mental health report that he filed after his guilty plea was accepted in relation to sentencing. However, it is well-established that, in determining whether a district court should have ordered a competency hearing, we focus on what the district court knew at the time of the plea hearing. <em>See Tiller, </em>911 F.2d at 576. Because the mental health report was not available at the time of the plea hearing, it is not relevant to our determination.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We conclude that there was not reasonable cause to believe that Nicoll was unable to understand the na<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>ture and consequences of the proceeding or to assist in his defense. Accordingly, we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in failing to order <em>sua sponte </em>a competency hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">II. CONSTITUTIONALITY OF 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1)</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">Nicoll\u2019s next argument is that the statute under which he was convicted \u2014 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) \u2014 is unconstitutional under both the Commerce Clause and the Second Amendment. Where, as here, a defendant challenges the constitutionality of a statute under which he was convicted for the first time on appeal, we will review the claim for plain error only. <em>United States v. Peters, </em>403 F.3d 1263, 1270 (11th Cir.2005). Under plain error review, we \u201cmay not correct an error the defendant failed to raise in the district court unless there is: (1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1271 (quotations omitted). Even then, we will rectify the error only if it \u201cseriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). Here, because Nicoll did not object to the constitutionality of \u00a7 922(g)(1) before the district court, we review his claims challenging the statute as unconstitutional on its face for plain error. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">\u201cThe law of this circuit is \u2018emphatic\u2019 that only the Supreme Court or this court sitting <em>en banc </em>can judicially overrule a prior panel decision.\u201d <em>Cargill v. Turpin, </em>120 F.3d 1366, 1386 (11th Cir.1997) (citing <em>United States v. Woodard, </em>938 F.2d 1255, 1258 (11th Cir.1991)). We have repeatedly upheld the constitutionality of \u00a7 922(g) against Commerce Clause challenges. <em>E.g., United States v. McAllister, </em>77 F.3d 387, 390 (11th Cir.1996); <em>United States v. Wright, </em>392 F.3d 1269, 1280 (11th Cir.2004) (listing eases in which we have upheld the constitutional validity of \u00a7 922(g)). In <em>McAllister, </em>we rejected a constitutional challenge identical to Nicoll\u2019s argument\u2014 that based on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Lopez, </em>514 U.S. 549, 115 S.Ct. 1624, 131 L.Ed.2d 626 (1995), \u00a7 922(g) exceeds Congress\u2019s Commerce Clause power because it does not require a substantial effect on interstate commerce. 77 F.3d at 389-90. Based on these precedents, we reject Nicoll\u2019s Commerce Clause argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-9\">Nicoll also argues that \u00a7 922(g) is unconstitutional under the Second Amendment. In <em>District of Columbia v. Heller, </em>554 U.S. 570, 128 S.Ct. 2783, 171 L.Ed.2d 637 (2008), the Supreme Court held that the District of Columbia\u2019s ban on handgun possession in the home by law-abiding citizens violated the Second Amendment. 554 U.S. at 634-35, 128 S.Ct. at 2821. The Court in <em>Heller, </em>however, qualified that the right to bear arms, \u201c[l]ike most rights, ... is not unlimited.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 626, 128 S.Ct. at 2816. The Court further stated that \u201cnothing in [Heller] should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons ...\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 626, 128 S.Ct. at 2816-17. After <em>Heller, </em>we held that \u00a7 922(g)(1) is a \u201cconstitutional avenue to restrict the Second Amendment right of\u2019 convicted felons. <em>United States v. Rozier, </em>598 F.3d 768, 771 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 3399, 177 L.Ed.2d 313 (2010). Noting that the <em>Heller </em>Court specifically disclaimed any erosion of the \u201clongstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons,\u201d we held that \u201cstatutes disqualifying felons from possessing a firearm under any and all circumstances do not offend the Second Amendment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). Recently, in <em>McDonald v. Chicago, </em>561 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 3020, 177 L.Ed.2d 894 (2010), the Supreme Court held that the holding in <em>Heller </em>\u201cdid not cast doubt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>on such longstanding regulatory measures as prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons [and] ... [w]e repeat those assurances here.\u201d 561 U.S. at-, 130 S.Ct. at 3047, 177 L.Ed.2d at 926 (quotation omitted). Based on these precedents, we reject Nicoll\u2019s argument that \u00a7 922(g) violates the Second Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">III. SENTENCING CLAIMS</p>\n<p id=\"A-B\">A. <em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1 (b)(6)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">Nicoll next argues that the district court erred in applying a four-level enhancement to his base offense level, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6), for having a firearm in connection with another felony offense. We review a district court\u2019s application and interpretation of the Guidelines <em>de novo, </em>and its factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Rhind, </em>289 F.3d 690, 693 (11th Cir.2002). The district court\u2019s determination that the defendant used a firearm in connection with another felony offense is a factual finding reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Whitfield, </em>50 F.3d 947, 949, n. 8 (11th Cir.1995). \u201cThe burden of establishing evidence of the facts necessary to support a sentencing enhancement falls on the government, and it must do so by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Perez-Oliveros, </em>479 F.3d 779, 783 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">In calculating the guideline range for a firearm possession offense under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g), a four-level increase to the base offense level is required \u201c[i]f the defendant used or possessed any firearm or ammunition in connection with another felony offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6). The commentary to this guideline indicates that the four-level increase may be added to a defendant\u2019s offense level even if he is not charged or convicted for the other felony offense. <em>Id., </em>comment. (n.l4(C)). Furthermore, the commentary specifically notes that the enhancement should apply \u201cin the case of a drug trafficking offense in which a firearm is found in close proximity to drugs, drug-manufacturing materials, or drug paraphernalia.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at (n. 14(B)).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-10\">Effective November 1, 2006, the Guidelines were amended to clarify that \u201c[s]ub-section (b)(6) applies] if the firearm or ammunition facilitated, <em>or had, the potential of facilitating, </em>another felony offense.'. <em>.Id. </em>at (n. 14(A)); U.S.S.G., App. C, amend. 691 (emphasis added). Before this amendment to the guidelines commentary, the phrase \u201cin connection with,\u201d as used in \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6), was not defined by the Sentencing Guidelines, and we held that the phrase should be expansively interpreted according to its ordinary meaning. <em>See Rhind, </em>289 F.3d at 695. Thus, according to its ordinary meaning, the phrase \u201cin connection with\u201d does not require proof that the firearm actually facilitated the other felony offense. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b498-11\">We have recognized that, \u201cin certain circumstances, mere possession of a firearm can be enough to apply a sentencing enhancement.\u201d <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>276 F.3d 1231, 1234-35 (11th Cir.2001). \u201cFor instance, where it is reasonable to assume that a defendant possesses a firearm, even without using it, to prevent the theft of counterfeit currency in his possession, an enhancement is properly applied.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1234. We have also held that a defendant possessed a firearm in connection with drug offenses where he possessed both the gun and the narcotics on his person at the same time, because it makes sense to conclude that the firearm \u201cpotentially emboldened [the defendant] to undertake illicit drug sales.\u201d <em>United States v. Gainey, </em>111 F.3d 834, 837 (11th Cir.1997). Additionally, we have held that a firearm that was not on a defendant\u2019s person can still be possessed in connection with a felony offense if the gun could have been easily retrieved. <em>United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number><em>Flennory, </em>145 F.3d 1264, 1270 (11th Cir.1998) (holding that a defendant possessed a firearm in connection with a crime when the firearm was kept in a car across the street from where the defendant was selling drugs), <em>superceded by regulation on other grounds, as stated in United States v. Brown, </em>332 F.3d 1341 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">We conclude that the district court in this case did not clearly err in applying a four-level enhancement to Nicoll\u2019s base offense level, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6). First, the government proved by a preponderance of the evidence that Nicoll either manufactured marijuana or knowingly maintained a residence where marijuana was manufactured. The pre-sentence investigation report stated that forty marijuana plants were found in the residence in which Nicoll lived. Although Nicoll claimed that the marijuana plants were not his but instead belonged to another individual to whom he rented a room, the district court concluded that the evidence presented \u2014 including a letter written by Nicoll to an acquaintance in which he implies that the marijuana plants seized by the police belonged to Nicoll\u2014 proved by a preponderance of the evidence that Nicoll manufactured marijuana. Further, even if the evidence was insufficient to show that Nicoll himself was manufacturing marijuana, a preponderance of the evidence demonstrated that he knowingly maintained a house where marijuana was manufactured, which is in itself a felony. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 856(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">Likewise, the district court did not clearly err in concluding that Nicoll\u2019s possession of a sawed-off shotgun was \u201cin connection with\u201d the marijuana manufacturing. The evidence showed that Nicoll admitted to possessing the sawed-off shotgun in the same residence where the marijuana plants were being grown. Nicoll\u2019s possession of the illegal shotgun in close proximity to the marijuana is sufficient to satisfy the \u201cin connection with\u201d requirement of \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6). Because Nicoll\u2019s firearm possession had the potential to facilitate another felony offense and was in close proximity to drugs, we conclude that the district court did not clearly err in applying the \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6) four-level enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">B. <em>STATEMENT DURING SENTENCING HEARING</em></p>\n<p id=\"b499-9\">Nicoll next argues that the district court erred in permitting an individual whose wife was killed in a car crash caused by Nicoll to make a statement during his sentencing hearing.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We review <em>de novo </em>\u201cwhether a factor considered by the district court in sentencing a defendant is impermissible.\u201d <em>United States v. Velasquez, </em>524 F.3d 1248, 1252 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-10\">Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3, a district court may only consider \u201crelevant conduct\u201d for purposes of determining (1) the base offense level, (2) specific offense characteristics, and (3) adjustments in Chapter Three. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3 (defining relevant con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>duct as including \u201call acts and omissions committed ... or willfully caused by the defendant ... that occurred during the commission of the offense of conviction\u201d). Regarding the factors that may be considered in fashioning a reasonable sentence, however, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3661 provides that \u201c[n]o limitation shall be placed on the information concerning the background, character, and conduct of a person convicted of an offense which a court of the United States may receive and consider for the purpose of imposing an appropriate sentence.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3661; see <em>also United States v. Faust, </em>456 F.3d 1342, 1348 (11th Cir.2006) (noting that \u201c18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3661 ... remains intact post-<em>Booker\u201d). </em>However, we have held that a district court\u2019s sentencing discretion under \u00a7 3661 is not unlimited because a district court is still subject to the limitations provided in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Burgos, </em>276 F.3d 1284, 1288-90 (11th Cir.2001). A sentence, therefore, must accomplish one of the purposes in \u00a7 3553(a), and a sentence imposed in order to accomplish some other purpose would be unlawful. <em>Id. </em>at 1289-92 (holding that the district court erred in taking into account the defendant\u2019s lack of cooperation in a separate case because there was no legitimate \u00a7 3553(a) purpose for the court to consider this conduct).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">Furthermore, although a court may consider evidence regarding the sentencing factors without regard to its admissibility under the rules of evidence, the evidence must be sufficiently reliable. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G, \u00a7 6A1.3(a) (noting that in sentencing a defendant, \u201cthe court may consider relevant information without regard to its admissibility under the rules of evidence ..., provided that the information has sufficient indicia of reliability,\u201d and suggesting in the commentary that evidence should be proven by a preponderance of the evidence); <em>cf. Faust, </em>456 F.3d at 1347 (holding that, in the context of determining whether a sentencing enhancement applies, a court may consider conduct for which the defendant was not convicted only if such conduct is proven by a preponderance of the evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">We conclude from the record that the district court here did not err by allowing Mr. Edwards, the husband of the women killed in the car accident caused by Nicoll, to make a statement at Nicoll\u2019s sentencing hearing because the statement was relevant to the factors and purposes contained in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), and the court did not consider the statement for an improper purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">C. <em>REASONABLENESS OF SENTENCE</em></p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">Finally, Nicoll argues that his sentence of 180 months was procedurally and substantively unreasonable. We review the reasonableness of a sentence under a \u201cdeferential abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). \u201c[T]he party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of both [the] record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">A sentence may be either procedurally or substantively unreasonable. <em>See Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 786. A sentence is procedurally unreasonable if, for example, the district court fails to calculate or improperly calculates the guideline range, treats the Sentencing Guidelines as mandatory, fails to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selects a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or fails to explain adequately the chosen sentence, including an explanation for any deviation from the guideline range. <em>United States v. Livesay, </em>525 F.3d 1081, 1091 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>(11th Cir.2008). A sentence is substantively unreasonable \u201cif it does not achieve the purposes of sentencing stated in \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1191 (11th Cir.2008) (quotation omitted). Pursuant to \u00a7 3553(a), the sentencing court shall impose a sentence \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary,\u201d to comply with the purposes of sentencing listed in \u00a7 3553(a)(2), namely reflecting the seriousness of the offense, promoting respect for the law, providing just punishment for the offense, deterring criminal conduct, protecting the public from future criminal conduct by the defendant, and providing the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). The sentencing court must also consider the following factors in determining a particular sentence: the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant, the kinds of sentences available, the applicable guideline range, the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission, the need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities, and the need to provide restitution to victims. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (3)-(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">When a district court decides that a variance is in order, \u201cit should explain why that variance is appropriate in a particular case with sufficient justifications.\u201d <em>United States v. Shaw, </em>560 F.3d 1230, 1238 (11th Cir.) (quotation omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 2847, 174 L.Ed.2d 566 (2009). \u201cThe justifications must be compelling enough to support the degree of the variance and complete enough to allow meaningful appellate review,\u201d but the district court need not provide an extraordinary justification for a sentence outside the guidelines range. <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted). \u201cThe district court must evaluate all of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors when arriving at a sentence, but is permitted to attach great weight to one factor over others.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1237 (quotation and citation omitted). However, \u201ca sentence based on an improper factor fails to achieve the purposes of \u00a7 3553(a) and may be unreasonable regardless of length.\u201d <em>United States v. Arevalo-Juarez, </em>464 F.3d 1246, 1249 (11th Cir.2006) (quotation and alterations omitted). When considering whether a sentence is substantively reasonable, we have compared the sentence imposed to the statutory maximum. <em>See United States v. Valnor, </em>451 F.3d 744, 751-52 (11th Cir.2006) (affirming an upward variance and observing that the sentence imposed was appreciably below the statutory maximum).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-9\">Nicoll has failed to demonstrate that his sentence was either proeedurally or substantively unreasonable. As to the procedural reasonableness, we conclude that the district court correctly calculated Nicoll\u2019s guideline range, adequately explained its reasons for imposing an upward variance, explicitly acknowledged that the Guidelines were not mandatory, and considered all of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. As to the substantive reasonableness, the court thoroughly reviewed and discussed the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and did not abuse its discretion in imposing an above-guideline sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-10\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b501-11\">For the aforementioned reasons, we affirm Nicoll\u2019s convictions and total sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b495-11\">. In <em>Bonner v. City of Prichard, </em>661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir.1981) <em>(en banc), </em>this court adopted as binding precedent all Fifth Circuit decisions handed down prior to the close of business on September 30, 1981.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b496-6\">. We note that, even if the mental health report is considered, the report in no way indicated that Nicoll did not have a reasonable degree of rational understanding of the proceedings against him. Instead, the report discussed the role that his mental health and substance abuse issues played in the charged offense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b499-6\">. Nicoll was involved in a fatal accident on June 27, 2009. The accident occurred after Nicoll failed to slow his car after traffic had slowed as a result of another crash. A passenger in one of the cars that Nicoll hit was killed and her husband, Mr. Edwards, and their two children were injured. After the police arrived on the scene, they searched Nicoll\u2019s vehicle and found a safe located in his trunk containing two firearms, ammunition, and a relatively large quantity of prescription medication. At the sentencing hearing in this case, the district court heard the testimony of an ATF agent, who testified that Nicoll\u2019s initial blood test showed that several drugs were in his system shortly after the fatal accident. The district court also entered the medical report into evidence. The ATF agent also testified that the state of Florida had not yet charged Nicoll in relation to that accident pending receipt of an independent blood analysis.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
