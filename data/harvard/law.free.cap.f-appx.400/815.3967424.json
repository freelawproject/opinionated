He contends that the court at sentencing gave inadequate consideration to his history of untreated substance-abuse problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-27\">The sentence was within the properly calculated advisory guidelines range and is presumed to be reasonable. <em>See United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006). Lewis addresses legitimate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>sentencing factors but does not rebut the presumption of reasonableness, especially where the district court considered and rejected his arguments in light of the pre-sentence report and the sentencing factors of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Lewis simply asks this court to substitute his assessment of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors for that of the district court, which is directly contrary to the deferential review dictated by <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b841-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
