Jones received a 180-month sentence, the statutory minimum under the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e), after pleading guilty to possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). On appeal, Jones asserts the district court erred in sentencing him under the ACCA because one of his prior crimes \u2014 resisting an officer with violence in violation of Florida Statute \u00a7 843.01 \u2014 should not qualify as a predicate offense under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>The district court did not err in finding that Florida Statute \u00a7 843.01 constitutes a predicate offense under the ACCA.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A predicate \u201cviolent felony\u201d is any crime punishable by more than one year in prison and that \u201chas as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)\u00ae.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> To determine whether a prior conviction is a qualifying offense under the ACCA, we apply a categorical approach. <em>United States v. Harrison, </em>558 F.3d 1280, 1284 (11th Cir.2009). That is, we look only at \u201cthe fact of conviction and the statutory definition of the prior offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">The Supreme Court has held that the type of \u201cphysical force\u201d required under the ACCA is <em>\u201cviolent </em>force \u2014 that is, force capable of causing physical pain or injury to another person.\u201d <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 1265, 1271, 176 L.Ed.2d 1 (2010) (holding that simple battery \u2014 the actual and intentional touching of another \u2014 does not constitute a predicate offense because the ACCA requires <em>\u201cviolent </em>force,\u201d not merely offensive contact). Though the meaning of \u201cphysical force\u201d is a question of federal law, not state law, we are bound by the Florida Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of the elements of the statute at issue. <em>Id. </em>at 1269.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">Florida Statute \u00a7 843.01 states in pertinent part: \u201cWhoever knowingly and willfully resists, obstructs, or opposes any officer ... in the lawful execution of any legal duty, by offering or doing violence to the person of such officer ... is guilty of a felony of the third degree....\u201d As to the sort of force required to sustain a conviction under \u00a7 843.01, Florida appellate courts have held that \u201cviolence is a necessary element of the offense,\u201d indicating that mere offensive touching, like in simple battery, would not suffice. <em>See Rawlings v. State, </em>976 So.2d 1179, 1181 (Fla. 5th DCA 2008); <em>Harris v. State, </em>5 So.3d 750, 751 (Fla. 1st DCA 2009).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b489-13\">Moreover, the Florida Supreme Court has specifically recognized the distinction drawn by the U.S. Supreme Court in <em>Johnson </em>\u2014 namely, that the offensive touching involved in simple battery does not rise to the level of \u201cviolent force.\u201d In <em>State v. Hearns, </em>the Florida Supreme Court explained that battery on a law-enforcement officer requires merely nonviolent, albeit unwanted, contact, and that it need not involve \u201cthe use or threat of physical force or violence.\u201d <em>See </em>961 So.2d 211, 215 (Fla.2007). Accordingly, the court held that battery on a law-enforcement officer does not constitute a \u201cforcible felony\u201d under Florida law. <em>Id. </em>at 218-19.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-15\">But, as a Florida appellate court has explained, \u201c[Rjesisting an officer with violence to his or her person, in violation of section 843.01, differs significantly from simple battery on a law enforcement offi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>cer....\u201d <em>Harris, </em>5 So.3d at 751. In other words, because \u201cviolence is a necessary element of the offense,\u201d <em>Rawlings, </em>976 So.2d at 1181, \u201cresisting an officer with violence\u201d is unlike the mere touching at issue in simple battery. Rather, a violation of \u00a7 843.01 involves the sort of <em>\u201cviolent </em>force\u201d contemplated by the Supreme Court as falling within the scope of the ACCA.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Johnson, </em>130 S.Ct. at 1271.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">Applying a categorical approach, we conclude that a conviction under Florida Statute \u00a7 843.01 constitutes \u00bf^predicate \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the ACCA. Accordingly, Jones\u2019s sentence is affirmed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b489-9\">. We review de novo a district court's determination that a particular conviction qualifies as a \"violent felony\" under the ACCA. <em>United States v. Canty, </em>570 F.3d 1251, 1254 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b489-10\">. A crime can also be a \"violent felony\u201d if it is punishable by more than one year in prison, and \"is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). It appears that neither the court nor the parties addressed this residual clause in the district court, so we will not address it on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b489-17\">.When the state supreme court has not definitively determined a point of state law, we are bound to adhere to decisions of the state\u2019s intermediate courts absent some indication that the state supreme court would hold otherwise. <em>Sculptchair, Inc. v. Century Arts, Ltd., </em>94 F.3d 623, 627 (11th Cir.1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b490-7\">. Jones argues that the \"offering or doing violence\u201d element of \u00a7 843.01 cannot satisfy the ACCA's \"violent force\u201d requirement because a defendant could \u201doffer[ ] or do[ ] violence\u201d in a merely negligent or reckless way. We are unpersuaded by this argument. Even if \u00a7 843.01 is a general intent crime, <em>see Frey v. State, </em>708 So.2d 918, 920 (Fla.1998), the fact remains that the sort of force contemplated by the statute is \"violent force,\u201d <em>see Rawlings, </em>976 So.2d at 1181 (\"[Violence is a necessary element of the offense.\u201d). This is sufficient for liability under the first prong of the ACCA, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(i).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"ABf\">. Jones also contends that the district court erred by concluding it was bound by an unpublished opinion, <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>355 Fed.Appx. 297 (11th Cir.2009). We review the court\u2019s reliance on <em>Jackson </em>only for plain error because Jones did not object in the district court. <em>See United States v. Frank, </em>599 F.3d 1221, 1238 (11th Cir.2010) (reviewing for plain error where the defendant failed to object). Here, the court even specifically asked if either party disagreed that <em>Jackson </em>controlled, and Jones said nothing.</p>\n<p id=\"AII\">We conclude that any error did not affect the outcome of the proceedings. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1299 (11th Cir.2005) (holding we may correct an error only if, among other things, the error \"affected the outcome of the district court proceedings\u201d) (quotations omitted). The district court specifically stated that, even without <em>Jackson, </em>\"the only conclusion one can come to\u201d using the categorical approach is that Florida Statute \u00a7 843.01 constitutes a predicate offense under the ACCA.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
