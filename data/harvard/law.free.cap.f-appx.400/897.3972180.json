She argues that her due process rights were violated because she was not provided with a list of counsel as required by the Immigration and Nationality Act. Because Veliz-Castro did not raise this argument before the IJ or the BIA, this court lacks jurisdiction to consider it. <em>See Roy v. Ashcroft, </em>389 F.3d 132, 137 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b924-4\">Veliz-Castro also contends that there is no evidence that she was advised of the consequences of failing to appear before the immigration court. We review the BIA\u2019s decision under a \u201chighly deferential abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Zhao v. Gonzales, </em>404 F.3d 295, 303 (5th Cir.2005). The BIA\u2019s finding that Veliz-Castro failed to provide authorities with a current mailing address and was orally notified in Spanish of the consequences of failing to appear is supported by substantial evidence in the record. <em>See Chun v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 76, 78 (5th Cir.1994). Veliz-Castro\u2019s failure to provide a current address precludes her from obtaining rescission of the in absentia order of removal. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(b) (5) (C) (ii); <em>Gomez-Palacios v. Holder, </em>560 F.3d 354, 360-61 (5th Cir.2009). The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b923-40\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
