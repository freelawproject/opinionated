Davenport seeks appointment of counsel to appeal the district court\u2019s order granting him a sentencing reduction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) based on retroactive amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines covering crack cocaine offenses. Davenport\u2019s sentence was reduced from 360 months to 292 months, and the district court opined that it would have considered a greater reduction if it was so authorized.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-25\">Davenport contends that the holding of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), applies to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings and that the district court erred when it determined that it was constrained in the amount of a reduction it could award. Davenport\u2019s argument has been rejected and is foreclosed. <em>See Dillon v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2692, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010); <em>United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 236-39 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 517, 175 L.Ed.2d 366 (2009). Because Davenport\u2019s appeal \u201clacks an arguable basis either in law or in fact,\u201d the appeal is frivolous. <em>See Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 325, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989) (citing <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967)). Davenport has already received the greatest sentence reduction the district court could have granted him. Accordingly the motion for appointment of counsel is denied and the appeal is dismissed. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-30\">APPEAL DISMISSED; MOTION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b911-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
