Garza appeals from the district court\u2019s imposition of two consecutive terms of imprisonment following the revocation of his terms of supervised release. The district court imposed eight-month terms of imprisonment on each revoked count, to be served consecutively, followed by four months of supervised release. The eight-month sentences were within the eight-to fourteen-month guidelines range and were below the twelve-month statutory maximum.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-16\">Garza argues that the district court reversibly erred by interpreting the Guidelines policy statements as recommending that the guidelines range be applied cumulatively to each term of supervised release revoked. Relying largely on U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.2, he argues that, like the Guidelines applicable at initial sentencing, the revocation policy statements should be interpreted as requiring one guidelines range applicable globally to all revoked terms of supervised release and as allowing consecutive sentences only as necessary to achieve the total punishment recommended by the guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-17\">The record does not support Garza\u2019s underlying premise, that the district court believed that the policy statements recommended that the guidelines range be applied cumulatively to each term of supervised release revoked. The district court had authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584(a) to impose consecutive sentences of imprisonment in its revocation of Garza\u2019s concurrent terms of supervised release. <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>250 F.3d 923, 925-29 (5th Cir.2001). Additionally, we have rejected the argument that the policy statements in Chapter 7 of the Guidelines should be read to preclude the imposition of consecutive sentences. <em>Id. </em>at 929 n. 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-18\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED, and Garza\u2019s motion to expedite the appeal is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b846-12\"><em> </em>Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
