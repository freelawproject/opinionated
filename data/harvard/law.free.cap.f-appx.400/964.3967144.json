King contends that the district court erred in denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion; that after <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), and <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), the district court should have reconsidered the amount of cocaine base attributable to him, recalculated his advisory guideline range, and imposed a sentence after consideration of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors; that the district court should not interpret U.S.S.G. \u00a7 IB 1.10 to limit its ability to resentence him; and that a 30-year sentence is too harsh and unreasonable because he is a nonviolent offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-24\">We review the district court\u2019s decision for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 3462, 177 L.Ed.2d 1064 (2010). Because King\u2019s offense involved more than 4.5 kilograms of crack cocaine, the retroactive crack cocaine amendment did not lower his guidelines range, and the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to reduce his sentence. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3582(c)(2); U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.lA) and 2D1.1. Moreover, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Booker </em>does not apply to sentence reductions under \u00a7 3582(e)(2) because such proceedings are not full resentencings. <em>Dillon v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-,- -, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2691-94, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010); <em>United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 238-39 (5th Cir.), cert. <em>denied, </em>- U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 517, 175 L.Ed.2d 366 (2009). King\u2019s argument <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"965\">*965</page-number>based on <em>Booker </em>and its progeny is therefore unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b990-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
