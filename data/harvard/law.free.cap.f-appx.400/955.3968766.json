Robinson pleaded guilty to conspiracy to distribute crack cocaine in excess of 50 grams and was sentenced to 360 months of imprisonment. The district court denied Robinson\u2019s Section 3582(c)(2) motion because application of the crack cocaine amendments would not have changed his Guidelines range since he was held accountable for 34.09 kilograms of cocaine base. The district court also denied Robinson\u2019s request for appointment of counsel and his motion to proceed IFP on appeal, certifying that the appeal was not taken in good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-10\">Robinson challenges the district court\u2019s failure to appoint counsel for him in the district court proceeding. In <em>United States v. Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d 1007, 1010-11 (5th Cir.1995), this court held that a Section 3582(c)(2) movant had no right to the appointment of counsel in the district court. This court recently reaffirmed <em>Whitebird\u2019s </em>reasoning. <em>See United States v. Hereford, </em>385 Fed.Appx. 366, 367-69 (5th Cir.2010). Further, because application of the crack cocaine amendments would not have resulted in a change to Robinson\u2019s sentence, he was not eligible for relief under Section 3582(c)(2). <em>See </em>\u00a7 3582(c)(2). As such, the appointment of counsel was not warranted in the interest of justice. <em>Cf. United States v. Robinson, </em>542 F.3d 1045, 1052 (5th Cir.2008) (appointing counsel in the interest of justice due to complexity of the defendant\u2019s Section 3582(c)(2) motion).</p>\n<p id=\"b982-15\">Given the foregoing, Robinson has failed to show that his appeal involves \u201clegal points arguable on their merits.\u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED that his motion to proceed IFP on appeal is DENIED, and his appeal is DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 &amp; n. 24 (5th Cir.1997); 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b982-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
