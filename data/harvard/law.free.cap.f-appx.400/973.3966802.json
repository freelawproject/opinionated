However, this statute is unavailable to Chavez-Barraza, whose conviction we previously affirmed on direct appeal. <em>See United States v. Chavez-Barraza, </em>237 Fed.Appx. 946 (5th Cir.2007). Although \u00a7 3742 provides that a defendant may directly appeal his sentence, the statute provides no mechanism through which he may reopen a direct appeal. The instant appeal is without arguable merit, and it is, therefore, dismissed as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-4\">This is not Chavez-Barraza\u2019s first attempt to obtain a second appeal via \u00a7 3742. Chavez-Barraza previously filed such a notice of appeal, which the district court construed as a motion for an extension of time to file a notice of appeal and denied it. We thereafter dismissed the appeal. We warn Chavez-Barraza that if he files another notice of appeal seeking to attack the 2006 judgment pursuant to \u00a7 3742, sanctions will be ordered that could include, but are not limited to, dismissal, monetary costs, and restrictions on his entitlement to file pleadings in this court and any court subject to this court\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-5\">APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b999-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
