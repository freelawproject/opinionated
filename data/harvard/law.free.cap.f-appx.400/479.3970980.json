Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-21\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Neely\u2019s motion. Neely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>argues that he and King were denied due process, but King was given notice of the charge of misconduct and defended that misconduct in his objection to a recommendation to grant the motion to impose sanctions. <em>See Attwood v. Singletary, </em>105 F.3d 610, 613 (11th Cir.1997). Neely also argues that the sanctions are excessive, but he failed to object to the amount requested by the City or the finding that the amount was reasonable. Neely\u2019s objection \u201ccomes too late.\u201d <em>Stuart I. Levin &amp; Assocs., P.A. v. Rogers, </em>156 F.3d 1135, 1142 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">We AFFIRM the denial of Neely\u2019s motion to vacate.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
