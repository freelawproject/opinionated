Before this court is Cofer\u2019s appeal of the district court\u2019s order denying his motion for reduction of sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Cofer contends that the district court erred by denying his motion based on its conclusion that he posed a threat to public safety, as evidenced by the enhancement he received to his base offense level due to his leadership role. In addition, he contends that a reduction in sentence was merited because he has behaved well in prison and availed himself of programs offered there.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-5\">These arguments do not suffice to show that the district court abused its discretion in connection with its denial of Cofer\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c) motion. <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 3462, 177 L.Ed.2d 1064 (2010). The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b938-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
