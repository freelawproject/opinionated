Lewis does not challenge the revocation of her supervised release but argues that the district court abused its discretion when sentencing her to the statutory maximum of thirty-six months\u2019 imprisonment when her guideline range was three to nine months. She argues that the explanation provided by the district court for the deviation from the applicable guideline range was insufficient in light of the record and the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, although she concedes the district court did properly calculate the guideline range. Lewis also contends that the district court did not properly consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and the upward variance was not necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">We review a sentence imposed upon revocation of supervised release for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Sweeting, </em>437 F.3d 1105, 1106-07 (11th Cir.2006). Whether the sentence is reasonable is determined under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 46, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). A sentence may be procedurally unreasonable if the sentencing court fails to calculate the advisory guideline range accurately, treats the sentencing guidelines as mandatory, bases the sentence on clearly erroneous facts, fails to consider the sentencing factors, or fails to explain the chosen sentence adequately. <em>Id. </em>at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. When revoking a defendant\u2019s term of supervised release, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e) instructs courts to consider certain \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors to determine an appropriate sentence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Once we have determined that the sentence is procedurally reasonable, we will consider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence under the totality of the circumstances. <em>Id. </em>at 46, 128 S.Ct. 586. The analysis includes \u201cexamining the totality of the circumstances, including an inquiry into whether the statutory factors in \u00a7 3553(a) support the sentence in question.\u201d <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-11\">Lewis first argues that her sentence is procedurally unreasonable because the district court did not adequately explain its reason for deviating upward from the guidelines range. We review the district court\u2019s decision to exceed the advisory sentencing range in Chapter 7 of the sentencing guidelines for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Silva, </em>443 F.3d 795, 798 (11th Cir.2006). The policy statements of Chapter 7 are merely advisory and not binding, and while the district court is required to consider the policy statements, it is not bound by them. <em>Id. </em>at 799. When exceeding the recommended range, the court must indicate that it considered the Chapter 7 policy statements. <em>Id. </em>Here, it is clear from the record that the district court was aware of and considered the Chapter 7 policy statements. Lewis has not shown that the court committed any error in its consideration of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>\u00a7 3558(a) factors, and Lewis concedes that the district court did not improperly calculate the advisory guideline range. Consequently, we conclude that her sentence is proeedurally reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">We also affirm her sentence as substantively reasonable. Lewis argues that the 36-months\u2019 statutory maximum sentence was excessive and that the district court\u2019s review of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors did not justify this sentence. The district court\u2019s comments, however, demonstrate its rationale for Lewis\u2019s longer sentence to be based significantly on the goal of rehabilitation as reflected in its recommendation for her placement in a 500-hour drug treatment and therapy program and also that she be considered for vocational training.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This circuit has previously held that a district court\u2019s consideration of \u201cthe availability of drug treatment in imposing a sentence exceeding that recommended by chapter seven of the Guidelines\u201d was not an abuse of discretion even where the court imposed the statutory maximum sentence. <em>United States v. Wiggins, </em>220 F.3d 1248, 1249 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b507-9\">. Specifically, courts are directed to consider: (1) \"the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant,\u201d (2) the need for the sentence imposed to (a) \"afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct,\u201d (b) \u201cprotect the public from further crimes of the defendant,\u201d and (c) provide the defendant with training, medical care, or other correctional treatment; (3) applicable guidelines or policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission; (4) the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities; and (5) the need to provide restitution to victims. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3583(e) and 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B)-(D) &amp; (a)(4)-(7).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"APP\">. The court also considered the availability of medical treatment for Lewis\u2019s high-risk pregnancy when imposing the statutory maximum 36-month sentence, although we do not see how a 36-month sentence accomplished that goal any more than would the nine-month sentence she requested where she was already five months pregnant at the time of sentencing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
