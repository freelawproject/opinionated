He appeals the denial of his 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for modification of his sentence based on three retroactive amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines. In his opening brief, Gamboa challenges only the denial of relief under Amendment 505, although he moves for leave to file a reply brief (which he styles a traverse) out of time to present additional claims. Issues not raised in an appellant\u2019s opening brief, however, are deemed abandoned. <em>Morgan v. Swanson, </em>610 F.3d 877, 884 n. 10 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b963-22\">Section 3582(c)(2) permits the court to modify a defendant\u2019s sentence in some instances when the Sentencing Commission lowers the applicable Guidelines range of imprisonment after the defendant has been sentenced. <em>See United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 237 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 517, 175 L.Ed.2d 366 (2009); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.lA). We review the district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for abuse of discretion, reviewing its application of the Guidelines de novo. <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 3462, 177 L.Ed.2d 1064 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b963-26\">Amendment 505 has no effect on Gam-boa\u2019s Guidelines sentencing range. That amendment lowered from 42 to 38 the maximum base offense level for drug offenses under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1. U.S.S.GApp. C., amend. 505 (effective Nov. 1, 1994); <em>United States v. Gonzalez-Balderas, </em>105 F.3d 981, 982 (5th Cir.1997). Gamboa was held responsible for 392 kilograms of cocaine and accordingly received a base offense level of 38, <em>United States v. Gamboa, </em>No. 94-20182, 1995 WL 534866, at *9 (5th Cir. Aug.15, 1995), the same base offense level he would have received under the new guideline, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b963-27\">Gamboa also contends that as charged in the indictment, the crimes do not support the life sentences he received and that his counsel was ineffective. Section 3582(c)(2) is not the proper vehicle for Gamboa to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"938\">*938</page-number>raise these claims. A \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion cannot be used to challenge the correctness of the original sentence. <em>See United States v. Whitebird, 55 </em>F.3d 1007, 1011 (5th Cir.1995); <em>see also Evans, </em>587 F.3d at 674 (explaining that a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion is not the appropriate vehicle to raise challenges to the original sentencing proceeding).</p>\n<p id=\"b964-4\">Accordingly, the decision of the district court is AFFIRMED. Gamboa\u2019s motion to file a reply brief out of time is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b963-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under die limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
