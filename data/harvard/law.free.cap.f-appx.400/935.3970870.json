Cavazos-Rodriguez argues that the district court committed error, plain or otherwise, by applying the \u201caggravated felony\u201d enhancement under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2) based on the finding that he had committed an aggravated felony in 2003 and had been removed in 2004. Ca-vazos-Rodriguez argues that the fact of his 2004 removal was not alleged in his indictment, proven beyond a reasonable doubt at trial, or admitted by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-21\">Because the indictment alleged only reentry after deportation without any specification of the date of deportation, much less any reference to a prior conviction, and because the Government failed to prove a deportation date at rearraignment, we conclude that the district court plainly erred in finding that Cavazos-Rodriguez was removed in 2004 for purposes of increasing his sentence beyond the two-year statutory maximum set forth in \u00a7 1326(a). <em>See United States v. Rojas-Luna, </em>522 F.3d 502, 506 (5th Cir.2008) <em>(\u201cAlmendarez-Torres </em>is limited to prior convictions and ... any other fact used to increase a sentence beyond a statutory maximum must be proven to a jury.\u201d); <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). This error seriously affected the fairness and integrity of the proceedings. <em>Rojas-Luna, </em>522 F.3d at 506. In the exercise of our discretion, relief is warranted. <em>See id. </em>We vacate Cavazos-Rodriguez\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing consistent with <em>Rojas-Luna.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b961-22\">Because Cavazos-Rodriguez is not subject to the sentencing enhancement under \u00a7 1326(b)(2), we need not address Cava-zos-Rodriguez\u2019s argument that the district court reversibly erred by treating his 2003 Texas assault conviction as an \u201caggravated felony\u201d warranting an eight-level adjustment under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C). <em>Id. </em>at 507 n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-23\">CONVICTION AFFIRMED; SENTENCE VACATED; CASE REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b961-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
