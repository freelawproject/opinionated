Fearce\u2019s IFP motion is construed as a challenge to the district court\u2019s determination that his appeal was not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 199-202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b962-17\">Although Fearce argues that he is eligible for a sentence reduction and that the district court should consider several issues on resentencing, Fearce does not challenge the district court\u2019s sole basis for denying his \u00a7 3582(c) motion \u2014 the court\u2019s determination that Fearce was not eligible for a sentence reduction because he had been sentenced to the statutory mandatory minimum sentence of 240 months. Fearce\u2019s failure to challenge the district court\u2019s legal analysis or its application in his case, \u201c[i]n practical effect, ... is the same as if he had not appealed that judgment.\u201d <em>Brinkmann v. Dallas Cnty. Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). Although pro se briefs are afforded liberal construction, <em>Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520-21, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972) (per curiam), arguments must be briefed in order to be preserved. <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b962-22\">Fearce has abandoned any challenge to basis of the district court\u2019s denial of his \u00a7 3582(c) motion. <em>See Brinkmann, </em>813 F.2d at 748. Consequently, the appeal lacks any issue of arguable merit. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). Fearce\u2019s IFP motion is DENIED and his appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-23\">IFP DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b962-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
