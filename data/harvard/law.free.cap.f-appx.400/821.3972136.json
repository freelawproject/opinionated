In 1995, a jury convicted Fisher of possession with intent to distribute crack cocaine and possession of a firearm by a felon. Based on Fisher\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>prior convictions for drug trafficking and aggravated assault, the district court concluded that Fisher was a career offender within the meaning of \u00a7 4B1.1 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines and sentenced him to 300 months in prison. Fisher raises three challenges to his sentence in this \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding. None has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\">First, Fisher contends that the district court erred by refusing to reduce his sentence in light of Amendments 706, 711, and 715 to the Sentencing Guidelines. These amendments reduced the base offense levels for crack-cocaine offenses. <em>United States v. Burns, 526 F.3d </em>852, 861 (5th Cir.2008). The Sentencing Commission made these amendments retroactive. <em>Id. </em>\u201cSection 3582(c)(2) permits a district court to reduce a term of imprisonment when it is based upon a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by an amendment to the Guidelines, if such a reduction is consistent with the policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>United States v. Gonzalez-Balderas, </em>105 F.3d 981, 982 (5th Cir.1997) (per curiam). In other words, a defendant is eligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) only if an amendment has lowered the Guideline range applicable to the defendant. <em>See </em>U.S. Sentenoing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 1B.1.10 cmt. n. 1 (2009). The 2007 and 2008 \u201ccrack cocaine guideline amendments do not apply to prisoners sentenced as career offenders\u201d under \u00a7 4B1.1 of the Guidelines. <em>United States v. Anderson, </em>591 F.3d 789, 791 (5th Cir.2009) (per curiam). Therefore, the district court did not err in denying Fisher\u2019s motion to have his sentence reduced under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">Next, Fisher argues that even if none of the amendments listed in Guidelines \u00a7 lB.10(c) explicitly authorizes a reduction in his sentence, the district court nonetheless should have exercised its discretion under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), to reduce his sentence based on the factors enumerated in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). However, <em>\u201cBooker </em>does not alter the mandatory character of Guideline \u00a7 lBl.lO\u2019s limitations on sentence reductions.\u201d <em>United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 238 (5th Cir.) (per curiam), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 517, 175 L.Ed.2d 366 (2009); <em>see also Dillon v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-,-, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2692, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010) (\u201cGiven the limited scope and purpose of \u00a7 3582(c)(2), we conclude that proceedings under that section do not implicate the interests identified in <em>Booker.\u201d). </em>Under Guideline \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(A), \u201c[a] reduction in the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment ... is not authorized under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) if ... [n]one of the amendments listed in subsection (c) is applicable to the defendant.\u201d Fisher has not identified any amendment listed in Guideline \u00a7 lB1.10(c) that is applicable to him. As a result, the district court was not authorized to reduce his sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-12\">Finally, Fisher asserts that he should not have been sentenced as a career offender because one of his prior offenses was a deferred adjudication. But \u201c[a] \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion is not a second opportunity\u201d to challenge \u201cthe appropriateness of the original sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d 1007, 1011 (5th Cir.1995). And even if it were, an offense resolved via deferred adjudication may count toward a defendant\u2019s status as a career offender under \u00a7 4B1.1 of the Guidelines where, as here, the defendant pled guilty to the offense. <em>See United States v. Daniels, </em>588 F.3d 835, 838 (5th Cir.2009) (per curiam), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 2424, 176 L.Ed.2d 938 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b849-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>The Government has moved for summary affirmance. The motion is GRANTED, and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.
