He appeals the district court\u2019s summary denial of its <em>sua sponte </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion to reduce Charles\u2019 sentence based upon the Guidelines range for crack-cocaine offenses being lowered by Amendment 706. Charles contends the district court erred in not reducing his sentence by failing to: (1) address the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a); and (2) provide him an opportunity to be heard.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-21\">Although \u00a7 3582(c)(2) directs district courts to consider the sentencing factors of \u00a7 3553(a), the reasonableness standard of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), does <em>not </em>apply to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings. <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 671-72 (5th Cir.2009) (citing <em>United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 238 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 517, 175 L.Ed.2d 366 (2009)), <em>cert. denied,, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 3462, 177 L.Ed.2d 1064 (2010). Instead, the district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Cooley, </em>590 F.3d 293, 295 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b951-25\">In exercising its discretion under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), the district court is required to consider: (1) the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors, (2) the nature and seriousness of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"926\">*926</page-number>the potential danger to the community if defendant\u2019s sentence is reduced, and (B) defendant\u2019s post-sentencing conduct. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. n. lB(i)-(iii). The district court explicitly considered the last two factors in denying the motion, emphasizing Charles\u2019 criminal history and post-sentencing disciplinary infractions. By focusing on Charles\u2019 criminal history, the district court implicitly weighed the \u00a7 3553(a) factors; it was <em>not </em>required to explain its consideration of them. <em>See Cooley, </em>590 F.3d at 298 (\u201c[A] court is <em>not </em>required to state findings of fact and conclusions of law when denying a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion\u201d.) (emphasis added) (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b952-4\">Finally, the court did <em>not </em>err in denying the motion without conducting a hearing because there were <em>no </em>contested issues of fact to be resolved. Where a proceeding involves only the correction or reduction of a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c), defendant\u2019s presence is <em>not </em>required. <em>See </em>Fed. R.CmmP. 43(b)(4); <em>see also United States v. Patterson, </em>42 F.3d 246, 248-49 (5th Cir.1994) (citing <em>United States v. Moree, </em>928 F.2d 654, 655 (5th Cir.1991)) (\u201c[A] defendant is not entitled to be present when the district court merely modifies an existing sentence\u201d.)</p>\n<p id=\"b952-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b951-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
