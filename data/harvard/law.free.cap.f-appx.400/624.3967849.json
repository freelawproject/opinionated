We will summarily affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-17\">In June 2010, Shemonsky filed a complaint against a United States Bankruptcy Court Judge as well as an application to proceed in forma pauperis. In his complaint, Shemonsky sought over $5 billion dollars in damages for the 1990 \u201cillegal theft of [his] savings and loan by the office of thrift supervision.\u201d The complaint, which states that the bases for federal jurisdiction are \u201cArticle IV of the U.S. Constitution [and the] Fifth Amendment,\u201d makes no reference Judge Thomas, the defendant. On June 21, 2010, the district court entered an order that granted She-monsky\u2019s application to proceed in forma pauperis but dismissed his complaint under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii). The district court explained that, under the doctrine of judicial immunity, Judge Thomas is absolutely immune from civil rights lawsuits that seek money damages for actions performed in a judicial capacity. <em>See Mireles v. Waco, </em>502 U.S. 9, 11, 112 S.Ct. 286, 116 L.Ed.2d 9 (1991). Additionally, the district court stated that Shemonsky\u2019s action, which was filed twenty years after the alleged events in question occurred, was time-barred because federal civil rights actions are subject to Pennsylvania\u2019s two-year statute of limitation for personal injury actions. <em>See Wallace v. Kato, </em>549 U.S. 384, 387, 127 S.Ct. 1091, 166 L.Ed.2d 973 (2007); 42 Pa. Cons.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 5524. This appeal followed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b652-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and our review of the district court\u2019s sua sponte dismissal of She-monsky\u2019s complaint is plenary. <em>See Allah v. Seiverling, </em>229 F.3d 220, 223 (3d Cir.2000). We may take summary action when we conclude that an appeal presents no \u201csubstantial question.\u201d 3d Cir. LAR 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">After granting a litigant leave to proceed in forma pauperis, a district court is required to dismiss the complaint if it fails to state a claim on which relief may be granted. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii). For the reasons given by the district court, we agree that Shemonsky\u2019s complaint failed to state a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">We have also held that a district court should not dismiss a pro se complaint without allowing the plaintiff leave to amend unless amendment would be inequitable or futile. <em>See Alston v. Parker, </em>363 F.3d 229, 235 (3d Cir.2004); <em>Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp., </em>293 F.3d 103, 108 (3d Cir.2002). Although the district court did not explicitly state that amendment of the complaint would be futile, it is clear that this was the district court\u2019s intent. Further, Shemonsky has had, and has taken, the opportunity to respond to the district court\u2019s order, but has revealed no flaw in the dismissal of his complaint. We will therefore summarily affirm the judgment of the district court. <em>See </em>3d Cir. LAR 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b651-14\">. After Shemonsky filed his notice of appeal from the June 21, 2010 order, he moved for reconsideration of that order. He attached documents from some of his previous cases (of which there are many), claiming that they supported his allegations regarding a \u201cconspiracy to [sic] entrapment for financial gain.\u201d The district court denied the motion, stating that Shemonsky did not address the bases for the dismissal of his complaint. She-monsky did not appeal from the denial of the motion for reconsideration.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
