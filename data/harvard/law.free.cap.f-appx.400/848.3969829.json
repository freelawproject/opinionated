The district court sentenced Simmons to 71 months on Count One, 60 months on Count Two, to run concurrently, and 20 years on Count Three, to run consecutively to Counts One and Two. Simmons contends that the 20-years sentence as to Count Three was substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-21\">The 20-year sentence challenged by Simmons was the result of an upward variance from the Guidelines. <em>See United States v. Brantley, </em>537 F.3d 347, 349 (5th Cir.2008). Following <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), our review of sentences is for reasonableness in light of the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 518-19 (5th Cir.2005). We \u201cconsider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b874-22\">The record indicates that the district court properly considered the \u00a7 3553(a) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>factors. The 20-year sentence reflected the seriousness of Simmons\u2019s offense, the need to promote respect for the law, the need to provide just punishment, and the need to protect the public from future crimes. The sentence imposed \u201cwas reasonable under the totality of the relevant statutory factors.\u201d <em>Brantley, </em>537 F.3d at 349 (quotation marks omitted); <em>see also United States v. Lopez-Velasquez, </em>526 F.3d 804, 807 (5th Cir.2008). Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b874-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
