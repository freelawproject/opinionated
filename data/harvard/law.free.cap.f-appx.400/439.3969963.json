He argues that the BIA erred in finding that his convictions for sexual abuse of a minor rendered him ineligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief. He points out that the case on which the BIA relied, <em>Matter of Blake, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 722 (BIA 2005), was overturned by the Second Circuit in <em>Blake v. Carbone, </em>489 F.3d 88 (2d Cir.2007). He asserts that <em>Matter of Blake </em>was wrongly decided and that he is, in fact, eligible for a waiver of inadmissibility under \u00a7 212(c). Hernandez also contends that <em>Matter of Blake </em>and the BIA\u2019s statutory counterpart test cannot be retroactively applied to pre-2004 convictions. For the reasons set forth below, we dismiss the petition for review in part and deny it in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-17\">In 2008, the Department of Homeland Security issued a Notice to Appear to Hernandez, charging that he was removable from the United States because he had been convicted of aggravated felonies. Specifically, the notice alleged that Hernandez had been convicted of two counts of custodial familial sexual battery, in violation of Fla.Stat. \u00a7 794.04. Hernandez conceded that he was removable as charged, but he sought a waiver of inadmissibility pursuant to \u00a7 212(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-18\">The IJ denied Hernandez\u2019s application for a waiver of inadmissibility. The IJ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>noted that, in <em>Matter of Blake, </em>the BIA held that an individual convicted of sexually abusing a minor is ineligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief because that offense does not have a statutory counterpart in any of the grounds of inadmissibility under INA \u00a7 212(a), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a). Hernandez appealed to the BIA. In his appeal brief, he argued that the IJ erred by applying <em>Matter of Blake </em>because that case was overruled in <em>Carbone. </em>The BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">Before addressing the merits of Hernandez\u2019s arguments, we must consider whether we have jurisdiction over his petition for review. We review our own subject-matter jurisdiction <em>de novo. Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250 (11th Cir.2006). Generally, we may not review a final order of removal where the petitioner was found to be removable based on a conviction for an aggravated felony. INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(C), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C). Nevertheless, we retain jurisdiction to review constitutional issues and questions of law. INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(D), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D). By statute, the petitioner must administratively exhaust his arguments by raising them before the BIA. <em>Amaya-Artunduaga, </em>463 F.3d at 1250. We lack jurisdiction to consider unexhausted arguments. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">In this case, Hernandez raises two issues before use. First, he argues that the BIA\u2019s decision in <em>Matter of Blake </em>is contrary to precedent and is inconsistent with the INA and the agency\u2019s own regulations. Second, he contends that application of <em>Matter of Blake </em>to his case would result in an impermissible retroactive ef-feet. Both of these issues present questions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-11\">However, in his appeal brief before the BIA, Hernandez argued only that <em>Matter of Blake </em>was wrongly decided and was no longer binding in light of the Second Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Carbone. </em>He did not assert that the IJ erred by retroactively applying <em>Matter of Blake </em>to his case. Because Hernandez failed to exhaust his administrative remedies with respect to the retroactivity question, we lack jurisdiction to consider it.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, we will dismiss Hernandez\u2019s petition with respect to that issue. Since Hernandez did exhaust his argument that <em>Matter of Blake </em>was wrongly decided, we will consider the merits of that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-13\">\u201cWe review the BIA\u2019s legal determinations <em>de novo.\u201d De la Rosa v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>579 F.3d 1327, 1335 (11th Cir.2009). Under the prior panel precedent rule, a prior decision of a panel of this Court is binding on all subsequent panels unless and until the panel\u2019s decision is overturned by the Supreme Court or by this Court sitting <em>en banc. Smith v. GTE Corp., </em>236 F.3d 1292, 1300 n. 8 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-14\">In 2004, the Attorney General promulgated 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1212.3(f)(5), which provides that an application for cancellation of removal must be denied if the alien is deportable or removable based on an offense that does not have a \u201cstatutory counterpart\u201d in the grounds of inadmissibility codified in INA \u00a7 212(a). In <em>Matter of Blake, </em>the BIA determined that an alien convicted of sexual abuse of a minor was ineligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief because his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>offense did not have a statutory counterpart in any of the grounds of inadmissibility listed in \u00a7 212(a). <em>Matter of Blake, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 727-29. The BIA explained that a ground of inadmissibility is a statutory counterpart to an aggravated felony only if it involves \u201cessentially the same category of offenses\u201d as the felony charge. <em>Id. </em>at 729. The inquiry \u201cturns on whether Congress has employed similar language to describe substantially equivalent categories of offenses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 728.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-17\">In <em>De la Rosa, </em>we adopted the BIA\u2019s categorical approach to the statutory counterpart test. <em>De la Rosa, </em>579 F.3d at 1337. We declined to accept the alternative, offense-based approach employed by the Second Circuit in <em>Carbone. Id. </em>We deferred to the BIA\u2019s conclusion in <em>Matter of Blake </em>that sexual abuse of a minor does not have a statutory counterpart in INA \u00a7 212(a). <em>Id. </em>at 1340.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-18\">Hernandez\u2019s argument that <em>Matter of Blake </em>was wrongly decided is foreclosed by our decision in <em>De la Rosa, </em>which affirmed <em>Matter of Blake </em>and adopted its categorical approach to the statutory counterpart test. Although the Second Circuit rejected the BIA\u2019s approach in <em>Carbone, </em>the Second Circuit\u2019s opinion did not affect the validity of <em>Matter of Blake </em>in this Circuit. We are bound by our decision in <em>De la Rosa </em>unless and until that case is overruled by the Supreme Court or by this Court sitting <em>en banc. See Smith, </em>236 F.3d at 1300 n. 8. Under <em>De la Rosa </em>and <em>Matter of Blake, </em>Hernandez\u2019s aggravated felony conviction for sexual abuse of a minor rendered him ineligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief. <em>See De la Rosa, 579 F.3d at </em>1340; <em>Matter of Blake, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 727-29. Therefore, the BIA properly denied Hernandez\u2019s application for a waiver of inadmissibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-19\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review in part and dismiss it in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-3\">PETITION DENIED IN PART, DISMISSED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b467-8\">. Even if Hernandez had exhausted his administrative remedies, his retroactivity argument is meritless. <em>See Valere v. Gonzales, </em>473 F.3d 757, 761-62 (7th Cir.2007) (holding that <em>Matter of Blake </em>can be applied retroactively); <em>Vue v. Gonzales, </em>496 F.3d 858, 862-63 (8th Cir.2007) (same).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
