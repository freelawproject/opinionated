We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-14\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b956-15\">January filed an application for Social Security disability benefits on account of her back and neck problems. In evaluating a disability claim, the Commissioner conducts a five-step sequential analysis to determine whether (1) the claimant is presently working; (2) the claimant has a severe impairment; (3) the impairment meets or equals an impairment listed in Appendix 1 of the Social Security regulations; (4) the impairment prevents the claimant from doing past relevant work; and (5) the impairment prevents the claimant from doing any other work.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> While the claimant bears the burden of establishing her disability in the first four steps of the analysis, the burden shifts to the Commissioner at step five to show that there is other substantial work in the national economy that the claimant can perform.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b956-16\">After a hearing, an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) \u2014 acting for the Commissioner \u2014 determined that January was not working and that she suffered from a severe impairment, a disorder of the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine. After concluding that a finding of disability was not required at step three, the ALJ determined that January\u2019s residual functional capacity enabled her to perform the full range of light work as defined by Social Security regulations. This finding precluded January from returning to her previous work as a sales associate, which fell in the medium work category. The ALJ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"931\">*931</page-number>determined, however, that under the Medical-Vocational Guidelines,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> other substantial work existed in the national economy that January was capable of performing. Accordingly, the ALJ found that January was \u201cnot disabled\u201d and denied her application for benefits. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b957-6\">Our review is limited to determining whether the Commissioner applied the proper legal standards and whether the denial is supported by substantial evidence in the record.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Substantial evidence \u201cis such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We may not reweigh the evidence or substitute our judgment for that of the Commissioner.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b957-7\">January\u2019s two contentions on appeal revolve around the ALJ\u2019s failure to consider a box ticked by a medical consultant on her residual functional capacity evaluation. The tick mark indicates that she suffers from a nonexertional limit on her work capacity, namely an environmental restriction prohibiting her from working around hazards such as machinery or heights. January first argues that the ALJ\u2019s failure to mention this nonexertional limitation deprives the residual functional capacity assessment of substantial evidence, thereby invalidating it. Though the ALJ is not always required to provide an \u201cexhaustive point-by-point discussion\u201d of the evidence offered in support of a disability claim,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> it is a close call whether his failure to discuss the nonexertional limitation was error. Assuming, arguendo, that the ALJ erred here, the error was harmless, as discussed more fully below.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-15\">January\u2019s second contention has more merit, but ultimately fails. She argues that, in light of her nonexertional limitation, the ALJ erred in relying exclusively on the Guidelines to find she was not disabled at step five. January is correct that, as a general rule, the Commissioner may not rely exclusively on the Guidelines when the claimant suffers from nonexer-tional impairments.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> That rule is subject to a substantial caveat, however, in that it does not apply when the claimant\u2019s nonex-ertional impairments \u201cdo not significantly affect [the claimant\u2019s] residual functional capacity.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Here, the ALJ looked to the Guidelines -without first determining that January\u2019s environmental restriction prohibiting her from working near machinery or heights significantly compromised her capacity to perform light work. This omission is error, as we cannot determine whether his decision to utilize the Guidelines \u2014 and thus declare January \u201cnot disabled\u201d \u2014 is based on substantial evidence.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b957-16\">Our analysis is not at an end, however, because we must analyze whether the ALJ\u2019s error was harmless. It is well-established that \u201cprocedural perfection in administrative proceedings is not required as long as the substantial rights of a party have not been affected.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We are con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"932\">*932</page-number>vinced that the ALJ\u2019s error here did not affect January\u2019s substantial rights, as we agree with the district court that Social Security Ruling 85-15 forecloses January\u2019s argument that her nonexertional limitation significantly affected her capacity to perform light work. SSR 85-15 describes various environmental limitations that a person may need to avoid, such as \u201cthose involving extremes of temperature, noise, and vibration; recognized hazards such as unprotected elevations and dangerous moving machinery; and fumes, dust, and poor ventilation.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The ruling also provides an example relevant here, stating that \u201ca person with a seizure disorder who is restricted only from being on unprotected elevations and near dangerous moving machinery is an example of someone whose environmental restriction does not have a significant effect on work that exists at all exertional levels.\u201d <footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Similarly, January\u2019s environmental limitation does not have a significant effect on the light work available to her in the national economy, and her substantial rights were not affected by the ALJ\u2019s error?</p>\n<p id=\"b958-4\">January argues that SSR 85-15 does not apply because her environmental restriction requires that she avoid <em>all </em>machinery and not just <em>dangerous </em>machinery. This argument is based solely on the language of the residual functional capacity checklist indicating that January should \u201cavoid all exposure\u201d to \u201chazards (machinery, heights, etc.).\u201d We are not persuaded that the checklist language must be taken so literally. Indeed, the medical consultant ticked another box indicating that January had \u201cunlimited\u201d capability to \u201cpush and/or pull\u201d within her exertional limitations. This capability, according to the checklist, includes the \u201coperation of hand and/or foot controls\u201d \u2014 actions typically associated with operating machinery. Moreover, January testified that she occasionally drove her car, which is undoubtedly \u201cmachinery.\u201d Most importantly, a restriction from dangerous machinery comports with the other \u201chazards\u201d described in the United States Department of Labor\u2019s <em>Selected Characteristics of Occupations Defined in the Revised Dictionary of Occupational Titles </em>(SCO),<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> one source from which the Commissioner may take administrative notice of work existing in the national economy.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Aside from \u201cproximity to moving mechanical parts,\u201d other hazards listed in the SCO include \u201cexposure to electrical shock\u201d; \u201cworking in high, exposed places\u201d; \u201cexposure to radiation\u201d; \u201cworking with explosives\u201d; and \u201cexposure to toxic, caustic chemicals.\u201d <footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In this context, we believe that the checklist\u2019s language is shorthand for \u201cdangerous machinery,\u201d and that SSR 85-15 is applicable. Accordingly, remand to the Commissioner would serve no purpose because January\u2019s environmental restriction does not significantly erode her potential job base at the light work level.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-9\">Finally, January contends that we are precluded from relying on SSR 85-15 because the Commissioner did not rely on it below. Generally, we may only affirm an agency decision on the basis of the rationale it advanced below.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> However, there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"933\">*933</page-number>are exceptions to that rule, including harmless error.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Here, there is \u201cno realistic possibility that, absent the error[],\u201d the ALJ would have reached a different conclusion.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b959-5\">The judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b956-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
