Caso-Giraldo contends that in denying his application, the agency erred by applying an incorrect legal standard to determine whether he entered into his marriage in good faith, despite the fact that he married a United States citizen after the Department of Homeland Security initiated removal proceedings against him. Caso-Giraldo also asserts that deficiencies in documentary support for his application are attributable to his prior counsel\u2019s ineffective representation. Second, as to his withholding of removal claim, Caso-Giral-do argues that the agency erred in denying his application, because the IJ failed to consider whether he was persecuted on account of his father\u2019s political opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-12\">We address each argument in turn, denying the petition for review in part and dismissing in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-14\">We review <em>de novo </em>our subject matter jurisdiction. <em>Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250 (11th Cir.2006). \u201cWe lack jurisdiction to consider a claim raised in a petition for review unless the petitioner has exhausted his administrative remedies with respect thereto.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1)). Therefore, if an alien challenges an issue in his petition for review without first raising the issue in his appeal to the BIA, we lack jurisdiction to consider it. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b540-15\">The INA further provides that \u201cno court shall have jurisdiction to review\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-16\">(i) any judgment regarding the granting of relief under section 1182(h), 1182(i), 1229b, 1229c, or 1255 of this title, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-17\">(ii) any other decision or action of the Attorney General or the Secretary of Homeland Security the authority for which is specified under this sub-chapter to be in the discretion of the Attorney General or the Secretary of Homeland Security, other than the granting of relief under section 1158(a) of this title.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-18\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B). Thus, Congress stripped this Court of jurisdiction to review judgments regarding the granting of relief under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255. <em>See Kucana </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number><em>v. Holder, </em>558 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 827, 837,175 L.Ed.2d 694 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">However, under \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D), no provision in the INA \u201cshall be construed as precluding review of constitutional claims or questions of law raised upon a petition for review filed with an appropriate court of appeals.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D); <em>see also Martinez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>446 F.3d 1219, 1221-22 (11th Cir.2006). A petitioner\u2019s garden-variety challenge that an immigration judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) \u201cabused her discretion by failing properly to weigh the factual scenario ... presented\u201d does not typically raise a constitutional claim or question of law for purposes of \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D). <em>See Alvarez Acosta v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>524 F.3d 1191, 1196-97 (11th Cir.2008). However, whether the IJ applied the correct legal standard is a \u201clegal question\u201d under the statute. <em>See id. </em>at 1197 &amp; n. 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">The INA provides the Attorney General with the discretion to adjust the status of an alien to that of lawful permanent resident if: \u201c(1) the alien makes an application for such adjustment, (2) the alien is eligible to receive an immigrant visa and is admissible to the United States for permanent residence, and (3) an immigrant visa is immediately available to him at the time his application is filed.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(a). When an alien marries a United States citizen, the citizen-spouse may file a Form 1-130 Petition for Alien Relative, which, if approved, \u201cprovides the evi-dentiary basis for the beneficiary\u2019s adjustment of status via Form 1-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status.\u201d <em>Alvarez Acosta, </em>524 F.3d at 1194 n. 6. Generally, an alien who seeks an immigrant visa on the basis of a marriage entered into while \u201cadministrative or judicial proceedings are pending regarding the alien\u2019s right to be admitted or remain in the United States\u201d may not have his status adjusted under \u00a7 1255(a). <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(e)(l)-(2). However, pursuant to the \u201cbona fide marriage exception,\u201d this bar to adjustment of status</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ab0\">shall not apply with respect to a marriage if the alien establishes by clear and convincing evidence to the satisfaction of the Attorney General that the marriage was entered into in good faith and in accordance with the laws of the place where the marriage took place and the marriage was not entered into for the purpose of procuring the alien\u2019s admission as an immigrant....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-9\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1255(e)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-10\">Caso-Giraldo argues that \u00a7 1252 does not strip this Court of jurisdiction to review the merits of the agency\u2019s denial of his adjustment of status application. Specifically, he contends that his petition implicates a purely legal question of \u201cstatutory eligibility for adjustment of status, a matter reviewable by the Courts of Appeals.\u201d Therefore, argues Caso-Giraldo, this Court has the authority to review the IJ\u2019s decision, which he characterizes as a denial of his adjustment of status petition pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(G)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-11\">As an initial matter, we note that \u00a7 1255(e), and not \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(G)(ii), governs Caso-Giraldo\u2019s adjustment of status application. While the IJ did cite to \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(G)(ii) in his oral decision, the record clearly reflects that Caso-Giraldo\u2019s petition turned upon an evaluation of \u00a7 1255(e)(3), the bona fide marriage exception. When Caso-Giraldo sought adjustment of status based on marriage to a U.S. citizen, removal proceedings had already begun. Therefore, he could only obtain adjustment of status if, as required by \u00a7 1255(e)(3), he was able to establish \u201cby clear and convincing evidence ... that the marriage was entered into in good faith,\u201d and not to avoid immigration laws. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1255(e)(3); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 245.1(c)(8)(iii)(F). This conclusion is confirmed not only in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>the BIA\u2019s order dismissing Caso-Giraldo\u2019s appeal, but also in Caso-Giraldo\u2019s own brief before the BIA. <em>(See </em>Br. Supp. Appeal 8-9.)</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">Caso-Giraldo argues that the agency applied an incorrect legal standard in ruling on his application for adjustment of status. He contends that under BIA precedent, the agency ought to have reviewed his petition only for \u201csubstantial and probative\u201d evidence, not clear and convincing evidence, that his marriage was in good faith. Because determination of the proper legal standard constitutes a legal question for the purposes of \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D), we have jurisdiction to review Caso-Giraldo\u2019s argument. <em>Cf. Alvarez Acosta, </em>524 F.3d at 1197. As discussed above, Caso-Giraldo\u2019s adjustment of status application was subject to \u00a7 1255(e)(3).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The plain language of both the statute and the relevant federal regulations places the burden on Caso-Giraldo to prove by clear and convincing evidence that he entered into his marriage in good faith. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(e)(3); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 245.1(c)(8)(iii)(F). Accordingly, the BIA applied the proper legal standard when it denied Caso-Giraldo\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">Insofar as Caso-Giraldo challenges the agency\u2019s application of the facts to the standard set out by \u00a7 1255(e)(3), \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i) clearly strips this Court of jurisdiction to consider Caso-Giraldo\u2019s argument. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i) (\u201c[N]o court shall have jurisdiction to review ... any judgment regarding the granting of relief under section ... 1255 of this title ....\u201d); <em>see also Kucana, </em>558 U.S. at-, 130 S.Ct. at 837 (explaining that \u201cclause (i) enumerates the] administrative judgments that are insulated from judicial review,\u201d and that Congress also \u201cadded in clause (ii) a catchall provision covering \u2018any other decision ... the authority for which is specified under this subchapter\u2019 \u201d (quoting 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii))).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-9\">Finally, Caso-Giraldo claims that his attorney had a negative effect on his ability to present evidence in support of his adjustment of status petition. Caso-Giraldo had a new attorney when he appeared before the BIA, and he had the opportunity to raise this challenge. Because he did not do so, he failed to exhaust this claim before the BIA and we lack jurisdiction to address his ineffective assistance of counsel arguments. <em>See Amaya-Artunduaga, </em>463 F.3d at 1250.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-11\">When the BIA issues a decision, we review only that decision, except to the extent that the BIA adopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning, in which case we also review the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001) (\u201cInsofar as the Board adopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as well.\u201d). In this case, the BIA agreed with the IJ\u2019s reasoning that the harm Caso-Giraldo allegedly suffered did not rise to the level of persecution. Thus, we will review both the decision of the BIA and that of the IJ. <em>See id</em></p>\n<p id=\"b542-12\">We review <em>de novo </em>the agency\u2019s conclusions of law, but review findings of fact for substantial evidence to support them. <em>Kazemzadeh v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>577 F.3d 1341, 1350 (11th Cir.2009). \u201cOur review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>for substantial evidence is highly deferential.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1351. \u201c[W]e view the record evidence in the light most favorable to the agency\u2019s decision and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of that decision.\u201d <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1027 (11th Cir.2004) (en banc). We may not \u201creweigh the evidence from scratch\u201d and must affirm the agency\u2019s decision if \u201cit is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Kazemzadeh, </em>577 F.3d at 1351 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cUnder this highly deferential standard of review, the [agency\u2019s] decision can be reversed only if the evidence compels a reasonable fact finder to find otherwise.\u201d <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1230 (11th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201c[T]he mere fact that th\u00e9 record may support a contrary conclusion is not enough to justify a reversal of the administrative findings.\u201d <em>Adefemi, </em>386 F.3d at 1027.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">Under the INA, an alien seeking withholding of removal must show that his \u201clife or freedom would be threatened in [his] country [of origin] because of [his] race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A). \u201cThe alien bears the burden of demonstrating that it is \u2018more likely than not\u2019 [he] will be persecuted or tortured upon being returned to [his] country.\u201d <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1232 (quoting <em>Fahim v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>278 F.3d 1216, 1218 (11th Cir.2002)). This standard, also known as \u201cclear probability of persecution,\u201d is more stringent than that used to evaluate applications for asylum. <em>Ruiz v. Gonzales, </em>479 F.3d 762, 764-66 &amp; n. 1 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">An alien may satisfy his burden of proof for withholding of removal in two ways. <em>Tan v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>446 F.3d 1369, 1375 (11th Cir.2006). First, an alien may establish past persecution based on a protected ground. Past persecution creates a rebut-table presumption that he has a well-founded fear of future persecution and shifts the burden to the government to show changed conditions in the country or the ability to avoid a future threat through relocation. <em>Id. </em>Second, an alien may establish that it is more likely than not that he would be persecuted upon removal due to a protected ground. <em>Id. </em>However, an alien \u201cmust demonstrate that his or her fear of persecution is subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1289. \u201cOnly in a \u2018rare case\u2019 does the record compel the conclusion that an alien has suffered past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution.\u201d <em>Rodriguez Morales v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>488 F.3d 884, 890 (11th Cir.2007) (quoting <em>Silva v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>448 F.3d 1229, 1239 (11th Cir.2006)).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">Caso-Giraldo\u2019s brief on appeal argues only that he is entitled to withholding of removal. It mentions the Convention Against Torture only to state that it is unnecessary for this Court to address whether he is entitled to relief under that treaty. Accordingly, the only issue properly before this Court is whether the BIA and IJ erred in denying his application for withholding of removal. <em>See Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005) (noting that the petitioner abandoned any challenge to the denial of relief under the Convention Against Torture because he failed to offer argument on the issue).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-9\">Specifically, the relevant portions of Caso-Giraldo\u2019s brief focus almost exclusively on the question of whether the IJ failed to consider the argument that his father\u2019s political opinion could be imputed to him. Contrary to the allegations of his brief, the IJ did in fact address this argument, but still concluded that Caso-Giraldo was not entitled to relief. The IJ held, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>and the BIA agreed, that Caso-Giraldo had not presented sufficient evidence that he was either subject to past persecution based on a protected ground or that he would more likely than not be subject to future persecution were he returned to Peru. In denying Caso-Giraldo\u2019s application, the IJ relied on alternative grounds to conclude that he had not demonstrated past persecution. The IJ found that (1) the aggregate of the harms of which Caso-Giraldo complained did not amount to persecution, and (2) the harm suffered was not connected to a protected ground. Accordingly, Caso-Giraldo\u2019s entire argument on appeal \u2014 that the agency failed to take into consideration the theory of imputed political opinion as a basis for establishing a nexus between the harm suffered and a protected ground \u2014 focuses on the second of these two, independently dispositive prongs. <em>See Silva, </em>448 F.3d at 1236 (\u201cEach avenue of asylum relief requires proof of two criteria. To establish asylum based on past persecution, the applicant must prove (1) that she was persecuted, and (2) that the persecution was on account of a protected ground.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">Thus, Caso-Giraldo has not challenged two different agency conclusions, a decision that proves fatal to his application. Specifically, he fails to address the findings that (1) he did not suffer past harm amounting to persecution, and (2) he did not establish that it is more likely than not that he would be persecuted upon return to Peru.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> While he cites to authority to support his position that his father\u2019s political opinions ought to be imputed to him as a statutorily protected ground, he makes no argument and cites to no authority to undermine either of the two agency findings described above.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Cf. Doe v. Moore, </em>410 F.3d 1337, 1349 n. 10 (11th Cir.2005) (\u201cOn appeal, we require appellants to not only state their contentions to us, but also to give \u2018the reasons for them, with citations to the authorities and parts of the record on which the appellant re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>lies.\u2019 \u201d (quoting Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9)(A))). In light of this shortcoming, we cannot conclude that the agency erred when it determined Caso-Giraldo had not demonstrated that there was a clear probability that he would be persecuted or tortured upon his return to Peru.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">For these reasons, we deny the petition for review in part and dismiss in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">PETITION DENIED IN PART; DISMISSED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b542-7\">. The one case to which Caso-Giraldo cites to support his position deals with another statutory provision. As discussed above, \u00a7 1255(e) governs Caso-Giraldo's request for adjustment of status. In fact, Caso-Giraldo noted in his own filings before the BIA that \u00a7 1255(e)(3)\u2019s good faith exception controlled, and that the record must demonstrate through \" \u2018clear and convincing evidence\u2019 that the marriage was entered into in good faith.\u201d (Br. Supp. Appeal 8-9 (quoting 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(e)(2), (3)).)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b544-4\">. Caso-Giraldo\u2019s does contend that the IJ evaluated only his asylum claim and erred by \"wholly failing] to consider the Petitioner's claim under withholding of removal.\u201d However, this statement is not accurate. The IJ concluded that because Caso-Giraldo had not even established the less stringent asylum standard, he could not satisfy the burden associated with an application to withhold removal. <em>See Rodriguez Morales, </em>488 F.3d at 891 (\"[A]n alien unable to prove a \u2018well-founded fear' of persecution based on a protected ground, as required for asylum relief, necessarily fails to demonstrate a 'clear probability of persecution,' the 'standard applicable to a claim for withholding of removal.\u2019 \" (quoting <em>Ruiz, </em>479 F.3d at 764)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b544-5\">. Caso-Giraldo testified that he was the victim of death threats and an attempted abduction, during which his car was boxed in and there \"was some crossfire\u201d before his trained driver thwarted the attempted abduction. (Admin.R.209.) We have held that if a petitioner is able to establish the requisite connection between a statutorily protected ground and a murder attempt, the petitioner might establish persecution for the purposes of an asylum application. <em>See Sanchez Jimenez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>492 F.3d 1223, 1228 (11th Cir.2007) (concluding that the record compelled the conclusion that petitioner suffered persecution when the petitioner testified that he had received repeated death threats, reported these threats to government security forces, was told that he was a \"military target\u201d (an indication that he and his family had been marked for death), a kidnaping attempt had been made on his daughter, and two armed men in masks followed him from a political associate\u2019s home and shot at his him while he was driving); <em>cf. Silva, </em>448 F.3d at 1238; <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231. As noted above, however, Caso-Giraldo\u2019s petition before this Court makes no argument as to the IJ\u2019s finding \"that what [Caso-Giraldo] encountered in the aggregate ... [does not] rise to the level of persecution.\u201d We therefore express no opinion as to whether the facts of this case compel the same conclusion as <em>Sanchez Jimenez.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
