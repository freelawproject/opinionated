A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"AL4\">The central issue in this matrimonial suit involves the defendant-wife\u2019s proposed removal from Wyckoff to Manhattan of the two children of the marriage, boys now of the ages of about 15 and 9 years respectively,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>for a limited period while she pursues graduate study there at the New School for Social Research leading to a master\u2019s degree in health services administration.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">The record before us discloses that the parties were married in 1960, separated in 1975, and divorced in 1977 on \u201cno-fault\u201d grounds. In accord with their \u201cSettlement Agreement,\u201d custody of the children was awarded to the wife, and the terms of the agreement were incorporated hy reference in the judgment of divorce. Other pertinent provisions of the agreement include: the grant of visitation rights to plaintiff-husband; provision for the support and maintenance of the wife<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and children, recognizing therein the possibility that the wife might he accepted in the New School graduate program in public health administration; and allowing the wife to continue to reside in the marital residence in Wy-ckoif. The wife was to pay all costs and charges in connection with the upkeep of the premises. Three provisions of the agreement relating to the marital premises became the subject of dispute in conjunction with the wife\u2019s intended temporary relocation in Manhattan while she pursued her graduate study. The relevant text reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-6\">Tlie Husband and Wife are owners, as tenants by the entirety, of residential premises known as 350 Monroe Avenue, Wyckoff, New Jersey. The Wife may continue to reside in said premises until the parties may mutually agree, in writing, which agreement shall not be unreasonably withheld; or until the youngest child of the mar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>riage then living reaches the age of 18 years, or the Wife remarries, whichever shall first occur. At said time, the parties agree that they will cooperate <em>to </em>effect a sale of the <em>property </em>at a reasonable price, and shall execute all such deeds or other instruments as are necessary to effect such sale. * * * [Par. 4.2]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-4\">The Husband and Wife are hereby given, at any time, the first option to purchase the other\u2019s interest in the marital premises, at a price to be determined by an independent appraisal of the premises, less the parties\u2019 joint responsibilities in the mortgages, indentures and. closing costs then secured against the marital premises. [Par. 4.3]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-5\"><em>* </em>^ * <em>+ </em>*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-6\">The Wife represents that she will maintain the marital premises and not allow waste during the period of joint ownership with the Husband, and she shall have all right, title and interest in and to any rents received from said marital premises during her period of occupancy. [Par. 4.6]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">Subsequently, Mrs. Middlekauff was accepted into the New School graduate program. To help finance her studies and enable her \u201cto keep closer track of what the boys are. doing\u201d she began making arrangements to rent out the Wy-ckoff residence for a term of two years and move with the children into an apartment in a housing complex in Manhattan on Second Avenue between 26th and 29th Streets. The older son was accepted at Stuyvesant High School, which is within walking distance of the apartment, and the younger son was to attend' a neighborhood elementary school. However, on plaintiff\u2019s motion, and after a hearing, the trial judge found that although the children \u201ccould be supervised * * * while [defendant is] in school\u201d and \u201cthe area that she contends [sic] to move into is a fine area,\u201d to allow her to rent out the Wyckoff residence and temporarily move to Manhattan with the children would frustrate the intent of the parties as expressed in their settlement agreement \u201cwhere they agreed that she should reside in * * * the residence * * * with the children, until one of the contingencies in [paragraph] 4.6 materializes.\u201d By an order of July 18, 1977 he, accordingly, enjoined defendant \u201cfrom removing herself from the jurisdiction\u201d of the court \u201cunder any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>circumstances,\u201d without the court\u2019s approval or order, and restrained her \u201cfrom renting the marital premises.\u201d He also denied her cross-motion \u201cfor payment of her counsel fees on account of plaintiff\u2019s motion,\u201d as well as plaintiff\u2019s application for temporary custody of the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\">Mrs. Middlekauff appealed from the provisions of the order that were adverse to her and applied to this court for emergent relief \u201cdissolving the restraint\u201d against removing herself from the court\u2019s jurisdiction. On August 12, 1977 this court disposed of that application hy, in effect, lifting the restraint against her leaving New Jersey, but providing that the children could not be removed from the State without an order of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">Defendant thereupon obtained an order for a plenary hearing on the issues of: (1) allowing her temporarily to remove the children from the jurisdiction; (2) allowing her to rent or sell the Wyckoff residence \u201cor purchase same from Plaintiff as provided in the Settlement Agreement,\u201d and (3) allowing her counsel fees and costs \u201cfor litigating these issues.\u201d After hearing both parties and a probation officer, another trial judge, although expressing admiration for Mrs. Middlekauff and her ambitions, found that \u201cit was the general intention of the parties that [she] should remain in Wyckoff with the children,\u201d and concluded that it would not be \u201cas conducive to the welfare of the children\u201d for them to live in Manhattan as it would be for them to remain where they were. He announced that he would \u201csign an order directing Mrs. Middlekauff to remain in Wyckoff.\u201d He subsequently ordered that (1) \u201cthe August 12, 1977 Order of the Appellate Division shall remain in force until further order of the Court\u201d; (2) in addition to the sums paid by plaintiff to defendant pursuant to the settlement agreement \u201cPlaintiff shall pay to Defendant $50.00 per month as reimbursement for her transportation expenses to her graduate training and the full amount of the second mortgage on the [marital] premises\u201d in Wyckoff \u201cwhich presently is $112.00 per month,\u201d and (3) \u201cPlaintiff shall provide a used car for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>Defendant which shall be not later than a 1972 model with a one-year warranty.\u201d Defendant thereupon filed an amended notice of appeal bringing up for review the July, 1977 restraint on her renting out the Wyekoff premises and denial of her application for counsel fees, and additionally, the restraint on her removal of the children to Manhattan for the period of her graduate study at the New School for Social Research.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">We direct our attention first to the trial court\u2019s restraint on defendant\u2019s renting out the Wyekoff premises. In each of the two post-divorce proceedings, <em>i. e., </em>at the hearing on plaintiff\u2019s motion and at the later plenary hearing, the trial judge found that the parties had intended by their settlement agreement to restrict Mrs. Middlekauff\u2019s and the children\u2019s residence to the Wyekoff marital premises. The trial judge at the earlier hearing additionally expressed the <em>feeling </em>that by paragraph 4.6 of the agreement, above quoted, the parties intended to permit only short-term rentals, such as might be needed to finance a vacation. As we previously indicated, the trial judge at the plenary hearing found a \u201cgeneral intention of the parties that Mrs. Middlekauff should remain in Wyekoff with the children.\u201d We are thoroughly satisfied that in each instance \u201cthe finding is clearly a mistaken one and so plainly unwarranted that the interests of justice demand intervention and correction <em>* * State v. </em>Johnson, 42 <em>N. J. </em>146, 162 (1964). Here, not only is there a \u201cmanifest lack of inherently credible evidence to support the finding [s],\u201d id., but, to the contrary, the plain terms of the settlement agreement and the testimony of the parties in regard thereto say otherwise. By paragraph 4.6 of the agreement Mrs. Middlekauff undertook to \u201cmaintain the marital premises and not allow waste during the period of joint ownership with the Husband,\u201d and was to have \u201call right, title and interest in and to any rents received from said marital premises during her period of occupancy.\u201d There is nothing in the agreement prohibiting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>the wife from moving out of the Wyekoff residence at any time. Paragraph 4.2 above-quoted provides that she \u201cmay continue to reside in said premises * * *.\u201d Mrs. Middlekauff testified at the plenary hearing that in a preliminary draft of the agreement the clause read, \u201c[T]he wife shall continue to reside\u201d in the premises, but</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-5\">I said no, that isn\u2019t my understanding and I changed the word shall to may so that it would be fairly clear about what I thought we were doing here.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">The settlement agreement does not prevent a temporary renting out of the Wyekoff premises by Mrs. Middlekauff. Nor is any condition imposed requiring the consent of her former husband thereto. Mrs. Middlekauff testified at the plenary hearing that she had no other source of income other than the alimony, and that she needed the rental money to help finance her graduate study and move to Manhattan. At the same hearing Mr. Middlekauff\u2019s testimony regarding his understanding of the rent clause in paragraph 4.6 of the settlement agreement, which he gave at the February 15, 1977 hearing in the divorce proceeding, was read in evidence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He had been asked on cross-examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-7\">Q And the [settlement] agreement also states that if the marital residence is rented for any period of time while your wife has the right tO' occupancy she will have the right to those rents?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">He responded: \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b113-9\">We discern nothing in the settlement agreement to prevent Mrs. Middlekauff from renting out the Wyekoff premises for all or any part of the duration of her graduate studies at the New School, retaining for her benefit all rents received from any rental arrangement. We so hold.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>We further hold that, in the totality of the circumstances disclosed in the record, the trial judge erred in not permitting Mrs. Middlekauff to relocate with the children in Manhattan for the duration of her graduate studies at the New School for Social Research. The single remark made by the trial judge on the subject at the plenary hearing was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-4\">I can\u2019t conceive of that environment in New York City of 27th Street and Second Avenue would be as conducive to the welfare of the children as it is living in one of our Bergen County suburbs, namely Wyekoff. Therefore, for that reason, I will sign an order directing Mrs. Middlekauff to remain in Wyekoff.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">Such a statement and determination are clearly not in keeping with the applicable statutory and decisional law. See <em>N. J. S. A. </em>9:2-2 and <em>D\u2019Onofrio v. D\u2019Onofrio, </em>144 <em>N. J. Super. </em>200 (Ch. Div. 1976), aff\u2019d 144 <em>N. J. Super. </em>352 (App. Div. 1976 )<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">In <em>D\u2019Onof\u00f1o </em>the trial court had before it the issue. of allowing the custodial parent, the defendant mother, to remove her infant children, a boy. of six and a girl of four, to South Carolina for purposes of establishing permanent residency there. The father of the children had obtained a no-fault divorce from <em>Mrs. D\u2019Onofrio </em>by a judgment which granted her custody of the children subject to his right of \u201creasonable visitation.\u201d In granting the mother\u2019s application over the objection of the children\u2019s father. Judge Pressler properly noted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-7\">* * <em>*' </em>when our courts speak of the \u201ccause shown\u201d criterion of <em>N. J. S. A. </em>9:2-2<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> in terms of the best interests and welfare of the child, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>they speak, as a matter <em>oi </em>content, not to the whole range of considerations which must be taken into account in deciding which of the parents shall have custody. They speak rather to one aspect of the child\u2019s welfare, namely his interest in continuing, by appropriate visitation, as reasonable, healthy and affectionate a relationship as possible with the parent with whom he does not reside. [144 <em>N. J. Super. </em>at 205]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">Other -observations by Judge Pressler are particularly pertinent here. Thus,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-6\">The children, after the parents\u2019 divorce or separation, belong to a different family unit then [sic] they did when the parents lived together. The new family unit consists only of the children and the custodial parent, and what is advantageous to that unit as a whole, to each of its members individually and to the way they relate to each other and function together is obviously in the best interests of the children. It is in the context of what is best for that family unit that the precise nature and terms of visitation and changes in visitation by the noncustodial parent must be considered, [at 206]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-7\">is * * s!' * ^ sj:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-8\">The court should not insist that the advantages of the move [out of the jurisdiction] be sacrificed and the opportunity for a better and more comfortable life style for the mother and children be forfeited solely to maintain weekly visitation by the father where reasonable alternative visitation is available and where the advantages of the move are substantial, [at 207]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-10\">It is further clear that a noncustodial parent is perfectly free to remove himself from this jurisdiction despite the continued residency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>here of his children in order to seek opportunities for a better or different life style for himself. And if he does choose to do so, the custodial parent could hardly hope to restrain him from leaving this State on the ground that his removal will either deprive the children of the paternal relationship or depreciate its quality. The custodial parent, who bears the essential burden and responsibility for the children, is clearly entitled to the same option to seek a better life for herself and the children, particularly where the exercise of that option appears to be truly advantageous to their interests and provided that the paternal interest can continue to he accommodated, even if by a different visitation arrangement than theretofore. [at 207-208]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">It is clear from the record before us that Mrs. Middlekauff has convincingly demonstrated the required \u201ccause,\u201d and we are entirely satisfied that her proposed relocation with the children would be best for the post-divorce family unit, and, in the particular circumstances, obviously in the best interests of the children, and accordingly should be allowed. She is a college graduate with a bachelor\u2019s degree in urban studies, embarking .on graduate study to obtain a master\u2019s degree in health services administration in order to obtain appropriate employment. In the present posture of the limited and circumscribed alimony provision of the settlement agreement, she will be constrained to obtain employment within two years, <em>i.e., </em>not later than July 1, 1980, in order to support herself and fulfill her obligations regarding maintenance of the former marital premises. Recognizing this, she decided, after investigation, \u201cthat health services was going to be a very worthwhile and rewarding area to pursue.\u201d Her graduate work at the New School requires her to be at the school two full days and part of a third day each week. Additionally, she will be required to undertake an internship program \u201cto be worked out with a placement officer at school.\u201d She has, with the school\u2019s understanding and consideration, been allowed to arrange a school schedule around the children\u2019s hours, affording her more time to be with them. She testified \u201cif they do continue with the schedule that I saw, I can be out .of school just about the time * * * [the younger son] gets out of school.\u201d In the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>opinion of the probation officer who reported to the trial court, Mrs. Middlekauff approached the relocation with her sons to Manhattan \u201cwith a lot of thought in mind in regard to going to the [N]ew [Sjchool and the area in question.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\">Defendant has no source of income other than the alimony. It appears that the house in Wyckoff can be rented for about $100 a month while the monthly rent on the prospective six-room apartment in Manhattan would be $516, inclusive of utilities. Mrs. Middlekauff points out that she cannot afford the tuition for her graduate training without the addition to her income which she would receive from renting out the Wyckoff house;<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> that \u201cthe cost and the time used in commuting [between Wyckoff and Manhattan] are impossible for [her] to handle,\u201d and that she needs to be home to supervise her children after school.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">The prospective six-room Manhattan apartment includes three bedrooms. Mrs. Middlekauff emphasized that this would allow each of the boys to have his own separate room, thus enabling them \u201cto still maintain the privacy and respect for each other\u2019s space that we have tried to maintain in the [Wyckoff] home.\u201d It is obvious from the record that she planned the proposed relocation with considerable thought and concern for the hoys\u2019 welfare. There are pedestrian malls and children\u2019s play areas within the housing complex. There is a Boys\u2019 Club on 29th Street near the apartment building, with an active program including theatre, workshop, photography, sports, and swimming pool, organized according to age groups. The older son took the competitive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>examination for and was accepted at Stuyvesant High 'School, which is within about 15 minutes\u2019 walking distance from the apartment. The younger son will be attending a a neighborhood elementary school located within 10 to 12 minutes\u2019 walking distance. Mrs. MiddlekaufE also indicated that she had spoken with \u201ca retired woman friend who lives in the corner building\u201d at' the housing complex and who \u201chas volunteered to be available for emergencies for the boys if they need the key or if they need to telephone somebody or anything comes up where they need help.\u201d Although the trial judge spoke to the boys in chambers, he commented that he was \u201cnot going to be too influenced, if at all, by [his] conversation with the two young men.\u201d It is clearly apparent from the record that, as counsel for <em>amici curiae </em>observes, \u201ctheir [the boys\u2019] clear preference was to move with their mother to New York City.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">Mr. MiddlekaufE lives in Wayne Township, a 15-minute drive from the WyckofE home. It takes an additional 45 minutes to get to the proposed Manhattan apartment building. It appears that at the time of the plenary hearing his visitation with the children was on the weekends, <em>i.e., </em>on a Sunday one week and on Saturday and Sunday the next week.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Hopefully, he will be able to make appropriate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>arrangements to accommodate Ms sons even though these visits will entail an additional 45 minute drive each way. Having conditioned Ms payment of alimony upon Mrs. Middlekauff\u2019s continuance in the New School graduate program, he can hardly complain of having to drive to Manhattan on weekends while expecting her to do so several times each week with a resulting loss to the children of many hours of her supervision and companionship.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">In summary, we hold that (1) Mrs. Middlekauff may, in her sole discretion, rent out the Wyckoff premises for all or any part of the duration of her graduate studies at the New School for Social Research, retaining for her benefit all rents received from any rental arrangement; (2) her relocation with the children to Manhattan for the duration of her graduate studies is allowed, the same being, in the totality of the circumstances, best for the post-divorce family unit and in the best interests of the children of the marriage. In light of these holdings, the provision in the September 12, 1977 order of the trial court reqMring plaintiff to pay defendant $50 a month \u201cas reimbursement for her transportation expenses to her graduate training\u201d is terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">The parts of the orders appealed from, as set forth in the amended notice, of appeal dated September 22, 1977, are reversed and the matter is remanded to the trial court for the entry forthwith of an appropriate order consistent with our holdings and determination herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">One additional issue requires our attention.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The trial judge who heard plaintiff\u2019s motion denied Mrs. Middle-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>kauff\u2019s application for a counsel fee \u201con account of\u201d that motion without comment. The trial judge at the post-divorce plenary hearing made no determination on her further application for \u201ccounsel fees and costs for litigating\u201d the issues at that hearing.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-4\">Under our practice, the award of counsel fees and costs in a matrimonial action rests in the discretion of the court. * <em>* </em>* In deciding whether a wife is entitled to counsel fees and costs, our courts focus on several factors, including the wife\u2019s need, the husband\u2019s financial ability to pay and the wife\u2019s good faith in instituting or defending the action. * !h *' Those factors being met, it is the policy of our law that counsel fees and costs in matrimonial actions are properly the obligation of the husband and he should be compelled to furnish them to the wife.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ad0\"><em>[Williams v. Williams, </em>59 <em>N. J. </em>229, 233 (1971)]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">See also, <em>Lavene v. Lavene, </em>148 N. <em>J. Super. </em>267, 276-277 (App. Div. 1977), certif. den. 75 N. <em>J. </em>28 (1977). It is obvious from our discussion of the issues that Mrs. Middlekauff acted entirely in good faith in defending against plaintiff\u2019s motion and in applying for the subsequent plenary hearing and litigating the issues thereat. However, neither trial judge made any finding as to Mrs. Middlekauff\u2019s need or her former husband\u2019s financial ability to pay. The issue of counsel fees and costs will, accordingly, be remanded to the trial court for .its further consideration, the trial judge to support his determination with express findings as to the respective need of defendant and financial ability of plaintiff. We do not retain jurisdiction in regard thereto. Defendant\u2019s application for counsel fees and costs on this appeal will be determined on appropriate motion therefor.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b108-12\">The record does not indicate the dates of birth of the children.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b109-7\">The payment to the wife \u201cof $1,083.00 per month as alimony [to] continue until the Wife\u2019s remarriage, her death, or until July 1, 1980, whichever event shall first occur; provided that the Wife is accepted and continues in the New School masters or its equivalent program for a graduate degree in Public Health Administration.\u201d [Par. 2.1].</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-8\">Upon the occurrence of any of the above referred to events, the Husband\u2019s obligation for alimony as set forth in paragraph 2.1 hereof shall cease, and he shall thereafter pay to the Wife, on the 1st day of each month, the sum of $300.00 per month per child, for the support and maintenance of the two children of the marriage, until their emancipation as hereinafter defined.
