Mezvrishvili credibly testified to instances of abuse on account of his belief as a Jehovah\u2019s Witness, but the Immigration Judge found that Mezvrishvili lacked adequate knowledge about or commitment to that faith and denied Mezvrishvili\u2019s application for asylum. Mezvrishvili petitions for review of a decision of the BIA, which cryptically discounted the finding of the Immigration Judge that Mezvrishvili lacked sufficient religious knowledge, but affirmed the order of the Immigration Judge. ' Because the BIA and the Immigration Judge failed to give reasoned consideration to Mezvrishvili\u2019s application and make adequate findings, we grant the petition for review, vacate the decisions of the BIA and the Immigration Judge, and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1344-4\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1344-5\">On April 13, 2002, Mezvrishvili arrived at Miami International Airport in route to Nicaragua from the Republic of Georgia. He requested asylum in the United States and was found to have a credible fear of persecution. On April 23, 2003, Mez-vrishvili filed his application for asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b1344-6\">At a hearing before the Immigration Judge on September 20, 2004, Mezvrishvili testified that he became a Jehovah\u2019s Witness in February 2000 and had been persecuted in the Republic of Georgia because of his religion. Mezvrishvili testified that, in August 2000, an official denied Mez-vrishvili\u2019s application for a job as an investigator with the Georgian police and told Mezvrishvili that he had been rejected because of his religious affiliation. In September 2000, Mezvrishvili and a group of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses were on buses headed to a large meeting of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses and were stopped by police in civilian clothes who broke the windows of the buses and beat and stoned individuals, including Mezvrishvili. In November 2000, people in civilian clothes accosted Mezvrishvili and a group of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses at the entrance to a Jehovah\u2019s Witness meeting place, seized all the religious literature carried by the group, and physically and verbally abused <em>the group. In March </em>2001, two uniformed Georgian police officers took Mezvrishvili from in front of his apartment to a location outside of the city and beat him for 15 to 20 minutes. The officers told Mezvrishvili that he was beaten because he was a Jehovah\u2019s Witness, instructed him not to report the beating, and left him alone outside the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b1344-8\">Mezvrishvili testified that, after he arrived in the United States, he attended Kingdom Hall about 20 times, but had not attended since February 2004, could not name any of the leaders of his Kingdom Hall, and had not been baptized. Mez-vrishvili provided no documents in support of his application for asylum, although the Immigration Judge considered a Country Report and a Religious Freedom Report prepared by the U.S. State Department, both of which described persecution of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses in the Republic of Georgia. The Immigration Judge asked Mezvrishvili fifty-nine questions about the religious doctrine of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses and determined that Mezvrishvili had only \u201csome rudimentary knowledge of the theology of the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1344-9\">The Immigration Judge denied Mez-vrishvili\u2019s application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture. The Immigration Judge found Mezvrishvili to be credible and to have described \u201cabuse ... sufficient to be prosecutory [sic] in nature,\u201d but found that Mezvrishvili \u201cha[d] not met his burden to present a preponderance of credible probative evidence to establish that he is in fact an individual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1295\">*1295</page-number>who adopted the Jehovah\u2019s Witness faith in his homeland of Georgia and suffered in that country as a result.\u201d The Immigration Judge \u201cd[id] not view [Mezvrishvi-li] as adequately possessed of fundamental knowledge regarding the denomination to be an individual who for four and a half years ha[d] been a student of the denomination\u201d and noted Mezvrishvili\u2019s \u201cfailure to provide any corroboration whatsoever regarding his proclaimed attendance at Kingdom Hall after his arrival in [the United States].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1345-5\">Mezvrishvili appealed the decision of the Immigration Judge to the BIA, and the BIA adopted and affirmed the decision of the Immigration Judge, although it noted that it \u201cagree[d] with [Mezvrishvili\u2019s] argument on appeal that he should not be held to western standards of religious knowledge.\u201d On June 1, 2006, we denied Mez-vrishvili\u2019s motion to stay his removal, but this appeal continues unabated. <em>See Weng v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>287 F.3d 1335, 1337 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b1345-6\">II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b1345-7\">We review the decision of the BIA and the decision of the Immigration Judge, to the extent it has been adopted by the BIA. <em>Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). We review legal issues <em>de novo, Mohammed v. Ashcroft, </em>261 F.3d 1244, 1247-48 (11th Cir.2001), and \u201cadministrative fact findings under the highly deferential substantial evidence test,\u201d <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1026 (11th Cir.2004) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>544 U.S. 1035, 125 S.Ct. 2245, 161 L.Ed.2d 1063 (2005). When the BIA or the Immigration Judge has failed to \u201cgive \u2018reasoned consideration\u2019 \u201d or \u201cmake \u2018adequate findings,\u2019 \u201d <em>Tan v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>446 F.3d 1369, 1375 (11th Cir.2006) (quoting <em>Morales v. INS, </em>208 F.3d 323, 328 (1st Cir.2000)), we remand for further proceedings because we are \u201cunable to review\u201d the decision, <em>id. </em>at 1377.</p>\n<p id=\"b1345-9\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1345-10\">Mezvrishvili presents two main arguments in his petition for review. First, Mezvrishvili argues that the Immigration Judge erroneously found that he failed to establish past persecution on a statutorily protected ground. Second, Mezvrishvili argues that the Immigration Judge violated his right to due process because the Immigration Judge relied on facts not supported by the record and failed to ask Mezvrishvili why corroborating documents had not been produced. Because we conclude that the BIA and the Immigration Judge failed to render a reasoned decision as to whether Mezvrishvili suffered past persecution on a statutorily protected ground, and vacate the decisions of the BIA and the Immigration Judge, we do not reach Mezvrishvili\u2019s due process argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b1345-11\">\u201cTo establish asylum based on past persecution, the applicant must prove (1) that she was persecuted, and (2) that the persecution was on account of a protected ground,\u201d <em>Silva v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>448 F.3d 1229, 1236 (11th Cir.2006), such as religion, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). Mezvrishvili argues that he established past persecution on account of his religion through his credible testimony about the individuals who assaulted him because he was a Jehovah\u2019s Witness. The problem with our evaluation of this argument comes when we attempt to review the decisions of the BIA and the Immigration Judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1345-12\">The BIA and the Immigration Judge did not give reasoned consideration to Mez-vrishvili\u2019s application or make adequate findings for at least three reasons. First, the BIA did not coherently explain the extent to which it adopted the decision of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1296\">*1296</page-number>the Immigration Judge. The BIA \u201cagree[d] with [Mezvrishvilfs] argument on appeal that [Mezvrishvili] should not be held to western standards of religious knowledge,\u201d but did not articulate whether or how its agreement limited its adoption of the decision of the Immigration Judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1346-4\">Second, after the Immigration Judge found Mezvrishvili\u2019s testimony about beatings and other abuse credible, the Immigration Judge failed to offer a reasonable explanation as to why he found that Mez-vrishvili had not \u201cadopted the Jehovah\u2019s Witness faith in his homeland of Georgia and suffered in that country as a result.\u201d The Immigration Judge did not make a \u201cclean\u201d adverse credibility determination, <em>Yang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>418 F.3d 1198, 1201 (11th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks omitted), and relied instead on his view that Mezvrishvili had exhibited insufficient commitment to the faith while in the United States and had insufficient knowledge of the religious doctrine of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses. This explanation is unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1346-5\">The issue to be decided in the asylum hearing is whether the applicant suffered religious persecution, not whether he displays the knowledge of a seminarian during a \u201cmini-catechism administered at the hearing.\u201d <em>Yan v. Gonzales, </em>438 F.3d 1249, 1255 (10th Cir.2006). \u201c[Detailed knowledge of [religious] doctrine may be irrelevant to the sincerity of an applicant\u2019s belief [because] a recent convert may well lack detailed knowledge of religious custom,\u201d <em>id. </em>(citing <em>Ahmadshah v. Ashcroft, </em>396 F.3d 917, 920 n. 2 (8th Cir.2005)), and \u201cmany deeply religious people know very little about the origins, doctrines, or even observances of their faith,\u201d <em>Iao v. Gonzales, </em>400 F.3d 530, 534 (7th Cir.2005). Because an asylum applicant must establish that \u201cthe persecution was <em>on account of </em>a protected ground,\u201d <em>Silva, </em>448 F.3d at 1236 (emphasis added), \u201ceven an individual who does <em>not </em>subscribe to a certain religion, but is nonetheless ... persecuted on account of others\u2019 perception that he does, may well be able to establish a religious persecution claim under a theory of \u2018imputed religion\u2019 analogous to the \u2018imputed political opinion\u2019 theory,\u201d <em>Rizal v. Gonzales, </em>442 F.3d 84, 90 n. 7 (2d Cir.2006). <em>See Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1289 (discussing imputed political opinion theory).</p>\n<p id=\"b1346-7\">Mezvrishvili\u2019s commitment to the Jehovah\u2019s Witness faith while in this country and whether he adopted that faith in his homeland of Georgia show little about whether he suffered in Georgia on account of his religion. \u201cBoth history and common sense make amply clear that people can identify with a certain religion, notwithstanding their lack of detailed knowledge about that religion\u2019s doctrinal tenets, and that those same people can be persecuted for their religious affiliation.\u201d <em>Rizal, </em>442 F.3d at 90; <em>see also Ahmadshah, </em>396 F.3d at 920 n. 2 (\u201cIf [petitioner] has shown that [his would-be persecutors] would believe that he was [of a particular religion], that is sufficient basis for fear of persecution under the law.\u201d). \u201cThis is not to say that questions about religious doctrine are never relevant in assessing an asylum applicant\u2019s credibility in claiming religious persecution,\u201d <em>Rizal, </em>442 F.3d at 90, because \u201ca purported Christian who didn\u2019t know who Jesus Christ was, or a purported Jew who had never heard of Moses, would be instantly suspect,\u201d <em>Iao, </em>400 F.3d at 534, but the Immigration Judge did not make an adverse credibility finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1346-8\">Third, the Immigration Judge assumed facts not in the record when he held Mez-vrishvili to a level of religious devotion that Mezvrishvili did not assert. The Immigration Judge found that Mezvrishvili\u2019s actions while in the United States were \u201cinconsistent with a strong commitment to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1297\">*1297</page-number>[the Jehovah\u2019s Witness] faith\u201d and that Mezvrishvili\u2019s \u201crudimentary knowledge of the theology of the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses\u201d was inconsistent with four and a half years of \u201creading and studying the denomination\u2019s principals and beliefs.\u201d The record shows that Mezvrishvili testified that he had been a follower of the Jehovah\u2019s Witness faith for four and a half years and had read some literature on his own, but contains no evidence that Mezvrishvili had represented that he had a strong commitment to the faith or that he had undertaken four and a half years of active study.</p>\n<p id=\"b1347-5\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1347-6\">Because the BIA and the Immigration Judge failed to render a reasoned decision in consideration of Mezvrishvili\u2019s credible testimony, we are unable to review the denial of Mezvrishvili\u2019s application for asylum. We GRANT Mezvrishvili\u2019s petition for review, VACATE the decisions of the BIA and the Immigration Judge, and REMAND for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
