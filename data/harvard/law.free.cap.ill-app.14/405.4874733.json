On the trial of this cause, which was a suit brought on the note, a judgment was rendered against plaintiff in error for the full amount of the note and interest thereon, notwithstanding the undisputed fact, as it appears by the record, that before the suit was commenced, defendants in error had taken possession of the mortgaged property, sold it under the mortgage, and bought it themselves at the sale for the sum of $695. Plaintiff in error claimed the benefit- of this credit on the trial of the cause and was entitled to it under the pleadings and proofs, and no good reason is shown why it was not allowed him.</p> <p id=\"b400-8\" pgmap=\"400\">The plea of usury was not sustained.
