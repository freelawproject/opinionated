Thomas F. Wheeler.</parties><headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b106-10\" pgmap=\"106\">1. Hearsay evidence. \u2014 Appellee was occupying a lower floor of a building of which appellant occupied the entire upper floor. Appellee sued appellant for an injury to goods caused by an overflow of water from a water-closet in appellant\u2019s store. The statements of appellant\u2019s porter-as to his having found the soil pipe to the water-closet stopped up with paper when he returned from church on the night of the overflow, and how he removed it, were admitted in evidence on behalf of appellee. Held, that these statements were inadmissible, being mere hearsay evidence, since the porter was in the performance of no act in the course of his employment by appellant at the time of the declarations made by him, and they were the statements of a past occurrence resting entirely upon the credit of the person making them.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b106-11\" pgmap=\"106\">2. Questions pertinent to the issue. \u2014 Where it was averred in the declaration and shown by the evidence that appellee, suing appellant for an injury to goods from an overflow of water, occupied the store jointly with a company who were dealers in the same kind of goods as appellee, and that the company had an agent in charge of the goods, and appellee in his examination in chief testified in a general way that he owned part of the goods and held a part for other parties. Held, that appellant\u2019s counsel had a right to cross-examine him on the matter of ownership. Where questions put and excluded are pertinent to the point in issue, the court is bound to assume that the evidence called for would have been material.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b107-3\" pgmap=\"107\">3.

Holl\u00edn S. Williamson, Judge, presiding.</summary><decisiondate data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AuJ\" pgmap=\"107\">Opinion filed December 21, 1883.</decisiondate><summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b107-6\" pgmap=\"107(261) 108(262)\">The appellee, Wheeler, on and before Hov. 30, 1882, was in the occupation of-the lower floor of store Ho. 203 Lake street, Chicago, and carrying on there the business of leather merchant, having a stock of leather goods in said store, while the appellant corporation occupied the entire floor above appellee\u2019s store for its business, both parties holding separately as tenants of the same landlord. There was a water-closet in appellant\u2019s store, over that of appellee, which was under the care, control and management of appellant; and some time after appellee\u2019s store was closed on said 30th of Hovember, and during the night of that day, there was an overflow from said closet, and the water ran down into appellee\u2019s store and upon the leather there, doing damage to a portion of it. This action was brought by appellee, Wheeler, against the appellant, to recover the damage so sustained, on the ground that it was the result of negligence on the part of the appellan t, its agent and servant, in the care and management of said water-closet. On the trial under the general issue, the plaintiff gave evidence tending to show the situation and occupation of the premises of the respective parties. The plaintiff, as a witness in his own behalf, testified that the Eagle Tanning Works occupied the lower floor jointly with him; that it had goods there, and an agent of the name of McConnell in charge; that he, plaintiff, was connected with the Eagle Tanning Works Company, and was a stockholder therein, but that his business was separate from that of the company. The witness testified that the water ran on to thirty or forty thousand dollars worth of property, and that the water did damage to his leather to the amount of $2,076.56. On cross-examination by defendant\u2019s counsel, the witness said he was the owner of most of the property; some of it he was selling for other people. The witness was then asked to state what he owned and what belonged to somebody else. To this inquiry, the plaintiff\u2019s counsel objected, the court sustained the objection, and defendant\u2019s counsel excepted. The witness was then asked to state what part of the property was his own absolute property. This was objected to in like manner, the objection sustained by the court and exception by plaintiff. The court permitted one Clark, a private watchman belonging to Pinkerton\u2019s force, to testify that about half past twelve o\u2019clock of the night in question lie went to the street door of the stairs leading up to defendant\u2019s store, and called up the colored porter; that the latcer told witness that when he (the porter) came back from church that evening \u2014 that night, that he caught the water running over the floor, as the soil pipe was stopped up with paper, and he got an umbrella cane, and poked the paper down through the soil pipe. The defendant\u2019s counsel objected to the witness telling what the porter said; but the court overruled the objection, and exception by defendant was duly taken.</summary><summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b108-5\" pgmap=\"108\">The court permitted the plaintiff\u2019s counsel to introduce in evidence the lease between the defendant and its landlord, which contained stringent covenants on the part of the defendant as to repairs. This was also objected to by defendant, and exception duly taken.' The jury found the defendant guilty, and assessed plaintiff\u2019s damages at $2,076.56, for which judgment passed, and defendant brings the record to this court.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b108-6\" pgmap=\"108\">Mr. Sidney Thomas and Mr. O. 0.

J.</author> <p id=\"ALY\" pgmap=\"110(77) 111(68)\">The damages which the plaintiff would be entitled to recover in respect of the injury complained of would be limited to such as were proximately consequent upon an injury to goods in which he had some property, either absolute, special or qualified, or goods which he had in charge under such circumstances or relations, as that he would be legally accountable to some third party. The circumstance alone that the goods alleged to have been injured were there in the store of which he was an occupant, would not raise a prima facie presumption of property in him because it was averred in the declaration and shown by the evidence that he occupied the store jointly with the Eagle Tanning Works Company, dealers in the same kind of goods, and that they had an agent, Mr. McConnell, in charge of them.</p> <p id=\"b111-4\" pgmap=\"111\">The plaintiff, in his examination in chief, testified in a general way, that he owned part of the goods in question, and held a part for other parties. Whereupon the defendant\u2019s counsel innocently supposing that this case was in no wise different from others, and that the defendant was not conclusively bound by what the plaintiff had stated upon these points in his direct examination, proceeded to cross-examine him on the matter, when, upon objection of plaintiff\u2019s counsel, the court stopped the inquiry and excluded the evidence.</p> <p id=\"b111-5\" pgmap=\"111\">It is obvious, from this bare statement, that such ruling was erroneous. It might have turned out when the plaintiff was brought close down to particular facts, that he was the owner of a very small portion of the goods, and that as to those of which in a general way he had claimed to be bailee, there was no bailment at all so far as he was concerned; that they belonged to the Eagle Tanning Works Company, and were at that time in the custody of their agent, McConnell.</p> <p id=\"b111-6\" pgmap=\"111\">It is enough, however, that the questions put and excluded were pertinent to a point in issue in which case the court is bound to assume that the evidence called for would have been material. 2 Phil. on Ev., Cowen, Hills &amp; E.\u2019s Notes, p. 903; Halsey v. Jarvis, 7 Bosw. 461.</p> <p id=\"b111-7\" pgmap=\"111(107) 112(114)\">The admission in evidence on behalf of the plaintiff, of the statements made by the defendant\u2019s porter as to his having found the soil pipe to the water-closet stopped up with paper when he returned from church, and how he removed it, was manifestly improper. The porter was in the performance of no act in the course of his employment by the defendant, at the time of the declaration made by him. The injury, the principal event, was completed. They were the statements of a past occurrence, and resting entirely upon the credit of the person making them. They can not be regarded as a part of the res gestae, but must be taken as mere hearsay evidence. The porter should have been called as a witness. But it was urged by appellee\u2019s counsel that this evidence was not objected to by defendant in apt time. The answer to that is, that the presiding judge has certified in the bill of exceptions, that to the admission of that evidence, the defendant\u2019s counsel then and there duly excepted. Besides, it appears from the record that defendant\u2019s counsel was prevented from moving to strike it out or to exclude it, by the court saying he should let it stand, and would not change his ruling if the plaintiff wanted it to stay there.</p> <p id=\"b112-5\" pgmap=\"112\">We are of opinion that the court erred in admitting in evidence against the defendant\u2019s objections, the lease between the Couch estate as lessor, and the defendant as lessee of the premises occupied by the defendant, and in which the water-closet in question was located. The plaintiff was no party to such instrument, and therefore no legal duty could arise, on the part of the defendant, toward the plaintiff, from that instrument 'or any covenants contained in it, since the only duties or obligations thereby imposed or created, were solely to the lessor.</p> <p id=\"b112-6\" pgmap=\"112\">It was not required to show the extent of the defendant\u2019s possession, because that was obvious and well understood. It is a general rule of law that the occupant of premises is responsible for injuries received in consequence of a failure to keep them in repair. Gridley v. City of Bloomington, 68 Ill. 47.</p> <p id=\"b112-7\" pgmap=\"112\">To admit the lease in evidence, was simply the admission of irrelevant testimony, calculated to confuse and mislead the jury. Notwithstanding its irrelevancy, the lease was alluded to in the instructions for the plaintiff as a substantive element in the case. Other points for reversal have been made and discussed by appellant\u2019s counsel, but which we do not deem it necessary to consider. Bor the errors pointed out, as above, the judgment of the court below will be reversed and the cause remanded for a new trial.</p> <p id=\"b112-8\" pgmap=\"112\">Judgment reversed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
