Prior to the construction of the viaduct, appellee, being the owner of lots having a frontage of about 150 \u2022 feet on Polk street and 200 feet on Beach street, erected and fitted up at large expense, buildings for manufacturing linseed oil. The machinery, consisting of heavy presses resting on massive foundation, large tanks, steam engine boilers and other fixtures, was placed in the first or lower story of the building. In 1881, the city constructed a viaduct on Polk street over Beach street, the east approach of which was directly in front of appellee\u2019s building, and consisted of a solid embankment of earth and stone, the full width of the street, and about fourteen feet in height, thereby cutting off the light and means of access from Polk street to the main floor of the building.</summary><summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b114-4\" pgmap=\"114\">Upon the trial, the court, against the objection of appellant, admitted in evidence an ordinance of the city, granting permission to the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Company to construct and operate railroad tracks between West Harrison and West Twelfth streets. Sections three and four of the ordinance are as follows:</summary><summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b114-5\" pgmap=\"114(319) 115(82)\">\u201cSec. 3.

Provided, however, that when any such viaduct, except said Polk street viaduct above provided for, can not be constructed across the tracks of said railroad company, without crossing the track or tracks of some other railroad company or companies, the said Chicago, Burlington, and Quincy Railroad Company, shall only be obliged to join such other railroad company or companies in paying the expense of erecting, constructing, maintaining and keeping in repair such viaduct and approaches, and to pay its fair proportion of such expense as between it and such other company or companies; and if such other railroad company or companies shall not join said Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad Company in paying said expense, then, when the proportion of said other company or companies shall be otherwise provided, the said Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad Company shall pay what would be its fair proportion of said expense, in case such other company or companies should join with it in the payment of said expense as aforesaid.</summary><summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b115-4\" pgmap=\"115\">\u201c Said viaduct or viaducts, and approaches thereto, to be constructed according to the plans and specifications of the department of public works.

The ordinance was in effect merely a license or permit from the city to the railroad company, (not a party to the suit) to construct its tracks in Beach street, upon certain specified conditions to be performed by the company. Appellee was neither party nor privy to it, and was not bound by any of its terms or conditions. It was claimed, however, by appellee upon the trial, that it was important to its rights to fix the time when certain of the railroad tracks crossing Polk street, immediately west of appellee\u2019s property, had been laid prior to the construction of the viaduct, the argument being that the greater the number of tracks before the construction of the viaduct, the greater the damage occasioned thereby to appellee\u2019s property, and consequently the smaller the damage resulting to appellee\u2019s property from its construction; and that for the purpose of fixing the dates when the tracks were laid, and to show that a witness previously called by the city was mistaken as to the time stated by him, the ordinance became pertinent evidence. The court, against the objection and exception of the defendant, admitted the entire ordinance in evidence, and subsequently, against a like objection and exception, permitted appellee\u2019s counsel to call the'attention of the jury to the fact that the city was indemnified by the ordinance, and that the railroad company would have to pay whatever damages the jury might find. In this, we think there was prejudicial error. Whether the city was indemnified or not was wholly immaterial, either to the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action or to the amount of damages to which it was entitled. To argue to the jury that the city was indemnified by the railroad company, so that whatever damages they should award would not come out of the tax-payers, but would have to be paid by the railroad company, was to present to their minds an improper consideration. Its inevitable tendency was to make them (to say the least) less circumspect in estimating the actual loss occasioned by the injury complained of.</p> <p id=\"b118-5\" pgmap=\"118(153) 119(147)\">It is true the court, at the request of the defendant, instructed the jury that they should disregard the evidence as ' to the liability of the railroad company. This was perhaps a technical correction of the evil, but we can not say it was effectual to wholly cure it. An impression once created in the mind is not easily removed. We may close the door after looking out upon a beautiful landscape, but we do not thereby shut out the landscape. The vision still remains, photographed upon the tablet of the brain. The jury could not forget when considering of their verdict that it was the railroad company and not the city that was to pay the damages; and it is a reasonable inference that this consideration had its influence in their deliberations. For the purpose for which the ordinance was professedly offered, namely, to fix a date, it was not necessary that the entire ordinance should have been introduced. Section 4, which contained the indemnity clause, was separate and distinct from the other pro visions, and conceding that the ordinance furnished competent evidence as to the alleged date, it was only necessary and only admissible to introduce such parts of it as were sufficient to show the date. But even if the entire ordinance were admissible, it was wholly improper for the counsel to comment upon the indemnity clause. The court properly instructed the jury to disregard the evidence on that subject, and for the same reason should have interposed to prevent the evidence from being discussed. We can not say that justice has been done in this case, because we can not know to what extent the jury were influenced by the testimony improperly admitted and commented upon by counsel.</p> <p id=\"b119-4\" pgmap=\"119\">We are therefore of opinion that a new trial ought to be had, and accordingly reverse the judgment below and remand the case for further proceedings.</p> <p id=\"b119-5\" pgmap=\"119\">Reversed and remanded.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
