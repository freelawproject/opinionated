For the reasons that follow, we hold that absent evidence that the rates were not calculated in accordance with sound actuarial principles, the Superintendent must find that the benefits provided are not unreasonable in relation to the premium charged, and he must approve the rate increase.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">Before discussing the proper application of R.C. 3923.021, however, we must dispose of CMIC\u2019s claim that the court of appeals ought to have granted CMIC\u2019s motion to dismiss the Superintendent\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-9\">First, CMIC argues that the court of appeals lacked subject matter jurisdiction to hear the Superintendent\u2019s appeal because the appeal did not raise \u201c* * * questions of law relating to the constitutionality, construction, or interpretation of statutes and rules of the agency, * * *\u201d as R.C. 119.12 requires. Only when the appeal raises such a question of law may an appellate court review whether the decision below was \u201c* * * supported by any reliable, probative, and substantial evidence in the entire record.\u201d R.C. 119.12; <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Dept. of Indus. Relations </em>(1985), 17 Ohio St. 3d 226, 17 OBR 466, 479 N.E. 2d 254. CMIC maintains that the trial court confined its opinion to a review of the evidence alone, thus precluding the Superintendent\u2019s subsequent appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-11\">We agree with the court of appeals that the trial court considered the proper construction of R.C. 3923.021, as CMIC urged it to do in its trial brief. The trial court interpreted the statute to limit the Superintendent\u2019s discretion to consideration of whether the rate request was prepared within sound actuarial principles. Since construction of a statute is one of the questions of law upon which an agency appeal may be based, the court of appeals correctly denied the motion to dismiss on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-12\">Second, CMIC contends that the court of appeals lacked jurisdiction over the Superintendent\u2019s appeal because CMIC had already begun implementing the higher premium rates at issue before the Superintendent filed his notice of appeal with the court of appeals. CMIC concludes that no justiciable controversy remained for the court of appeals to decide.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-13\">In support of this premise, CMIC cites R.C. 3923.02, which provides in part that \u201c* * * no policy of sickness and accident insurance shall be delivered, issued for delivery, or <em>used </em>in this state * * * until a copy of the form of such policy * * * and of the premium rates * * * has been filed with the superintendent of insurance. * * *\u201d (Emphasis added.) Because CMIC began using the new rates by billing insureds immediately after the trial court ruled in its favor, CMIC argues that the case immediately became moot. The quoted portion of R.C. 3923.02 has no relevance to this issue, however, because the language <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>quoted does not concern approval of rate increases, nor does it confer any rights on insurers who file policies. Instead, the quoted language merely requires insurers to file policies with the Superintendent. Were we to adopt CMIC\u2019s position that mere implementation of new rates strips an appellate court of jurisdiction, we would render the appellate process meaningless.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">The Superintendent obtained a stay of the trial court\u2019s order from the court of appeals, his motion for a stay having been denied by the trial court. App. R. 7(A). When modified, the stay allowed CMIC to implement the rates subject to a refund if the Superintendent won his appeal. The stay protected the interests of both parties, and the refund provision prevented the appeal from being rendered moot. CMIC cites a number of cases in support of the principle that a court should not hear an appeal if the appellee\u2019s lawful accomplishment of the event the appellant wished to prevent has rendered the case moot. See, <em>e.g., State, ex rel. Bd. of Trustees, </em>v. <em>Davis </em>(1982), 2 Ohio St. 3d 108, 2 OBR 658, 443 N.E. 2d 166; <em>Travis </em>v. <em>Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1931), 123 Ohio St. 355, 175 N.E. 586; <em>Pontiac Motor Div., General Motors Corp. </em>v. <em>Motor Vehicle Dealers Bd. </em>(Sept. 15, 1987), Franklin App. No. 87AP-48, unreported. These cases are inapposite here because in <em>none </em>of them did the appellant obtain a stay of execution of the lower court\u2019s order. In <em>Pontiac, </em>the court of appeals dismissed the appeal as moot, but observed that \u201c* * * [h]ad Nassief [the appellant] timely obtained a stay from the common pleas court, a decision by this court on the merits of the case may well have dictated a different result. * * *\u201d The Superintendent filed a motion for a stay of execution in this case a mere eight days after the trial court reversed his order. When the trial court denied the stay, the Superintendent obtained a stay from the court of appeals a couple of days later. Clearly the Superintendent\u2019s effort to stay the execution of the trial court\u2019s judgment was timely. The case is not moot, and we affirm the court of appeals\u2019 refusal to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">Turning now to the merits, we must decide how much discretion R.C. 3923.021 confers on the Superintendent in approving or disapproving rate increases for nongroup health and accident policies. R.C. 3923.021 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">\u201c(B) With respect to any filing, made pursuant to section 3923.02 of the Revised Code, of any premium rates for any individual policy of sickness and accident insurance or for any indorsement or rider pertaining thereto, the superintendent of insurance may, within thirty days after filing:</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">U* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b252-9\">\u201c(2) Set a date for a public hearing to commence no later than forty days after the filing. The superintendent shall give the insurer making the filing twenty days\u2019 written notice of the hearing and shall give such public notice as he considers appropriate. <em>The superintendent, </em>within twenty days after the commencement of a hearing, <em>shall issue a written order, </em>a copy of which shall be mailed to the insurer that has made the filing, <em>either approving such filing if he finds that the benefits provided are not unreasonable in relation to the premium charged, or disapproving such filing if he finds that the benefits provided are unreasonable in relation to the premium charged. </em>This division does not apply to any insurer organized or transacting the business of insurance under Chapter 3907. or 3909. of the Revised Code.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b252-10\">R.C. 3923.021(A) defines the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>phrase \u201cbenefits provided are not unreasonable in relation to the premium charged\u201d:</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">\u201cAs used in this section, \u2018benefits provided are not unreasonable in relation to the premium charged\u2019 means the rates were calculated in accordance with sound actuarial principles.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">CMIC contends that because there was no evidence in the record that the proposed rate increase was not \u201ccalculated in accordance with sound actuarial principles,\u201d the Superintendent was obliged to approve the proposed rate increase. The Superintendent argues, and the court of appeals agreed, that even though the ODI\u2019s own expert actuary, Flieschacker, conceded in the Tillinghast report and at the hearing that the rates were calculated in accordance with sound actuarial principles, the statutory standard of reasonableness in R.C. 3923.021(B) allows the Superintendent to exercise his discretion in deciding whether to approve the proposed increase.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">The Superintendent asserts that R.C. 3923.021(B)(2) states the precise standard for disapproval of a rate filing, <em>i.e., </em>\u201cthat the benefits provided are unreasonable in relation to the premium charged.\u201d The Tillinghast report took exception to the calculation of the CMIC rate increase in a number of areas, amounting to a ten-percent reduction in the proposed increase. The Superintendent based his finding of unreasonableness, and his decision to disapprove the filing, on these exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">The Superintendent would have us read R.C. 3923.021(A) not as a definition, but as providing further meaning to the reasonableness standard of subsection (B). He argues that to read R.C. 3923.021(A) as restricting the meaning of \u201cbenefits provided are not unreasonable in relation to the premium charged\u201d would be to supplant the reasonableness standard of subsection (B) 'with a much narrower standard that was never meant to be a standard at all, but rather a kind of elaboration or additional comment on the reasonableness standard of subsection (B).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-10\">This attempt to downplay R.C. 3923.021(A) through a non-textual approach to defining same is not convincing. The use of the word \u201cmeans\u201d in subsection (A) expresses the legislature\u2019s intent that the phrase \u201ccalculated in accordance with sound actuarial principles\u201d be synonymous with the reasonableness standard of (B). In <em>Montgomery Cty. Bd. of Commrs. </em>v. <em>Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1986), 28 Ohio St. 3d 171, 175, 28 OBR 262, 266, 503 N.E. 2d 167, 170, we took a textual approach to the Revised Code and observed that \u201c[definitions provided by the General Assembly are to be given great deference in deciding the scope of particular terms. * * *\u201d In this case the scope of the reasonableness standard is co-extensive with \u201ccalculated in accordance with sound actuarial principles.\u201d See <em>Ohio Civil Rights Comm. </em>v. <em>Parklawn Manor </em>(1975), 41 Ohio St. 2d 47, 70 O.O. 2d 148, 322 N.E. 2d 642.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-11\">We would stress that our conclusion that the Superintendent\u2019s assessment of the reasonableness of benefits in relation to premiums is limited to a determination of whether the proposed rates were calculated according to sound actuarial principles is consistent with the legislative history of R.C. 3923.021. Until recently, nongroup health insurance was provided by health insurance companies, whose rate increases were and are subject to R.C. 3923.021, and by hospital service associations, whose rate increases were subject to former R.C. 1739.051.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-12\">R.C. 1739.051 was a cost-contain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>ment measure that required hospital service associations to demonstrate, among other things, that they had made a good faith effort to control hospital costs in order for the Superintendent to approve a premium increase. 138 Ohio Laws, Part I, 499, 528-529. The Superintendent could disapprove a rate increase if he found it to be other than \u201clawful, fair and reasonable * * *.\u201d R.C. 1739.051(D). R.C. 1739.01(L) defined a \u201clawful, fair and reasonable\u201d rate as one that is \u201cin accordance with sound actuarial principles\u201d <em>and </em>that \u201creflects a good faith effort * * * to control costs * * 138 Ohio Laws, Part I, 527. R.C. Chapter 1739 was repealed in its entirety in 1987 by Sub. S.B. No. 124. 142 Ohio Laws, Part I, 330. This bill made companies such as CMIC, which were changing over from hospital service associations to mutual insurance organizations, subject to R.C. 3923.021 when they sought rate increases on nongroup health and accident policies. <em>Id. </em>In addition, Sub. S.B. No. 124 amended R.C. 3923.021 by adding present subsections (A) and (D). 142 Ohio Laws, Part I, 373-374.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">The court of appeals accepted the Superintendent\u2019s contention that the reasonableness standard of R.C. 3923.021(B) was not affected when that statute was amended to add current subsection (A). The court reasoned that the requirement of subsection (A) that the rates comport with sound actuarial principles was carried over from R.C. 1739.01(L), where it was not the sole standard for rate increase approval. Thus the court concluded that sound actuarial principles are not the sole criterion now. We disagree. By adding subsection (A) in 1987, the General Assembly unambiguously evinced its intention to explain and restrict the reasonableness standard of R.C. 3923.021(B). When it did so, the legislature substantially narrowed the scope of the Superintendent\u2019s discretion in evaluating nongroup rate increase requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">The General Assembly took the opportunity in enacting Sub. S.B. No. 124 to state in precise terms the exact meaning of the R.C. 3923.021(B) reasonableness standard. That standard, that the rates be calculated in accordance with sound actuarial principles, is the one we must follow. Accordingly, if the proposed rate increase meets that standard, the Superintendent has no authority to object to it in the name of reasonableness.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">Because the record discloses no testimony by any of the expert witnesses that CMIC\u2019s August 8, 1988 rate filing was <em>not </em>calculated in accordance with sound actuarial principles, the trial court was correct in holding that the Superintendent\u2019s order was not supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence. R.C. 119.12; see <em>Miller, supra, </em>at 227, 17 OBR at 466-467, 479 N.E. 2d at 256.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-9\">The court of appeals correctly held that it had subject matter jurisdiction over the Superintendent\u2019s appeal. We reverse the court of appeals on the issue of the scope of the Superintendent\u2019s discretion in disapproving rate increases under R.C. 3923.021 and reinstate the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-10\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed in part and reversed in part.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b254-11\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Douglas, Wright, Bryant and Resnick, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b254-12\">Holmes, J., dissents.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b254-13\">Thomas F.

I must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>respectfully dissent from the judgment of the majority, which ties the hands of the Superintendent of Insurance, strips him of all discretion in approving or disapproving individual sickness and accident policy rates, and shifts such discretion to one or more actuaries or accountants. The so-called \u201ctextual approach\u201d by which the majority reaches this result is unduly narrow, and fails to take into account the entire \u201ctext\u201d of Sub. S.B. No. 124, contrary to well established principles of statutory construction and the specific legislative history of Sub. S.B. No. 124.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\">The Superintendent does <em>not </em>take a \u201cnon-textual\u201d approach to defining the phrase \u201cbenefits provided are unreasonable in relation to the premium charged,\u201d as used in R.C. 3923.021(B). Rather, he argues that this phrase is fully defined <em>in various terms </em>and in <em>various places </em>within R.C. Chapter 3923; <em>i.e., </em>in R.C. 3923.021(A) <em>and </em>3923.33(E) and (K).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">It cannot be denied, and the majority has so stated, that R.C. 3923.021(A) defines the operative phrase here <em>solely </em>in terms of whether \u201cthe rates were calculated in accordance with sound actuarial principles.\u201d It is also clear from the legislative history, as explained by the majority, that \u201creasonable\u201d rates are no longer defined, <em>as a general matter, </em>in terms of whether they reflect \u201ca good faith effort * * * to control costs,\u201d since the repeal of former R.C. 1739.01(L) by Sub. S.B. No. 124.1 thus concur in the majority\u2019s conclusion that the general cost containment analysis undertaken as a prerequisite to the Superintendent\u2019s finding policy rates to be reasonable was not carried over from former R.C. Chapter 1739 into current R.C. 3923.021.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">The analysis does not end at this point, however. R.C. 3923.021 is a general law applicable \u201cto <em>any </em>filing, made pursuant to section 3923.02 of the Revised Code, of <em>any </em>premium rates for <em>any </em>individual policy of sickness and accident insurance * * *.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The Superintendent points out that the <em>specific </em>provisions of R.C. Chapter 3923 relevant to Medicare supplement policies of the type filed by appellant here, R.C. 3923.33, set forth <em>specific </em>requirements for the Superintendent to consider in determining whether such policies \u201creturn to policyholders benefits that are reasonable in relation to the premium charged.\u201d These requirements are contained within R.C. 3923.33(E) and (K), and rules promulgated thereunder. Those statutory' sections provide as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">\u201c(E) Medicare supplement policies shall be expected to return to policyholders benefits that are reasonable in relation to the premium charged. The superintendent shall adopt rules to establish minimum standards for loss ratios of medicare supplement policies on the basis of incurred claims experience and earned premiums for the entire period for which rates are computed to provide coverage and in accordance with accepted actuarial principles and practices. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b255-9\">a* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b255-10\">\u201c(K) The superintendent shall promulgate such additional rules as are necessary in order to meet the requirements set forth in subsection (c) of Public Law 96-265, 42 U.S.C. 1395ss, as amended for federal certification of state regulatory standards.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b255-11\">The court of appeals correctly construed these requirements, stating:</p>\n<p id=\"b256-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>\u201cIt is clear that the foregoing provisions set forth <em>minimum </em>standards which must be met by insurers seeking to market Medicare supplemental insurance policies in Ohio. These sections do not require the superintendent to approve any policy or rate filing that meets these standards, but rather sets forth the standard which must be met as a condition for approval. For example, a given rate may be actuarially sound, but nevertheless unreasonable if it fails to meet the prescribed loss ratio. This construction finds further support in Subchapter XVIII of the Social Security Act regarding supplemental Medicare health insurance policies. See Sections 1395ss(b)(1) and (c), Title 42, U.S. Code.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">The specific . provisions of R.C. 3923.33 conflict with a literal reading of R.C. 3923.021(A), as the former statute requires the Superintendent to promulgate rules ensuring that all Medicare supplemental policies comply with federal law, and <em>in addition, </em>are calculated \u201cin accordance with accepted actuarial principles and practices.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">Given this obvious conflict, it is a fundamental rule of statutory construction that statutes <em>in pari materia, i.e., </em>relating to the same or similar subject matter, shall be read together as if they were a single statute, and construed and applied to render their contents operative and valid, so as to accomplish the manifest purpose of their enactment and give full force and effect to the legislative intent. <em>Cochrel </em>v. <em>Robinson </em>(1925), 113 Ohio St. 526, 149 N.E. 871, paragraph four of the syllabus; <em>Trotwood Trailers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Evatt </em>(1943), 142 Ohio St. 197, 27 O.O. 168, 51 N.E. 2d 645, paragraph one of the syllabus; <em>Meeks </em>v. <em>Papadopulos </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St. 2d 187, 16 O.O. 3d 212, 404 N.E. 2d 159.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-11\">\u201cIt is a settled rule of construction, that the intention of the lawmaker is to be deduced from a view of the whole, and every part of the enactment, taken and compared together. He must be presumed to have intended to be consistent with himself throughout, and at the same time to have intended effect to be given to each and every part of the law. And from this it results, that general language found in one part, is to be modified and restricted in its application, when it would otherwise conflict with specific provisions found in another; and this from the reasonable and almost irresistible conclusion, that when the mind is directed to any particular subject, the language used is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>more likely to express the intention than general words which might otherwise cover it, but from which it does not appear that the particular case was intended to be provided for.\u201d <em>State, ex rel. Commrs. of Knox Cty., </em>v. <em>Blake </em>(1853), 2 Ohio St. 147, 151. See, also, R.C. 1.47(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">The general language contained in R.C. 3923.021(A), although clear, must be restricted in its application when it conflicts with the specific provisions of R.C. 3923.33(E) and (K), <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">\u201cThe legislature * * * is presumed to have intended a just and reasonable result, feasible of execution.\u201d <em>Radcliffe </em>v. <em>Artromick Internatl., Inc. </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St. 3d 40, 43, 31 OBR 148, 151, 508 N.E. 2d 953, 956; R.C. 1.47(C) and (D). Where, as here, an insurer files a Medicare supplemental insurance policy with the Superintendent for his approval, R.C. 3923.33(E), (K), and the rules promulgated thereunder require the Superintendent to determine whether the rates contained therein (1) were calculated in accordance with sound actuarial principles and practices, and (2) are in compliance with both the Superintendent\u2019s loss ratio standards and federal law. To hold, as has the majority today, that the general provisions of R.C. 3923.021(A) and (B), exclusively, govern the Superintendent\u2019s conduct does violence to the General Assembly\u2019s intent in enacting the whole of Sub. S.B. No. 124. Therefore, I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b255-6\"> One such rule, relevant here, is Ohio Adm.

Unless a state regulatory program includes requirements \u201cequal to or more stringent than the requirements described in subparagraphs (2) and (3) of subsection (c),\u201d as does Ohio\u2019s program, such state will lose its primacy over certification enforcement of Medicare supplemental policies.
