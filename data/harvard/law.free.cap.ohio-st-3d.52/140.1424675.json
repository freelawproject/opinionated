Bowshier responds that, since a corporate officer stands charged in place of the corporate vendor, R.C. 5739.16 also applies to the corporate officer\u2019s derivative assessment. We hold that R.C. 5739.16 does not time bar R.C. 5739.33 assessments against corporate officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-10\">R.C. 5739.33, during the audit period, provided:</p>\n<p id=\"b203-11\">\u201cIf any corporation required to file returns and to remit tax due to the state under the provisions of sections 5739.01 to 5739.31, inclusive, of the Revised Code, fails for any reason to make such filing or payment, any of its officers, or employees having control or supervision of or charged with the responsibility of filing returns and making payments, shall be personally liable for such failure. * * *\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b203-13\">R.C. 5739.16(A) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b203-14\">\u201cNo assessment shall be made or issued against a vendor or consumer for any tax imposed by or pursuant to section 5739.02, 5739.021, 5739.023, 5739.026, or 5739.10 of the Revised Code more than four years after the return date for the period in which the sale or purchase was made, or more than four years after the return for such period is filed, whichever is later. * * *\"</p>\n<p id=\"b203-16\">We held, in <em>Rowland </em>v. <em>Collins </em>(1976), 48 Ohio St. 2d 311, 2 O.O. 3d 450, 358 N.E. 2d 582, that R.C. 5739.33 binds the corporate officer to a conclusive assessment against the corporation and that the officer cannot challenge the underlying assessment. We there concluded that the R.C. 5739.33 assessment was derivative in nature. However, we did not hold, contrary to the court of appeals\u2019 ruling in the instant case, that an officer receives the same protections that the corporation, as vendor, receives. Instead, we held that the corporation, not the corporate officer, is the \u201cvendor,\u201d and that \u201c* * * a corporate officer made personally liable pursuant to R.C. 5739.33 is not entitled to all the procedural and substantive rights afforded a \u2018vendor\u2019 by R.C. Chapter 5739.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 314, 2 O.O. 3d at 452, 358 N.E. 2d at 584. In <em>Rowland, </em>we decided that an officer was not entitled to a \u201csixty-day\u201d letter under R.C. 5739.03, in which procedure a vendor would have sixty days to secure \u201clet<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>ters of usage\u201d to avoid an assessment by showing that sales were exempt from taxation.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">Thus, the corporation, not its officers, is the vendor mentioned in R.C. 5739.16. Consequently, R.C. 5739.16 does not time bar assessments against corporate officers under R.C. 5739.33.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b204-8\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Douglas, Wright, H. Brown and Res-nick, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b204-9\">Holmes, J., dissents.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b204-10\">Holmes, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AlG\">dissenting. I must respectfully dissent from the majority opinion which in my view completely misconstrues, the legal effect of the statute of limitations contained in R.C. 5739.16. I believe, as did the court of appeals, that R.C. 5739.16 bars assessments against corporate officers who are held personally liable for their corporation\u2019s tax debt pursuant to R.C. 5739.33.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-12\">In Ohio, the legal effect of a statute of limitations is to bar the owner of the claim from employing remedial measures to collect the debt. It is the claimant\u2019s remedies, not the validity or existence of the claim, which are affected. <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Thorn </em>(1876), 29 Ohio St. 569.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-14\">In the case <em>sub judice </em>the majority incorrectly focused its analysis on the liability of the corporate officer while ignoring the claimant\u2019s ability to assert her claim. It is immunity which protects individuals and entities from liability. The statute of limitations bars the assertion of claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-15\">The claim in the case at bar arose from the corporation\u2019s failure to remit its assessed tax under the provisions of R.C. 5739.01 to 5739.31, inclusive. It is this same claim for which R.C. 5739.33 imposes personal liability on the corporate officer. However, the Tax Commissioner is precluded from asserting this claim regardless of who may be liable therefor.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-16\">By enacting R.C. 5739.16 the General Assembly sought to bar claimants from litigating stale claims. Today\u2019s decision, however, does violence to such legislative purpose. Because I believe the result of today\u2019s decision is contrary to the purpose and intent of R.C. 5739.16, I must respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
