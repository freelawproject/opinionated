Adler, </em>for appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b146-15\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AFk\">Appellee argues that we have no jurisdiction over this appeal because the notice of appeal was not timely filed in the court of appeals. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-16\">Section 1(A), Rule I of the Supreme Court Rules of Practice plainly states: \u201cThe notice of appeal from a Court of Appeals must be filed in the court from which the case is appealed within thirty days from the entry of the judgment * * * appealed from * * Thirty days after December 29, 1989 was January 28, 1990. However, as that day was a Sunday, Tyler\u2019s notice of appeal was due on January 29. See Rule XI, Supreme Court Rules of Practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-17\">Tyler argues, citing <em>Houston </em>v. <em>Lack </em>(1988), 487 U.S. 266, that when a prisoner acting <em>pro se, </em>seeks to appeal an adverse judgment, we should consider his notice of appeal \u201cfiled\u201d when he turns it over to the prison authorities for mailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-18\">In <em>Houston, </em>the United States Supreme Court rested its holding on its interpretation of a federal statute and the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, and not on any constitutional provision. As such, it is not binding on us.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-19\">Nor do we find <em>Houston </em>persuasive. In <em>Houston, </em>Justice Scalia observed in dissent that the court\u2019s interpretation of the phrase \u201cfiled with the clerk,\u201d Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(1), to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>mean \u201c \u2018delivered to the warden of a prison\u2019 \u201d was \u201cremote from plain English.\u201d <em>Houston, supra, </em>at 280. Similarly, we reject appellant\u2019s suggestion that \u201cfiled in the court from which the case is appealed\u201d really means \u201cdelivered to the prison mail room.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ADk\">The notice of appeal is jurisdictional. <em>State, ex rel. Curran, </em>v. <em>Brookes </em>(1943), 142 Ohio St. 107, 26 O.O. 287, 50 N.E. 2d 995, paragraph seven of the syllabus. Appellant failed to file it within the time specified in Section 1, Rule I. Thus, the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b147-7\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Holmes, Douglas, Wright, H.
