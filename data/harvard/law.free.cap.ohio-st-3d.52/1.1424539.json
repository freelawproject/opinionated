For the reason^ that follow, we agree with the appellants that the credit should have been computed on all of the adjusted gross income they earned in Oklahoma, not just on that part of their Oklahoma income that was actually taxed, <em>i.e., </em>taxable income.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-9\">R.C. 5747.02 imposes a tax based on all the adjusted gross income of resident individuals (minus an exemption), without regard to where that income is earned. In order not to tax income that was earned in and therefore comes within the taxing authority of another state, R.C. 5747.05(B)(1) provides for a resident tax credit:</p>\n<p id=\"b64-10\">\u201cThe following credits shall be allowed against the income tax imposed by section 5747.02 of the Revised Code:</p>\n<p id=\"b64-11\">* *</p>\n<p id=\"b64-12\">\u201c(B)(1) The amount of tax otherwise due under section 5747.02 of the Revised Code on <em>such portion of the adjusted gross income </em>of a resident taxpayer <em>that in another state </em>or in the District of Columbia <em>is subjected to a tax on income </em>or measured by income[.]\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b64-14\">Consistent with its earlier decisions, the BTA interprets the \u201cportion of adjusted gross income\u201d that in the other state, here Oklahoma, \u201cis subjected to a tax on income\u201d to mean the portion of Oklahoma adjusted gross income that Oklahoma actually taxed, that is, the amount that is multiplied by the applicable tax rate to yield the Brachmans\u2019 Oklahoma tax liability. See <em>Lynham </em>v. <em>Limbach </em>(Feb. 17, 1989), B.T.A. No. 87-F-289; <em>Lloyd </em>v. <em>Limbach </em>(June 24, 1988), B.T.A. No. 87-J-1281; and <em>Horwitz </em>v. <em>Lindley </em>(Apr. 27, 1984), B.T.A. No. 82-E-245.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-15\">This interpretation derives from a misreading of the distinction drawn by R.C. 5747.05(B)(1) in allowing the credit for out-of-state income. In this subsection, the General Assembly singled out for preferred treatment that portion of a resident taxpayer\u2019s total adjusted gross income earned in another state. All of this out-of-state income is \u201csubjected to\u201d the tax laws of Oklahoma. In other words, the legislature declared its intention not to tax out-of-state income which was subject to tax in another state. The distinction in the statute is drawn between income subject in this case to Oklahoma\u2019s tax laws and that subject to Ohio\u2019s tax laws, and <em>not, </em>as the BTA interpreted it, between Oklahoma taxable income and income earned in Oklahoma that Oklahoma chooses not to tax. For the Brachmans, the credit should have been based on Oklahoma adjusted gross income of $159,483, not Oklahoma taxable income of $52,615.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-16\">The phrase \u201csubjected to a tax on income\u201d refers in this context to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>jurisdiction\u2019s exercise of authority-over income earned within its boundaries. Such income is subjected to the overall tax scheme of the jurisdiction, not merely that portion of the income used in the final calculation of the applicable rate. To arrive at taxable income, a taxpayer must consult the jurisdiction\u2019s statutes setting out exclusions, deductions, and exemptions from gross income. Only then may a taxpayer\u2019s tax liability be computed. For instance, a corporation in Oklahoma or Ohio may have sales of a million dollars but, after deducting for business expenses, losses, and the like, it will pay taxes on a fraction of that amount. To arrive at the final figure, however, <em>all </em>of the corporation\u2019s income has been subject to the taxation scheme</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">This analysis of R.C. 5747.05(B)(1) finds support in the use of the phrase \u201csubject to an income tax\u201d in the Internal Revenue Code. R.C. 5747.01 states that \u201c[e]xcept as otherwise expressly provided or clearly appearing from the context, any term used in this chapter [which includes R.C. 5747.05(B)(1)] has the same meaning as when used in a comparable context in the Internal Revenue Code, and all other statutes of the United States relating to federal income taxes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">Such a comparable context is Section 1503, Title 26, U.S. Code. This section deals with consolidated corporate income tax returns. Section 1503(d)(2)(A) concerns tax treatment of losses of a domestic corporation that is taxed by a foreign government:</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">\u201c* * * Except as provided in sub-paragraph (B), the term \u2018dual consolidated loss\u2019 means any net operating loss of a domestic corporation which is <em>subject to an income tax </em>of a foreign country on its income without regard to whether such income is from sources in or outside of such foreign country, or is <em>subject to such a tax </em>on a residence basis.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b65-9\">This provision contemplates a situation in which a United States corporation is also a resident for tax purposes of another country and pays taxes in both. This situation is comparable to that of an Ohioan paying taxes in Ohio and in. another state. (Of course, the Ohioan can be a resident of only one state.) In this comparable context the dual resident corporation is \u201csubject to\u201d two tax schemes, much as Ohio residents earning income in another state are \u201csubjected to\u201d a tax on their income by both states.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-10\">The legislative history of Section 1503 reveals that Congress used the phrase \u201csubject to an income tax of a foreign country\u201d in the jurisdictional sense discussed above. The Conference Committee Report on an amendment to Section 1503 explains that the section applies to a corporation that \u201c* * * may be <em>subject to foreign tax </em>on a residence basis because its place of effective management is in a foreign country or for other reasons. Where a corporation is <em>subject to foreign tax </em>on a residence basis, then, for U.S. purposes, its loss will be available to offset income of that corporation in other years, but not income of another U.S. corporation. * * *\u201d (Emphasis added.) 1986 U.S. Code Congressional and Administrative News 4075, 4744-4745. (H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 99-841, 99th Cong. 2nd Sess. 656-657.)</p>\n<p id=\"b65-11\">The conference committee intended Section 1503 to extend \u201c* * * to all foreign corporations that could benefit from a dual resident corporation\u2019s net operating loss, whether or not the foreign corporation\u2019s earnings are or will be <em>subject </em>to U.S. tax * * (Emphasis added.) <em>Id. </em>at 4745. In justifying this extension, the Conference Committee Report states that \u201c* * * the conferees are not aware of a case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>where the use of one company\u2019s deduction by two other companies <em>in two tax jurisdictions </em>makes sense as a matter of tax policy. * * *\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">This reference to tax jurisdictions makes it clear that the corporations covered by Section 1503(d)(2)(A) are \u201csubject to\u201d a tax in the United States and abroad in the sense that both jurisdictions have exercised the authority to tax them.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">Applying this Internal Revenue Code construction of \u201csubject to an income tax\u201d to R.C. 5747.05(B)(1), it is obvious that the \u201c* * * portion of the adjusted gross income of a resident taxpayer that in another state or in the District of Columbia is subjected to a tax on income * * *\u201d is that portion of a resident Ohio taxpayer\u2019s income which has come under the taxing power of another state or of Washington, D.C. Under the statute, the out-of-state credit is to be computed based on the portion of an Ohio resident\u2019s income to which another jurisdiction\u2019s tax laws apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">Section 61(a), Title 26, U.S. Code defines \u201cgross income\u201d as \u201call income from whatever source derived.\u201d The predecessor to this statute included in its definition the phrase \u201cincome derived from any source whatever.\u201d Title 26, Section .22(a), U.S. Code. The United States Supreme Court concluded that \u201c* * * this language was used by Congress to exert in this field \u2018the full measure of its taxing power.\u2019 <em>Helvering </em>v. <em>Clifford, </em>309 U.S. 331, 334; <em>Helvering </em>v. <em>Midland Mutual Life Ins. Co., </em>300 U.S. 216, 223; <em>Douglas </em>v. <em>Willcuts, </em>296 U.S. 1, 9; <em>Irvine </em>v. <em>Gavit, </em>268 U.S. 161, 166. * * * Congress applied no limitations as to the source of taxable receipts, nor restrictive labels as to their nature. And the Court has given a liberal construction to this broad phraseology in recognition of the intention of Congress to tax all gains except those specifically exempted. * * *\u201d <em>Commissioner </em>v. <em>Glenshaw Glass Co. </em>(1955), 348 U.S. 426, 429-430.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-8\">Unquestionably, then, income subject to tax includes all income which is reached as gross income in the taxing scheme of a jurisdiction. The manner in which a state government constructs its taxing scheme does not change the result.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-9\">Thus, to say that the Brachmans\u2019 Oklahoma income was subjected to an income tax in 1983 is to mean that the Brachmans\u2019 income was subjected to Oklahoma\u2019s tax laws, all of them, not just the statutes dealing with taxable income. Therefore, the BTA was incorrect in deciding that only the portion of these taxpayers\u2019 total adjusted gross income that represents Oklahoma taxable income qualifies for the credit allowed by R.C. 5747.05(B)(1). Accordingly, we reverse the decision of the BTA and remand with instructions that the BTA recompute the credit based on the Brachmans\u2019 1983 adjusted gross income in Oklahoma.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-10\">\n<em>Decision reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b66-11\">Holmes, Miller, Wright and H.

It is a fundamental principle of law that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>court should give the strictest interpretation to the language of a tax statute so as to avoid restricting the legislature\u2019s power to tax. <em>Herrick </em>v. <em>Lindley </em>(1979), 59 Ohio St. 2d 22, 27, 13 O.O. 3d 13, 16, 391 N.E. 2d 729, 733. The majority has failed to adhere to this principle and, therefore, I respectfully dissent. Since the General Assembly could have taxed each Ohio resident based upon total income, no matter where it was earned, and the statute is unclear as to how extensive an exemption is intended, the majority\u2019s interpretation of R.C. 5747.05(B)(1) is inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">R.C. 5747.02 provides that a tax shall be levied on each individual residing in or earning or receiving income in the state of Ohio based upon the individual\u2019s adjusted gross income less a statutory exemption for the individual taxpayer, the taxpayer\u2019s spouse, and each dependent. Certain credits are permitted against the income tax imposed by R.C. 5747.02. Among those credits is the \u201cresident tax credit\u201d for the tax due under R.C. 5747.02 on that part of the adjusted gross income of a resident taxpayer which was subject to tax in another state. R.C. 5747.05(B)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">As noted by the majority, the Board of Tax Appeals has interpreted this section on at least three prior occasions. In each case, the board interpreted R.C. 5747.05(B)(1) strictly and found that the credit must be based on taxable income. The board interpreted Ohio law strictly to avoid expanding the deductions and allowances intended by the legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">Appellants argue that the board\u2019s interpretation of the statute is improper because it conflicts with the obvious intent of the legislature to prevent double taxation. They assert that the legislature could have provided a credit equal to the actual tax paid, but chose instead to provide a credit which would avoid double taxation. Appellants conclude, therefore, that the method used by the other state to calculate the tax due is irrelevant. Otherwise, the Ohio credit would be directly related to the deductions allowed by the other state. The greater the deductions, the lower the credit and vice versa. Appellants argue that this result is inequitable and, therefore, clearly not the legislative intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-10\">Appellants are correct in their assertion that the allowance of a credit for tax paid to another state based upon the same income is a means by which Ohio may prevent double taxation which would otherwise penalize a taxpayer living in Ohio and earning income outside the state. However, the legislature also seeks to equalize .the tax burden among all residents because they all enjoy the benefits of residing in Ohio. Therefore, the General Assembly designed the resident tax credit to achieve both of these goals.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-11\">While it is true that Oklahoma could have taxed appellants\u2019 entire gross income, it did not. Oklahoma, like other states, allows certain deductions to be taken against gross income, excluding some income from taxation. To give appellants a credit based upon income which was not actually taxed would not further the goals of the Ohio General Assembly. Although it may appear under appellants\u2019 analysis that they are being taxed by both states on the same income, they are not. If Oklahoma had actually taxed appellants\u2019 total gross income, appellants\u2019 resident tax credit would have been proportionately larger, thus preventing any double taxation. If we adopted appellants\u2019 view, we would be preventing the state of Ohio from taxing that portion of appellants\u2019 adjusted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>gross income which Oklahoma\u2019s legislature has exempted from taxation. This result would be contrary to the purposes behind the resident tax credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">The majority premises its decision on a comparison of the statute at issue with sections of the Internal Revenue Code pertaining to corporate taxation. While either the phrase, \u201csubject to taxation,\u201d or the phrase, \u201csubjected to taxation,\u201d is used in both sections, the function of each statute is uniquely different. The considerations made by</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">Congress when it determined how to tax income earned by a United States corporation in a foreign country are not comparable to those made by a state legislature with regard to how to tax a resident individual who earned income in another state.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">I would find that the Board of Tax Appeals\u2019 decision is reasonable and lawful.</p>\n<judges id=\"b68-7\">Sweeney, Acting C.J., and Re snick, J., concur in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
