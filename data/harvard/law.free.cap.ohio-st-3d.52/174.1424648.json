Bd. of Edn. </em>v. <em>Findlay Edn. Assn. </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St. 3d 129, 551 N.E. 2d 186, we discussed the degree of judicial restraint'necessary for a court to exercise in reviewing an arbitrator\u2019s award. In <em>Findlay, </em>paragraphs one and two of the syllabus, we held:</p>\n<p id=\"b237-26\">\u201c1. Given the presumed validity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>of an arbitrator\u2019s award, a reviewing court\u2019s inquiry into whether the arbitrator exceeded his authority, within the meaning of R.C. 2711.10(D), is limited.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">\u201c2. Once it is determined that the arbitrator\u2019s award draws its essence from the collective bargaining agreement and is not unlawful, arbitrary or capricious, a reviewing court\u2019s inquiry for purposes of vacating an arbitrator\u2019s award pursuant to R.C. 2711.10 (D) is at an end. * * *\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AHy\">Our holding in <em>Findlay </em>was meant to foster the arbitration system of dispute resolution which \u201c * * provides the parties with a relatively speedy and inexpensive method of conflict resolution and has the additional advantage of unburdening crowded court dockets.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 131, 551 N.E. 2d at 189. The only way to give effect to the purposes of the arbitration system of conflict resolution is to give lasting effect to the decisions rendered by an arbitrator whenever that is possible. If a motion to vacate an arbitrator\u2019s award is granted, the arbitration method of conflict resolution becomes less speedy and more expensive and the advantage of unburdening crowded court dockets becomes less of an advantage (or no advantage at all). Hence, judicial inquiry for purposes of vacating an arbitrator\u2019s award is limited by <em>Findlay </em>and where a reviewing court exceeds the permissible scope of review such judgment will be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">In the case at bar, the arbitrator reviewed Section 15.3, Article XV of the collective bargaining agreement, which provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">\u201cAll <em>hours actually worked in excess of </em>eight (8) hours in one day or <em>forty (10) hours in one week </em>shall be paid at one and one-half (1\u00bd) times the employees <em>[sic] </em>regular straight-time hourly rate.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b238-12\">The arbitrator concluded that the term \u201chours actually worked\u201d applied only to those hours worked in excess of forty hours in one week. The arbitrator was then faced with an obligation to determine what type of hours could be used to calculate the \u201cforty (40) hours.\u201d Since \u201chours actually worked\u201d applied only to those hours worked in excess of forty hours, the arbitrator reasoned that the forty hours themselves could include those hours for which an employee is entitled to be paid <em>regardless </em>of whether actual work was performed. Griffith was entitled to be paid for eight hours of holiday pay for July 4, 1986<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and the arbitrator included those hours in the forty-hour computation to determine Griffith\u2019s overtime eligibility for the work she performed on July 9, 1986. The eight hours in which work was performed on July 9, 1986 were \u201chours actually worked in excess of\u201d the arbitrator\u2019s forty-hour computation. As such, Griffith was awarded overtime pay for the work she performed on July 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-13\">The trial court and the court of appeals held that Section 15.3, Article XV of the contract was unambiguous and subject to but one interpretation. According to the trial court and a majority of the court of appeals, the \u201ceight (8) hours in one day or forty (40) hours in one week\u201d must also be hours \u201cactually worked\u201d and the arbitrator, in effect, substituted the term \u201chours in active pay status\u201d for the contract language \u201chours actually worked,\u201d thereby exceeding her authority.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b238-14\">We do not agree. In the court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>appeals, Presiding Judge Grey (dissenting) made the following observations:</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">\u201cThe trial court, and the majority opinion do the very thing they accuse the arbitrator of doing \u2014 re-writing the agreement under the guise of interpreting it.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">\u201c* * * The trial court decision subverts the whole purpose of arbitration under R.C. 2711.10.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">\u201c* * * The trial court, in effect, rewrote the contract so that Section 15.3 of the agreement would read as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">\u201c <em>\u2018SECTION 15.3 OVERTIME. </em>All hours actually worked in excess of eight (8) hours [actually worked] in one day or forty (40) hours [actually worked] in one week shall be paid at one and one-half (1\u00bd) times the employee\u2019s regular straight-time hourly rate.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">\u201cThe clear unambiguous intent of the language is that the police officer can get overtime only for overtime hours actually worked. An officer cannot get the overtime rate for hours or days credited but not worked. * * *\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b239-9\">Clearly, Section 15.3, Article XV of the agreement is subject to more than one reasonable interpretation and, hence, is ambiguous. Section 15.3, Article XV can be interpreted to deal only with those hours actually worked in excess of forty hours. Therefore, we find that the arbitrator merely rendered her bargained-for interpretation of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-10\">Applying our holding in <em>Findlay </em>to the case at bar, we find the arbitrator applied the correct section of the collective bargaining agreement. The contractual provision was obviously subject to more than one interpretation and the arbitrator concluded that the term \u201chours actually worked\u201d applied only to those hours <em>in excess of </em>\u201cforty (40) hours in one week.\u201d The arbitrator determined that the \u201cforty (40) hours in one week\u201d included the hours of holiday pay and awarded Griffith overtime compensation for those hours \u201cactually worked\u201d <em>in excess of </em>\u201cforty (40) hours in one week.\u201d Clearly, the award draws its essence from the <em>agreement. </em>Further, the arbitrator merely interpreted the contract rather than adding to, subtracting from, or altering the language of the contract and, hence, she did not exceed her authority under the terms of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-13\">Therefore, the arbitrator\u2019s award draws its essence from the collective bargaining agreement and is not unlawful, arbitrary or capricious, and, thus, the award should not have been vacated. The trial court and a majority of the court of appeals erred in substituting their interpretation of Section 15.3, Article XV for that of the arbitrator. Both courts exceeded their limited power to review the arbitrator\u2019s award. When a provision in a collective bargaining agreement is subject to more than one reasonable interpretation and the parties to the contract have agreed to submit their contract interpretation disputes to final and binding arbitration, the arbitrator\u2019s interpretation of the contract, and not the interpretation of a reviewing court, governs the rights of the parties thereto. This is so because the arbitrator\u2019s interpretation of the contract is what the parties bargained for in agreeing to submit their disputes to final and binding arbitration. The arbitrator\u2019s interpretation must prevail <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>regardless of whether his or her interpretation is the most reasonable under the circumstances.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">The continued vitality of the arbitration system of dispute resolution can only be ensured through judicial restraint. Not only must a reviewing court limit its inquiry for purposes of vacating an arbitrator\u2019s award in accordance with the requirements in <em>Findlay, </em>but a reviewing court also must be sensitive to upholding an arbitrator\u2019s award whenever it is possible to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">For all the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the court of appeals is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b240-7\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Wright, H. Brown and Resnick, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b240-8\">Holmes, J., dissents.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b238-9\"> Pursuant to Section 18.1, Article XVIII of the collective bargaining agreement, Griffith received a paid holiday for Independence Day.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b238-15\"> The collective bargaining agreement at Section 8.5(B), Article VIII provides in relevant part:</p>\n<p id=\"b238-16\">\u201cThe arbitrator shall have no power or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>authority to add to, subtract from, or in any manner, alter the specific terms of this Agreement * * * or to make any award that * * * violates any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement. * * *\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b240-12\"> A judge reviewing an arbitrator\u2019s award may completely disagree with the arbitrator\u2019s interpretation of the contract.

The particular language of the agreement at issue here is contained in Section 15.3, entitled \u201cOvertime.\u201d At the crux of this dispute is the meaning of the following sentence:</p>\n<p id=\"b240-10\">\u201cAll hours <em>actually worked </em>in excess of eight (8) hours in one day or forty (40) hours in one week shall be paid at one and one-half (1\u00bd) times the employees regular straight-time hourly rate.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b240-11\">The arbitrator found the foregoing language to be \u201cobviously ambiguous.\u201d Based on this conclusion, the arbitrator directed the plaintiff-appellee (the \u201ccity\u201d) to pay the grievant, Betty Griffith, overtime for periods in which she had been in \u201cactive pay status,\u201d but had not actually worked, in excess of forty hours in one week.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-14\">The courts below did not find the language ambiguous. The court of common pleas stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b240-15\">\u201c \u2018Hours actually worked\u2019 means exactly that and cannot be interpreted in any other way.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b240-16\">Similarly, the cpurt of appeals held that:</p>\n<p id=\"b240-17\">\u201c \u2018Actually worked\u2019 means \u2018actually worked.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b240-18\">Based on these conclusions, the courts below found that the arbitrator had exceeded the scope of her powers by altering and adding to the specific terms of the agreement and vacated the arbitrator\u2019s award.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-19\">It is apparent that, as the courts below concluded, the real import of the arbitrator\u2019s decision was to replace the words \u201cactually worked\u201d with the phrase \u201cin active pay status.\u201d Neither \u201cactually\u201d nor \u201cworked\u201d is ambiguous. Both words have readily understood dictionary definitions in common usage. Since no reasonable ambiguity should exist in the contract language, given a grammatical construction of the sentence and the clear definitions of the critical words, the lower courts recognized that the arbitrator necessarily altered and added to the contract language and thereby exceeded the scope of her powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-20\">The arbitrator\u2019s error in exceeding her powers was a valid basis for the court of common pleas to vacate the arbitrator\u2019s decision under R.C. 2711.10(D) and for the court of appeals to affirm the trial court. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
