When transferred to the January 11, 1985 and June 12, 1985 orders, however, the nature of disability, <em>i.e., </em>\u201cspr.\u201d (\u201csprain\u201d), was somehow deleted. R.C. 4121.36(B)(4) compliance thus warranted remedial action, but not to the extent seen here.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-15\">Analysis turns to R.C. 4123.52, which grants the commission continuing jurisdiction to modify or change former orders. While not unlimited, invocation of this statute may be appropriate in certain cases of mistake. See <em>Indus. Comm. </em>v. <em>Dell </em>(1922), 104 Ohio St. 389, 135 N.E. 669; <em>State </em>v. <em>Ohio Stove Co. </em>(1950), 154 Ohio St. 27, 42 O.O. 117, 93 N.E. 2d 291. In the case at bar, the appearance of a statutorily defective allowance in the 1985 orders constituted such a mistake.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-17\">This error could have been corrected simply by amending the allowed condition to reflect \u201cback sprain\u201d instead of just \u201cback.\u201d The commission, however, went one step further and narrowed the named body part from \u201cback\u201d to \u201clumbosacral\u201d and \u201clumbar spine.\u201d It did so, moreover, despite the absence of any allegation that its designation of \u201cback\u201d as the affected body part was wrong. As such, the commission\u2019s continuing jurisdiction did not allow the extent of the correction attempted here.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-18\">Appellants 'also challenge appellee\u2019s resort to mandamus, contending that the commission\u2019s February 2, 1987 order could have been appealed under R.C. 4123.519. Appellants, however, misdefine the issue before us. The relevant question here is not one of appellee\u2019s right to participate in the State Insurance Fund for a \u201cback\u201d injury but is instead whether a mistake sufficient to invoke the continuing jurisdiction provisions of R.C. 4123.52 existed. We find this latter question to be the proper subject matter for a writ of mandamus. <em>State, ex rel. Highway Co., </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1980), 70 Ohio App. 2d 41, 24 O.O. 3d 37, 434 N.E. 2d 279.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-19\">Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-20\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b148-21\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Holmes, Douglas, Wright, H.
