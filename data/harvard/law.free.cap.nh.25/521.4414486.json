S.\u201d are a proper representation of a seal, in copying or enrolling legal precepts.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b521-10\">A plea in abatement, enrolling a summons, contained an allegation that it was enrolled in the \u201c words <em>\" </em>following, and the enrolment showed \u201c words, figures and <em>letters,\u201d </em>\u2014 Held, that the allegation was sufficient.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b521-11\">Where the declaration contained four counts, and the summons left with the defendant only <em>two, </em>\u2014 Held, that it did not give to the defendant the same information which the declaration gave more at large, nor contain the substance thereof, and that the action must abate.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b521-12\">Assumpsit. The declaration contained four counts. The summons left with the defendant contained only two counts. The defendant filed a plea in abatement for variance between the writ and summons.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b521-13\">The plea was entitled as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b521-14\">\u201c Court of Common Pleas, August Term, A. D. 1852.\u201d Strafford, ss.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b521-15\">Timothy Smith <em>vs. </em>Ephraim K. Butler.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b522-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>In the plea, the defendant craved oyer of the writ, declaration and officer\u2019s return, and set them out at length; and then prayed that the summons might be enrolled, and enrolled it \u201c in the words following,\u201d setting out the summons at length, which contained \u201c words, figures and letters and in place of the seal on the original summons, were put the letters \u201c L. S.\u201d in <em>the </em>enrolment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b522-5\">The plaintiff demurred generally, and with his demurrer filed <em>the </em>original summons in the action, without praying for a re-enrolment. The demurrer was joined by the defendant.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b522-6\"><em>Soule, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b522-7\">We contend, first, that the plea is not in the English language, as is required by the Revised Statutes. The caption of the plea is a part of the plea, and as great certainty and particularity are required in that as in any other part of it. The abbreviation <em>\u201c vs.\u201d </em>for the Latin word \u201c <em>versus,\u201d </em>is not sufficient. The defendant should have written out the word \u201c against.\u201d This, it is contended, to a plea in abatement, where the highest degree of certainty is required, is a fatal exception.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b522-8\">2. In enrolling the summons, the defendant, professing to set out words merely, has set out figures and letters also. This is bad. x</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b522-10\">3. The \u201c L. S.\u201d is not a sufficient setting out of the seal on the original summons. The word \u201c seal \u201d should have been written out, or an exact copy of the seal attached. If the original summons is brought to the notice of the court, and is made a part of the record, any defect in the enrolment may be taken advantage of. The defendant makes profer\u00ed of it in his plea. It is produced in court, and filed with the plaintiff\u2019s demurrer. All the purposes of a reenrolment are answered, and the court'will take notice of it. The doctrine would seem to be that the court only wish to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>have the summons before them in some way. <em>Nelson </em>v. <em>Swett, </em>4 N. H. Rep. 256.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b523-5\">4. The allegation in the plea, \u201c that the said summons does not contain the substance of the plaintiff\u2019s writ,\u201d is not the proper form of pleading. The statute does not require the substance of the writ to be stated in the summons.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b523-6\"><em>Christie Sf </em>Kingman, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b523-7\">Eastman, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Azu\">This summons was bad. It did not give to the defendant the same information which the declaration gives more at large, nor contain the substance thereof. Rev. Stat. ch. 183, \u00a7 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">The defect was a substantial one. The writ contained four counts, and the summons but two. The defendant might have been willing to let judgment pass against him upon the two counts specified in the summons, while at the same time he might have had a valid defence to the other two not specified. And to hold such a summons good, would be to put it in the power of a plaintiff to obtain a judgment against a defendant, in ease he should not appear, upon a cause of action of which he had no notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-9\">But the demurrer raises two or three questions upon the sufficiency of the plea in abatement, which we will consider.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-10\">It is said in the argument that the plea is not wholly in the English language; that \u201c <em>vs.\u201d </em>stands for \u201c <em>versus,\u201d </em>and that \u201c <em>versus </em>\u201d is not an English word; that the plea should have been entitled Smith <em>against </em>Butler. But \u201c <em>vs.\u201d </em>and <em>\u201cversus\u201d </em>have been too long used in legal practice, and their meaning is too well understood, to be open to the objection stated. They have, in fact, become engrafted upon the English language, at least so far as they are used in this country in legal proceedings. Their meaning is well understood, and their use quite as appropriate as the word \u201c against \u201d could be.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>The position in regard to the copy of the seal is also untenable. In copying a writ or summons, <em>the fac simile </em>of a seal cannot well be made, and to do it would require more skill than pertains to the profession generally. By long usage and the general understanding of legal writers, \u201c L. S.\u201d is regarded as the true representation of a seal, in a copy of all legal precepts. If the word \u201c seal\u201d were written in the place of the seal, on the writ or summons, it would not be a true copy, for no such writing is upon the writ or summons. Whether we might receive that as a sufficient representation, is not necessary to say; but we have no hesitancy in deciding that the letters \u201c L. S.\u201d are the proper designation and copy of the seal.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">Another exception is, that the plea is not sufficiently certain ; that it should have been stated in the \u201c words, figures and letters \u201d following, instead of simply saying the \u201c words \u201d following.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">\u2022The court do not ordinarily regard pleas in abatement with much favor, and when any error occurs in the enrolment of the writ or summons, we hold the plea bad on general demurrer. But the defeet here alleged is not of that character. No exception is taken to the enrolment. And the allegation in the plea is in accordance with the <em>general </em>forms in such cases, and we think sufficient. Bell\u2019s Jus. &amp; Sher. 95; Story\u2019s Plead. 117; <em>Nelson </em>v. <em>Swett, </em>4 N. H. Rep. 256.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">The last point raised by the argument is not embraced in the case. But, probably, if it was, it would not avail. <em>Lyman </em>v. <em>Dodge, </em>13 N. H. Rep. 198.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\"><em>Judgment for the </em>defendants.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
