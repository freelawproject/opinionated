The following summarizes what happened to Wiederholt\u2019s tenure application.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-8\">Department Personnel Committee: voted in favor of tenure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-9\">Department Chairman: recommended against tenure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-10\">School of Public Health Personnel Committee: voted in favor of tenure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-11\">Dean of School of Public Health: recommended against tenure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-12\">Manoa Campus Faculty Personnel Committee: voted in favor of tenure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-13\">Manoa Chancellor: recommended against tenure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-14\">President of University (on behalf of Board of Regents): denied tenure to applicant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b245-15\">Wiederholt filed a grievance on June 27, 1977, which ultimately went to arbitration. On June 1,1980, the arbitrator found that the recommendation against tenure submitted by Wiederholt\u2019s Department Chairman was arbitrary and capricious, since the Chairman \u201clacked sufficient knowledge and expertise to fairly and fully assess the Wiederholt application for tenure in the areas of research and community service.\u201d The arbitrator also found the recommendation of the Dean to be \u201cwithout substantial evidentiary support,\u201d and thus arbitrary and capricious. The arbitrator declined to award or even recommend tenure on Wiederholt\u2019s behalf, but ordered that Wiederholt submit a new application to a panel composed of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>tenured faculty chosen by lot and designated representatives of Wiederholt and the various University officials. The arbitrator empowered this panel to grant or deny tenure to the grievant.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">The University filed a Motion to Vacate Arbitration Award, which the trial court granted \u201cto the extent that it [the award] invests the tenure review panel with authority to grant tenure to the grievant. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">In <em>University of Hawaii Professional Assembly ex rel. Daeufer </em>v. <em>University of Hawaii, </em>66 Haw. 214, 659 P.2d 720 (1983) (hereinafter <em>Daeufer), </em>we focused on the arbitration provision of the collective bargaining agreement which stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ag3\">In any grievance involving the employment status of a Faculty Member, the Arbitrator shall not substitute his judgment for that of the official making such judgment unless he determines that the decision of the official is arbitrary or capricious.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b246-9\">Agreement between UHPA and University of Hawaii (March 1975 - June 1977), Art. XII (B)(4).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b246-10\">We held in <em>Daeufer </em>that the above-quoted language allowed the arbitrator to substitute his judgment for that of the official and actually grant tenure or promotion upon a finding of arbitrary or capricious conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-11\">In this case, however, instead of deciding whether tenure would be granted to the grievant, the arbitrator empaneled a special tenure review committee to perform that task. Such a course of action is not allowed by the collective bargaining agreement, and we cannot permit it here. The \u201cjudgment\u201d of the University officials is limited to determining whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>tenure is to be granted the grievant;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> they are not empowered to form ad hoc tenure committees to decide the issue for them. Since the arbitrator is allowed to only \u201csubstitute his judgment for that of the official making such judgment,\u201d it follows that he must be likewise limited in the options he can exercise. As we noted in <em>Daeufer </em>\u201cIt is the <em>arbitrator\u2019s </em>construction [of the contract] which was bargained for \u2014\u201d 66 Haw. at 225-26, 659 P.2d at 728 (emphasis added) (quoting <em>United Steelworkers of America </em>v. <em>Enterprise Wheel &amp; Car Corp., </em>363 U.S. 593, 597 (1960)).</p>\n<attorneys id=\"ARSz\"><em>Thomas P. Gill {Gill, Park, Park &amp; Kim </em>of counsel) <em>{Lowell K. Y. Chun-Hoon </em>and <em>Herbert R. Takahashi </em>on the briefs) for defendant-appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AU4\"><em>Cynthia Winegar </em>and <em>Edward Yuen, </em>Deputy Attorneys General, for plaintiff-appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">We hold that the arbitrator\u2019s submission of this tenure grievance to an ad hoc committee was inconsistent with the terms of the collective bargaining agreement, and exceeded his powers as defined in Article XII (B)(4) of that agreement. Thus, under HRS \u00a7 658-9(4), the arbitrator\u2019s award must be vacated, and rehearing by the arbitrator of this grievance ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">Although we do not pass judgment on the arbitrator\u2019s finding of arbitrary and capricious conduct by the University officials in this case,, we do pause to emphasize the standard which must guide him: unless the arbitrator can find the decision of the appointing University official to lack any rational basis whatsoever, he cannot substitute his judgment for that of such official. The official\u2019s decision need not be the most fair, logical, or judicious one; it need only be rational. With that caveat in mind, we remand to the circuit court with instructions to return this grievance to the arbitrator for reconsideration.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b246-12\"> This particular provision of the grievance-arbitration section is identical to that contained in the 1977-79 collective bargaining agreement, which was construed in <em>Daeufer.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b247-9\"> The University officials could also remand the matter for reconsideration to a lower level; this would be an option available to the arbitrator as well.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
