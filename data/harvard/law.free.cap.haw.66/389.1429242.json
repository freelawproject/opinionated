We reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent herewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-15\">On September 14,1974, at about 5:30 p.m., the traffic lights at the intersection of Waialae and Kilauea Avenues were malfunctioning. All lights at the intersection were stuck on red, except for the lights governing the mauka half of Waialae Avenue. Traffic was congested on Kilauea Avenue and the makai half of Waialae Avenue and some vehicles in those lanes were proceeding across the intersection against the red lights.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-16\">Plaintiff Rachelle Shields and a companion had crossed the makai half of Waialae Avenue and were standing on a medial strip, when they first noticed the traffic light malfunction. They decided that their safest route would be to cross the mauka half of Waialae Avenue, where the traffic was lightest, instead of returning to the makai side of Waialae Avenue. After several minutes of waiting, Rachelle Shields and her companion attempted to cross the mauka lanes of Waialae Avenue. Mid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>way through the lanes, Rachelle Shields was struck by an ewa-bound vehicle driven by Gail Beddow, who did not realize that the traffic lights at the intersection were malfunctioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">Rachelle Shields and her parents sued the City, among others, for damages arising from the accident. Plaintiffs\u2019 theory of liability against the City was based on plaintiffs\u2019 allegation that the City\u2019s negligent failure to properly maintain the traffic signal control box at the intersection of Waialae and Kilauea Avenue was the proximate cause of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">On May 31, 1978, after informal requests by plaintiffs\u2019 attorney, plaintiffs filed and served on the City a formal written request for production of the traffic signal control box. Despite plaintiffs\u2019 request for production, a private contractor, under the supervision of City employees, subsequently removed and destroyed the traffic signal control box without plaintiffs\u2019 knowledge or consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">On October 3, 1978, Judge Arthur S. K. Fong of the First Circuit Court issued the following order imposing sanctions against the City:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-7\">IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED, that the following sanctions shall be imposed against Defendant City and County of Honolulu for its failure to respond to Plaintiffs\u2019 Request for Production of Traffic Signal Control Box and for the destruction of said control box:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-8\">1. Defendant was negligent in that it had a malfunctioning traffic signal control box at the Waialae and Kilauea Avenue intersection which caused the traffic lights at said intersection to malfunction on September 14, 1974.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-9\">2. Defendant City and County of Honolulu is estopped from claiming that the traffic signal control box was defective in design or manufacture or that any such alleged defective condition was the cause of the malfunction on September 14, 1974.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-10\">3. Defendant City and County of Honolulu shall not be estopped from asserting its claims as to proximate cause, comparative negligence, assumption of risk or any other affirmative defenses against any other party in this action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AqF\">The case was subsequently assigned to Judge Robert Won Bae Chang of the First Circuit Court. By order entered on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>March 1, 1982, Judge Chang granted the City\u2019s motion for reconsideration of Judge Fong\u2019s order of sanctions and modified the prior order as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-5\">IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the City\u2019s Motion to Reconsider Judge Fong\u2019s Order Imposing Sanctions be granted to the extent that the finding of \u201cnegligence\u201d per se is omitted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-6\">IT IS HEREBY FURTHER ORDERED that the new finding and order reads that: \u201cThe City failed to properly maintain the traffic signal control box at Waialae and Kilauea causing the traffic lights at said intersection to malfunction on September 14, 1974.\u201d The remainder of Judge Fong\u2019s original order is not affected by this ruling.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AKIU\">By another order entered on the same date, Judge Chang then granted City\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Judge Chang held that even assuming that the City had failed to properly maintain the traffic signal control box, there was no legal basis upon which the City could be found liable for the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">Plaintiffs contend that the trial court erred in its order granting the City\u2019s motion for reconsideration. Plaintiffs argue that the sanctions imposed by Judge Fong were appropriate under HRCP Rule 37(d). Plaintiffs further point out that the City\u2019s motion for reconsideration was brought more than three years after the filing of Judge Fong\u2019s original order and the delay caused severe prejudice to the plaintiffs. Finally, plaintiffs argue that the trial court was precluded under the doctrine of \u201claw of the case\u201d from reconsidering an order of a court of equal and concurrent jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-9\">The circuit court has authority to impose sanctions against a party for failure to respond to a request for inspection, under HRCP Rule 37(d) which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-10\">(d) Failure of Party to Attend at Own Deposition or Serve Answers to Interrogatories or Respond to Request for Inspection. <em>If a party </em>or an officer, director, or managing agent of a party or a person designated under Rule 30(b)(6) or 31(a) to testify on behalf of a party <em>fails </em>(1) to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>appear before the officer who is to take his deposition, after being served with a proper notice, or (2) to serve answers or objections to interrogatories submitted under Rule 33, after proper service of the interrogatories, or (3) <em>to serve a written response to a request for inspection submitted under Rule 34, after proper service of the request, the court in which the action is pending on motion may make such orders in regard to the failure as are just, and among others it may take any action authorized under paragraphs (A), (B) and (C) of subdivision (b)(2) of this rule. </em>In lieu of any order or in addition thereto, the court shall require the party failing to act or the attorney advising him or both to pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney\u2019s fees, caused by the failure, unless the court finds that the failure was substantially justified or that other circumstances make an award of expenses unjust.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-5\">The failure to act described in this subdivision may not be excused on the ground that the discovery sought is objectionable unless the party failing to act has applied for a protective order as provided by Rule 26(c).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">Rule 37(d) refers to the following sanctions in HRCP Rule 37(b)(2)(A), (B) and (C), which may be imposed by the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-8\">(2) Sanctions by Court in Which Action is Pending. If a party or an officer, director, or managing agent of a party or a person designated under Rule 30(b)(6) or 31(a) to testify on behalf of a party fails to obey an order to provide or permit discovery, including an order made under subdivision (a) of this rule or Rule 35, the court in which the action is pending may make such orders in regard to the failure as are just, and among others the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-9\">(A) <em>An order that the matters regarding which the order was made or any other designatedfacts shall be taken to be established for the purposes of the action in accordance with the claim of the party obtaining the order;</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-10\">(B) <em>An order refusing to allow the disobedient party to support or oppose designated claims or defenses, or prohibiting him from introducing designated matters in evidence;</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>(C) An order striking out pleadings or parts thereof, or staying further proceedings until the order is obeyed, or dismissing the action or proceeding or any part thereof, or rendering a judgment by default against the disobedient party ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">The circuit court is given broad discretion in determining the sanctions to be imposed pursuant to Rule 37(b)(2). <em>See </em>J. Moore, 4A Moore\u2019s Federal Practice \u00b6 37.03[2] (1982); 8 C. Wright and A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure Civil \u00a7 2284 (1970). It does not appear that Judge Fong abused his discretion in imposing the sanction that the City would be deemed negligent for having a malfunctioning control box at the time of the accident. Judge Fong had the prerogative under Rule 37(b)(2)(A) and (B) of designating certain facts to be deemed established for purposes of the action and preventing the City as the disobedient party from asserting certain defenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">The sanction imposed by Judge Fong is commensurate with the prejudice suffered by the plaintiffs as a result of the City\u2019s destruction of the traffic signal control box. If the control box had been produced, plaintiffs would have had the opportunity to prove through their experts that the traffic light malfunction was caused by the City\u2019s improper maintenance of the control box. Since the box and its contents were destroyed due to the fault of the City, it is only fair that sanctions be imposed so that the City does not benefit from its destruction of potentially significant evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">Judge Chang agreed with Judge Fong that sanctions should be imposed against the City for its destruction of the traffic signal control box. Judge Chang, however, disagreed with Judge Fong\u2019s use of the word \u201cnegligence\u201d in describing the City\u2019s culpability. Judge Chang was apparently worried that the word \u201cnegligence\u201d in the designated facts would confuse the jury with regard to the City\u2019s liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">The disagreement between Judge Chang and Judge Fong stems from the different connotations the two judges placed on the word \u201cnegligence.\u201d In the narrow sense, \u201cnegligence\u201d is \u201cthe failure to do what a reasonable and prudent person would ordinarily have done under given circumstances, as well as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>doing of what such person would, under the circumstances, not have done.\u201d <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>23 Haw. 74, 88 (1915). In the broad sense, \u201cnegligence\u201d connotes \u201c(1) [t]he existence of a duty on the part of the defendant to protect the plaintiff from injury; (2) the failure of the defendant to perform that duty; and (3) injury to the plaintiff from such failure of duty on the part of the defendant.\u201d <em>Medeiros </em>v. <em>Honomu Sugar Co., </em>21 Haw. 155, 159 (1912).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">Judge Fong\u2019s order granting sanctions apparently used \u201cnegligence\u201d in the narrow sense, meaning that the City would be deemed to have failed to do what it ordinarily should have done, that is, the City would be deemed to have failed to properly maintain the traffic signal control box. As made explicit in paragraph 3 of his order, Judge Fong did not preclude the City from proving lack of proximate causation, which is an element of the broader definition of \u201cnegligence.\u201d Judge Fong\u2019s order also made it clear that the City was not estopped from proving comparative negligence, assumption of risk or any other defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">Judge Chang apparently thought that the word \u201cnegligence\u201d in Judge Fong\u2019s order meant negligence in the broad sense, thereby establishing the City\u2019s liability with regard to breach of duty and proximate cause. Judge Chang therefore changed the word \u201cnegligence\u201d to a finding that the City had failed to properly maintain the traffic signal control box and consequently was responsible for the traffic light malfunction on the date of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">Our responsibility on review is not to decide which judge\u2019s order of sanctions is better worded, but whether the disagreement as to the wording of the designated fact was sufficient grounds for Judge Chang\u2019s order granting the City\u2019s motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">A judge should generally be hesitant to modify, vacate or overrule a prior interlocutory order of another judge who sits in the same court. Judicial restraint in this situation stems from considerations of courtesy and comity in a court with multiple judges, where each judge has equal and concurrent jurisdiction. <em>See generally </em>Annot., 132 A.L.R. 14 (1941). <em>See also Castner </em>v. <em>First National Bank of Anchorage, </em>278 F.2d 376, 379-80 (9th Cir. 1960); <em>United States v. Wheeler, </em>256 F.2d 745, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>746-47 (3d Cir.) <em>cert. denied, </em>358 U.S. 873 (1958); <em>Shreve </em>v. <em>Cheesman, </em>69 F. 785, 790-91 (8th Cir. 1895); <em>United States v. First National Bank and Trust Co. of Lexington, </em>263 F. Supp. 268, 270 (E.D. Ky. 1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">The normal hesitancy that a court would have in modifying its own prior rulings is even greater when a judge is asked to vacate the order of a brother or sister judge. The general rule which requires adherence to a prior interlocutory order of another judge of the same court thus commands even greater respect than the doctrine of \u201claw of the case\u201d which refers to the usual practice of courts to refuse to disturb all prior rulings in a particular case, including rulings made by the judge himself. <em>See </em>132 A.L.R. at 15. <em>Cf Jordan </em>v. <em>Hamada, </em>64 Haw. 446, 450, 643 P.2d 70, 72 (1982); <em>Cain v. Cain, </em>59 Haw. 32, 36, 575 P.2d 468, 472-73 (1978); <em>Gallas v. Sanchez, </em>48 Haw. 370, 382, 405 P.2d 772, 779 (1965); <em>Glover v. Fong, </em>42 Haw. 560, 578 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">Unless <em>cogent reasons </em>support the second court\u2019s action, any modification of a prior ruling of another court of equal and concurrent jurisdiction will be deemed an abuse of discretion. <em>See Greyhound Computer Corp., Inc. v. International Business Machines Corp., </em>559 F.2d 488, 508 (9th Cir. 1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 1040 (1978); <em>Shreve </em>v. <em>Cheesman, </em>69 F. at 791; <em>In re Airport Car Rental Antitrust Litigation, </em>521 F. Supp. 568, 572 (N.D. Cal. 1981), <em>aff'd, </em>693 F.2d 84 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">There was no cogent reason for Judge Chang\u2019s modification of Judge Fong\u2019s prior order of sanctions. As illustrated above, the orders of the two judges are substantially similar. Under both orders, the City is precluded from asserting that it properly maintained the traffic signal control box and from claiming that it was not responsible for the traffic light malfunction on the date of the accident. The City, under both orders, is also allowed the opportunity of proving lack of proximate causation and asserting other defenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">Since Judge Fong\u2019s order was not erroneous and there were no other cogent reasons which would justify a departure from the general rule of comity, we reverse Judge Chang\u2019s order which granted the City\u2019s motion for reconsideration of Judge Fong\u2019s order of sanctions against the City.</p>\n<p id=\"ADM\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">We now turn to Judge Chang\u2019s order which granted the City\u2019s motion for summary judgment. At the hearing on the motion for summary judgment, the court assumed for the purposes of the motion that (1) at the time of the accident, the traffic signal light was malfunctioning; (2) Rachelle Shields knew that the traffic signal light was malfunctioning; and (3) Rachelle Shields was attempting as a reasonable person to cross the street so as to avoid being struck by a motor vehicle. The court held that even assuming that these facts were true and Rachelle Shields was without fault, there was no legal basis upon which the City would be liable to the plaintiffs for the accident which occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">Although not expressly articulated, the court\u2019s apparent concern was that plaintiffs had failed to make a prima facie showing that the City had breached a duty owed to plaintiffs and that the City\u2019s breach was a proximate cause of Rachelle Shields\u2019 injuries. The court did not consider the question of Rachelle Shields\u2019 comparative negligence or assumption of risk, since it concluded that even if she was without fault, plaintiffs still could not have established negligence on the part of the City.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">We have previously held that \u201c[t]he basic theory of governmental tort liability in Hawaii is that the State and its political subdivisions shall be held accountable for the torts of governmental employees \u2018. . . in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances . . .\u2019 HRS \u00a7 662-2.\u201d <em>Salavea </em>v. <em>City &amp; County of Honolulu, </em>55 Haw. 216, 220, 517 P.2d 51, 54 (1973). In several recent cases, we have found that the City owes a duty of exercising ordinary care with regard to highway safety in order to protect the motoring public and pedestrians. <em>See, e.g., First Insurance Co. of Hawaii, Ltd. </em>v. <em>International Harvester Co., </em>66 Haw. 185, 192, 659 P.2d 64, 69 (1983) (\u201cduty owned by the City to the motoring public and pedestrians not to validate a truck-trailer driver\u2019s presence on the highways without an examination of his competence [by licensing procedures]\u201d); <em>McKenna </em>v. <em>Volkswagenwerk Aktiengesellschaft, </em>57 Haw. 460, 463, 558 P.2d 1018, 1022 (1977) (\u201c[City has] duty to exercise ordinary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>care to keep safe the shoulders of the highway where the accident occurred\u201d); <em>Terranella </em>v. <em>City &amp; County of Honolulu, </em>52 Haw. 490, 494, 479 P.2d 210, 213 (1971) (\u201cduty on the part of the proper county authorities to exercise ordinary care to keep safe not only the part of the road or highway customarily used by the traveling public, but also the part contiguous to the traveled part\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">The City and its director of transportation services likewise had a duty at the time of the accident to \u201c[l]ocate, select, install and maintain traffic control facilities and devices and street lighting systems.\u201d Revised Charter of Honolulu, Art. VI, \u00a7 6-1202(b) (1973) (subsequently renumbered as Art. VI, \u00a7 6-1102(b) (1978)). Pursuant to an agreement on July 28, 1966 between the City and the State of Hawaii, operational control of certain traffic signal installations, including the traffic lights at the intersection of Waialae and Kilauea Avenues, was transferred from the State to the City. The agreement stated that \u201c[t]he CITY shall have the full responsibility for and bear all costs for operating and maintaining the traffic control devices involved in the transfer of operational control.\u201d It consequently cannot be disputed that the City had the duty to properly maintain the traffic signal lights and control box at the intersection of Waialae and Kilauea Avenues.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">Because of the sanctions imposed on the City for its destruction of the traffic signal control box, the City\u2019s breach of its duty also cannot be disputed. Under the sanctions imposed by Judge Fong, it is an established fact for purposes of this action that the traffic lights were malfunctioning at the time of the accident because of the City\u2019s failure to properly maintain the traffic signal control box at Waialae and Kilauea Avenues.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">Since the City\u2019s breach of its duty to plaintiff Rachelle Shields as a member of the pedestrian public is established for purposes of this action, the only remaining issue concerning the City\u2019s negligence is whether the City\u2019s breach of its duty was the proximate cause of the accident. In <em>Collins </em>v. <em>Greenstein, </em>61 Haw. 26, 595 P.2d 275 (1979), we described the respective functions of the court and the jury on the issue of proximate cause as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-8\">In cases where reasonable persons might differ on the issue of proximate cause, the question is one for the jury. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>Where reasonable persons would not dispute the absence of causality, however, the court may take the decision from the jury and treat it as a question of law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-5\">In situations involving more than one probable cause of a plaintiffs injury and where there is conflicting evidence on this issue, the question of proximate cause remains a jury question.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 41-42, 595 P.2d at 284 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">In this case, reasonable persons could have differed on the issue of proximate cause. It is possible that a reasonable jury . could have determined that the City\u2019s improper maintenance of the traffic signal control box and the resulting traffic light malfunction was a substantial factor in causing the accident. In <em>McKenna, </em>we noted that \u201c[i]t is not necessary that the City\u2019s negligence be the whole cause or the only factor as under the \u2018substantial factor\u2019 test a negligent party will not automatically escape liability merely because other causes have contributed to the plaintiffs injury.\u201d 57 Haw. at 464, 558 P.2d at 1022.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">It is also possible that a reasonable jury could have determined that any intervening acts by the other original defendants in this action, that is, the driver of the vehicle which struck Rachelle Shields, and the manufacturer and distributor of the traffic signal control box, did not relieve the City from liability. In <em>McKetina, </em>we quoted with approval the following statement: \u201cIt is a rare case where the court may hold, as a matter of law, that the intervening act breaks the chain of causation because whether it was reasonably foreseeable is a question of fact and not of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 466, 558 P.2d at 1023 (quoting <em>Jones </em>v. <em>City of South San Francisco, </em>96 Cal. App. 2d 427, 435, 216 P.2d 25, 30 (1950)). <em>Accord, Mitchell </em>v. <em>Branch, </em>45 Haw. 128, 139, 363 P.2d 969, 976-77 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-9\">Since reasonable persons could have differed on the issue of proximate cause in this action, we accordingly reverse the trial court\u2019s order granting the City\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Summary judgment should only be granted in cases where the record reveals that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact. Where there are genuine issues of material fact, and the moving party is not able to establish that it is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law, the case should be remanded for jury resolution.
