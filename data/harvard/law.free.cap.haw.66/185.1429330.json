The primary question posed for decision is whether the City should be responsible in part for damages flowing from an accident where the City\u2019s negligence in licensing the driver of the truck was found by the jury to be a causative factor. We agree with the circuit court that in this case the City\u2019s conduct rendered the judgment against it for part of the sums previously paid by Hartford a proper one, and we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">The fatal mishap occurred on August 3, 1971 while Anthony Tekare, a truck driver employed by Oahu Turf, was operating the heavy truck and trailer combination on Likelike Highway and proceeding toward Honolulu. Shortly after he had traversed the Koolau mountain range through the Wilson Tunnel, the brakes on the rig apparently failed. The driver was unable to bring the truck and trailer to a stop, and they sped out of control down the highway and crashed into an automobile being driven by Frances Thomas. Six persons, including Tekare and Frances Thomas, were killed and two others suffered serious injuries as a result of the collision. The fatalities included two passengers in Frances Thomas\u2019 vehicle and two pedestrians.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">The ill-fated truck owned by Oahu Turf had been manufactured by International Harvester Company (Harvester); the trailer was owned by Hawaiian Equipment but leased to Oahu Turf. When the accident happened, the truck and trailer were being used to haul material for the Koolau Nursery under an agreement between the nursery and Oahu Turf.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>The calamitous accident caused a number of lawsuits to be brought against the owners of the truck and trailer. Hartford settled the claims for damages against Hawaiian Equipment and thereafter sought contribution from Harvester and the City for the amounts expended in the settlement. The contribution suits were tried before a jury in the First Circuit Court and a verdict finding the City responsible for fifty percent of such expenditures was returned. The circuit court entered judgment against the City in accord with the verdict, and the City subsequently perfected a timely appeal to this court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Though the City has raised several issues, the principal question on appeal, as we noted, is whether the City should be liable for damages flowing from its negligence in the licensing of the truck driver.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">The watershed decision in Hawaii on municipal tort liability for negligence in the performance of public functions w\u00e1s <em>Kamau </em>v. <em>Hawaii County, </em>41 Haw. 527 (1957). Like most American jurisdictions, we earlier followed \u201cthe so-called \u2018rule\u2019 that the municipality... [was] liable for torts committed by its agents in the performance of its private or proprietary functions but. . . [was] not responsible for torts committed in the performance of governmental functions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 530. But in <em>Kamau </em>our Territorial predecessors acknowledged the cases applying the foregoing \u201crule\u201d were \u201cin hopeless confusion\u201d and \u201cimpossible to reconcile,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 531, and after reexamining the \u201crule\u201d proclaimed</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-8\">that the narrow rule heretofore followed as to so-called \u201cgovernmental\u201d or public functions and \u201cproprietary\u201d or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>private functions should not control the question of municipal liability for its torts; that where its agents are negligent in the performance of their duties so that damage results to an individual, it is immaterial that the duty being performed is a public one from which the municipality derives no profit or that it is a duty imposed upon it by the legislature.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b205-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 552. \u201cThe basic . . . [principle] of governmental tort liability in Hawaii [now] is that the State and its political subdivisions shall be held accountable for the torts of governmental employees \u2018... in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances . . . \u2019 HRS \u00a7 662-2.\u201d <em>Salavea </em>v. <em>City &amp; County, </em>55 Haw. 216, 220, 517 P.2d 51, 54 (1973).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">Hartford\u2019s claim against the City is one for contribution; it rests on the City\u2019s alleged negligence in issuing a motor vehicle operator\u2019s license. Fundamental in any determination of liability for negligence is \u201cthe existence of a duty owed by the ... [putative tortfeasor] to the . .. [injured person].\u201d <em>Namauu </em>v. <em>City &amp; County, 62 </em>Haw. 358, 361, 614 P.2d 943, 945 (1980). However, \u201cit should be recognized that \u2018duty\u2019 is not sacrosanct in itself, but only an expression of the sum total of those considerations of policy which lead the law to say that the particular plaintiff is entitled to protection.\u201d W. Prosser, <em>Handbook of the Law of Torts </em>\u00a7 53, at 325-26 (4th ed. 1971). Our initial task then is to weigh the considerations supporting recovery by the injured person against those favoring a limitation of the City\u2019s liability to determine whether there was a duty owed by the City to those who suffered injury in the highway crash. <em>Kelley </em>v. <em>Kokua Sales &amp; Supply, Ltd., </em>56 Haw. 204, 207, 532 P.2d 673, 675 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"AmQ\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>B.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">A very substantial public interest in highway safety compels the licensing of motor vehicle operators. In Hawaii, the authority \u201cto examine into the qualifications and fitness of any person desiring to secure ... a license to operate a motor vehicle\u201d has been delegated to the counties. HRS \u00a7 286-101.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The licensing of an operator, however, does not render the City a guarantor of his competence, for it obviously can do no more than test a person\u2019s minimal competence to drive a motor vehicle. <em>See Pickering </em>v. <em>State, </em>57 Haw. 405, 409, 557 P.2d 125, 128 (1976). And when reasonable procedures adopted to examine the relevant qualifications and fitness are followed, there would be no reason for predicating liability on the issuance of a driver\u2019s license.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Otherwise, the City may be saddled with an impossible burden in the exercise of the delegated function. But we do not suggest the City should be free of liability under all circumstances. <em>See Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7 288C comment a (1965); <em>see also Jones </em>v. <em>Hittle Service, Inc., </em>219 Kan. 627, 631-32, 549 P.2d 1383, 1389 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">Here, the circumstances were such that a breach of duty could be premised on the City\u2019s authorization of Anthony Tekare\u2019s presence behind the steering wheel of the truck-trailer combination that \u201cbarreled\u201d down the Likelike Highway with catastrophic consequences. Since his operation of the rig was authorized, there was an implication that his fitness to do so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>had been examined and determined. <em>See </em>HRS \u00a7 286-102.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Yet the record discloses no examination was conducted to test even his minimal competence to drive the rig on a public highway without endangering the motoring public and pedestrians. Tekare was licensed a day or so before the accident on the strength of a single letter stating he had been found qualified to drive truck-trailer combinations by someone competent to examine applicants for licenses. The purported examiner, however, was not authorized to certify the qualifications and fitness of an applicant for a \u201cCategory 7\u201d license. Moreover, a deposition of the \u201cexaminer\u201d which was received in evidence at trial reveals he denied ever having evaluated Anthony Tekare\u2019s competence as a driver.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">The licensing procedures in effect during the relevant period called for the issuance of an instruction permit when application for a \u201cCategory 7\u201d license was made. The applicant would only be issued a license after his qualifications and fitness to operate the vehicles in this category were certified by someone competent to make such judgments. It was, of course, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>expected that the necessary certification would be preceded by testing. In Tekare\u2019s case no certification of the applicant\u2019s competence, as prescribed by the City\u2019s own procedures, was ever presented. Nevertheless, his operation of a potentially lethal instrumentality on the public highways was sanctioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">We think there was a duty owed by the City to the motoring public and pedestrians not to validate a truck-trailer driver\u2019s presence on the highways without an examination of his competence. And as the City\u2019s egregious conduct enhanced the possibility of harm befalling the victims of the accident, there was negligence that could give rise to recovery. <em>Cf. Oleszczuk </em>v. <em>State, </em>124 Ariz. 373, 376-77, 604 P.2d 637, 640-41 (1979) (as a statutory duty becomes more specific and narrow, it becomes more likely that the duty has been narrowed to one owed an individual).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">Having concluded there was a legal basis for the judgment in Hartford\u2019s favor, we proceed to the assertions that the circuit court erred in rejecting some of the expert testimony offered by the City. From our review of the record, we are convinced there was no prejudicial error in the rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-9\">The City\u2019s initial claim of error in the evidentiary rulings is related to the proffer of the deposition testimony of Derwyn M. Severy, who had initially been listed as Hartford\u2019s expert, as evidence at trial. While much of his deposition testimony was read to the jury, the trial court did not allow the reading of portions dealing with a \u201cbelt disruption monitor system\u201d which allegedly would have apprised the driver of the fatal rig that there was insufficient air for the air brakes to function, if such a system had been installed in the truck and trailer. The City maintains the accident could have been avoided by these means and the evidence was therefore relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-10\">Severy, however, acknowledged the system was not \u201cin common use in the manufacture of motor vehicles\u201d; he also had no knowledge of whether such systems were actually in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>use. We find no abuse of discretion in the trial court\u2019s rejection of the foregoing evidence on grounds that a proper foundation for its introduction was lacking. <em>See Friedrich </em>v. <em>Department of Transportation, </em>60 Haw. 32, 38, 586 P.2d 1037, 1041 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">The rejection of parts of the deposition testimony of a second \u201cexpert\u201d who had been designated by Hartford as a prospective witness, Tolerton Vaughn, is next raised as error by the City. The disallowed portions consisted of testimony on \u201chow a human error in handling the air brakes of the truck could not have caused a loss of air sufficient to result in a negative effect on the braking of the truck.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">This line of evidence presupposed a braking system that was operational. But the record indicates the brakes on the rig probably failed shortly after its emergence from the Wilson Tunnel. We could not deem as error the ruling by the trial court that testimony of questionable relevance ought not be read to the jury. ,</p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">c.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-9\">The City\u2019s final claim of error covers the trial court\u2019s decision not to allow the reading of those pages of the deposition \u201cwhere Mr. Vaughn rendered his opinion that the accident would not have occurred had the emergency relay valve been operating.\u201d Hartford\u2019s objection to the testimony was that it was speculative and based on hearsay. We would have to agree the testimony was speculative; it also gave an appearance of invading the jury\u2019s province. <em>See Friedrich </em>v. <em>Department of Transportation, supra; Bachran </em>v. <em>Morishige, </em>52 Haw. 61, 67, 469 P.2d 808, 812 (1970). Again, we see no reason to hold there was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-10\">And from our review of the record, we conclude the judgment is sustained by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AZ-\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number><em>Francis Nakamoto (Charles A.
