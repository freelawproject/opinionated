[non-profit] hospitals, infirmaries, and sanitaria as such.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">Queen\u2019s, a historic institution serving metropolitan Honolulu, was incorporated as The Queen\u2019s Hospital under a charter dated June 20, 1859; its name was changed to The Queen\u2019s Medical Center in 1967. The corporate charter empowers Queen\u2019s to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-6\">purchase, lease and otherwise acquire, and hold, real and personal property; to sell, convey, mortgage, lease or rent any of its property, and to exchange the same for other property; ... to build, establish, furnish, operate and maintain hospitals in Honolulu, and if its funds permit, at other places in the State of Hawaii, for the treatment of sick and disabled persons, and from time to time to enlarge, rebuild and repair such hospitals; * * * to make and enter into any and all such contracts as may be necessary or convenient to effect the purposes of said Corporation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>On May 20, 1974, ground was broken for the construction of the Queen\u2019s Physicians Office Building and parking facility after more than a decade of discussion and planning. Planning for an on-campus building to provide offices for physicians engaged in private medical practice commenced in 1967 when a recommendation of the institution\u2019s administrator to build such a structure as part of a long-range plan that included the construction of \u201cnew Pauahi and Bishop,\u201d two new hospital wings, was accepted in principle by the Board of Directors of Queen\u2019s. In the administrator\u2019s opinion, it was imperative from an economic standpoint that the institution \u201cprovide services and facilities to physicians which make it easy and desirable for them to admit patients to The Queen\u2019s Hospital.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">The rental of space in the Physicians Office Building and the operation of the adjacent parking facility commenced in August of 1977. On June 30, 1981, the State Director of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>Taxation (the Director) served Queen\u2019s with Notices of Assessment of Additional General Excise Tax covering the three fiscal years that ended on June 30, 1978, June 30, 1979, and June 30, 1980. Queen\u2019s was informed thereby that it was being assessed a total of $166,895.17 in taxes and interest due on the unreported gross income that had been derived from the office structure and parking facility. The assessments were promptly appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">In the Tax Appeal Court, the Director argued the gross income in question was not exempted from taxation by HRS \u00a7 237-23 since the \u201cleasing and rental activities\u201d that generated the receipts were \u201cusual and ordinary business activities.\u201d But the court found, as contended by Queen\u2019s, that the \u201ctaxpayer\u2019s primary purpose in constructing and operating the Physicians Office Building and adjacent parking facility was to further its activities as a hospital and not to produce income.\u201d And the court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-5\">Since the primary purpose for the taxpayer\u2019s activities in the Physicians Office Building and parking facility was to furnish better, more efficient and cost effective, complete medical care to patients, and not to produce income, all receipts from such activities are exempt under the general excise tax, \u00a7237-23(a)(8) and (b)(3).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">The Director\u2019s appeal to this court followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-9\">The privilege tax levied by HRS \u00a7 237-13 against individuals and entities on account of their business or other activities in the State \u201capplies at all levels of economic activity... and to virtually all goods and services.\u201d <em>In re Tax Appeal of Central Union Church, </em>63 Haw. 199, 202, 624 P.2d 1346, 1349 (1981). \u201cIn enacting [HRS] Chapter 237, the legislature [undoubtedly] cast a wide and tight net.\u201d <em>In re Tax Appeal of Island Holidays, Ltd., </em>59 Haw. 307, 316, 582 P.2d 703, 708, <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>59 Haw. 408, 582 P.2d 709 (1978). But the \u201cinherent pervasiveness ... [of the tax has been] mitigated by limited categories of exemptions from coverage provided for certain persons or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>entities, certain activities, and described transactions.\u201d 63 Haw. at 202-03, 624 P.2d at 1349.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">HRS \u00a7 237-23(a) enumerates the persons and entities who have been excused in whole or in part from payment of the tax. Queen\u2019s is among those so favored since \u00a7 237-23(a)(8) describes an exempt category composed of \u201c[h]ospitals, infirmaries, and sanitaria.\u201d But the exemptions granted pursuant to \u00a7 237-23(a)(5) to (8)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> are qualified exemptions that apply only</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AX2\">(1) To those persons<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> who shall have registered with the department of taxation on or before January 31 of each calendar year, or within one month after the commencement of business, by filing a written application for registration in such form as the department shall prescribe, and shall have paid for the registration an annual fee of $1, and shall have had the exemption allowed by the department or by a court or tribunal of competent jurisdiction upon appeal from any assessment resulting from disallowance of the exemption by the department; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>(2) To activities from which no profit inures to the benefit of any private stockholder or individual, except for death or other benefits to the members of fraternal societies; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-4\">(3) To the fraternal, religious, charitable, scientific, educational, communal, or social welfare activities of such persons, or to the activities of such hospitals, infirmaries, and sanitaria as such, and not to any activity the primary purpose of which is to produce income even though the income is to be used for or in furtherance of the exempt activities of such persons.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">Like the parties and the court below, we consider the nature of the activities in question, viewed in the light of the relevant language of \u00a7 237-23(b)(3), dispositive.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">The Director, as we noted, characterizes the operation of the office building and parking facility as \u201cordinary business activities\u201d; the taxpayer asserts the construction and operation of the structures were in furtherance of \u201cits activities as a hospital and not to produce income.\u201d It directs us to earlier decisions construing HRS \u00a7 237-23(b) where we regarded the primary purpose of the activity in question as controlling, particularly <em>In re Tax Appeal of Central Union Church, supra, </em>and <em>Oceanic Foundation </em>v. <em>Kondo, </em>53 Haw. 1, 486 P.2d 396 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">In <em>Central Union Church, </em>we examined a religious organization\u2019s operation of a non-profit retirement residence providing housing, meals, limited nursing care and other services for elderly persons and ruled the entrance and monthly service fees received from the residents constituted nontaxable gross income. The church\u2019s claim of exemption was premised on HRS \u00a7 237-23(a)(6), which excludes religious, charitable, scientific, or educational organizations from coverage under the general excise tax law, and \u00a7 237-23(b), which exempts from taxation the gross income from a \u201ccharitable activity\u201d of an exempt organization. The ruling that the receipts in question were not subject to the excise tax was grounded on a broad reading of the pertinent term; for we found \u201ccontemporary notions of philanthropy embody much broader objectives\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>than \u201cthe relief of poverty\u201d and \u201ca \u2018charitable\u2019 purpose now undoubtedly embraces a wide range of activities.\u201d <em>In re Tax Appeal of Central Union Church, </em>63 Haw. at 204, 624 P.2d at 1349-50.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">At issue in <em>Oceanic Foundation </em>were rents received from a subsidiary corporation by a foundation organized for scientific and educational purposes. The circuit court found the sublease generating the rental receipts was a dual-purpose lease designed to obtain the construction of educational and research facilities for the foundation, as well as to produce income. But it concluded the primary objective of the subleasing activity was to have the facilities constructed and thereby further the tax-exempt foundation\u2019s scientific and educational purposes. We affirmed the circuit court\u2019s ruling that HRS \u00a7\u00a7 237-23(a)(6)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and 237-23(b)(3) exempted the rents from excise taxation.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">It cannot be denied that <em>Central Union Church </em>and <em>Oceanic Foundation </em>furnish possible grounds for a ruling favorable to Queen\u2019s. There is room for argument, of course, that the primary purpose of the construction and operation of the Physicians Office Building and the adjoining parking facility was to further the taxpayer\u2019s activity as a hospital. Still, it is the statute itself to which we must look first for guidance. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Turkette, </em>452 U.S. 576, 580 (1981); <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>United States, </em>445 U.S. 55, 60 (1980); <em>Travelers Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>Hawaii Roofing, Inc., </em>64 Haw. 380, 383, 641 P.2d 1333, 1336 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">Queen\u2019s, as we observed, unquestionably is entitled to the exempt status granted by HRS \u00a7 237-23(a); \u00a7 237-23(a)(8) expressly provides that Chapter 237 \u201cshall not apply to\u201d hospitals, infirmaries, and sanitaria. The privilege bestowed thereby is nevertheless subject to the strictures set forth in the succeeding paragraph, \u00a7 237-23(b). We entertain no doubt that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>Queen\u2019s has satisfied the requirements of \u00a7 237-23(b)(l) and (2). Its registration as an exempt organization is a foregone conclusion. That the activities in question have been structured so no profit would accrue directly to \u201cany private stockholder or individual\u201d also is not open to serious challenge. But as the Director suggests, the circuit court\u2019s application of the limiting provisions of the third subparagraph is. And the logical focus of our inquiry is the language in \u00a7 237-23(b)(3) which complements \u00a7 237-23(a)(8) by stating that the exemptions enumerated in the latter subsection \u201cshall apply only to . . . the activities of such hospitals, infirmaries, and sanitaria as such.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">The earlier decisions cited by Queen\u2019s involved activities of organizations described in \u00a7 237-23(a)(6) rather than \u00a7 237-23(a)(8). We were asked in <em>Central Union Church </em>to give meaning to \u201ccharitable activity.\u201d We read it consistently with present-day notions of charity to encompass the operation of a non-profit retirement home by a church, for the term obviously embraces a broad spectrum of deeds. \u201cScientific\u201d and \u201ceducational\u201d were likewise applied liberally in <em>Oceanic Foundation. </em>Nothing in the statutory scheme suggested a legislative design not to have the relevant term applied other than broadly in either situation. In the situation at hand, however, the legislature has decreed that the privilege of not paying taxes shall be confined to the gross income received from the activities of a hospital \u201cas such.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">An accepted meaning of \u201cas such\u201d is \u201cin itself or in themselves.\u201d <em>See The Random House Dictionary of the English Language, </em>at 86 (unabridged ed. 1966); <em>see also Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary, </em>at 2283 (unabridged ed. 1967).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The presence of the critical phrase thus clearly narrows <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>the instances where an exemption applies, and we are not at liberty to read \u201cthe activities of such hospitals, infirmaries, and sanitaria\u201d expansively. While we do not doubt the construction and operation of an office building and parking garage can be related to \u201cbetter, more efficient, and cost effective medical care,\u201d we do not think the activities constitute hospital activities in themselves. We therefore conclude the gross income in question is subject to taxation.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AfT\"><em>T.

Subsections (1) to (9) thereof delineate specific persons or activities subject to the tax. None of the foregoing subsections covers the activities in question, but HRS \u00a7 237-13(10), a catch-all provision, ostensibly subjects the activities to excise taxation. Section 237-13(10) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-8\">Upon every person engaging or continuing within the State in any business, trade, activity, occupation, or calling not included in the preceding paragraphs or any other provisions of this chapter, there is likewise hereby levied and shall be assessed and collected, a tax equal to four percent of the gross income thereof. In addition, the rate prescribed by this paragraph shall apply to a business taxable under one or more of the preceding paragraphs or other provisions of this chapter, as to any gross income thereof not taxed thereunder as gross income or gross proceeds of sales or by taxing an equivalent value of products, unless specifically exempted.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b336-6\"> The administrator\u2019s proposal was accompanied by a covering letter which stated in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-7\">The attached proposal presents an aggressive, challenging, and ambitious program \u25a0which is urgently needed if The Queen\u2019s Hospital is to maintain its role in providing exemplary health care facilities and services to the patients and physicians in this community. It is my feeling that construction of new Bishop and Pauahi can be justified only if it is viewed as an integral part of a program to provide adequate facilities for patients and office facilities for physicians. Therefore it is imperative that there be simultaneous planning and construction of a physician\u2019s office building, new Bishop and Pauahi.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-8\">Under present operating conditions, which do not include a physician\u2019s office building, the construction of new Bishop and Pauahi provides bed facilities in excess of the need and represents a massive square footage lying idle for many years \u2014which is a shameful waste of facilities and an unjustifiable burden of expense to patients. However, it must be recognized that accelerating personnel costs and the increasing demands of non-revenue producing services against a fixed base of 431 beds is nearing the point of unreasonable cost to patients hospitalized at Queen\u2019s.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-9\">Therefore it is essential that the \u201crevenue base\u201d must be broadened to spread the cost of these increasing demands or a re-trenchment in demands must be brought about if we are to provide services to the individual patients at reasonable cost.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-10\">In view of new events in the health field, it appears almost impossible to re-trench, therefore aggressive programs to broaden the revenue base must be developed. I believe we must provide services and facilities to physicians which make it easy and desirable for them to admit patients to The Queen\u2019s Hospital. We must seek to increase the number of admissions to assist in paying for continuation and/or expansion of present programs and invitation of new programs.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b338-6\"><em> See </em>HRS \u00a7\u00a7 237-23, 237-3, 237-22, and 237-24 to 29.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b338-7\"><em> </em>HRS \u00a7 237-23(a)(5) to (8) read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-8\">(5) Fraternal benefit societies, orders, or associations, operating under the lodge system, or for the exclusive benefit of the members of the fraternity itself, operating under the lodge system, and providing for the payment of death, sick, accident, prepaid legal services, or other benefits to the members of such societies, orders, or associations, and to their dependents;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-9\">(6) Corporations, associations, trusts, or societies organized and operated exclusively for religious, charitable, scientific, or educational purposes, as well as that of operating senior citizens housing facilities qualifying for a loan under the laws of the United States as authorized by section 202 of the Housing Act of 1959, as amended by the Housing Act of 1961, the Senior Citizens Housing Act of 1962, the Housing Act of 1964, and the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1965 as well as that of operating a prepaid legal services plan;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-10\">(7) Business leagues, chambers of commerce, boards of trade, civic leagues, and organizations operated exclusively for the benefit of the community and for the promotion of social welfare which shall include the operation of a prepaid legal service plan, and from which no profit inures to the benefit of any private stockholder or individual;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-11\">(8) Hospitals, infirmaries, and sanitaria.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b338-12\"> \u201cPersons\u201d is broadly defined by HRS \u00a7 237-1 to include corporations and other entities, as well as individuals.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b340-9\"> When the case was decided, \u00a7 237-23(a)(6) was numbered as \u00a7 237-23(aX7).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b341-6\"> <em>The Random House Dictionary of the English Language </em>(unabridged ed. 1966) defines the phrase in these terms:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-7\">[A]s such, a. as being what is indicated; in that capacity: <em>The officer of the law, as such, is entitled to respect, </em>b. in itself or in themselves: <em>The position, as such, does not appeal to him, but the salary is a lure.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 86.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-9\"><em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>(unabridged ed. 1967) provides the following definition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-10\">[A]s such: in itself <em>(as such </em>the gift was worth little).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 2283.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
