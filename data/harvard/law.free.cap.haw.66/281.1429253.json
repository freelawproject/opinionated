The circuit court dismissed the Incest count on the ground that it did not charge an offense because it failed to allege the state of mind necessary to establish the offense. The State of Hawaii (the State) challenges the dismissal, asserting Incest is a general intent crime that does not call for the explicit allegation of a wrongful intent. Finding the dismissed count of the indictment was legally sufficient, we set aside the circuit court\u2019s order of dismissal and remand the case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">\u201cThe contention that an injury can amount to a crime only when inflicted by intention is no provincial or transient notion,\u201d <em>Morissette v. United States, </em>342 U.S. 246, 250 (1952); for the requirement of a culpable state of mind is deeply rooted<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and remains \u201cthe rule of, rather than the exception to, the principles of Anglo-American criminal jurisprudence.\u201d <em>Dennis </em>v. <em>United States, </em>341 U.S. 494, 500 (1951). The notion is iterated in the Hawaii Penal Code, as HRS \u00a7 702-204 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AiT\">State of mind required. Except as provided in section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>702-212, a person is not guilty of an offense unless he acted intentionally, knowingly, recklessly, or negligently, as the law specifies, with respect to each element of the offense. When the state of mind required to establish an element of an offense is not specified by the law, that element is established if, with respect thereto, a person acts intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">That the offense at issue includes a mental element and the establishment of Incest demands a showing that the defendant acted intentionally are undisputable; for it is a felony defined by the Penal Code and no legislative purpose to impose absolute liability for the offense or any of its elements clearly appears. <em>See </em>note 3 <em>supra; see also State </em>v. <em>Rushing, </em>62 Haw. 102, 105, 612 P.2d 103, 106 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">The question posed for decision here, however, is whether the indictment charging a violation of HRS \u00a7 707-741<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> must also contain an allegation of a specific intent to commit the proscribed act. The State argues Incest is a general intent crime and the absence of an express averment that the act was intentionally or knowingly committed did not render Count I of the indictment deficient in any way. The defendant asserts the omission was fatal because a recent amendment of HRS \u00a7 707-700(7) transmuted the crime to one where a wrongful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>intent must be explicitly charged.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> But we are not convinced the redefinition of \u201csexual intercourse\u201d in 1980 had the claimed effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">The State initially directs us to the Penal Code section outlining the crime in question and calls our attention to the fact that it does not prescribe exactly what must be proved with respect to the mental element of the offense. We are then reminded that \u201c[w]hen the state of mind required to establish an element of an offense is not specified by the law, that element is established if, with respect thereto, a person acts intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly.\u201d HRS \u00a7 702-204. And the State maintains there was no defect in the particular charge, since the governing procedural statute, HRS \u00a7 806-28, expressly provides an indictment need not allege the crime was committed intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly, \u201cexcept where such characterization is used in the statutory definition of the offense.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We cannot fault the State\u2019s reading of the statutes concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>The defendant, however, insists the indictment was infirm when viewed in the light of constitutional constraints, namely the requirement of due process and the prohibition against placing a person twice in jeopardy. In his opinion the broad meaning now attached to \u201csexual intercourse\u201d renders it imperative that an indictment charging a violation of HRS \u00a7 707-741 allege the prohibited act was accompanied by a culpable state of mind. Otherwise, he claims, totally innocuous acts may well be punished thereunder.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">A cursory examination of HRS \u00a7 707-741 and HRS \u00a7 707-700(7), as amended by S.L.H. 1980, c. 223, lends credence to his argument, as the gravamen of Incest is \u201csexual intercourse\u201d and the term now comprehends \u201csexual intercourse in its ordinary meaning <em>or any intrusion or penetration, however slight, of any part of a person\u2019s body, or of any object, into the genital opening ofanother </em>person.\u201d HRS \u00a7 707-700(7) (emphasis added). A literal application of the subsection would encompass, as defendant fears, some innocent acts. Among the possibilities broached by the defendant are the accidental \u201cintrusions or penetrations\u201d that may occur during an infant\u2019s bath, which he suggests could subject a parent to criminal prosecution under HRS \u00a7 707-741.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">The absurd and unjust results of reading the new definition of \u201csexual intercourse\u201d literally have not escaped us. Yet we are not bound to accept such consequences, for</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-7\">[i]t is well settled and established in this jurisdiction that courts are required to construe and interpret a statute where it is ambiguous, or, absent such ambiguity, where the literal application of the statute causes an absurd or unjust result and such literal application is clearly inconsistent with the purposes and policies of the statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-8\"><em>State </em>v. <em>Park, </em>55 Haw. 610, 614, 525 P.2d 586, 589-90 (1974); <em>see also Tangen </em>v. <em>State Ethics Commission, </em>57 Haw. 87, 93, 550 P.2d 1275, 1279 (1976); <em>Save Hawaiiloa Ridge Association </em>v. <em>Land Use Commission, </em>57 Haw. 84, 85, 549 P.2d 737, 738 (1976); <em>Pacific Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>Oregon Auto Insurance Co., </em>53 Haw. 208, 211, 490 P.2d 899, 901 (1971). Thus our task here is to determine whether a literal reading of the definition would be clearly inconsistent with the purpose and policy that induced the legislature to expand the meaning of \u201csexual inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>course.\u201d And if we decide an inconsistency would ensue, we are obligated to weigh whether a reasonable construction consistent with such purpose and policy could be placed upon the statute. <em>State </em>v. <em>Park, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">The quest for purpose and policy leads us to the legislative history of the amendatory legislation, where we find the redefinition of \u201csexual intercourse\u201d was prompted by a perceived need to \u201cupdate the sexual offenses section of the Penal Code.\u201d Sen. Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 39-80, in 1980 Senate Journal, at 960; Hse. Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 52-80, in 1980 House Journal, at 1107. Specifically, the amendment\u2019s purpose was \u201cto encompass more types of prohibitive action within the scope of sexual offenses\u201d because the prior definition was \u201crestrictive in its effect\u201d and failed \u201cto adequately cover within its scope certain acts which are <em>malum in se.\u201d </em>Hse. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 841-80, in 1980 House Journal, at 1673-74.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">We can only gather from the foregoing declarations of legislative sentiment that the intent was to incorporate within the Penal Code certain acts not covered previously by the provisions delineating sexual offenses. The particular acts the lawmakers had in mind were those that could be deemed <em>malum in se.</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>A reading that would include all intrusions or penetrations of any part of another person\u2019s body, accidental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>or otherwise, within the scope of \u201csexual intercourse\u201d would therefore be clearly inconsistent with the purpose and policy of the 1980 amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">Though seemingly unlimited in scope, the definition, in our opinion, can be reasonably construed to cover coitus in the ordinary sense and those intrusions or penetrations of another person\u2019s body that are considered \u201cinherently and essentially evil.\u201d <em>See </em>note 7 <em>supra. </em>For \u201c[w]here the letter of the law has produced a harsh result contrary to its intendment, we have not hesitated to eschew a strict interpretation and to seek meaning from its policy.\u201d <em>Montalvo </em>v. <em>Chang, </em>64 Haw. 345, 356, 641 P.2d 1321, 1329 (1982). Our interpretation would, of course, exclude those accidental intrusions and penetrations that may happen during an infant\u2019s bath; it would also preclude criminal prosecutions where other innocent intrusions and penetrations may occur, as in the course of a medical examination. HRS \u00a7 707-741, therefore, is not subject to the reading suggested by defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">Having concluded the offense in question outlaws coitus and certain immoral and injurious acts between persons who are within the degrees of consanguinity or affinity where marriage is prohibited, we proceed to the remaining issue, whether Count I of the indictment served to adequately inform defendant of the nature and cause of the accusation against him. The defendant\u2019s contention in this regard is that the stated count was deficient under the standards enunciated in <em>State v. Jendrusch, </em>58 Haw. 279, 567 P.2d 1242 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-9\">In <em>Jendrusch </em>we reiterated the fundamental precept that an \u201caccusation must sufficiently allege all of the essential elements of the offense,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 281, 567 P.2d at 1244, and said that \u201c[w]here the statute sets forth with reasonable clarity all essential elements of the crime intended to be punished, and fully defines the offense in unmistakable terms readily comprehensible to persons of common understanding, a charge drawn in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>the language of the statute is sufficient.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 283, 567 P.2d at 1245.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">The charge of Incest here was drawn in the language of the statute; it gave the accused \u201creasonable notice of the facts\u201d as required by HRS \u00a7 806-34,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> since it contained the particulars of an offense. We think it informed the defendant of all essential elements of the crime intended to be punished and sufficiently apprised him of what he must be prepared to meet, despite the absence of a specific allegation of the mental state necessary to establish the offense. <em>See Territory </em>v. <em>Yoshimura, </em>35 Haw. 324, 330 (1940). We further believe if other proceedings were to be brought against him for a similar offense, the charge provides more than enough information for him to plead an acquittal or conviction and avoid being placed in jeopardy again for the offense. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">Our conclusion that the crime was unmistakably defined despite the lack of an explicit averment of the mental state accompanying the prohibited act rests on the nature of the offense charged and the earlier conclusion that it is not a crime that can be accidentally or innocently committed. In some situations knowledge or intent \u201cneed not be alleged in terms, and a pleading is good if it fairly imports knowledge or intent.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Arteaga-Limones, </em>529 F.2d 1183, 1199 (5th Cir. 1976); 1 C. Wright, <em>Federal Practice &amp; Procedure </em>\u00a7 125, at 377-78 (1982). Incest as charged here is an offense where intent can be inferred because \u201csexual intercourse\u201d under the circumstances alleged could only be a wilful act.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AGt\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number><em>Nancy T.
