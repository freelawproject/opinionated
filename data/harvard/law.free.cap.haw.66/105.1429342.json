Papa, Sr., from a judgment of the circuit court affirming the denial by the Board of Trustees of the State Employees\u2019 Retirement System of his claim for service-connected total disability retirement benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">On July 12, 1968, the appellant, then a firefighter with the City and County of Honolulu Fire Department and a member of the Employees\u2019 Retirement System, injured his back while working on a fireboat. Several days later, he was admitted to Queen\u2019s Medical Center where Dr. Alan Pavel performed an operation on his back and excised a protruding disc at the L4-5 level. The appellant\u2019s condition improved and he returned to work in December, 1968.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">In June of 1969, while he was at home, the appellant felt a low back pain which radiated down his right leg. He was again hospitalized and on August 29, 1969, Dr. Pavel performed a laminectomy and fused the L-5 vertebra to the S-l vertebra to relieve the pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">On March 16, 1970, the appellant applied for service-connected total disability retirement, claiming that he was permanently incapacitated for gainful employment as a result of the July 12, 1968 accident. This application was made pursuant to the provisions of HRS \u00a7 88-77 which in pertinent part provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-8\">(a) Upon application of a member, or of the head of his department, any member who has been permanently incapacitated as the natural and proximate result of an accident occurring while in the actual performance of duty at some definite time and place, or as the cumulative result of some occupational hazard, through no willful negligence on his part, may be retired by the board of trustees for service-connected total disability provided that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-9\">(4) The medical board certifies that the member <em>is incapacitatedfor gainful employment </em>and that his incapacity is likely to be permanent. . . . [Emphasis added]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b122-10\">Pursuant to the foregoing statutory provisions, the application was referred to a medical board comprised of three licensed physicians. The medical board examined the appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>and found and certified that, as the natural and proximate result of the July accident, he was permanently incapacitated for the further performance of duty but recommended that he be granted <em>service-connected occupational disability retirement, </em>under HRS \u00a7 88-79, and not <em>service-connected total disability retirement, </em>under HRS \u00a7 88-77.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">HRS \u00a7 88-79, in pertinent part, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-6\">(a) Upon application of a member, or of the head of his department, any member who has been permanently incapacitated for duty as the natural and proximate result of an accident occurring while in the actual performance of duty at some definite time and place, or as the cumulative result of some occupational hazard, through no willful negligence on his part, may be retired by the board of trustees for service-connected occupational disability provided that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-7\">(4) The medical board certifies that the member <em>is incapacitatedfor the further performance ofduty, </em>that his incapacity is likely to be permanent. . . . [Emphasis added] HRS \u00a7 88-79 is a 1963 amendment to the Employees\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AIm\">Retirement System Law. <em>See </em>Act 127, S.L.H. 1963. The legislature explained the amendment as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-8\">Section 6 (adding a new section, designated as 6-46.1 [now HRS \u00a7 88-79]) would establish procedures for the application for, and determination of, retirement for service-connected occupational disability, a new category. For retirement system purposes \u201coccupational disability\u201d means permanent incapacity for the further performance of duty. This is designed to eliminate existing problems in granting full benefits for life when the applicant is incapacitated for the duties of his position. The Retirement System has experienced significant unanticipated costs under the present provisions. [1963 Senate Journal 845, Stand. Com. Rep. 497.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b123-9\">The Board accepted the findings and certification of the medical record and granted the appellant occupational disability retirement, effective July 1, 1970.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-10\">The allowance for occupational disability retirement is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>monthly pension of two-thirds of the retiree\u2019s average final compensation for a period of three years. HRS \u00a7 88-80. Thereafter, it is reduced to one-third of the retiree\u2019s average final compensation <em>unless </em>the medical board, within this three-year period, finds and certifies that the retiree is \u201ctotally incapacitated for gainful employment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In the latter event, the retiree continues to receive two-thirds of his average final compensation or the same allowance as that provided for service-connected total disability retirement by HRS \u00a7 88-78.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">The medical board did examine the appellant within the period as provided by the statute but found that he was not totally incapacitated for gainful employment. On the basis of the medical board\u2019s findings, the Board of Trustees refused to award the appellant benefits equal to service-connected total disability retirement allowances. The circuit court affirmed the decision of the Board of Trustees and the present appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">To be eligible for service-connected total disability retirement, the medical board must certify that the claimant is likely to be permanently <em>\u201cincapacitated for gainful employment.\u201d </em>HRS \u00a7 88-77(a)(4). (Emphasis added) The legislature has made this perfectly clear: \u201cFor retirement system purposes \u2018total disability\u2019 means permanent incapacity for gainful employment.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 1963 Senate Journal 845, Stand. Com. Rep. 497.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">The Board has construed the phrase \u201cgainful employment\u201d to mean <em>substantial </em>gainful employment. We think this is a fair and reasonable interpretation. <em>See Aaron </em>v. <em>Fleming, </em>168 F. Supp. 291 (D. Ala. 1958). Thus, where the claimant is permanently unable to engage in any substantial gainful employment which is commensurate with his education, training, experience, and physical and mental capacities, as a consequence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>his having been injured while in the performance of his duties, he will be deemed to be totally disabled within the intendment of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">In the present case, the Board found that the appellant could no longer be able to perform the physical work of a firefighter. Accordingly, it granted him <em>occupational disability </em>retirement benefits. The Board further found, however, that the appellant was still capable of performing substantial gainful work. Accordingly, it declined to award him <em>total disability </em>retirement benefits. The circuit court affirmed. In its findings of fact, the trial court wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-6\">Appellant, in his present condition, is not permanently incapacitated for gainful employment. He is physically capable of performing lighter work than he performed as a firefighter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-7\">Dr. Alan Pavel, Appellant\u2019s treating orthopedic physician from the time of his injury in 1968, indicated on two occasions that Appellant can do most light desk or paper work. Dr. Calvin Kam, a neurosurgeon who examined Appellant at the request of his former counsel, noted that \u201cMr. Papa can do some form of light duty.\u201d Dr. Herbert K. N. Luke, who examined the Appellant on November 8, 1973, stated that \u201cbased on the examination, he (Mr. Papa) appears to be capable of returning to some type of selected light work.\u201d Dr. Luke further stated: \u201cThe examination seems to indicate that he is not totally disabled permanently, but he is permanently partially disabled. It is my impression that this patient can return to work if he so wishes, but I gather from talking to him that he would prefer not doing so.\u201d Dr. Richard S. Dodge, an orthopedic surgeon and a member of the Medical Board which examined Appellant for the three-year evaluation, testified at the hearing before the hearing officer below that Appellant can do work that does not require heavy lifting and prolonged periods of sitting or standing and that Appellant is able, for example, to work as a security guard or a parking lot attendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">A review of the record fails to convince us that the findings of both the Board and of the trial court were clearly erroneous. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>Neither are we left with a firm and definite conviction that a mistake has been made. <em>De Victoria </em>v. <em>H&amp;K Contractors, </em>56 Haw. 552, 545 P.2d 692 (1976).</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AV2\"><em>Alvin T.
