Its petition to this court seeks also to expedite the appeal of an earlier order denying the State\u2019s petition for waiver of family court jurisdiction over the minor to enable criminal proceedings to be brought against him. Though an appeal by the State from such order would not lie, we are nevertheless convinced there was manifest error of a magnitude calling for an extraordinary remedy. But mandamus, an alternative remedy sought by the State\u2019s somewhat inartfully drawn pleadings, rather ihan prohibition, is the relief we find appropriate to remedy the family court\u2019s error in denying the State\u2019s request to allow the minor to be treated as an adult for the purported breach of law because of a lack of evidence on whether the minor was committable to or treatable in suitable institutions, a failure of proof engendered by his flouting of a court directive.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">Doe was seventeen years old on September 9,1982 when he allegedly engaged in conduct violative of HRS \u00a7\u00a7 134-8 and 708-840(l)(bX\u00fc). Were he an adult he would have been charged with the crimes of Possession of a Prohibited Firearm and Robbery in the First Degree respectively. But as he was a minor presumptively under exclusive family court jurisdiction, he was not charged with those felonies.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">The Prosecuting Attorney, however, petitioned the family court on the State\u2019s behalf for waiver of the court\u2019s jurisdiction over Doe and an order that he be held for trial as an adult in circuit court pursuant to the provisions of HRS \u00a7 571-22(a)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>which permit transfer of authority when certain preconditions are met. Exercising the discretion granted by Hawaii Family Court Rule 128,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the court first issued an Order of Examination and Appointment of Diagnostic Team, directing that Doe be examined by a court-appointed psychologist \u201cto determine and advise the Court whether ... [Doe] is committable to an institution for the mentally defective or retarded or the mentally ill,\u201d as well as a three-member diagnostic team, of which the psychologist was also a member, \u201cto investigate and advise the Court whether . . . [Doe] is treatable in any available institution or facility within the State designed for the care or treatment of children or adults under 20 years of age, or whether the safety of the community requires that... [Doe] continue under judicial restraint for a period extending beyond the age of 20 years.\u201d The appointed examiners were instructed to submit their reports to the court by November 24, 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">On November 18, 1982, however, they advised the family court of an inability to examine Doe because of his refusal to appear and answer questions. They explained that Doe\u2019s counsel \u201cinformed the team members he [counsel] would be available to receive questions from the team members and to relay and discuss the questions with the minor\u201d; but Doe \u201cmay or may not respond to the questions and any response would be in writing.\u201d Concluding this arrangement would rule out a proper examination, the team ignored counsel\u2019s proposal and filed the following finding instead: that no statement could be made \u201cas to whether the minor is committable to an institution for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>mentally defective or retarded or the mentally ill\u201d or \u201cas to whether the minor is treatable in an available institution or facility within the State designed for the care and treatment of children\u201d since no interview of Doe was possible. The team members nevertheless</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-5\">unanimously agreed that the safety of the community requires that the minor continue under judicial restraint for a period extending beyond age 20 years based on the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-6\">1. Severity of the offense coupled with the minor\u2019s age;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-7\">2. Previous history with the court which includes a prior adjudication for possession of a prohibited firearm;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-8\">3. There appears to be an escalation in the seriousness of the offenses for which he is now being referred.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b536-9\">Consequently, \u201cthe Diagnostic Team members recommended] that the Petition for Waiver of Jurisdiction be GRANTED.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b536-10\">A hearing on the Petition for Waiver of Jurisdiction was conducted by the family court on January 14, 1983, immediately after it denied the State\u2019s Motion for Continuance and to Compel Compliance with Order of Examination. Finding the State</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-11\">failed to prove by substantial evidence that: a)... [Doe] is not committable to an institution for the mentally defective or retarded or the mentally ill, b)... [Doe] is not treatable in any available institution or facility within the State designed for the care and treatment of children, or c) the safety of the community requires that... [Doe] continue under judicial restraint for a period extending beyond his minority,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b536-12\">the court denied the waiver petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-13\">When a Motion for Reconsideration was rejected, the State noted its intention to seek appellate review of the family court\u2019s decision to retain jurisdiction over the minor. The court, however, promptly scheduled an adjudicatory hearing on the purported law violations, which the State sought to have held in abeyance pending appeal. And when the request was denied, the State attempted to secure similar relief from this court through an Ex Parte Motion Staying Proceedings in the First Circuit Family Court Pending Appeal of Denial of Waiver <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>Petition. But we could not act affirmatively on the substantively deficient pleading submitted by the Prosecuting Attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">The unsuccessful attempt to have this court bring a halt to the adjudicatory proceedings was followed by the instant Petition for Writ of Prohibition. The petition, unlike the prior abortive effort to stop the family court adjudication of Doe\u2019s status, recited possible grounds for intercession on the State\u2019s behalf, and we temporarily stayed all proceedings below pending disposition of the request for extraordinary relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">The primary relief requested in the Petition for Writ of Prohibition, as we have observed, is a stay of proceedings; in essence it seeks what was denied when we dismissed the earlier motion for stay of the proceedings below pending its appeal. Before addressing the question of whether the requested ancillary relief is appropriate, we must decide whether the State may appeal from a family court refusal to relinquish authority over a juvenile offender. The issue is one we have not encountered previously.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-9\">We are bound here by the principle that \u201cthe right of appeal ... exists only when granted by constitution or statute.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Shintaku, </em>64 Haw. 307, 310, 640 P.2d 289, 292 (1982); <em>see also Chambers </em>v. <em>Leavey, </em>60 Haw. 52, 57, 587 P.2d 807, 810 (1978); <em>Samuel Mahelona Memorial Hospital </em>v. <em>County of Kauai Civil Service Commission, </em>46 Haw. 260, 263, 377 P.2d 703, 705 (1962); <em>In re Sprinkle &amp; Chow Liquor License, </em>40 Haw. 485, 491 (1954). And we have not been directed to a constitutional or statutory provision that expressly grants the State a right of appeal in this instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-10\">But the Prosecuting Attorney purports to find implied authority therefor, claiming \u201cthe proposition that an order against waiving jurisdiction is appealable by the State\u201d is implicit in HRS \u00a7 571-22.5. The cited provision, however, renders an order <em>waiving </em>jurisdiction appealable by a defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>dant only after trial; it reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-5\">Appeal of waiver of jurisdiction. An order waiving jurisdiction shall not be appealable as a final order, but may only be appealable in conjuction [sic] with an appeal of all other issues after a trial on the charge against such minor or adult.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">Nothing therein even hints that the State may also seek appellate review of an order <em>denying </em>waiver of jurisdiction. Nor is there anything in the relevant legislative history suggesting there may be more to the statute than appears on its face. <em>See </em>Hse. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 493-80, in 1980 House Journal, at 1493-94; Sen. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 1006-80, in 1980 Senate Journal, at 1519; Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 18-80, in 1980 House Journal, at 1077-78; Conf. Comm.Rep. No. 41-80, in 1980 Senate Journal, at 961-62. If a means for appeal by the State has been established, it would have to be elsewhere.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">The statutory section covering appeals from family court orders and judgments in general is HRS \u00a7 571-54, which states in pertinent part that \u201c[a]n interested party aggrieved by any order or decree of the court may appeal to the supreme court for review of questions of law and fact upon the same terms and conditions as in other cases in the circuit court.\u201d While the State is an interested party in a transfer proceeding, we do not view it as one aggrieved by a judicial decision to promote the rehabilitation of a juvenile offender under family court auspices rather than subject him to adult procedures. Significantly, the Prosecuting Attorney does not argue that his claim of a right to appeal rests upon HRS \u00a7 571-54. We thus conclude the State is not an \u201caggrieved party\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> when a waiver petition is denied and it lacks standing to appeal here.</p>\n<p id=\"A3D\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\">The holding that appeal rights have not been extended to the State in the situation before us, of course, precludes the issuance of an order restraining the court below until our review has been completed. Yet, this does not necessarily draw our inquiry to a close; for we may still intercede and cure a judicial lapse in the rare case where a need for extraordinary relief has been pleaded and demonstrated. This may be such a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">Though a writ of prohibition was the primary remedy prayed for, the State\u2019s pleadings were actually ambivalent in this regard. While the original petition sought prohibitory relief to protect the appeal, the Prosecuting Attorney\u2019s supplemental memorandum hedged in requesting a remedy and prayed in the alternative for an order \u201cdirecting the court below to follow the statutory rules,\u201d which we read as a plea for relief by way of mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">The extraordinary writ of mandamus is utilized on occasion \u201cto require ... [an inferior tribunal] to act in accordance with its prescribed powers when it. . . [is] its duty to do so.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Shintaku, </em>64 Haw. at 312, 640 P.2d at 293. Resort to mandamus is justified where the \u201cpetitioner has a \u2018clear and indisputable\u2019 legal right to performance of a duty owed by respondent . . . and . . . [the] petitioner lacks other means of adequately redressing the wrong or of obtaining the relief sought.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 309, 640 P.2d at 291-92 (citations omitted). The original jurisdiction vested in this court by virtue of HRS \u00a7 602-5(4)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and our general supervisory jurisdiction over the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>lower courts \u201cto prevent and correct errors and abuses . . . where no other remedy is expressly provided by law,\u201d HRS \u00a7 602-4,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> enable us to issue the writ when a need therefor has been shown. We think there is reason for us to act here.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">Doe is now subject to the family court\u2019s authority because HRS \u00a7 571-11(1) entrusts it with exclusive original jurisdiction in proceedings \u201c[cjoncerning any person who is alleged to have committed an act prior to achieving eighteen years of age which would constitute a violation or attempted violation of any federal, state or local law or municipal ordinance.\u201d This exclusive jurisdiction, however, may be waived under certain conditions. Should the court find \u201cthere is no evidence that the juvenile is committable to an institution for the mentally defective or retarded or the mentally ill and also that either he \u2018is not treatable in any available institution or facility within the State designed for the care and treatment of children\u2019 or \u2018the safety of the community requires that [he] continue under judicial restraint for a period extending beyond minority,\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Dinson, </em>58 Haw. 522, 526-27, 574 P.2d 119, 123 (1978), it may relinquish its authority in favor of the circuit court, where he would be subject to criminal procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">Acting in his capacity as the public officer primarily charged with initiating criminal prosecutions in the City and County of Honolulu, <em>see Amemiya </em>v. <em>Sapienza, </em>63 Haw. 424, 425, 629 P.2d 1126, 1128 (1981), the Prosecuting Attorney petitioned the family court for an order effecting a transfer of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>authority over Doe.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The court found good cause in the petition for the issuance of an order pursuant to Hawaii Family Court Rule 128, which governs the initiation of waiver proceedings, directing the examination of Doe by a diagnostic team of professionals appointed \u201cto investigate the matter and make a recommendation as to whether or not the statutory criteria of the Hawaii Revised Statutes section 571-22(a) are met, and whether or not... [he] should be waived for criminal proceedings.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> But the diagnostic team\u2019s efforts, as noted earlier, were frustrated by Doe\u2019s counsel, the ordered investigation was not completed, and the determination and advice sought of the team by the court relative to Doe\u2019s committability to an institution for the mentally defective, retarded or ill and his treatability in a facility for the care and treatment of children did not materialize.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">Shortly before the scheduled hearing on the petition, upon learning the examiners had been stymied by the recalcitrance of Doe and his counsel, the Prosecuting Attorney moved to compel their compliance with the order of examination and for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>a continuance of the hearing until the examiners were able to complete the tasks assigned by the court. Although the procedural rule governing such hearings expressly provides \u201c[t]he transfer hearing shall not commence until the transfer investigation has been completed,\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the court denied the foregoing requests, proceeded with the hearing, and dismissed the petition for want of substantial evidence on the matters it had ordered the examiners to investigate, determine, and submit recommendations on. In the course of the hearing, it summarily rejected the Prosecuting Attorney\u2019s requests that the State be allowed to call as a witness another psychologist who had previously examined Doe and that judicial notice be taken of the family court records pertaining to Doe.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">Given these circumstances, we would have to honor the State\u2019s plea that the court below be directed \u201cto follow the statutory rules.\u201d For there was an indisputable failure on the court\u2019s part \u201cto act in accordance with its prescribed powers when it was its duty to do so.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Shintaku, </em>64 Haw. at 312, 640 P.2d at 293.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">We are not speaking here, of course, about the order denying the waiver petition itself, for a decision premised largely on discretionary authority is normally free from recall by mandamus. <em>Id.; In re Tactacan, </em>42 Haw. 141, 142-43 (1957); <em>cf. Fong </em>v. <em>Sapienza, </em>39 Haw. 79, 81 (1951) (mandamus does not lie to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>control judicial discretion, except where there is \u201ca clear, manifest, otherwise irremedial abuse resulting in a denial of justice\u201d). We are referring to the court\u2019s action in proceeding to hear the waiver petition despite a clear mandate not to.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-3\">The statutory foundation of the family court\u2019s power to waive jurisdiction and order a minor to be held for criminal prosecution is HRS \u00a7 571 -22. But \u00a7 571 -22 sanctions a transfer of authority only \u201cafter full investigation and hearing.\u201d In accord therewith, we have made an investigation by a diagnostic team or the family court\u2019s staff the mandatory antecedent of a waiver hearing. <em>See </em>Haw. Fam. Ct. Rules 128 and 129. The court in this instance chose to have the investigation conducted by a diagnostic team and ordered that Doe be examined by its members. However, they could not conduct a \u201cfull investigation\u201d and so informed the court. Yet no steps were taken to enable the examiners to complete the assigned task, even in the face of a specific request therefor by the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">The State undoubtedly had a right to have lawful procedure followed in the consideration of its petition. Ordinarily, a judicial lapse would be correctable on appeal; but we concluded earlier that relief for the State through the avenue of appeal was precluded in this case. Thus, we are presented with a rare situation where mandamus lies to direct the action of a court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">Our decision to issue a writ is influenced in large degree by what we perceive may be the consequence of a decision not to. The widespread adoption of counsel\u2019s defiant ploy may well cause HRS \u00a7 571-22 to go for naught, and we would be remiss if we permitted the modicum of ingenuity displayed here to have this effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">A writ will issue, and the family court will be directed to set aside the order denying the Petition for Waiver of Jurisdiction, to compel compliance with the Order of Examination and Appointment of Diagnostic Team,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and to conduct a rehearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>on the petition upon the completion of the investigation by the diagnostic team.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"ACa\"><em>J.
