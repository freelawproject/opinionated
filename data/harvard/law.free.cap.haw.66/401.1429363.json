HPERB\u2019s findings of fact, conclusions of law, and order dismissing the complaints were affirmed by the First Circuit Court, and the teachers have sought further judicial review of the administrative decision. After a thorough examination of the record, we likewise arrive at a decision that HPERB\u2019s findings and its construction of applicable statutory provisions are not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-11\">Under the system for collective bargaining in the public sector authorized by HRS Chapter 89, public employees are accorded \u201cthe right of self-organization and the right to form, join, or assist any employee organization for the purpose of bargaining collectively.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> But employees are also free \u201cto <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>refrain from any or all . . . activities [related to collective bargaining], except to the extent of making . . . payment of service fees to an exclusive representative [of an appropriate bargaining unit] as provided in section 89-4.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">The thirteen teachers who have appealed belong to Bargaining Unit 5, which has been designated an appropriate unit for collective bargaining pursuant to HRS \u00a7 89-6, and HSTA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>has been chosen by a majority of the members therein as the exclusive representative of the unit. Although twelve of the thirteen teachers did not belong to the employee organization during relevant times, all of them were nevertheless subject to the payroll deductions for \u201creasonable service fees necessary to defray the costs for . . . services rendered [by HSTA] in negotiating and administering... [the collective-bargaining] agreement\u201d on behalf of the bargaining unit. <em>See </em>note 2 <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">On January 13, 1978, each appellant filed a prohibited practice complaint with HPERB, alleging HSTA had, since July 1976,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> improperly expended moneys received as service fees for partisan political and union membership purposes in violation of HRS \u00a7 89-13(b)(l) and 89-13(b)(4).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The specific remedy sought was either reimbursement or credit for any portion of the service fees disbursed in violation of HRS \u00a7 89-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">The hearing on the complaints commenced shortly thereafter. After conducting several sessions, HPERB continued the case in order to consider HSTA\u2019s Petition for Modification of Service Fee, which sought an increase in the service fees payable by employees in Bargaining Unit 5 for the fiscal year <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>beginning July 1, 1978.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The requested raise in fees was approved in November of 1978, and the Board subsequently resumed the continued hearing. HPERB Decision 129, the subject of this appeal, was issued on June 13, 1980. The decision, a fifty-two page document, consisted of detailed findings of fact and lengthy conclusions of law. Though HPERB found \u201cHSTA made expenditures out of service fees during the subject period in program areas clearly outside the scope of permissible service fee expenditures,\u201d it nonetheless concluded</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Abm\">that no prohibited practices as described in Subsection 89-13(b)(l) and (4), HRS, have occurred for the reasons that no willful violations of Complainant employees\u2019 rights have occurred such as would make out a case under Subsection 89-13(b)(l), and no unreasonable expenditures of service fee monies have willfully been undertaken such as would make out a case under Subsection 89-13(b)(4).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AE4\">HPERB therefore dismissed the complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">An appeal of the decision to the circuit court followed, and the court upon review of the record affirmed the decision in all respects. A timely request for further judicial review was perfected.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">The questions posed on the appeal to this court are: (1) whether HPERB erred in concluding HSTA\u2019s legislative and Constitutional Convention (Con-Con) lobbying efforts during the relevant period were confined to areas directly related to teachers\u2019 working conditions and therefore were chargeable to HSTA\u2019s service fee account; (2) whether HPERB erred in holding certain articles and editorials that appeared in various issues of the organization\u2019s news organ, Teacher Advocate, were political news items rather than candidate endorsements and therefore chargeable to the service fee account; (3) whether HPERB incorrectly interpreted the term \u201cwilfully\u201d as it appears in HRS \u00a7 89-13(b); and (4) whether HPERB erred in concluding certain expenditures made by HSTA did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>amount to violations of HRS \u00a7 89-13(b)(l) and 89-13(b)(4) because they were not made with \u201cconscious, knowing, and deliberate intent\u201d to violate HRS Chapter 89.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">Judicial review of decisions rendered by administrative tribunals like HPERB is governed by the Administrative Procedure Act, which in pertinent part provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-6\">Upon review of the record the court may affirm the decision of the agency or remand the case with instructions for further proceedings; or it may reverse or modify the decision and order if the substantial rights of the petitioners may have been prejudiced because the administrative findings, conclusions, decisions, or orders are:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-7\">(5) Clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">HRS \u00a7 91-14(g). Under the clearly erroneous test articulated above, a reviewing court will not disturb agency findings and conclusions unless it is left, after examining the record, with a \u201cdefinite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made.\u201d <em>DeFries </em>v. <em>Association of Owners, </em>57 Haw. 296, 302, 555 P.2d 855, 859 (1976); <em>see also Wailuku Sugar Co. </em>v. <em>Agsalud, </em>65 Haw. 146, 148, 648 P.2d 1107, 1110 (1982); <em>McGlone v. Inaba, </em>64 Haw. 27, 34, 636 P.2d 158, 163 (1981); <em>In re Hawaii Electric Light Co., </em>60 Haw. 625, 629, 594 P.2d 612, 616-17 (1979); <em>In re Kauai Electric Division of Citizens Utility Co., </em>60 Haw. 166, 186, 590 P.2d 524, 538 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-9\">We have further acknowledged that \u201c[i]n order to preserve the function of administrative agencies in discharging their delegated duties and the function of this court in reviewing agency determinations, a presumption of validity is accorded to decisions of administrative bodies acting within their sphere of expertise.\u201d <em>In re Hawaii Electric Light Co., </em>60 Haw. at 630, 594 P.2d at 617. Judicial deference to agency expertise has also been a guiding precept where the interpretation and application of broad or ambiguous statutory language by an administrative tribunal are the subject of review. For we have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>recognized the wisdom of</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-4\">a well established rule of statutory construction that, where an administrative agency is charged with the responsibility of carrying out the mandate of a statute which contains words of broad and indefinite meaning, courts accord persuasive weight to administrative construction and follow the same, unless the construction is palpably erroneous. <em>Estrin </em>v. <em>Moss, </em>221 Tenn. 657, 430 S.W.2d 345 (1968); <em>Udall </em>v. <em>Tollman, </em>380 U.S. 1 (1965); <em>Norwegian Nitrogen Products Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>288 U.S. 294 (1933).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ATy\"><em>Treloar </em>v. <em>Swinerton &amp; Walberg Co., 65 </em>Haw. 415, 424, 653 P.2d 420, 426 (1982) (quoting <em>Waikiki Resort Hotel </em>v. <em>City &amp; County, </em>63 Haw. 222, 242-43, 624 P.2d 1353, 1368 (1981)).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">The voluminous record proffered for our scrutiny discloses the circuit court was indeed mindful of the standard forjudging agency determinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">Appellants, however, urge the circuit court nevertheless erred in affirming HPERB\u2019s decision that HSTA\u2019s expenditures for lobbying, other than those related to efforts directed toward securing legislative ratification of collective bargaining agreements, were permissible uses of service fees. They strenuously argue the court also erred when it affirmed the agency determination that expenses covering the publication of certain articles and editorials in the Teacher Advocate, political in nature, were still permissible expenditures of service fee moneys. But we are convinced from our own review that the foregoing HPERB rulings are reasonable and not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">In its discussion of the line of demarcation between permissible and impermissible uses of service fees by employee organizations in Decision 129, HPERB noted it had previously expounded at length on the issue. The decision underscored what had been emphasized in HPERB Decisions 94, 78, and 7 with respect to the crucial statutory language, \u201ccosts for . . . services rendered in negotiating and administering an agreement.\u201d That the Board viewed the phrase as \u201ca term of art... [describing] a complex, comprehensive ongoing process of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>union representation of all employees in the bargaining unit\u201d was reiterated.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> And the task of separating allowable costs from the \u201cso-called \u2018union membership\u2019 costs\u201d was characterized again as \u201calmost impossible.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We would have to agree that the duty of allocation delegated to HPERB by the legislature is by no means simple and may be well-nigh impossible. For as the Supreme Court has observed, \u201c[t]here will, of course, be difficult problems in drawing lines between collective-bargaining activities, for which contributions may be compelled, and ideological activities unrelated to collective bargaining, for which such compulsion is prohibited.\u201d <em>Abood </em>v. <em>Detroit Board of Education, </em>431 U.S. 209, 236 (1977). Moreover, \u201cin the public sector the line may be somewhat hazier\u201d than in the private. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">We have combed through the record with these considerations and the statutory standard of review in mind to decide Whether there is merit in appellants\u2019 assertion that the chronicle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>of proceedings before the Board cannot sustain the decisions reached by HPERB and the circuit court. But the record gives no support to this claim. Rather, we are convinced by our reading thereof that HPERB\u2019s findings and conclusions regarding HSTA\u2019s lobbying activities and publication of news articles and editorials in the Teacher Advocate are reasonable and supportable. The obvious mistake demanded for reversal of an agency decision does not appear. HRS \u00a7 91-14(g); <em>see also In re Hawaii Electric Light Co., </em>60 Haw. at 630, 594 P.2d at 617; <em>In re Kauai Electric Division of Citizens Utility Co., </em>60 Haw. at 187, 590 P.2d at 538.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">Turning to appellants\u2019 assertion that HPERB incorrectly interpreted \u201cwilfully\u201d as it is employed in HRS \u00a7 89-13(b), we observe at the outset that the related legislative history is devoid of any reference thereto. HPERB thus logically sought aid from a dictionary, and relying on the discussion of the pertinent term in <em>Black\u2019s Law </em>Dictionary,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> ruled \u201cthat to make</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>out a prohibited practice under Subsection 89-13(b), HRS, conscious, knowing, and deliberate intent to violate the provisions of chapter 89, HRS, must be proven.\u201d We have no reason to reject the construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">Though appellants forcefully argue an act committed \u201cvoluntarily\u201d and \u201cwith plain indifference\u201d to the law can only be one \u201cwilfully\u201d committed, we are not persuaded that the crucial word can only be read as they suggest. We earlier noted a presumption of validity attaches to decisions of administrative bodies \u201cacting within their sphere of expertise.\u201d <em>In re Hawaii Electric Light Co., </em>60 Haw. at 630, 594 P.2d at 617. HPERB is empowered pursuant to HRS \u00a7 89-1 to administer HRS Chapter 89, Collective Bargaining in Public Employment, with specific authority to \u201c[cjonduct proceedings on complaints of prohibited practices . . . and take such actions with respect thereto as it deems necessary and proper.\u201d HRS \u00a7 89-5(b)(4). Furthermore, we customarily accord persuasive weight to the construction given words of broad and indefinite meaning by the agency charged with the responsibility of carrying out the mandate of the statute in question, unless the construction is palpably erroneous. <em>Treloar </em>v. <em>Swinerton &amp; Walberg Co., </em>65 Haw. at 424, 653 P.2d at 426. We do not find HPERB\u2019s reading of \u201cwilfully\u201d to be so.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">v.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">The remaining question is whether HPERB erred in holding that while HSTA made disbursements \u201cout of service fees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>during the subject period in program areas clearly outside the scope of permissible service fee expenditures,\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> no prohibited practices resulted because \u201cno willful violations of Complainant employees\u2019 rights have occurred such as would make out a case under Subsection 89-13(b)(1), and no unreasonable expenditures ... have willfully been undertaken such as would make out a case under Subsection 89-13(b)(4).\u201d</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AWU\"><em>Jared H.

The agency officially charged with the task of drawing the lines here has deemed it an \u201calmost impossible\u201d one. We therefore cannot expect that such lines would be readily discernible, particularly where the permissible and the impermissible have not been clearly distinguished by prior decision. And when we apply the clearly erroneous test in the haze of uncertain statutory language, we too are left with an impression that the disbursements in question were not made with \u201cconscious, knowing, and deliberate intent to violate the provisions of Chapter 89, HRS.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">The decision of the circuit court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b418-12\"> Prior to 1981 and during the period covered by this appeal, HRS \u00a7 89-3 read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AN0\">Rights of employees.

The phrase embraces activities which go beyond, but are reasonably related to, direct across the table negotiations and grievance processing. Such activities, at minimum, include all of the statutory representational duties imposed on exclusive representatives by Subsections 89-9(a) [negotiations], 89-9(c) [consultation on employment matters including those which may be nonnegotiable under 89-9(d)], and 89-8(a), HRS.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b424-8\"> The following excerpt from Decision 7 was quoted in Decision 129:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-9\">In the final analysis, this almost impossible task of allocation can be best approached and undertaken by a process of exclusion of so-called \u2018union membership benefit* costs from the total costs of operations as the statutory language seems to suggest. The approach suggested by the AFT of limiting allowable costs to direct-contact negotiations and bargaining must therefore be refused. We view the words \u2018negotiating and administering an agreement\u2019 ds a term of art which generally encompasses the entire collective bargaining and representation activities of the representative with the employer, including all preliminary planning, preparation, training, budgeting and organizational efforts and \u2018tooling up\u2019 process related to \u00e1 negotiating contract and administering the same after its consummation. It virtually amounts to a residuum of the union\u2019s total activities after the \u2018union membership benefits\u2019 have been isolated and removed.

The one is positive and the other negative.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-10\">Premeditated; malicious; done with evil intent, or with a bad motive or purpose, or with indifference to the natural consequences; unlawful; without legal justification.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-11\"><em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1434 (5th ed. 1979) (emphasis added by HPERB in Decision 129).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b427-10\"> The program areas where the questionable expenditures occurred included programs designed \u201cTo Develop and Maintain a Grass-Roots Political Apparatus Which Includes a Precinct Level Organization,\u201d \u201cTo Elect to Public Office Those Who Have Proven or Stand to Prove That They Support the Goals and Objectives of HSTA,\u201d and \u201cTo Increase the Membership.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b427-11\">HSTA charged some of the expenses connected with the programs to its service fee account.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<p id=\"b428-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>CONCURRING OPINION BY</p>\n<author id=\"AJ6\">PADGETT, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">I concur in the above opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">As the opinion notes, HPERB found that HSTA made disbursements \u201cout of service fees during the subject period in program areas clearly outside the scope of permissible service fee expenditures.\u201d I write this concurring opinion to make clear that the appellants have not, in these proceedings, properly raised any contention that those improper expenditures violated their rights under the State and Federal Constitutions. <em>Compare Abood </em>v. <em>Detroit Bd. of Education, </em>431 U.S. 209, 97 S.Ct. 1782, 52 L.Ed.2d 261 (1977); <em>International Ass\u2019n of Machinists </em>v. <em>Street, </em>367 U.S. 740, 81 S.Ct. 1784, 6 L.Ed.2d 1141 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">On an examination of the record, it is clear that no such issue was raised by appellants in their pleadings in the court below. Moreover, on the eve of oral argument, appellants filed a document entitled \u201cNotice of Pending Federal Cases and Reservation of Rights Under Federal Law\u201d making clear that they did not desire to submit such issues to this court. Accordingly, no constitutional issue is before us in this case.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
