(Morrison-Knudsen or the contractor) sought a substantial modification of an arbitrator\u2019s award favoring The Makahuena Corporation (Makahu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>ena or the owner-developer) pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) Chapter 658. The Circuit Court of the First Circuit, however, confirmed the award with only a slight modification, and the contractor appeals. It asserts the circuit court erred in rejecting an offer of proof that purportedly would have demonstrated the arbitrator\u2019s miscalculation of the damages sustained by the owner-developer and in several other respects. What the court rejected were self-serving exhibits consisting of detailed analyses of evidentiary matter presented to the arbitrator and related testimony. We think any alleged miscalculation that could only be established by such means could hardly be deemed \u201can evident miscalculation of figures.\u201d And as the other claims of arbitral mistake were addressed to the merits of the award, we affirm the circuit court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">The disputes underlying the arbitration and the award at issue arose from the design by Team Pacific, Inc. (the architect) and the construction by Morrison-Knudsen of \u201cThe Makahuena,\u201d a condominium apartment building located at Poipu, Kauai. The Standard Form of Agreement Between Owner and Architect provided for the arbitration of all claims, demands, and disputes arising thereunder. The construction contract likewise called for the settlement of disputes through the arbitral process. At or near the completion of the construction, questions concerning the performance of both architect and contractor were raised by the owner-developer, who claimed defects in the design of the building as well as in its construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">Although separate claims were advanced against the architect and the contractor by the owner-developer and the initial demand for arbitration was raised under the construction agreement, the parties after protracted discussions and several abortive attempts to expedite the resolution of the disputes finally executed a tri-partite arbitration agreement. The parties agreed Judge Masato Doi, a retired circuit judge, would \u201carbitrate all disputes between or among each other in a single arbitration proceeding\u201d and that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-7\">[t]he Arbitrator\u2019s decision and award shall be final and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>binding on all parties to this Agreement and shall not be subject to appeal. A judgment shall be entered upon the decision and award in the appropriate Circuit Court or Courts of the State of Hawaii. Other than as provided in said Chapter 658, no appeal may be taken from a judgment entered upon an award.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">The hearings before Judge Doi commenced on October 5, 1981 and extended through April 22, 1982. He issued his decision and awards favoring the owner-developer on July 30, 1982, the award against the architect amounting to $415,699 and that against the contractor adding up to the large sum of $3,412,628. Makahuena promptly sought judicial confirmation of the awards pursuant to HRS \u00a7 658-8,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and Morrison-Knudsen quickly followed with its application for judicial relief from the arbiter\u2019s ruling. While the contractor initially cited HRS \u00a7\u00a7 658-9<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and 658-10 as grounds for vacating or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>modifying the award of $3,412,628, the attempt to vacate the award was abandoned later and modification pursuant to \u00a7 658-10<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> was the relief ultimately requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-4\">When the competing motions for confirmation and for correction were heard, the foundation of Morrison-Knudsen\u2019s effort to establish the alleged miscalculation of figures consisted of evidence extrinsic of the record made before the arbitrator. The exhibits offered to the circuit court as proof of inaccurate computation were the product of certified public accountants who, at the behest of the contractor, had \u201cperformed certain agreed upon procedures with respect to award items\u201d that were being challenged by the contractor. The proffered evidence consisted of the accountants\u2019 \u201canalysis\u201d of the contested award claims, the notes accompanying the \u201canalysis,\u201d their conclusions regarding the challenged award items, and testimony related thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">But the court saw no reason to plunge into the extensive review implicit in the offer of such \u201cproof.\u201d And it concluded after considering the written and oral arguments of the parties that the \u201cevident miscalculation of figures\u201d was limited to a sum of $590 in the award against the architect and $1,720 in that adverse to the contractor. The awards were confirmed with reductions in the foregoing amounts by the order and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>judgment entered below, and Morrison-Knudsen\u2019s appeal to this court followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">s Though several issues are raised on appeal, the'basic question is whether the policy on \u201cArbitration and Awards\u201d declared by the legislature would countenance what was unsuccessfully urged upon the circuit court by Morrison-Knudsen.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-8\">We have not hesitated to state our general view on the judicial consideration of arbitration awards in forthright terms \u2014 HRS Chapter 658 \u201cconfine[s] judicial review to the strictest possible limits. <em>Richards </em>v. <em>Ontai, </em>20 Haw. 198 (1910); <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Lunalilo Estate, </em>5 Haw. 39 (1883).\u201d <em>Mars Constructors, Inc. </em>v. <em>Tropical Enterprises, Ltd., </em>51 Haw. 332, 335, 460 P.2d 317, 319 (1969). For \u201can extensive ... review of arbitration awards would frustrate the intent of the parties to avoid litigation and would also nullify the legislative objective in the enactment of the Arbitration and Awards statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 335, 460 P.2d at 319. And we have often reiterated the obvious by stating an arbitrator\u2019s decision \u201ccan only be vacated or modified in accordance with HRS Chapter 658.\u201d <em>Loyalty Development Co. </em>v. <em>Wholesale Motors, Inc., </em>61 Haw. 483, 488, 605 P.2d 925, 928 (1980). <em>See also University of Hawaii Professional Assembly ex rel. Daeufer </em>v. <em>University of Hawaii, </em>66 Haw. 214, 224-25, 659 P.2d 720, 726-28 (1983); <em>Kim v. Mel Cummins Building Contractor, Inc., </em>57 Haw. 186, 188, 552 P.2d 1117, 1118 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-9\">Morrison-Knudsen invoked HRS \u00a7 658-10 in seeking modification. The thrust of its argument was that there were duplications and overstatements of damage items. This, it averred, resulted in a miscalculation of the amount of the award. The applicable subsection, \u00a7 658-10(1), demands that a miscalculation subject to correction thereunder must be \u201can evident miscalculation of figures.\u201d We have yet to spell out exactly what is encompassed by the phrase. But a clear legislative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>policy to further the objectives of arbitration<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and a desired consistency in applying the provisions of Chapter 658 compel us to read the phrase narrowly and confine judicial review pursuant to \u00a7 658-10(1) \u201cto the strictest possible limits.\u201d <em>Mars Constructors, Inc., </em>51 Haw. at 335, 460 P.2d at 319.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-4\">Read in this light, \u201cevident miscalculation of figures\u201d can only mean \u201cmathematical errors committed by arbitrators which would be patently clear to a reviewing court.\u201d <em>Carolina Virginia Fashion Exhibitors, Inc. </em>v. <em>Gunter, </em>41 N.C. App. 407, _, 255 S.E.2d 414, 419 (1979). <em>Cf. DeMello v. Souza, </em>36 Cal. App. 3d 79, 86, 111 Cal. Rptr. 274, 279 (1973) (\u201cit is manifest that the award did not reveal on its face a miscalculation of figures . . .\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-8\">The mistakes ascribed to the arbitrator by Morrison-Knudsen were for the most part purported \u201cduplications.\u201d What it hoped to establish with matter foreign to the record of the arbitration proceeding was that in twenty-three instances it had been assessed twice or more for an item of defective work. Yet as the circuit court observed, the arbitrator\u2019s decision stated \u201cthe element of possible duplication of costs in the various items of work as well as possible increases in construction costs have also been considered.\u201d And as Makahuena protested, the court\u2019s acceptance of the proffered proof would have impelled a rebuttal on its part of the opinions and conclusions of the public accountants that would have entailed numerous references to and extensive discussion of the tran<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>script of the proceeding before Judge Doi and the exhibits presented to him. This then would have placed the court in an anomalous situation of having to weigh the evidence in the record against the extrinsic evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">No such procedure is tolerated by HRS Chapter 658, for it was designed to foster the integrity of the arbitral process. <em>Mars Constructors, Inc., </em>51 Haw. at 334-35, 460 P.2d at 319. Thus, we cannot fault the circuit court\u2019s rejection of the material and testimony offered by Morrison-Knudsen to prove the purportedly erroneous computations. Any miscalculation provable only by these means could not have been \u201ca patently clear mathematical error\u201d correctable pursuant to HRS \u00a7 658-10(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">We also conclude as the circuit court did that the other claims of computational error advanced by the contractor do not fall within the purview of HRS \u00a7 658-10 and that the award was not vitiated by the arbitrator\u2019s allowance of \u201cpost-judgment interest in excess of that provided in HRS \u00a7 478-2.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b686-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-9\">Morrison-Knudsen asserts there was an \u201coverstatement\u201d of damages because \u201c[t]he arbitrator used various estimates for various items of work and averaged them to compute his damage award for the particular work item.\u201d He should, it claims, \u201chave used the lowest responsible estimate.\u201d Still, \u201cthe fact that an arbitrator may err in applying the law, finding facts, or in construing the contract, or enters an award that is contrary to the evidence adduced, is insufficient grounds for judicial reversal.\u201d <em>University of Hawaii Professional Assembly ex rel. Daeufer, </em>66 Haw. at 228-29, 659 P.2d at 728. After all, it was agreed \u201c[t]he Arbitrator\u2019s decision and award shall be final and binding on all parties to this Agreement and shall not be subject to appeal,\u201d and it was his judgment they had bargained for, not a court\u2019s. <em>Cf. United Steelworkers of America </em>v. <em>Enterprise Wheel &amp; Car Corp., </em>363 U.S. 593, 599 (1960) (\u201cIt is the arbitrator\u2019s construction which was bargained for; and ... <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>the courts have no business overruling him because their interpretation of the contract is different from his.\u201d). HRS \u00a7 658-10 thus gave the circuit court no reason to even consider whether the arbitrator should \u201chave used the lowest possible estimate\u201d in fixing the sum to be assessed for an item of defective construction, since nothing in the statute intimates the merits of an arbitration award are judicially reviewable. <em>Mars Constructors, Inc., </em>51 Haw. at 336, 460 P.2d at 319.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">Morrison-Knudsen attacks the award as well as the judgment below for assessing \u201cpost-judgment interest in excess of that provided in HRS \u00a7 478-2.\u201d The pertinent award provision recited that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-6\">[s]aid payments [of the awards against the architect and the contractor] shall be made on or before August 16, 1982; and if not so paid, interest on any portion not so paid shall [be] assessed thereon at the monthly floating prime rate of interest established by the First Hawaiian Bank (Honolulu, Hawaii) plus two percent, retroactive to the date hereof.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Al2\">Since the possible payment of \u201cinterest\u201d at two percent above First Hawaiian Bank\u2019s \u201cfloating prime rate\u201d as assessed by the arbitrator was confirmed in the judgment entered by the circuit court and HRS \u00a7 478-2 allows \u201c[i]nterest at the rate of ten percent a year, and no more,... on any judgment recovered before any court in the State, in any civil suit,\u201d the judgment appears at first sight to be at odds with the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">But Makahuena argues the inconsistency is more illusory than real, for what is labelled \u201cinterest\u201d was actually intended by the arbitrator as compensation for damages. It contends the award served to compensate the owner-developer for money borrowed at two percent above the prime rate which the contractor had \u201capplied for and was paid\u201d under the construction contract it had not fulfilled. And by ordering the payment of \u201cinterest\u201d on any portion of the damage award not paid promptly, the arbitrator \u201cwas simply providing compensation for further damages\u201d that would be occasioned by any delay in payment. Morrison-Knudsen tacitly acknowledges that if the arbitrator\u2019s decision and award are binding a delay in payment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>would result in further damages, which would be measurable by the interest that would continue to accrue on Makahuena\u2019s construction loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">Like the circuit court, we think it reasonable under the circumstances to consider the \u201cinterest\u201d assessed by the arbitrator as compensation or a penalty to prevent further damages rather than interest \u201con any judgment recovered before any court in the State, in any civil suit.\u201d <em>See </em>HRS \u00a7 478-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">The final claim of error advanced by Morrison-Knudsen is related solely to judicial action. The contention is that the confirmation of the award with only the slight modification neither party found objectionable was clear error because $1,529,120 had been paid in partial satisfaction of the award prior to the entry of the court\u2019s order and judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-8\">But HRS \u00a7 658-8 contemplates a judicial confirmation of the award issued by the arbitrator, \u201cunless the award is vacated, modified, or corrected\u201d in accord with HRS \u00a7\u00a7 658-9 and <em>658-10. See </em>note 1 <em>supra. </em>The circuit court\u2019s action conformed to the statutory mandate in both respects; it confirmed the decision and award as issued, but with the correction of \u201can evident miscalculation.\u201d We discern no error on the part of the court or prejudice to Morrison-Knudsen here, for it is fundamental that a party \u201ccould have but one satisfaction of judgment.\u201d <em>Kealoha </em>v. <em>Halawa Plantation, Ltd., </em>24 Haw. 436, 439 (1918).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-9\">Finding no grounds <em>for </em>reversal, we affirm the order and judgment of the circuit court.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys id=\"AFAQ\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number><em>Howard K.
