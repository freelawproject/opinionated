A single point is raised on appeal. Appellant pled guilty to the charge of prostitution and her attorney made an oral motion for a deferred acceptance of guilty plea under \u00a7 853-1, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>HRS. The trial court held that under \u00a7 712-1200(4), he could not grant such a plea. Subsection 4 was added by Act 110 of the Session Laws of 1981. It provides:</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AjS\"><em>Keith M. Kiuchi, </em>Deputy Public Defender, on the briefs, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"A5\"><em>Arthur E. Ross, </em>Deputy Prosecuting Attorney, and <em>John M. Conte, </em>law student intern, on the brief, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-4\">Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, a person convicted of committing the offense of prostitution shall be sentenced as follows:</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">(a) For the first offense, a fine of $500 ....</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">Since the last amendment to \u00a7 853-1, HRS, was by \u00a7 42 of Act 232 of the Session Laws of 1980, we think that \u00a7 853-1, HRS, is \u201cany other law to the contrary\u201d and that the court below therefore correctly construed \u00a7 712-1200(4) as taking away his power to grant deferred acceptance of guilty pleas in prostitution cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
