The issues raised on appeal are the propriety of not apportioning death benefits in this case and of assessing one employer for the attorney\u2019s fees and costs of a concurrent employer when the former instituted the appeal and lost. For reasons set forth below, we affirm the Board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-8\">Medeiros had been employed by Maui Pine from February 1950 until his death on May 1, 1976. At the time of his death, Medeiros was concurrently employed by Grayline-Maui. The findings of the Board pertinent to this appeal are that Medeiros had suffered from severe cardiovascular disease, had suffered a severe myocardial infarction two to six weeks prior to his death, and had suffered a myocardial infarction which resulted in his death on May 1, 1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-9\">The Board concluded that Maui Pine was liable for death benefits and for reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs incurred by Grayline-Maui. Subsequently, the Board denied Maui Pine\u2019s motions to reconsider its denial of apportionment and to strike Grayline-Maui\u2019s request for approval of attorney\u2019s fees and costs. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-11\">Maui Pine correctly avers that the appeals board erred in perfunctorily holding death benefits nonapportionable under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) \u00a7 386-33 in light of <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Financial Plaza Contractors, </em>64 Haw. 415, 643 P.2d 48 (1982), wherein this court held that the special compensation fund would be liable for a portion of death benefits owed an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>employee\u2019s dependents \u201c[w]here an employee with a permanent partial disability which preexists employment dies as a result of a combination of that preexisting disability and a .subsequent work-related injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 424, 643 P.2d at 54. However, notwithstanding what we perceive to be erroneous reasoning on the part of the appeals board in denying Maui Pine\u2019s request for apportionment, we hesitate to reverse on that ground for \u201cwe have repeatedly held that where [a] trial court has reached a correct conclusion, its decision will not be disturbed on the ground that the reasons it gave for its actions were erroneous.\u201d <em>Federal Express Corp. </em>v. <em>Fasi, </em>56 Haw. 57, 64, 527 P.2d 1284, 1289-90, <em>reh\u2019g denied </em>56 Haw. 706 (1974); <em>Keawe </em>v. <em>Hawaiian Electric Co., </em>65 Haw. 232,_, 649 P.2d 1149, 1153 (1982); <em>Hawaii Carpenters\u2019 Trust Funds </em>v. <em>Aloe Development Corp., </em>63 Haw. 566, 578, 633 P.2d 1106, 1113 (1981). The same deference must be afforded an administrative decision in light of HRS \u00a7 91-14(g) of the Administrative Procedures Act which precludes judicial reversal or modification of an administrative decision even where affected by error of law, as in this case, unless substantial rights of the petitioner may have been prejudiced.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">Thus, we must determine whether the Board reached a correct conclusion on the issue of apportionability in spite of its reasoning. <em>Crawford </em>set forth three conditions which must be met before it becomes incumbent upon the Director of Labor and Industrial Relations to determine the relative contributions of the two injuries to the cause of death and apportion death benefits between the employer and the SCF accordingly. The conditions are, one, the employee must have had a permanent partial disability; two, the permanent partial disability must preexist employment; and, three, the employee\u2019s death must result from a combination of the preexisting disability and a subsequent work-related injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">Maui Pine contends, in its opening brief, that apportionment is proper where \u201cmedical evidence and specific findings of fact [indicate] that Claimant suffered from severe preexisting cardiovascular disease and a myocardial infarction <em>prior to his death </em>on May 1,1976.\u201d (Emphasis added.) It is apparent from the foregoing that Maui Pine believes a showing that an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>employee suffered from permanent partial disability prior to his second injury is sufficient to require apportionment. This is not the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">The legislative history underpinning the <em>Crawford </em>decision necessitated the conclusion that the permanent partial disability not merely preexist the subsequent injury but preexist employment; HRS \u00a7 386-33 was enacted to alleviate discriminatory hiring practices which confronted handicapped persons seeking employment by limiting the liability of employers who hired handicapped persons to compensation for the subsequent injury alone. <em>Crawford, </em>64 Haw. at 423, 643 P.2d at 53-54; Sen. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 43, in 1937 Senate Journal 292, 293; House Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 276, in 1937 House Journal 1354, 1355.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">Even assuming Medeiros\u2019 cardiovascular disease constituted a permanent partial disability and his death precipitated from a combination of the disease and his subsequent on-the-job injury, we are unconvinced the disease preexisted his employment. The record is devoid of evidence demonstrating that Medeiros suffered from cardiovascular disease prior to his employment with Maui Pine in 1950.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">The post-mortem examination report indicated Medeiros\u2019 coronary arteries were markedly calcified and obstructed in several areas. In a letter to Maui Pine\u2019s counsel, Dr. Chesne, a cardiologist, concluded from the post-mortem report, that Medeiros had long-standing and extensive coronary artery disease. However, neither Dr. Chesne nor Dr. Sherman who testified at the hearing before the Board made a determination as to when Medeiros developed his cardiovascular condition. When asked to estimate \u201chow long standing\u201d Medeiros\u2019 cardiovascular disease was, Dr. Sherman answered \u201cit\u2019s documented at least since \u201971, and \u2014 in that he had hypertension documented in \u201971. He probably had hypertension before that, but nobody documented it.\u201d (Tr. 85.)</p>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">Dr. Sherman also testified that Medeiros had complained of headaches; those complaints dated from 1963. Dr. Sherman stated that the headaches could have been a manifestation of hypertension; however, no blood pressure readings were taken to confirm that Medeiros\u2019 hypertension dated from 1963.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-9\">Thus, although there is evidence demonstrating Medeiros <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>suffered from long-standing cardiovascular disease, there is no evidence indicating the disease existed prior to his employment. Additionally, Medeiros\u2019 medical records reveal that Medeiros was diagnosed as not suffering from heart disease when he underwent physical exams in 1968, 1969,1970, 1971, 1973, 1974,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and 1975, apparently in connection with his employment with Paschoal Grayline and later with GraylineMaui.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">Given the state of the record, we believe that no apportionment was required.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">Although the failure to produce evidence sufficient to establish Medeiros\u2019 cardiovascular disease preexisted his employment with Maui Pine may be the result of Maui Pine\u2019s misconception of the phrase \u201cpreexisting\u201d in the context of the statute and its legislative history, our decision in <em>Brodie </em>v. <em>Hawaiian Automotive Retail Gasoline Dealers, </em>65 Haw__, 655 P.2d 863 (1982), precludes us from remanding this case to afford Maui Pine an opportunity to adduce additional evidence indicating that Medeiros\u2019 cardiovascular disease preexisted his employment. <em>Brodie </em>teaches us that \u201c[t]he fact that \u2018appellants may be taken by surprise\u2019 by the ruling of the appellate court\u201d does not justify a remand where the appellate court\u2019s ruling on an issue of first impression does not constitute a sudden departure from an established rule of law. <em>Id. </em>at_, 655 P.2d at 864.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-11\">Appellant in this case may arguably have been \u201ctaken by surprise\u201d by the requirement that the permanent partial disability preexist employment established in <em>Crawford </em>since <em>Crawford </em>was decided after the proceedings before the board in the instant case had been completed. However, <em>Crawford </em>was based on legislative history and did not constitute a sudden <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>departure from established law. Thus, <em>Brodie\u2019s </em>rationale is applicable, and we affirm the Board\u2019s decision denying apportionment.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">Maui Pine\u2019s second point on appeal necessitates a determination as to the proper application of HRS \u00a7 386-93. Initially, we note that Hawaii allows attorney\u2019s fees only when authorized by statute, rule of court, agreement, stipulation, or Hawaiian precedent. <em>THC Financial Corp. </em>v. <em>LR&amp;I Development One, </em>65 Haw. 477, 653 P.2d 789 (1982); <em>Salvador </em>v. <em>Popaa, </em>56 Haw. 111, 530 P.2d 7 (1974). Thus, where Grayline\u2019s claim for fees and costs is predicated solely on HRS \u00a7 386-93, the award of fees and costs is proper only if authorized by that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">HRS \u00a7 386-93 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-8\"><em>Costs, </em>(a) If the director of labor and industrial relations, appellate board or any court finds that proceedings under this chapter have been brought, prosecuted, or defended without reasonable ground the whole costs of the proceedings may be assessed against the party who has so brought, prosecuted, or defended the proceedings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-9\">(b) If an employer appeals a decision of the director or appellate board, the costs of the proceedings of the appellate board or the supreme court of the State, together with reasonable attorney\u2019s fees shall be assessed against the employer, if the employer loses; provided that if an employer or an insurance carrier, other than the employer who appealed, is held liable for compensation, the costs of the proceedings of the appellate board or the supreme court of the State together with reasonable attorney\u2019s fees shall be assessed against the party held liable for the compensation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ACY\">We note in passing that Grayline was not entitled to fees<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and costs under subsection (a) where the Board found \u201c[i]n <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>view of the difficult evidentiary questions presented by the relationship between employment activity and cardiovascular events,... that Maui Land &amp; Pine\u2019s claim against Grayline was made in good faith,\u201d and where such finding was not clearly erroneous. HRS \u00a7 91-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">The question of whether subsection (b) provides the necessary statutory authorization is the issue of major concern. Grayline, advocating the literal application of the statute, argues the statute clearly and unambiguously states \u201ccosts of proceedings ... together with reasonable attorney\u2019s fees shall be assessed against the employer, if the employer loses\u201d its appeal. Consequently, since Maui Pine instituted and lost its appeal, it is liable for the costs and attorney\u2019s fees of all the parties involved in the proceedings. Maui Pine counters, stating although the statutory language is unambiguous, a literal application would produce an absurd and unjust result, inconsistent with the purpose and policy of the workmen\u2019s compensation law.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">In construing statutes, a court\u2019s primary objective is to ascertain and give effect to the intention of the legislature as gleaned primarily from the language contained in the statute itself. <em>In re Hawaiian Telephone Co., </em>61 Haw. 572, 577, 608 P.2d 383, 387 (1980). Accordingly, \u201c[i]t is well settled that this court is bound by the plain, clear and unambiguous language of a statute unless the literal construction would produce an absurd and unjust result, and would be clearly inconsistent with the purposes and policies of the statutes.\u201d <em>Sherman </em>v. <em>Sawyer, </em>63 Haw. 55, 59, 621 P.2d 346, 349 (1980). <em>Chun v. Employees\u2019 Retirement System, </em>61 Haw. 596, 600-01, 607 P.2d 415, (1980); <em>In re Spencer, </em>60 Haw. 497, 499, 591 P.2d 611, 613 (1974). The foregoing does not preclude an examination of sources other than the language of the statute itself even when the language appears clear upon perfunctory review. <em>Crawford, </em>64 Haw. at 420, 643 P.2d at 52. Were this not the case, a court may be unable to adequately discern the underlying policy which the legislature seeks to promulgate and, thus, would be unable to determine if a literal construction would produce an absurd or unjust result, inconsistent with the policies of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>Guided by the above precepts, we embark on our analysis of subsection (b) of the statute in question. Subsection (b) as originally enacted imposed liability for fees and costs on an employer who appealed a decision of the director or the Board and lost. The legislature subsequently enacted a proviso to the original provision which imposed liability for fees and costs on a non-appealing employer or insurance carrier held liable for the compensation due the claimant.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">Given the factual situation in the instant case, an award of fees and costs could only be justified under the original provision of subsection (b). An examination of the legislative history of the original provision failed to reveal any legislative intent to limit a losing employer\u2019s liability for fees and costs to that incurred by the claimant. We are cognizant that the two basic goals of workmen\u2019s compensation statutes are to \u201c(a) restore the injured worker, to the greatest possible extent, physiologically and as a productive member of society; and (b) to compensate him or his family adequately for the losses consequent upon his personal injury.\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>64 Haw. at 419, 643 P.2d at 51, quoting S. Riesenfeld, <em>Study of Worker\u2019s Compensation Law in Hawaii, </em>Legislative Reference Bureau, Report No. 1 (1963), at 28. However, we do not believe an interpretation which imposes liability for fees and costs incurred by Grayline upon Maui Pine amounts to an absurd and unjust result, inconsistent with the aforementioned policies of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">Nevertheless, Maui Pine contends the legislative history of the proviso when read in light of <em>Crawford </em>necessitates a construction which limits Maui Pine\u2019s liability to fees and costs incurred by the claimant. The legislative history<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of the proviso is replete with statements indicating the impetus for enacting the proviso was to relieve a claimant of the burden of paying costs and fees where an employer appeals and another employer or insurance carrier is held liable for the compensation since the orginal provision did not address such situation. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>Maui Pine contends that where the legislative history, which <em>Crawford </em>compels us to consider, clearly indicates the purpose of the statutory provision is to provide relief for the claimant, this court should so limit the seemingly broad language of the statute.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Axn\"><em>Howard A. Matsuura(Char, Hamilton, Taylor &amp; Thom, </em>of counsel) for Appellant Maui Land and Pineapple Company.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"A8n\"><em>Grant K. Kidani </em>and <em>Amy R. Miyasaki {Kidani, Oshima &amp; Wong, </em>of counsel) for Appellees Grayline-Maui and Hawaiian Insurance and Guaranty Company.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">We are unconvinced by Maui Pine\u2019s argument. Initially, we note that we are called upon to interpret the original provision and not the later added proviso of subsection (b). Additionally, we do not read <em>Crawford </em>as advocating the exaltation of legislative history over statutory language as the source for divining legislative intent where the intent as gleaned from the two sources is not contradictory.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">The language of the statute comprehends imposing liability for the fees and costs incurred by a non-appealing employer upon an appealing employer who loses. The imposition of such liability does not contravene the purpose of the statute, thus, <em>Crawford </em>is inapposite.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Accordingly, we affirm the board\u2019s decision awarding reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs to Grayline-Maui.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b311-12\"> While the 1974 examination report indicates Medeiros did not have heart disease, it did note that Medeiros had mild hypertension.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b311-13\"> In this case there was no evidence indicating that Medeiros\u2019 cardiovascular disease preexisted his employment with Maui Pine; thus, we need not and do not decide whether the employer or the SCF has the burden of proof on the question of whether a permanent partial disability preexisted employment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b312-10\"> Additionally, we note that HRS \u00a7 386-93(a) mentions only costs and not attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b314-7\"> Hse. Stand. Comm. Rpt. No. 357, in 1967 House Journal, at 608; Sen. Stand. Comm. Rpt.
