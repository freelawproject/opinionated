Appellant contends the search and subsequent seizure of the contraband violated his constitutional rights as guaran<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>teed by the fourth amendment of the United States Constitution and article I, \u00a7 7 of the Hawaii Constitution. We do not agree, and thus affirm appellant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"AXm\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">On December 14, 1979, appellant was an inmate in the Hawaii State Prison. At about 5:45 p.m., he was standing in front of one of the dorms on the ground floor of the prison, an area under the supervision of Sergeant William Taylor, a corrections officer. Sergeant Taylor observed appellant talking to another inmate who was inside the dorm, a large room enclosed by barred doors. Taylor then saw appellant stick his arm through the bars and pull out a small white packet resembling a piece of an envelope.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">Sergeant Taylor testified he then asked appellant to approach him, but that appellant instead turned and ran up the stairs to the second floor. Taylor radioed the guard patrolling the second floor, Officer Jerry Roberts, who called out to appellant to stop. When appellant backed away from Roberts and started to pull something out of his pocket, Roberts grabbed him in a bear hug, picked him up, and carried him into the maximum security unit a few feet away.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-8\">Officer Roberts then told appellant to undress. After appellant had done so, Roberts searched his pants pockets where he found the white packet. Opening the packet, he discovered two marijuana cigarettes and two packs of rolling paper.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-9\">At a pretrial hearing,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> appellant moved to suppress the evidence discovered in the strip search, alleging that there was no probable cause for the search and that the warrantless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>search and seizure violated his fourth amendment rights. This motion was denied, and appellant was subsequently found guilty of violating HRS \u00a7 710-1022, promoting prison contraband in the first degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">In deciding whether the strip search of appellant and the accompanying initial seizure of the packet were unconstitutional, we start with the oft-quoted statement that \u201c[t]here is no iron curtain drawn between the Constitution and the prisons of this country.\u201d <em>Wolff </em>v. <em>McDonnell, </em>418 U.S. 539, 555-56 (1974). The United States Supreme Court has drawn, however, a large distinction between the constitutional rights of prison inmates and those of everyone else. <em>See, e.g., Bell </em>v. <em>Wolfish, </em>441 U.S. 520, 545-48 (1979); <em>Jones </em>v. <em>North Carolina Prisoners\u2019 Labor Union, Inc., </em>433 U.S. 119, 125-26, 129-30 (1977); <em>Pell v. Procunier, </em>417 U.S. 817, 822-23 (1974). As the Court stated in <em>Jones, supra:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-7\">Prisons, it is obvious, differ in numerous respects from free society. They, to begin with, are populated, involuntarily, by people who have been found to have violated one or more of the criminal laws established by society for its orderly governance. In seeking a \u201cmutual accommodation between institutional needs and objectives [of prisons] and the provisions of the Constitution that are of general application,\u201d .. . this Court has repeatedly recognized the need for major restrictions on a prisoner\u2019s rights.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b40-8\">433 U.S. at 129 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>One of the more notable of these \u201crestrictions\u201d lies in the fourth amendment area. The Supreme Court\u2019s latest pronouncements on the fourth amendment rights of prisoners occurred in <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Wolfish, </em>441 U.S. 520 (1979). There, a majority of the Court upheld a prison rule which required all prison inmates and pretrial detainees<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to strip and expose their body cavities for visual inspection following \u201ccontact visits\u201d with outsiders. <em>Id. </em>at 558. Although noting at the outset that \u201cthis practice instinctively gives us the most pause,\u201d <em>id., </em>the Court concluded such searches were reasonable after considering \u201cthe scope of the particular intrusion, the manner in which it is conducted, the justification for initiating it, and the place in which it is conducted,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 559. The majority opinion did not say prison inmates have absolutely no fourth amendment rights, <em>see id. </em>at 558, a position we would be hesitant to embrace.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On the other hand, the Court did say: \u201c[W]e deal here with the question whether visual body-cavity inspection ... can <em>ever </em>be conducted on less than probable cause. Balancing the significant and legitimate security interests of the institution against the privacy interests of the inmates, we conclude that they can.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 560.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>We realize that this holding in <em>Wolfish </em>represents the view of a bare majority of the Supreme Court,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and is a view which has been the target of some criticism.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We are also aware of our prerogative \u201cto extend the protections of the Hawaii Bill of Rights beyond those of textually parallel provisions in the Federal Bill of Rights when logic and a sound regard for the purposes of those protections\u201d so warrant. <em>State </em>v. <em>Kaluna, </em>55 Haw. 361, 369, 520 P.2d 51, 58 (1974), <em>quoted in Huihui </em>v. <em>Shimoda, </em>64 Haw. 527, 531, 644 P.2d 968, 971 (1982), and <em>State </em>v. <em>Miyasaki, </em>62 Haw. 269, 281, 614 P.2d 915, 922 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">We believe, however, that whether we should give greater protection under our state constitution than the Supreme Court gave the inmates in <em>Wolfish </em>under the federal one is irrelevant, since it is evident we do not have <em>Wolfish </em>facts before us in this appeal. In <em>Wolfish, </em>all prisoners who had had contact visits were subjected to a body cavity search, even though their conduct aroused absolutely no suspicion in the minds of the prison guards. <em>See 441 </em>U.S. at 558. Here, Sergeant Taylor testified that he observed appellant whispering to another inmate and receiving a small white packet which he quickly placed in his pants pocket. Taylor also testified that after calling out to appellant, appellant turned and ran away. Based on these facts and his own considerable experience in dealing with these matters,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Taylor concluded that appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>was concealing contraband, a conclusion which culminated in Officer Roberts\u2019 strip search of appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">Clearly, these facts reach a much higher level of \u201ccause\u201d than do the ones in <em>Wolfish.</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Whether these facts constitute \u201cprobable\u201d cause we need not decide, for it has become accepted by apparently every jurisdiction to consider this issue that probable cause is not necessary to conduct searches in prisons. <em>See, e.g., Bell </em>v. <em>Wolfish, </em>441 U.S. at 560; <em>United States </em>v. <em>York, </em>578 F.2d 1036, 1041 (5th Cir. 1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 1005 (1978); <em>Daughtery </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>476 F.2d 292, 294-95 (10th Cir. 1973), <em>cert. denied, </em>414 U.S. 872 (1973); <em>In re Alan R., </em>132 Cal. App. 3d 601, 604-05, 183 Cal. Rptr. 325, 327 (Ct. App. 1982); <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>State, </em>285 Md. 458, 468, 404 A.2d 257, 263 (1979); <em>Marrero </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>222 Va. 754, 757, 284 S.E.2d 809, 810-11 (1981).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We believe this position to be a sound one, given the unique and compelling need of prisons to preserve order and security within their walls. As we observed in <em>Holdman </em>v. <em>Olim:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-6\">Maintenance of order or control in a prison has been recognized to be an important, in fact a vital, governmental objective. . . . The institutional consideration of internal security within the correction facilities is central to all correctional goals. . . . Because of the essential need for security and the recognition that courts are ill-equipped to deal with matters of prison administration, wide-ranging deference is given to prison administrators in the exercise of their discretion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">59 Haw. 346, 350, 581 P.2d 1164, 1167 (1978) (citations omitted); <em>accord: State </em>v. <em>Martinez, </em>59 Haw. 366, 368-71, 580 P.2d 1282, 1284-86 (1978); <em>see generally State </em>v. <em>McCray, </em>267 Md. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>111, 134-44, 297 A.2d 265, 277-82 (1972) (discussing the traditional reluctance of courts to review the decisions and actions of prison officials).</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">But it is important that this \u201cwide-ranging deference\u201d not amount to a total abdication of our power of judicial review, however, for that would bring with it an unacceptably high potential for abuse. <em>See United States </em>v. <em>Hinckley, </em>672 F.2d 115, 129 (D.C. Cir. 1982); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lilly, </em>576 F.2d 1240, 1244-46 (5th Cir. 1978); Giannelli &amp; Gilligan, <em>Prison Searches and Seizures: \u201cLocking\u201d the Fourth Amendment out of Correctional Facilities, </em>62 Va. L. Rev. 1045, 1068-69 (1976). Thus, we hold that in order to conduct the more intrusive body searches such as strip searches in non-emergency, non-contact visit situations, prison officials must have a reasonable basis to conclude that contraband is being concealed by inmates on their person. Relying on such a basis, they may conduct the search in a reasonable, non-oppressive manner.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">Given the possibility that appellant Bayaoa may have concealed contraband on his person during his flight and subsequent apprehension, we cannot say the strip search of appellant was unreasonable.. It was not arbitrary or capricious; it was neither meant to harass nor motivated by malice. It was, in fact, based on Sergeant Taylor\u2019s strong suspicion that appellant was in possession of contraband. The search of appellant was thus more than an act of discretion \u2014 it was an act of duty, and we hold that the State has met its burden of proving that act to be reasonable under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"AWc\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-4\">Having concluded that the strip search of appellant and the ancillary seizure of the packet were constitutional, we next address the question whether the subsequent warrantless examination of the packet\u2019s contents was likewise lawful. Appellant contends that once the prison guards assumed exclusive control of the packet, there were no exigent circumstances which justified the opening of the packet without a warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">A similar contention was made by the appellee in <em>State </em>v. <em>Custodio, </em>62 Haw. 1, 607 P.2d 1048 (1980). There, a body cavity search conducted by a prison matron upon the appellee, a female visitor to the prison, had resulted in the discovery of a balloon secreted in the appellee\u2019s vagina. The balloon was opaque and thus its contents, as in this case, were not visible. <em>Id. </em>at 5 n.4, 607 P.2d at 1051. It was nonetheless opened without a warrant, and appellee claimed this act violated her fourth amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">We employed a two-pronged test to determine whether the search infringed upon the appellee\u2019s \u201clegitimate expectations of privacy\u201d: first, whether the individual exhibited an actual expectation of privacy; and second, whether that expectation was one society was prepared to acknowledge as reasonable. <em>Id. </em>at 8, 607 P.2d at 1052-53 (citing <em>Katz </em>v. <em>United States, </em>389 U.S. 347, 361 (1967) (Harlan, J., concurring)). We held that, although the appellee\u2019s subjective expectation of privacy in articles hidden in her vagina was justifiable, such an expectation was not one that society would consider reasonable, given the \u201ccompelling governmental interests\u201d in \u201cmaintaining order and control in prison facilities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 9, 607 P.2d at 1053 (citations omitted). We thus concluded that the warrantless examination of the balloon violated neither the fourth amendment nor our state constitutional equivalent. <em>Id. </em>at 10, 607 P.2d at 1054.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">The conclusion in <em>Custodio </em>directs us to the result we reach here: the examination of the seized packet did not violate the fourth amendment\u2019s proscription against unreasonable searches and seizures. For even if we were to assume appellant\u2019s actual expectation of privacy in a packet placed in his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>pants pocket was a justifiable one, and that assumption is tenuous given the prison setting, such an expectation is not one which we feel society is prepared to recognize as legitimate. Ensuring prison security and control was the basis for the decision in <em>Custodio, supra, </em>and such a state interest is even more compelling when applied to searches of prison inmates as opposed to prison visitors.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> \u201cSmuggling of money, drugs, weapons and other contraband is all too common an occurrence\u201d in prisons, <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Wolfish, </em>441 U.S. at 559, and prison officials realize that packets and other containers are often used to conceal such contraband. <em>See State </em>v. <em>Custodio, </em>62 Haw. at 9, 607 P.2d at 1053. We thus conclude that the need to maintain internal security in prisons outweighs the reasonable expectations of privacy, if any, prisoners have in closed containers,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and that the opening of the packet in this case did not violate appellant\u2019s fourth amendment rights.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys id=\"AVl\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number><em>June Y. Inouye </em>and <em>Keith M. Kiuchi, </em>Deputy Public Defenders, on the brief for defendant-appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AS6\"><em>Wesley T. Kan, </em>Deputy Prosecuting Attorney, on the brief for plaintiff-appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"Ah\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-4\">This decision should not be construed as giving carte blanche to prison administrators and employees in their treatment of prisoners. Not all searches and seizures which occur inside prison walls automatically fall outside the proscriptions of the fourth amendment. As with other search and seizure cases, the burden will remain on the State to show that the alleged governmental intrusion is justified by a legitimate governmental interest, such as preserving the institutional security of our prison system. Where prison officials act capriciously, maliciously \u2014 in effect, unreasonably, we will not hesitate to hold them accountable to constitutional mandates. This not being such a case, however, we uphold the search and seizure and affirm appellant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b39-10\"> In its Answering Brief, the State contends appellant\u2019s motion to suppress should have been dismissed since it was filed 70 days after he had been arraigned, and under HRPP Rule 12(c), \u201c[p]retrial motions and requests must be made within 21 days after arraignment unless the court otherwise directs.\u201d A similar situation existed in State v. Melear, 63 Haw. 488, 630 P.2d 619 (1981), where we stated: \u201cWe expect compliance with Rule 12(c).... The record reflects the motions were not made within the allotted time period. Thus, the motions should have been considered untimely.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 490 n.3, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>630 P.2d at 622. In the present case, there were mitigating circumstances which prevented strict compliance with the rule, since defense counsel was appointed 23 days after appellant\u2019s arraignment. Nonetheless, a good faith effort to comply with the spirit if not the letter of Rule 12(c) would seem to require that the motion have been filed sooner than the seven weeks it took following defense counsel\u2019s appointment. Because of our decision on the merits of this case, however, we need not decide whether the trial court should have deemed appellant\u2019s suppression motion untimely and what result should have followed therefrom.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b41-5\"> The majority opinion did not make any critical distinction between prison inmates and pretrial detainees \u2014 <em>i.e., </em>persons charged with a crime but not yet tried \u2014 for purposes of evaluating the alleged constitutional infringements. The dissenting Justices in <em>Wolfish, </em>however, believed that detainees must be given greater constitutional protection than convicted inmates. <em>See </em>441 U.S. at 568 (Marshall, J., dissenting); <em>id. </em>at 579 <em>passim </em>(Stevens, J., dissenting). <em>Accord: The Supreme Court, 1978 Term, </em>93 Harv. L. Rev. 60, 104-05 (1979). We likewise believe that, at least with regard to the fourth amendment, the rights of persons not yet convicted of crimes must be more closely scrutinized than the rights of prisoners. <em>See generally </em>State v. Clark, 65 Haw. 488, 498 n.11, 654 P.2d 355, 362 (1982) (distinguishing pre-incarceration searches of arrestees from those of prisoners entering the main prison).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b41-6\"> This hesitancy is shared by most other courts, which have ruled that prisoners are not completely devoid of fourth amendment protection. <em>See, e.g., </em>United States v. Hinckley, 672 F.2d 115, 128-29 (D.C. Cir. 1982); United States v. Lilly, 576 F.2d 1240, 1244 (5th Cir. 1978); United States v. Stumes, 549 F.2d 831, 832 (8th Cir. 1977); Bonner v.

Martinez, another case involving a strip search of a prison visitor, we implicitly acknowledged that a prison inmate\u2019s rights are weaker than a prison visitor\u2019s when we stated: \u201cWithout suggesting that the constitutional protections of prison visitors may not exceed those enjoyed by prison inmates, we consider that an individual who seeks entry into a prison in a purely personal capacity may not claim immunity from security measures which are reasonable as applied to the prison inmates.\u201d 59 Haw. at 371, 580 P.2d at 1286 (citation omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b46-6\"> We must emphasize that this rule applies only with respect to any fourth amendment rights prisoners may have in closed containers; it is not intended to apply to the opening of prisoners\u2019 mail, which implicates the first amendment\u2019s free speech guarantee as well as the inmates\u2019 constitutional right of access to counsel and the courts. <em>See generally </em>Procunier v. Martinez, 416 U.S. 396, 404-19 (1973) (first amendment); Adams v.

I, \u00a7 6, which provides in part: \u201cThe right of the people to privacy is recognized and shall not be infringed without a showing of compelling state interest.\u201d Although we have not yet precisely delineated the boundaries of this privacy right, we do not believe this is the proper case to do so, given the fact it involves prisons and prison inmates. For just as an individual\u2019s fourth amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures is severely curtailed upon his or her passing through the prison gates, so too is that person\u2019s right of privacy \u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>whether that right is constitutionally expressed or implied \u2014 drastically diminished. <em>See, e.g., </em>Lanza v.
