But we are not convinced a decision to engage in sex for hire is a fundamental right in our scheme of ordered liberty, and we affirm her conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-13\">The defendant was charged in the District Court of the First Circuit that she \u201cdid engage in, or agree to engage in, sexual conduct with another person, in return for a fee, in violation of Section 712-1200 of the Hawaii Revised Statutes.\u201d She moved to dismiss the charge, asserting a \u201cconstitutional right to privacy for activities that were conducted in the privacy of her own home.\u201d At the hearing on the motion the parties entered into a stipulation of facts, agreeing that the activity in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>question took place in Lauren Mueller\u2019s apartment, the participants were willing adults, and there were \u201cno signs of advertising\u201d anywhere in the apartment building.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">The defendant\u2019s argument to the court was that the activity\u2019s private setting and the absence of public solicitation set her case apart \u201cfrom every other prostitution case.\u201d And she maintained a decision to engage in sex with \u201ca voluntary adult companion\u201d was \u201cwell within her constitutional right to privacy.\u201d The district court, however, found her argument unpersuasive, ruled the State had a \u201ccompelling interest in controlling prostitution in private residences as well as on the streets,\u201d and denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">The case proceeded to trial, and the State offered the testimony of several police officers, including that of the officer responsible for arranging the assignation leading to her arrest. The defendant elected not to rebut this evidence; but she renewed her constitutional objection to the prosecution. The motion was denied again, and a judgment of conviction was entered by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">The sole issue posed on appeal is whether the proscriptions of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) \u00a7 712-1200<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> may be applied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>to an act of sex for a fee that took place in a private apartment. With <em>Roe </em>v. <em>Wade, supra, </em>as the point of departure, the defendant argues the privacy guaranteed by the federal and state constitutions prevented a valid application of the statute to the act in question. We begin our analysis by examining the sources and scope of the federally established right to personal privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">The United States Constitution contains \u201cno express provisions guaranteeing to persons the right to carry on their lives protected from the \u2018vicissitudes of the political process\u2019 by a zone of privacy or a right of personhood.\u201d L. Tribe, <em>American Constitutional Law </em>893 (1978). But in <em>Griswold </em>v. <em>Connecticut, </em>381 U.S. 479 (1965), the Supreme Court found \u201cthat specific guarantees in the Bill of Rights have penumbras, formed by emanations from those guarantees that help give them life and substance,\u201d 381 U.S. at 484, and concluded \u201c[v]arious guarantees create zones of privacy.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>The marriage relationship, it held, was one \u201clying within the zone of privacy created by several fundamental constitutional guarantees.\u201d 381 U.S. at 485. And the Connecticut statute forbidding the use of contraceptives was struck down as being \u201crepulsive to the notions of privacy surrounding the... relationship.\u201d 381 U.S. at 486.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>Thus the privacy accorded constitutional protection by <em>Griswold </em>inhered in the marital relationship. But when the Court subsequently invalidated a Massachusetts law regulating the distribution of contraceptives in <em>Eisenstadt </em>v. <em>Baird, </em>405 U.S. 438 (1972), it recognized that this right also existed apart from marriage. For as the Court explained, \u201c[i]f the right of privacy means anything, it is the right of the <em>individual, </em>married or single, to be free from unwarranted governmental intrusions into matters so fundamentally affecting a person as the decision whether to bear or beget a child.\u201d 405 U.S. at 453 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">Whether the right is broad enough to accommodate a woman\u2019s decision to seek an abortion was the question in <em>Roe </em>v. <em>Wade, supra. </em>The Court observed that earlier decisions made \u201cit clear that only personal rights that can be deemed \u2018fundamental\u2019 or \u2018implicit in the concept of ordered liberty,\u2019 <em>Palko </em>v. <em>Connecticut, </em>302 U.S. 319, 325(1937), are included in this guarantee of personal privacy.\u201d <em>Roe </em>v. <em>Wade, </em>410 U.S. at 152. That the guarantee had been extended to activities relating to marriage, procreation, contraception, family relationships, and child rearing and education was also noted. <em>Id. </em>at 152-53. And the Court concluded \u201c[t]his right of privacy, whether it be founded in the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s concept of personal liberty and restrictions upon state action... or... in the Ninth Amendment\u2019s reservation of rights to the people, is broad enough to encompass a woman\u2019s decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 153. However, it ruled \u201cthis right is not unqualified and must be considered against important state interests in regulation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 154.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">The Court has also spoken very clearly in another area of intimate decision. The issue in <em>Stanley </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>394 U.S. 557 (1969), was whether \u201cthe Georgia obscenity statute, insofar as it punishes mere private possession of obscene matter, violates the First Amendment, as made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 559. The appellant\u2019s thesis was characterized as \u201casserting the right to read or observe what he pleases \u2014 the right to satisfy his intellectual and emotional needs in the privacy of his own home.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 565. Though it acknowledged \u201cthe States retain broad power to regulate obscenity,\u201d the Court nevertheless held that the \u201cpower simply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>does not extend to mere possession by the individual in the privacy of his own home.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 568.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">But there has been no clear and binding judicial statement on the matter of our present concern. What little we have heard from the Court on whether a decision to engage in promiscuous sexual behavior with consenting adults is within a protected zone of privacy has been in the muted tones of a summary affirmance of the decision of a three-judge district court upholding the constitutionality of a state statute making sodomy a crime and by way of dicta<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in other decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">The question before the three-judge court in <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney, </em>403 F. Supp. 1199 (E.D. Va. 1975), was whether an application of the Virginia statute prohibiting sodomy to adult males engaging in homosexual relations, consensually and in private, deprived them of their constitutional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>rights to due process, freedom of expression, and privacy. The district court denied the declaratory judgment and injunction sought by ihe plaintiffs after concluding \u201cthat the sodomy statute, so long in force in Virginia, has a rational basis of State interest demonstrably legitimate and mirrored in the cited decisional law of the Supreme Court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1203.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">The ruling was appealed to the Supreme Court, which affirmed the three-judge court without opinion. <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney, </em>425 U.S. 901 (1976), <em>aff'g mem., </em>403 F. Supp. 1199 (E.D. Va. 1975). The summary affirmance was a decision \u201con the merits of a case,\u201d <em>Hicks v. Miranda, </em>422 U.S. 332, 344 (1975), and \u201cis therefore a controlling precedent, unless and until reexamined by . . . [the] Court.\u201d <em>Tully </em>v. <em>Griffin, Inc., </em>429 U.S. 68, 74 (1976). \u201cSince, however, it was a summary affirmance, it is not here \u2018of the same precedential value as would be an opinion . . . treating the question on the <em>merits.' Edelman v. Jordan, </em>415 U.S. 651, 671.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Yet since no such opinion has been brought to our attention,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> our quest for specific guidance on whether a federally established right protected the defendant here ends with <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">We turn from privacy as expounded by the Supreme Court to the right of privacy that has been written into the Hawaii Constitution. As we observed earlier, Article I, Section 6 of the State Constitution now provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-8\">The right of the people to privacy is recognized and shall not be infringed without the showing of a compelling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>state interest. The legislature shall take affirmative steps to implement this right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">Couched in the terse language characteristic of constitutions, the provision itself gives no clue of its intended breadth. We therefore look to an obvious extrinsic aid to construction, its history, for direction.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">The language at bar was added to the Hawaii Bill of Rights during the most recent decennial review of our fundamental law. The suggestion to adopt a specific right to privacy was offered by the Committee on Bill of Rights, Suffrage and Election of the Constitutional Convention of Hawaii of 1978 as one of several proposals related to the Bill of Rights. <em>See </em>Comm. P. No. 15, Proceedings of the Constitutional Convention of Hawaii of 1978, Vol. I, at 825-27. The report accompanying Committee Proposal No. 15 discussed the proposals at length, and the discussion on the proposed privacy right furnishes an insight to what was meant to be covered.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">Noting some doubt on whether the existing privacy provision in the Hawaii counterpart of the Fourth Amendment extended beyond the criminal area, the committee felt \u201cit would be appropriate to retain... [this] privacy provision..., but limit its application to criminal cases, and create a new section as it relates to privacy in the informational and personal autonomy sense.\u201d Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 69, in Proceedings of the Constitutional Convention of Hawaii of 1978, Vol. I, at 674. An awareness \u201cthat the right of privacy has meaning varying in degree and nature\u201d was duly recorded, and the report proceeded thereafter to \u201cexplicitly state the intent of ... [the] Committee as to the scope and nature of the right.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b640-9\">The committee believed \u201cthis right of privacy . . . [should include] the right of an individual to tell the world to \u2018mind your own business.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>It cited with approval the proposition that \u201cthe right to be left alone... [is] the most comprehensive of rights and the right most valued by civilized men.\u201d <em>See Olmstead </em>v. <em>United States, </em>277 U.S. 438, 478 (Brandeis, J., dissenting). The intended privacy, it said, gave \u201ceach and every individual the right to control certain highly personal and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>intimate affairs of his own life.\u201d Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 69, <em>supra, </em>at 674. \u201cThe right to personal autonomy,\u201d it made clear, was to be \u201cincluded in this concept of privacy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cWhether an individual\u2019s desire to engage in a particular activity is protected by this aspect of the right to privacy, (the right to personal autonomy),\u201d however, was deemed \u201ca matter for the courts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 675.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">The recommendation to endorse \u201cprivacy in the informational and personal autonomy sense\u201d as a constitutional right was the subject of spirited floor debate. <em>See </em>Proceedings, <em>supra, </em>Vol. II, at 628-644. Sitting as a committee of the whole, the convention discussed the proposal at length and thereafter adopted a committee report reflecting the consensus of the assembly. The report in pertinent part reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-7\">By amending the Constitution to include a separate and distinct privacy right, it is the intent of your Committee to insure that privacy is treated as a fundamental right for purposes of constitutional analysis. Privacy as used in this sense concerns the possible abuses in the use of highly personal and intimate information in the hands of government or private parties but is not intended to deter the government from the legitimate compilation and dissemination of data. More importantly, this privacy concept encompasses the notion that in certain highly personal and intimate matters, the individual should be afforded freedom of choice absent a compelling state interest. This right is similar to the privacy right discussed in cases such as <em>Griswold v. Connecticut, </em>381 U.S. 479 (1965), <em>Eisenstadt </em>v. <em>Baird, </em>405 U.S. 438 (1972), <em>Roe v. Wade, </em>410. U.S. 113 (1973), etc. It is a right that, though unstated in the federal Constitution, emanates from the penumbra of several guarantees of the Bill of Rights. Because of this, there has been some confusion as to the source of the right and the importance of it. As such, it is treated as a fundamental right subject to interference only when a compelling state interest is demonstrated. By inserting clear and specific language regarding this right into the Constitution, your Committee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>intends to alleviate any possible confusion over the source of the right and the existence of it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">Comm. Whole Rep. No. 15, in Proceedings, <em>supra, </em>Vol. I, at 1024.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">Thus, we are led back to <em>Griswold, Eisenstadt, </em>and <em>Roe </em>and appear to have come full circle in our search for guidance on the intended scope of the privacy protected by the Hawaii Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">The defendant asserts <em>Griswold, et al, </em>and the State Constitution placed the act for which she was prosecuted beyond the reach of HRS \u00a7 712-1200 because it was sexual activity carried on in private between two consenting adults and it was not preceded by public solicitation. There was, she claims, no state interest that compelled her prosecution under these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-9\">Since the guaranteed freedom from intrusion extends to sexual activity among unmarried adult couples as <em>Eisenstadt v. Baird </em>suggests and to autoeroticism in the home as <em>Stanley </em>v. <em>Georgia </em>implies, we would have to agree there is room for argument that the right encompasses any decision to engage in sex at home with another willing adult. Moreover, as the defendant reminds us, the commentary on HRS \u00a7 712-1200 evidences that the drafters of the Penal Code found the usual reasons advanced for suppressing prostitution \u201care not convincing.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Still, \u201cevery enactment of the legislature is presump<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>tively constitu\u00ed ional^and a party challenging the statute has the burden of showing unconstitutionality beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Schwab </em>v. <em>Ariyoshi, </em>58 Haw. 25, 31, 564 P.2d 135, 139 (1977); <em>see also State </em>v, <em>Raitz, </em>63 Haw. 64, 72-73, 621 P.2d 352, 359 (1980); <em>Bishop </em>v. <em>Mahiko, </em>35 Haw. 608, 641 (1940); <em>In re Mott-Smith, </em>29 Haw. 343, 346 (1926). The defendant has not met this burden, for she has not demonstrated in a convincing manner that a decision to engage in prostitution has been recognized as a fundamental right.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">\u201c[0]ne aspect of the \u2018liberty\u2019 protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment is \u2018a right of personal privacy,\u2019\u201d <em>Carey </em>v. <em>Population Services International, </em>431 U.S. at 684 (quoting <em>Roe </em>v. <em>Wade, </em>410 U.S. at 152), which includes \u201cthe interest in independence in making certain kinds of important decisions.\u201d <em>Whalen </em>v. <em>Roe, </em>429 U.S. 589, 599-600 (1977). \u201cWhile the outer limits of this aspect of privacy have not been marked by the Court, it is clear that among the decisions that an individual may make without unjustified government interference are personal decisions \u2018relating to marriage . . . , procreation . . . , contraception . . . , family relationships..., and child rearing and education____\u2019 <em>Roe </em>v. <em>Wade, supra, </em>at 152-153.\u201d <em>Carey </em>v. <em>Population Services International, </em>431 U.S. at 684-85 (citations omitted). It is also clear that state laws \u201cthat burden an individual\u2019s right to decide\u201d in the foregoing areas may be justified only by a compelling state interest. <em>Id. </em>at 688.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>But state regulation need not meet this standard \u201c \u2018whenever it implicates sexual freedom\u2019\u201d or \u201c\u2018affect[s] adult sexual relations.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 688 n.5.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> For as we noted earlier, \u201conly personal rights that can be deemed \u2018fundamental\u2019 or \u2018implicit in the concept of ordered liberty,\u2019 <em>Palko </em>v. <em>Connecticut, </em>302 U.S. 319, 325 (1937), are included in this guarantee of personal privacy.\u201d <em>Roe </em>v. <em>Wade, </em>410 U.S. at 152.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">The defendant has directed us to nothing suggesting a decision to engage in sex for hire at home should be considered basic to ordered liberty. Our review of Supreme Court case law in the relevant area leaves us with a distinct impression to the contrary, for we perceive no inclination on the part of the Court to exalt sexual freedom per se or to promote an anomic society. And until we learn from the Court\u2019s pronouncements that we have been misinformed, we shall continue to assume there is a \u201csocial interest in order and morality,\u201d <em>Chaplinsky </em>v. <em>New Hampshire, </em>315 U.S. 568, 571-72 (1942) (quoted in <em>Roth v. United States, </em>354 U.S. 476, 485 (1957)), that enables a state legislature to act in this area. <em>Cf. Paris Adult Theatre I </em>v. <em>Slaton, </em>413 U.S. 49, 57-69 (1973) (States have a legitimate interest in regulating commerce in obscene material, even among consenting adults). The validity of the action, of course, is contingent upon the presence of a rational basis therefor.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">The drafters of the Hawaii Penal Code justified the enactment of HRS \u00a7 712-1200 on \u201cthe need for public order.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>would not dispute that it was reasonable for the legislature to act on that basis. A large segment of society undoubtedly regards prostitution as immoral and degrading, and the self-destructive or debilitating nature of the practice, at least for the prostitute, is often given as a reason for outlawing it. We could not deem these views irrational. And we think the following comment by the Supreme Court on a basis for legislatures to regulate the commerce in obscene material may be apt here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ano\">The sum of experience, including that of the past two decades, affords an ample basis for legislatures to conclude that a sensitive, key relationship of human existence, central to family life, community welfare, and the development of human personality, can be debased and distorted by crass commercial exploitation of sex. Nothing in the Constitution prohibits a State from reaching such a conclusion and acting on it legislatively simply because there is no conclusive evidence or empirical data.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-5\"><em>Paris Adult Theatre I </em>v. <em>Slaton, </em>413 U.S. at 63.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">Having found that defendant\u2019s decision, though arguably an intimate one, has yet to be drawn into a federally protected zone of privacy, we now consider the decision to have sex for a fee in the light of the special recognition accorded privacy by the Hawaii Constitution. Our duty is \u201cto give effect to the intention of the framers and the people adopting\u201d the provi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>sion. <em>HGEA </em>v. <em>County of Maui, </em>59 Haw. 65, 80-81, 576 P.2d 1029, 1039 (1978).</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AMk\"><em>James D.

Ross, </em>Deputy Prosecuting Attorney, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">While the report that brought the proposal to the floor of the convention in 1978 may be read as envisioning a broader right to privacy, what was approved by the framers \u201cis similar to the privacy right discussed in cases such as <em>Griswold </em>v. <em>Connecticut, </em>. . . , <em>Eisenstadt </em>v. Baird,..., <em>Roe </em>v. Wade,..., etc.\u201d Comm. Whole Rep. No. 15, in Proceedings, <em>supra, </em>Vol. I, at 1024 (citations omitted). Thus, \u00e1 purpose to lend talismanic effect to \u201cthe right to be left alone,\u201d \u201cintimate decision,\u201d or \u201cpersonal autonomy,\u201d or \u201cpersonhood\u201d cannot be inferred from the State provision, any more than it can from the federal decisions. However described, a freedom that is protected thereunder must still be one \u201cranked as fundamental\u201d in the concept of liberty that underlies our society. <em>Palko </em>v. <em>Connecticut, </em>302 U.S. at 325 (quoting <em>Snyder </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>291 U.S. 97, 105 (1934)). We see no evidence that we are dealing with one.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">Though the trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the charge on grounds that a compelling state interest had been shown, the denial was a correct result. We therefore affirm the defendant\u2019s conviction of prostitution. <em>Agsalud </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>66 Haw. 425, 430, 664 P.2d 734, 738 (1983); <em>Hawaii Carpenters\u2019 Trust Funds </em>v. <em>Aloe Development Corp., </em>63 Haw. 566, 578, 633 P.2d 1106, 1113 (1981).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b635-9\"> HRS \u00a7 712-1200 reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-10\">Prostitution.

The Third Amendment in its prohibition against the quartering of soldiers \u201cin any house\u201d in time of peace without the consent of the owner is another facet of that privacy. The Fourth Amendment explicitly affirms the \u201cright of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.\u201d The Fifth Amendment in its Self-Incrimination Clause enables the citizen to create a zone of privacy which government may not force him to surrender to his detriment. The Ninth Amendment provides: \u201cThe enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b636-9\">381 U.S. at 484.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b638-8\"> For example, in Griswold v. Connecticut, <em>supra, </em>Justice Goldberg in his concurring opinion stated the constitutionality of the Connecticut adultery and fornication statutes was beyond doubt. 381 U.S. at 498. The opinion also contained the following caveat: \u201cFinally it should be said of the Court\u2019s holding today that it in no way interferes with a State\u2019s proper regulation of sexual promiscuity or misconduct.\u201d 381 U.S. at 498-99. Justice White\u2019s concurring opinion stated \u201cthe State\u2019s policy against all forms of promiscuous or illicit sexual relationships, be they premarital or extramarital, [was] concededly a permissible and legitimate legislative goal.\u201d 381 U.S. at 505. Justice Harlan based his concurring opinion on his dissent in Poe v. Ullman, 367 U.S. 497 (1961). <em>See </em>381 U.S. at 500. The dissent in Poe v. Ullman contained this statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aycu\">Yet the very inclusion of the category of morality among state concerns indicates that society is not limited in its objects only to the physical well-being of the community, but has traditionally concerned itself with the moral soundness of its people as well. Indeed to attempt a line between public behavior and that which is purely consensual or solitary would be to withdraw from community concern a range of subjects with which every society in civilized times has found it necessary to deal. The laws regarding marriage which provide both when the sexual powers may be used and the legal and societal context in which children are born and brought up, as well as laws forbidding adultery, fornication and homosexual practices which express the negative of the proposition, confining sexuality to lawful marriage, form a pattern so deeply pressed into the substance of our social life that any Constitutional doctrine in this area must build upon that basis.

Yet the trend of modern thought on prostitution in this country is that \u201cpublic policy\u201d demands that the criminal law go on record against prostitution. Defining this \u201cpublic policy\u201d is a difficult task. Perhaps it more correctly ought to be considered and termed \u201cpublic demand\u201d \u2014 a widespread community attitude which the penal law must take into account regardless of the questionable rationales upon which it is based.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-12\">A number of reasons have been advanced for the suppression of prostitution, the most often repeated of which are: \u201cthe prevention of disease, the protection of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>innocent girls from exploitation, and the danger that more sinister activities may be financed by the gains from prostitution.\u201d These reasons are not convincing. Venereal disease is not prevented by laws attempting to suppress prostitution. If exploitation were a significant factor, the offense could be dealt with solely in terms of coercion. Legalizing prostitution would decrease the prostitute\u2019s dependence upon and connection with the criminal underworld and might decrease the danger that \"organized crime\u201d might be financed in part by criminally controlled prostitution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b643-10\">Commentary on HRS \u00a7 712-1200 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b644-8\"> Footnote 5 at 431 U.S. 688 reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-9\">Contrary to the suggestion advanced in Mr. Justice Powell\u2019s opinion, we do not hold that state regulation must meet this standard \u201cwhenever it implicates sexual freedom,\u201d <em>post, </em>at 705, or \u201caffectfs] adult sexual relations,\u201d post, at 703, but only when it \u201cburden[s] an individual\u2019s right to decide to prevent conception or terminate pregnancy by substantially limiting access to the means of effectuating that decision.\u201d <em>Supra, </em>this page.

Making prostitution a criminal offense is one method of controlling the scope of prostitution and thereby protecting those segments of society which are offended by its open existence. This \u201cabolitionist\u201d approach is not without its vociferous detractors. There are those that contend that the only honest and workable approach to the problem is to legalize prostitution and confine it to certain localities within a given community. While such a proposal may exhibit foresight and practicality, the fact remains that a large segment of society is not presently willing to accept such a liberal approach. Recognizing this fact and the need for public order, the Code makes prostitution and its associate enterprises criminal offenses.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b646-9\"> Our opinion here is limited to the question of whether the right to privacy guaranteed by Article I, Section 6 of the Hawaii Constitution is broad enough to include a decision to engage in prostitution.
