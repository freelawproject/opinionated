The effect of the decision below was to hold the appellee exempted from the provisions of the Hawaii Employment Security Law with respect to services performed by her employees. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-13\">The enterprise run by appellee consists of 12-1/2 acres located at Kalaheo, Kauai, which is operated as an arboretum. An admission fee is charged to visitors of the gardens and the gate receipts account for 90% of the total revenues. The other 10% is derived 6% from rental income and 4% from the retail sale of plants.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-14\">Section 383-9, HRS, defines a farm as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-15\">As used in this section, \u201cfarm\u201d includes stock, dairy, poultry, fruit, furbearing animal, and truck farms, planta<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>tions, ranches, nurseries, ranges, greenhouses or other similar structures used primarily for the raising of agricultural or horticultural commodities and orchards.</blockquote>\n<attorneys id=\"AuH\"><em>James W.
