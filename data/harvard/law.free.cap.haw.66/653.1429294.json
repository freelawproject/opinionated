Lo (the defendant) by installing electronic viewing, amplifying, and recording devices in a hotel room to which he had been lured by a patient feigning, under the direction of law enforcement officers with whom she was cooperating, an urgent need for his medical attention. The Circuit Court of the First Circuit suppressed the evidence to remedy what it concluded was a constitutional violation, and the State appeals. It asserts there was no invasion of defendant\u2019s constitutional or statutory right to privacy because the patient consented to the surveillance. We affirm the trial court\u2019s suppression order, but on statutory rather than constitutional grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-9\">The defendant was indicted for Promoting a Dangerous Drug in the Second Degree in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) \u00a7 712-1242(l)(c). The investigation leading to the indictment was triggered by a report made by a pharmacist to a State narcotics control officer on March 5, 1981 of the receipt of what appeared to be a forged drug prescription written on a form bearing the defendant\u2019s name. When the defendant was informed of this report, he told the officer that blank prescription forms had been stolen earlier from his office by two of his patients, Lawrence Padilla and Charisse Sundberg. Several days later the pharmacist was shown photographs of several persons who the officer thought might have passed the prescription. She selected the likeness of Charisse Sundberg as that of the person who had done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-10\">On the morning of March 12, 1981, approximately a week after the State narcotics control agency had been alerted to the possible offense, several agents assigned to the Investigation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>and Narcotics Control Section (INCS) proceeded to the residence of Lawrence Padilla and Charisse Sundberg to question them. The suspects acknowledged receiving barbiturates and prescriptions for other controlled substances from the defendant; they also implicated him in criminal activity related to the use of drugs. The officers then prevailed upon them to cooperate with the agency in obtaining evidence of the defendant\u2019s criminal activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">Miss Sundberg went to the office of the INCS later that day as instructed and was advised of a covert plan to develop evidence incriminating the defendant. Following directions given her by INCS agents, she telephoned the defendant at his office and asked him to come to a Waikiki hotel, claiming to be in desperate need of counselling and medication. The defendant agreed to see her at 5:30 p.m., approximately two hours later.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">The agents thereupon set about the tasks of securing two adjoining rooms at the hotel and equipment required to monitor and electronically record the event they had arranged. They encountered some difficulty in obtaining the equipment and personnel necessary for the planned surveillance. They sought aid from other agencies, but were not in a position to further implement the plan at the prearranged hour. Miss Sundberg was therefore instructed to delay the meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">The defendant arrived at the hotel at 7:00 p.m. and proceeded to the room then occupied by Miss Sundberg. Unbeknownst to the defendant, of course, audio and video apparatus to effectuate a surveillance of activities therein had been installed, and what transpired thereafter was monitored by INCS agents occupying the adjoining room.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At a crucial moment when the defendant handed Miss Sundberg a vial containing drug capsules, an officer posing as her \u201cbusiness manager\u201d entered and grabbed it from her. The defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>made several attempts to recover it from the \u201cbusiness manager,\u201d but did not succeed. And he eventually departed an hour or so after he arrived, without the drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">The electronically recorded evidence of defendant\u2019s criminal activity, as well as other evidence acquired by the government agents in the course of their investigation, was subsequently presented to the Grand Jury in and for the Circuit Court of the First Circuit, and the jury returned the indictment sought by the Prosecuting Attorney. Upon reviewing the transcript of grand jury proceedings and other information supplied by the prosecution, defendant\u2019s counsel sought to exclude from trial \u201cany and all video and audio tapes, transcripts, and/or reports derived therefrom\u201d and \u201cany and all evidence, physical or electronic, derived from the electronic eavesdropping, surveillance and monitoring conducted during the investigation.\u201d He further moved to suppress any testimony based on information obtained from the foregoing conduct; and he moved for the return of the drug capsules and for the dismissal of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">The trial court after conducting a full hearing excluded \u201cthe audio and video recordings and the testimony of the agents who monitored such recordings\u201d as evidence. The defendant\u2019s pleas for the return of the drug capsules and for the dismissal of the indictment, however, were denied. While it discussed the constitutional and statutory objections raised by the defendant and found merit in both, the court expressly granted the suppression order as \u201cthe clear remedy for the violation of section 7, article I\u201d of the State Constitution.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Aac\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\">Though the circuit court ruled that the electronic surveillance of the activities in the hotel room breached the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to privacy, we are by no means obliged \u201cto pass upon a constitutional question although properly presented by the record, if there is also present some other ground upon which the case may be disposed of.\u201d <em>Ashwander </em>v. <em>Tennessee Valley Authority, </em>297 U.S. 288, 347 (1936) (Brand\u00e9is, J., concurring). \u201cThus, if a case can be decided on either of two grounds, one involving a constitutional question, the other a question of statutory construction or general law,... [this court] will decide only the latter.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The question at the threshold whenever constitutional questions are pressed upon us for decision, therefore, is whether there may be another ground upon which the case can be decided. <em>See State </em>v. <em>Bumanglag, </em>63 Haw. 596, 615, 634 P.2d 80, 93 (1981); <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>56 Haw. 295, 305, 535 P.2d 1109, 1116 (1975); <em>cf. State v. W. Tin Yan, </em>44 Haw. 370, 383, 355 P.2d 25, 32 (1960) (\u201cCourts generally will not pass upon the constitutionality of a law unless necessary to the determination upon the merits of the cause under consideration.\u201d); <em>Territory </em>v. <em>Gaudia, </em>41 Haw. 213, 214-15 (1955) (\u201cCourts will not pass upon the validity of a statute in any case unless it is necessary to a decision of the case so to do.\u201d) We think there is such ground here; like the circuit court, we find merit in the defendant\u2019s claim that the electronic eavesdropping carried on by the State in this case was prohibited by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">Electronic eavesdropping by the State and its agents is regulated by Hawaii\u2019s Wiretap Law, HRS \u00a7\u00a7 803-41 to 803-50. The law generally proscribes the electronic surveillance of wire communications but permits law enforcement officers to intercept such communications in the investigation of criminal offenses when the interception is pursuant to a valid court order or otherwise authorized by law.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> For the most part our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>law follows the federal statute governing the use of wiretaps by law enforcement officers. It reiterates many of the provisions of Title III of the Omnibus Criminal Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See </em>A. Bowman, <em>Hawaii\u2019s New Wiretap Law, </em>14 Haw. Bar J., No. 3, at 84 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">Yet it departs from the federal paradigm in a presently significant aspect. The relevant provision of the Hawaii law, like the prototype,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> allows the interception of a wire or oral communication where the interceptor is a party to the communication or where one of the parties has given prior consent to the interception. But HRS \u00a7 803-42(b)(3) goes further and forbids the surreptitious installation in a \u201cprivate place\u201d of any device to record, amplify, or broadcast sounds emanating from or events occurring in the \u201cprivate place\u201d; the subsection reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ay7\">It shall not be unlawful under this part for a person to intercept a wire or oral communication where such person is a party to the communication or where one of the parties to the communication has given prior consent to such interception unless such communication is intercepted for the purpose of committing any criminal or tortious act in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States or of this State or for the purpose of committing any other injurious act; <em>provided that installation in any private place, without consent of the person or persons entitled to </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number><em>privacy therein, of any device for recording, amplifying, or broadcasting sounds or events in that place, or use of any such unauthorized installation, or installation or use outside a private place of such device to intercept sounds originating in that place which would not ordinarily be audible or comprehensible outside, without the consent of the person or persons entitled to privacy therein is prohibited. </em>(Emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">The proviso above plainly outlaws the \u201cbugging\u201d of \u201cany private place,\u201d unless the parties entitled to privacy therein consent. <em>See </em>A. Bowman, <em>supra, </em>at 85.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">The State concedes \u201cthat if the literal language of section 803-42 controls, the eavesdropping recordings by the agents fall outside the statute since \u2018wire\u2019 was not used in the eavesdropping.\u201d However, it argues a literal application would do violence to or be in conflict with a legislative intent to permit the interception of both wire and oral communications where one of the parties consents.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-8\">Although \u201cwe have rejected an approach to statutory construction which limits us to the words of a statute, no matter how clear they may appear upon perfunctory review,\u201d <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Financial Plaza Contractors, </em>64 Haw. 415, 420, 643 P.2d 48, 52 (1982), it is still fundamental \u201cthat the starting point for interpreting a statute is the language of the statute itself.\u201d <em>Consumer Product Safety Commission </em>v. <em>GTE Sylvania, Inc., </em>447 U.S. 102, 108 (1980). And \u201c[ajbsent a clearly expressed legislative intention to the contrary, that language must ordinarily be regarded as conclusive.\u201d <em>Id.; see also In re Tax Appeal of Queen\u2019s Medical Center, </em>66 Haw. 318, 324, 661 P.2d 1201, 1205 (1983); <em>Travelers Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>Hawaii Roofing, Inc., </em>64 Haw. 380, 383-84, 641 P.2d 1333, 1336-37 (1982). Yet, it has not been our practice \u201cto seek refuge in \u2018strict construction,\u2019 \u2018plain meaning,\u2019 or \u2018the popular sense of the words,\u2019\u201d where there is \u201cmaterial evidencing legislative purpose and intent.\u201d <em>Black Construction Corp. </em>v. <em>Agsalud, </em>64 Haw. 274, 284, 639 P.2d 1088, 1094 (1982). We thus examine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>the material at hand to see whether it substantiates the State\u2019s claim that the legislature meant to allow consensual \u201cbugging\u201d as well as consensual wiretapping.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">The Judiciary Committee of the State House of Representatives reporting on House Bill No. 2434-78, which was subsequently enacted as Hawaii\u2019s Wiretap Law and codified as HRS \u00a7\u00a7 803-41 to 803-50, acknowledged that the measure followed the related federal statute. Hse. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 605-78, in 1978 House Journal, at 1661.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> But the committee emphasized that \u201cthe bill incorporate^] added safeguards against unwarranted invasions of privacy\u201d and that there were \u201csignificant differences between the bill and the federal and most other state wire-tapping statutes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Among the differences specifically noted was \u201cthe complete prohibition of court-ordered bugging.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">The Judiciary Committee of the State Senate, to which the measure was also referred for consideration, submitted a report reflecting similar views. <em>See </em>Sen. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 983, in 1978 Senate Journal, at 1172.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Like its House <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>counterpart, the Senate committee pointedly affirmed \u201cthe prohibition of bugging\u201d in the proposed legislation. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">Given the plain language of HRS \u00a7 803-42(b)(3) and the expressions of legislative sentiment confirming the proscription of \u201cbugging\u201d in an even clearer idiom, we would have to conclude there is no foundation for the State\u2019s contention that the statutory scheme condones consensual \u201cbugging.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">We also see no reason to adopt the State\u2019s thesis that <em>State v. Lester, </em>64 Haw. 659, 668, 649 P.2d 346, 353 (1982), is dispositive of the question posed by this appeal, though we realize the holding there was that \u201cparticipant monitoring\u201d of a conversation between the defendant and a government informer did not contravene Hawaii\u2019s Wiretap Law. The meeting between the defendant and the government informer in <em>Lester </em>took place in a public park, and the dialogue was recorded by a \u201cbug\u201d the informer carried on her person. There was no installation of an electronic device in \u201cany private place,\u201d and <em>Lester </em>is not controlling precedent here.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-8\">Nor do we find substance in the State\u2019s suggestion that the surveillance of the hotel room occupied by Charisse Sundberg was not subject to judicial reproof since it was unreasonable for the defendant to expect the content of their conversation would not be revealed by her. HRS \u00a7 803-42(b)(3) condemns the surreptitious installation of electronic viewing, listening, and recording devices; it protects \u201cany private place\u201d and the privacy of anyone rightfully there. What we aie expounding, therefore, is a statutory right associated with places; we are not dealing with notions of privacy unrelated thereto, which have been incorporated in Fourth Amendment jurisprudence since <em>Katz </em>v. <em>United States, </em>389 U.S. 347, 351-52 (1967). And we experience no qualms in holding a hotel room ostensibly serving as someone\u2019s temporary abode is a \u201cprivate place\u201d and a physician called there by the occupant is \u201centitled to privacy therein\u201d by virtue of his rightful presence. <em>Cf. Lanza </em>v. <em>New York, </em>370 U.S. 139, 143 (1962) (\u201cA hotel room, in the eyes of the Fourth Amendment, may become a person\u2019s \u2018house.\u2019\u201d); <em>Jones v. United States, </em>362 U.S. 257, 267 (1960) (A person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>permitted to use an apartment may \u201cinvoke the privacy of the premises\u201d to challenge the legality of a search thereof).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">Having decided that the defendant\u2019s statutory right to privacy was breached by the emplacement of electronic eyes and ears, we do not reach the constitutional question raised by the State. But this renders it necessary for us to consider whether the remedy afforded the defendant was nonetheless proper, inasmuch as the trial court fashioned its remedial order in terms of a constitutional rather than a statutory violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">To be sure, the Wiretap Law speaks of a remedy \u2014 HRS \u00a7 803-46(i)(l) permits an \u201caggrieved person\u201d to seek the suppression of \u201cany intercepted wire communication, or evidence derived therefrom\u201d on grounds that it was \u201cunlawfully intercepted.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> But what may be excluded from trial pursuant to the subsection appears to be limited to unlawfully intercepted <em>wire </em>communications and evidence derived therefrom. There is no provision explicitly permitting an aggrieved person to move for the suppression of evidence obtained through the installa-. tion of microphones and video cameras.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-8\">Yet it would be the height of illogic for us to assume the legislature intended that one aggrieved by \u201cbugging,\u201d a practice it flatly prohibited, should be without a practical remedy. In our opinion the omission was inadvertent, and it is implicit in the Wiretap Law that evidence obtained in violation of its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>provisions should not be used against \u00e1 person aggrieved by the illegal conduct.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A8J\"><em>Arthur E. Ross (Peter C. Hsieh </em>on reply brief), Deputies Prosecuting Attorney, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"Anz\"><em>Wilfred H. C. Youth (Thomas J. Wong </em>with him on the brief; <em>Ikazaki, Devens, Lo, Youth &amp; Nakano, </em>of counsel) for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b679-4\">The order suppressing evidence is affirmed, and the case is remanded for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b671-8\"> N o warrant authorizing the monitoring and recording of the activities was sought by the agents since they believed Miss Sundberg\u2019s cooperation rendered it unnecessary for them to do so.
