We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>Appellant Paradise Hui Hanalike, a Hawaii non-profit corporation, and certain individual lot owners in the Hawaiian Paradise Park subdivision brought an action to require the owners of lots in Increment I of that subdivision to contribute to the maintenance of the private roadways in the subdivision. Increment I contains several thousand lots and the roads in question, apparently, total over a hundred miles in length. The deeds issued to the lot owners in Increment I are silent as to the obligation to contribute to the maintenance of roads.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">The court below entered findings of fact and conclusions of law, holding that the lot owners in Increment I, whose deeds did not contain road maintenance clauses, nevertheless had a duty to contribute to road maintenance where their lots abutted on the private subdivision roadways. However, the court dismissed the action because the proposed relief, by way of a mandatory injunction requiring payments to Paradise Hui Hanalike, a non-profit corporation, was inappropriate. The court held that road maintenance by that corporation was ultra vires; that the corporation by-laws deprived out-of-state lot owners of a right to vote for officers and directors of the corporation; and that the proposed means of carrying out the assessments by requiring payments to that corporation were innately unfair.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">We agree with the court below that the specific relief of a mandatory injunction requiring payments to the appellant corporation was inappropriate. There was, however, a prayer for general relief and as this court has said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-7\">As Chancellor Hardwicke, quoting \u2018very eminent counsel,\u2019 said \u2018general relief was the best prayer next to the Lord\u2019s Prayer.\u2019 <em>(Cook </em>v. <em>Martyn, 2 </em>Atk. 2, 3, 26 Eng. Rep. 399 [Ch. 1737].)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-8\"><em>Lum </em>v. <em>Kwong, </em>39 Haw. 532, 542 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-9\">As the <em>Lum </em>case recognized when the specific relief sought from a court having equity powers cannot be granted, appropriate relief will be fashioned by the court. <em>See Eastern I. &amp; M. </em>v. <em>Patterson, et als., </em>39 Haw. 346 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-10\">We hold, as did the court below, that the lot owners whose lots abut on subdivision roads have a legal duty to contribute to necessary maintenance of the roads in the subdivision even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>though their deeds are silent on the matter. Accordingly, the case is remanded to the circuit court to fashion, by decree, an appropriate remedy to enforce that duty.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AaJ\"><em>Stuart H.
