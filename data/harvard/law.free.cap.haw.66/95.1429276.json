The indictment failed to allege that the person against whom the force was used, June Suenaga, was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>either physically present or was the owner of the property stolen. However, the challenge to the indictment came only after conviction. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Motta, </em>66 Haw. 89, 657 P.2d 1019 (1983), we adopted a liberal approach to the construction of indictments where the challenge is after conviction. Using that approach here, we hold that the indictment sufficiently alleged the elements of the crime of robbery to meet a post-conviction challenge.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys id=\"Au\"><em>Isaac Smith (Daphne E. Barbee </em>on the opening brief and <em>Alvin T. Sasaki </em>and law clerk <em>Ger\u00f3nimo Valdriz </em>on the reply brief), Deputy Public Defender, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"ACK\"><em>Shirley Smith, </em>Deputy Prosecuting Attorney, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">The record is crystal clear that appellant knew that the State was contending that June Suenaga was present when he threatened her in the course of committing the theft of an automobile. The facts are that he threatened to kill her and physically threw her out of the car she had been driving. Obviously, the omitted allegations did not prejudice appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b112-9\"> Because we read <em>State </em>v. <em>Jendrusch, </em>58 Haw. 279, 567 P.2d 1242 (1977), differently, we reached a different result on the robbery charge, from that reached by the Intermediate Court of Appeals in <em>State </em>v. <em>Tuua, </em>3 Haw. App. 287, 649 P.2d 1180 (1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
