Concluding that the requested remedy should have been granted because the possible barrier to performance by the Boyces was removed within a reasonable time of the date specified for the \u201cclosing\u201d of the agreement, we reverse the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-11\">The subject property is a 24.78 acre parcel of unimproved land which the Boyces acquired in 1972 through a sub-agreement of sale. They subsequently agreed to sell the property to Mr. and Mrs. Albert Braun (the Brauns) by way of a sub-sub-agreement of sale. The contract between the Boyces and the Brauns was evidenced by a DROA<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> executed on July 6, 1977. The DROA stipulated that \u201ctime was of the essence\u201d in the consummation of the contract and it was to be closed on or before October 1, 1977. Although the closing date was later extended to November 1, 1977, the agreement was never <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>closed. The Boyces ascribe the failure to consummate the contract to the Brauns\u2019 intransigence on the terms relating to the satisfaction of the underlying agreement between the fee owner and the party from whom the Boyces obtained their interest in the land. And they have maintained throughout these proceedings that the Brauns\u2019 contract was unenforceable after November 1, 1977.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">The Freemans tendered their offer to purchase the subject property on November 17,1977 through Robert Prosser, a real estate broker. When he inquired of the Boyces whether such a bid would be entertained, he was instructed by Mr. Boyce to transmit the DROA containing the offer directly to Paul Klaverkamp, an attorney in Minneapolis, because of a concern about the prior agreement with the Brauns. The broker forwarded the document to Mr. Boyce\u2019s lawyer as instructed, and the DROA was subsequently returned to him with the Boyces\u2019 signatures affixed. But attached to the document was an \u201caddendum\u201d prepared by Mr. Klaverkamp which had also been signed by the Boyces. The appendix in pertinent part stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-6\">Sellers entered into a Purchase Agreement covering the premises in July of 1977 which included certain contingencies. These contingencies were not fulfilled and the closing date passed with both sides rejecting the contract. However, section 7 of the Purchase Agreement should be interpreted to deny purchasers an action for damages or specific performance if (and only if) a closing cannot be held because the purchasers under the July agreement prevent said closing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">The attorney\u2019s covering letter provided an explanation for the added language; it also reiterated the concern expressed earlier by Mr. Boyce about the previous unconsummated contract.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>The Freemans accepted the additional provisions drafted by the Boyces\u2019 lawyer on December 13, 1977. The augmented DROA fixed a February 1, 1978 closing date for the transaction. But unlike the Boyce-Braun contract, it contained no provision that time was to be considered essential in its performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">Meanwhile, however, the Brauns were still pressing to complete their transaction in the face of assertions by the Boyces that the contract had expired and they were \u201cno longer interested in looking at Purchase Agreements that have lengthy addendums.\u201d By letter dated December 11, 1977, a real estate broker acting on behalf of the Brauns informed Mr. Klaverkamp of their continuing interest in consummating the agreement. The letter further conveyed a threat that \u201cif no substantial progress has been made toward closing by the end of this month [December] Mr. Braun appears to have no recourse but to deposit funds in escrow sufficient to close the transaction and commence an action for specific performance.\u201d The attorney for the Boyces responded with a detailed recapitulation of their position, which essentially was that the inflexibility of the Brauns had rendered closing impossible. His parting shot was: \u201cThe Boyces do not understand from a layman\u2019s standpoint, nor I from a legal standpoint, why the Purchase Agreement did not terminate by its terms on November 1, 1977.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">Mr. Prosser was apprised of the foregoing events and the possibility that the Boyces might be prevented from fulfilling the purchase agreement with the Freemans. But a copy of the strongly worded letter outlining the Boyces\u2019 position with respect to the termination of the Brauns\u2019 purchase agreement was also given to the broker.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>The Brauns subsequently retained a Kauai attorney who wrote Mr. Klaverkamp on December 29, 1977, again threatening suit to enforce the Boyce-Braun agreement if it was not closed within a month. This did not appear to affect the Boyces\u2019 resolve; they claimed as before that the contract had expired on November 1, 1977. The Brauns then followed up by placing funds in escrow to be applied to the agreement. But the promised suit to enforce performance did not materialize. Even the threat of legal action faded away on May 20, 1978 when Mr. Klaverkamp was notified that Mr. Braun had purchased an adjoining parcel of property and the contract had been \u201ccan-celled.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">The Freemans in the meantime took steps to demonstrate an active interest in their agreement. On February 6,1978 they sent a letter to the sellers proposing an extension of the closing date to August 1,1978. The sellers were also informed thereby that $5,000 had been deposited with the Security Title Corporation, the \u201cescrow\u201d designated by the agreement. Though the letter acknowledged the plight of the Boyces and that the transaction could not be closed \u201cat this time due to threatened litigation,\u201d it also reiterated the Freemans\u2019 understanding that the agreement was still viable. The Boyces, however, failed to respond to a request to \u201cnote your approval of the extension by signing below.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">On April 13, 1978, the Boyces\u2019 attorney instructed an agent of the Security Title Corporation to \u201creturn all documents and earnest monies to Dr. Freeman that he may have deposited with you\u201d and also asked the Freemans\u2019 broker to \u201creturn the Purchase Agreements executed with Dr. Freeman.\u201d But the attorney assured the broker that \u201c[w]e will be in contact with you again when the Braun matter has been resolved.\u201d The record discloses neither an assent by the Freemans nor action by the title company on the unilateral requests. The record, however, reveals that on June 27, 1978, the manager of the company\u2019s Kauai office responded, stating in part: \u201cThe seller does not want to sell; the purchaser wishes to proceed. Escrow cannot continue until an agreement is reached between the Seller and the Buyer.\u201d The purchasers\u2019 request to proceed had been made earlier on May 31, 1978 by an attorney retained by the Freemans.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>The complaint for specific performance brought by the Freemans on September 6, 1978 was tried before the circuit court on September 29, 1980, and judgment in favor of the Boyces was entered on March 31, 1981. Although the circuit court concluded \u201c[tjime was not of the essence\u201d in the performance of the agreement, it ruled the Boyces were \u201clegally and equitably entitled to cancellation of the transaction contemplated by the Boyce-Freeman DROA\u201d because a lawsuit against the Boyces appeared likely on February 1, 1978. It further concluded that \u201c[ujnder the circumstances of this case, it would be inequitable to compel specific performance by the Boyces.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">The questions posed by the Freemans\u2019 appeal, therefore, are whether the Boyces were legally entitled to unilaterally cancel the purchase agreement and whether the record sustains a conclusion that it was inequitable to compel specific performance by the Boyces.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">We begin our analysis by examining the executory contract for the sale of land signed by the parties, a DROA with an addendum prepared by the sellers\u2019 attorney. A properly executed DROA, we have said, \u201cbinds the buyer to buy and the seller to sell a particular property at a fixed consideration.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Kunimoto, </em>62 Haw. 502, 508, 617 P.2d 93, 98 (1980); <em>see also State </em>v. <em>Pioneer Mill Co., </em>64 Haw. 168, 174, 637 P.2d 1131, 1136 (1981). Though no one challenged the execution of the DROA, the circuit court nonetheless concluded the sellers were not bound thereby. Their performance was excused because the court concluded the buyers had waived the right to seek performance by accepting the addendum, which provided that the contract should be interpreted to deny such right \u201cif (and only if) a closing cannot be held because the purchasers under ... [a prior] agreement prevent... [such] closing,\u201d and on the exact day designated for closing there was a likelihood that legal proceedings might be instituted.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">Courts, however, have seldom regarded time as absolute or unbending within the context of a bilateral contract for the purchase and sale of land. 3A <em>Corbin on Contracts </em>\u00a7 716 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>(1960). For \u201c[u]nless otherwise specifically provided by the parties, the general rule is that time is not the essence in a contract for the sale of land. <em>Guy </em>v. <em>Hanley, </em>111 N.H. 73, 276 A.2d 1 (1971); <em>Knable </em>v. <em>Bradley, </em>430 Pa. 153, 242 A.2d 224 (1968); <em>Reutt </em>v. <em>Jordan, </em>207 Va. 869, 153 S.E.2d 197 (1967).\u201d <em>Gum </em>v. <em>Nakamura, </em>57 Haw. 39, 44, 549 P.2d 471, 475 (1976); <em>see also Lum </em>v. <em>Stevens, </em>42 Haw. 286, 288 (1958) (In suits for specific performance, \u201ctime is not ordinarily regarded as of the essence of a contract.\u201d). Here, as the circuit court found, the parties chose not to make performance within the stated period essential. Yet, specific performance was denied buyers who stood ready to fulfill their end of the bargain exactly as stipulated. Viewing the relevant circumstances in the light of controlling precedent, we perceive no grounds to sustain such denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">The circuit court premised its refusal of relief on the language in the appendix to the DROA providing that the Free-mans would have no \u201caction for damages or specific performance if (and only if) a closing cannot be held because the purchasers under the July agreement prevent . . . [such] closing.\u201d It concluded \u201cthe Boyces were prevented from performing\u201d because \u201c[b]y February 1, 1978, the agreed closing date of the Boyce-Freeman DROA, the Brauns\u2019 acts and demands made a.lawsuit by them against the Boyces appear likely.\u201d That the Boyces were prevented from performing merely because a possibility of suit existed on February 1,1978 is open to serious doubt. But we do not find it necessary to discuss the validity of this conclusion. For the court unjustifiably regarded the time specified for performance as absolute despite its finding that it had not been made so by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">HI.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">The circuit court further concluded \u201cit would be inequitable to compel specific performance by the Boyces\u201d; yet nothing in the findings rendered by the court supports this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">The findings do not recite that the delay in the closing of the agreement deprived the Boyces of anything they had bargained for. Nor is there even an allusion to a possible forfeiture of any part of the consideration they were entitled to receive. To hold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>the Boyces to their agreement for a period of four months beyond February 1, 1978 would hardly be unreasonable, especially where the delay in performance was attributable to them and not the Freemans; on the other hand, to deny the Free-mans what had been bargained for when they were willing and able to perform exactly as agreed would not be consonant with principles of equity. \u201cBy the terms of the contract the land ought to be conveyed by the vendee, and the purchase price ought to be transferred to the vendor.\u201d 2 J. Pomeroy, <em>A Treatise on Equity Jurisprudence </em>\u00a7 368 (5th ed. 1941); <em>see also 4 </em>J. Pomeroy, <em>A Treatise on Equity Jurisprudence </em>\u00a7 1402 (5th ed. 1941).</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A2Q\"><em>Calvin K. Murashige (Clinton I.
