The sole point on appeal, although stated in three different ways, is a claim that the court committed error by finding the complaining witness\u2019 testimony more credible than that of the appellant since the prosecutor and appellant\u2019s attorney had stipulated that appellant was credible. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-15\">To begin with, the stipulation was not that appellant was more credible than the complaining witness. It simply was that he was credible. If both were credible, the court below had to choose between them and make a finding on credibility because their testimony as to whether appellant took the goods in question was diametrically opposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-16\">Moreover, it is well established that matters affecting the public interest cannot be made the subject of stipulation so as to control the court\u2019s action with respect thereto. 73 AM. JUR.2d, <em>Stipulations, </em>\u00a7 4(1974); 83 C.J.S., <em>Stipulations, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 17 and 23(b) (1953). Criminal cases are <em>per se </em>matters affecting public interest and so the court\u2019s determination of credibility <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>cannot be controlled by the parties\u2019 stipulations.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Aqr\"><em>Michael K.
