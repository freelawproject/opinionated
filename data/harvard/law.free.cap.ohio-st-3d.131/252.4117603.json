We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-13\">I. Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b432-14\">{\u00b6 2} In 1949, Ohio Edison purchased an easement in Boardman, Ohio, for the purpose of building and maintaining an electric transmission line. Today, a 69,000-volt electric transmission line runs over the property. In 1977, Thomas and Derrell Wilkes purchased a portion of the property subject to the easement, and in 1993, they built an above-ground swimming pool and a storage shed in the area of the easement.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>{\u00b6 3} Ohio Edison discovered the structures 15 years later. It informed the couple that the pool and shed presented safety issues and asked them to \u201crelocate or remove\u201d the structures. The Wilkeses retained an attorney, who informed Ohio Edison that he would \u201chave each and every employee of Ohio Edison who trespass or attempt to trespass on Mr. and Mrs. Wilkes\u2019 property arrested and charged with all felony criminal statutes presently enacted in the State of Ohio.\u201d Ohio Edison responded by filing a complaint in the court of common pleas to enforce the easement, asking the court to order the Wilkeses to remove their structures.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">{\u00b6 4} The Wilkeses filed their own complaint a few months later, not with a court, but with the commission. They asked the commission to order the company to move its transmission line.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">{\u00b6 5} Ohio Edison filed a motion to dismiss the Wilkeses\u2019 complaint, asserting lack of jurisdiction. The commission granted the motion. It found that the technical issue \u2014 that the proximity of the pool and shed to the transmission lines violates the National Electrical Safety Code \u2014 was undisputed. What <em>was </em>disputed was \u201cthe remedy that should be applied to bring about compliance with the [code],\u201d that is, which structure must give way, the pool and shed or the transmission line. But that dispute involved a legal question of \u201ccompeting property rights\u201d and thus belonged before the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">{\u00b6 6} The Wilkeses have appealed; Ohio Edison has intervened as an appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-9\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b433-10\">{\u00b6 7} The Wilkeses present three propositions of law on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-11\">{\u00b6 8} In the first, they argue that the commission has exclusive jurisdiction over a claim for \u201cservice-related issues\u201d that \u201ccalls for the interpretation and enforcement of the National Electrical Safety Code.\u201d However, the Wilkeses have not stated such a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-12\">{\u00b6 9} As a general matter, the commission \u201cdoes not possess judicial power and may not adjudicate controversies between parties as to property rights.\u201d <em>Dayton Communications Corp. v. Pub. Util. Comm., </em>64 Ohio St.2d 302, 303-304, 414 N.E.2d 1051 (1980); <em>New Bremen v. Pub. Util. Comm., </em>103 Ohio St. 23, 30-31, 132 N.E. 162 (1921). But it does possess exclusive jurisdiction over certain types of claims, set forth in R.C. 4905.26. <em>Corrigan v. Illum. Co., </em>122 Ohio St.3d 265, 2009-Ohio-2524, 910 N.E.2d 1009, \u00b6 8-9. A claim is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the commission if (1) the commission\u2019s administrative expertise is required to resolve the issue in dispute <em>and </em>(2) the act complained of is a practice normally authorized by the utility. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 11-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-13\">{\u00b6 10} The Wilkeses have not shown that the commission\u2019s expertise is required to resolve the disputed issue. Their only jurisdictional theory is that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>this case requires the commission to interpret the National Electrical Safety Code. Yet the Wilkeses offer no explanation of how the code applies to this case \u2014 indeed, they do not cite even a single page or section of it. This lack of explanation and citation of authority suffices as a basis for rejecting their argument. <em>See, e.g., In re Application of Columbus S. Power Co., </em>129 Ohio St.3d 271, 2011-Ohio-2638, 951 N.E.2d 751, \u00b6 14 (failure to \u201ccite a single legal authority\u201d or \u201cpresent an argument that a legal authority applies on these facts and was violated * * * is grounds to reject [a] claim\u201d); <em>Util. Serv. Partners, Inc. v. Pub. Util. Comm., </em>124 Ohio St.3d 284, 2009-Ohio-6764, 921 N.E.2d 1038, \u00b6 39 (\u201cunsupported legal conclusions\u201d do not establish error).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">{\u00b6 11} We decline to accept the first proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">{\u00b6 12} In their second proposition of law, the Wilkeses argue that the commission had \u201cindependent\u201d jurisdiction over their claims because the claims were based upon the statutes governing the commission and the commission\u2019s own rules. It is true that in a given case, the commission and the courts may each have jurisdiction that is independent of the other. When a case has both regulatory and legal issues, the commission would have jurisdiction over the former by virtue of its exclusive jurisdiction, while a court may adjudicate the latter by virtue of its general jurisdiction. <em>Corrigan, </em>122 Ohio St.3d 265, 2009-Ohio-2524, 910 N.E.2d 1009. <em>See also State ex rel. The Illum. Co. v. Cuyahoga Cty. Court of Common Pleas, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 69, 2002-Ohio-5312, 776 N.E.2d 92, \u00b6 18-21, 32. But the Wilkeses have not demonstrated that an \u201cindependent\u201d regulatory claim exists for the commission to resolve. They assert that their claims are independent from those raised in the common pleas court because their claims are based upon two large collections of laws: \u201cthe PUCO statutes (O.R.C. 4905.01 <em>et seq.) </em>and Ohio Administrative Code (Ohio Admin. Code 4901, <em>et seq.).\u201d </em>This is not a meaningful assertion of a regulatory claim \u2014 to cite everything is to cite nothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">{\u00b6 13} As for their argument that \u201ccollateral attacks are permissible in the PUCO,\u201d it is based on a misreading of precedent. (Emphasis deleted.) The case they depend on, <em>W. Res. Transit Auth. v. Pub. Util. Comm., </em>39 Ohio St.2d 16, 313 N.E.2d 811 (1974), held merely that the commission could revisit its <em>own </em>orders, not the orders of a court. <em>Id. </em>at 18; <em>see Martin Marietta Magnesia Specialties, L.L.C. v. Pub. Util. Comm., </em>129 Ohio St.3d 485, 2011-Ohio-4189, 954 N.E.2d 104, \u00b6 41. <em>W. Res. </em>did not address, much less alter, the jurisdictional balance between the commission and the courts, and the case is irrelevant here.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">{\u00b6 14} We decline to accept the second proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">{\u00b6 15} The Wilkeses\u2019 last proposition \u2014 that the commission erred by dismissing their \u201cclaim for unfair and discriminatory treatment\u201d \u2014 is forfeited. The Wilkeses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>did not raise this argument in their application for rehearing before the commission, and we are jurisdictionally barred from considering such claims.

Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">{\u00b6 16} For these reasons, the Wilkeses have not demonstrated that the commission erred in dismissing their complaint for lack of jurisdiction.
