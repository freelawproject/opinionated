Notwithstanding Nickleson\u2019s claims, his sentencing entry was a final, appealable order because it contained a full resolution of all the counts of his indictment for which there were convictions. <em>State ex rel. Davis v. Cuyahoga Cty. Court of Common Pleas, </em>127 Ohio St.3d 29, 2010-Ohio-4728, 936 N.E.2d 41, \u00b6 2; <em>State ex rel. Rose v.

Simpson v. Cooper, </em>120 Ohio St.3d 297, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>2008-Ohio-6110, 898 N.E.2d 936, \u00b6 6 (mandamus petitioner had adequate remedy at law by direct appeal to raise his challenge to the validity or sufficiency of his indictment); <em>Smith v.
