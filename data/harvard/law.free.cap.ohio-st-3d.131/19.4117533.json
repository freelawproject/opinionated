Wyatt McKay, to issue a final, appealable order in his criminal case. Neither mandamus nor procedendo will compel the performance of a duty that has already been performed. See <em>State ex rel. Rose v. McGinty, </em>123 Ohio St.3d 86, 2009-Ohio-4050, 914 N.E.2d 366, \u00b6 2. Judge McKay\u2019s December 11, 2006 sentencing entry in the criminal case fully complied with Crim.R. 32(C) by including the findings of the jury upon which his convictions were based, the sentence, the signature of the judge, and the time stamp indicating entry upon the journal by the clerk of court. See <em>State ex rel. Williams v. McGinty, </em>129 Ohio St.3d 275, 2011-Ohio-2641, 951 N.E.2d 755, \u00b6 1. Insofar as McKinney asserts that Judge McKay erred in his. sentencing entry by stating that he was convicted of first-degree kidnapping instead of second-degree kidnapping, McKinney had an adequate remedy by appeal to raise the claimed sentencing error. <em>State ex rel.
