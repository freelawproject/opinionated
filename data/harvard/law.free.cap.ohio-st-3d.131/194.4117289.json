In June 2010, relator, Akron Bar Association, filed a complaint charging Groner with violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct for filing a pleading that contained misrepresentations and false accusations about an individual who had applied to be administrator in a probate estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-11\">{\u00b6 2} The parties submitted stipulations of fact and mitigation, and a panel of the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline conducted a hearing and made additional findings. The panel concluded that Groner had violated Prof.Cond.R. 3.1 (prohibiting a lawyer from asserting an issue unless there is a basis in law or fact for doing so), 3.3(a)(1) (prohibiting a lawyer from knowingly making a false statement of law or fact to a tribunal) and (3) (prohibiting a lawyer from offering evidence that the lawyer knows to be false and requiring a lawyer to take reasonable measures to remedy the situation when the lawyer discovers that the evidence is false), 4.1 (prohibiting a lawyer from making a false statement of law or fact to a nonclient), and 8.4(c), (d), and (h) (prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation, conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice, and conduct that adversely reflects on the lawyer\u2019s fitness to practice law), as charged. The board adopted the panel\u2019s findings of fact, conclusions of law, and recommended sanction that Groner be suspended from the practice of law in Ohio for 12 months, with six months of the suspension stayed.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-12\">{\u00b6 3} Groner filed objections in which she argued that she did not knowingly make false statements to the court; she claims that she had made the statements in good faith and had withdrawn them when she suspected that they were incorrect. She also argued that while she had made a mistake, she had not intended to deceive, defraud, or misrepresent.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>{\u00b6 4} For the reasons stated below, we sustain Groner\u2019s objections in part. There is insufficient evidence that Groner violated Prof.Cond.R. 8.4(c), (d), and (h), and we dismiss those charges. Consequently, we find that the more appropriate sanction is to suspend Groner from the practice of law in Ohio for six months, with the entire period stayed upon the condition that she commit no further disciplinary violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">Findings of Panel and Board</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">{\u00b6 5} Groner was retained by Zachary Hopson, a Texas resident, to oppose the application of his sister, Brenda Joyce Fowler, to serve as fiduciary of their deceased mother\u2019s estate. Groner entered a notice of appearance in the matter pending in the Probate Court of Summit County, and she filed a motion to recognize Hopson as the named executor in the will and to allow David Pierce, a family friend and resident of Summit County, to serve as cofiduciary.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-9\">{\u00b6 6} The court issued a notice of a hearing for September 8, 2009. When Groner arrived at court that day, she was told there was no oral hearing; instead, she was advised that September 8 was the deadline to submit written objections to the appointment of Fowler as administrator of the estate. She returned to her office to prepare objections for filing that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-10\">{\u00b6 7} While preparing the objections, Groner requested information on Fowler from an online service that provides background reports for a fee, and she also searched a government website that provides \u2014 also for a fee \u2014 case and docket information from federal courts. Groner obtained a 16-page report from Intelius that disclosed that a Brenda Joyce Fowler of New Philadelphia, Ohio, had filed for bankruptcy and had a felony record. The government website confirmed the bankruptcy. Groner admitted that she was panicked that day and did not spend sufficient time reviewing the record, but she testified that, at the time, she believed that the allegations in the multipage report pertained to her client\u2019s sister, and she did not verify the information.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-11\">{\u00b6 8} Using the information she had obtained, Groner next contacted a bonding agency to inquire whether a convicted felon with a bankruptcy record could obtain a probate bond. The agency\u2019s representative, Frank Duffy, testified that he told Groner that such an applicant would not be approved. Groner asked for the rejection in writing. Instead, using the information that Groner had provided, Duffy indicated on a preapplication form that the applicant would be declined and faxed it to Groner.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-12\">{\u00b6 9} Groner prepared and filed written objections in probate court, alleging that Brenda Joyce Fowler would be prohibited from serving as the fiduciary because her personal bankruptcy and felony record precluded her obtaining a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>bond. In support of the allegations, Groner attached the preapplication bond form as Exhibit A.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">{\u00b6 10} When Fowler received a copy of the objections from her attorney, she discovered that the pleading contained false information and accusations about her. The information in the reports that Groner had obtained referred to persons who were not the Brenda Joyce Fowler in this case. The Intelius report referred to 19 different individuals named Brenda J. Fowler or something similar and described persons of different ages, races, locations, and sex. The report disclosed criminal records from states other than Ohio, including Texas, Florida, and Alaska.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">{\u00b6 11} Groner testified that within a few days of filing the objections, after conversations with opposing counsel and her client, she began to suspect that the information she had submitted about Fowler was not correct. Groner subsequently filed a motion for mediation in which she amended the objections to remove most of the allegations made about Fowler.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">{\u00b6 12} The panel concluded, and the board agreed, that there was clear and convincing evidence that Groner had no basis in fact or law for the false assertions and misleading arguments that she had made in a pleading, in violation of Prof.Cond.R. 3.1 and 3.3(a)(1) and (3). The panel also found that that she had filed a pleading containing false statements of material fact that became a public record and that she did not correct these statements, in violation of Prof.Cond.R. 4.1. The panel also concluded, and the board agreed, that there was clear and convincing evidence that Groner\u2019s knowing misrepresentations of fact to a court, her disregard for the truth, and her procurement and use of misleading evidence were a matter of fundamental dishonesty and misrepresentation in violation of Prof.Cond.R. 8.4(c), (d), and (h).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">Groner\u2019s Objections</p>\n<p id=\"b376-9\">{\u00b6 13} Groner contends that she did not knowingly submit false statements to the court. Instead, she made the statements in good faith and believed that they were correct. She further contends that the court did not consider or rely on the assertions she had made.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-10\">{\u00b6 14} Groner notes that relator admitted that the probate court did not rely on and was not misled by the document Groner filed, and counsel acknowledged that she was remorseful.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-11\">Violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct</p>\n<p id=\"b376-12\">{\u00b6 15} The board found that Groner had violated Prof.Cond.R. 3.1, 3.3(a)(1) and (3), and 4.1, and we agree. There was clear and convincing evidence that in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>pleading, Groner made a number of false statements that had no basis in law or fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">{\u00b6 16} We do not agree that the evidence supports a finding that Groner violated Prof.Cond.R. 8.4(c), (d), and (h), however. The record demonstrates that ten days after Groner filed the objections, she filed a motion for mediation in which she attempted to amend the objections to remove any allegations of criminal charges and any statements concerning the bond. In addition, counsel for relator agreed that while the exhibit attached to the objections may have demonstrated negligence or recklessness, it fell short of being intentionally fraudulent or deceitful. Counsel further admitted that the probate court did not rely on the information that Groner submitted, and therefore, it was not misled.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">{\u00b6 17} We agree that the evidence does not reach the level of clear and convincing sufficient to establish that Groner violated Prof.Cond.R. 8.4(c), (d), or (h). Consequently, we dismiss those alleged violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">{\u00b6 18} The purpose of the disciplinary proceedings is to investigate the conduct and fitness of the attorney to practice law in order \u201cto safeguard the courts and to protect the public from the misconduct of those who are licensed to practice law.\u201d <em>Ohio State Bar Assn. v. Weaver </em>(1975), 41 Ohio St.2d 97, 100, 70 O.O.2d 175, 322 N.E.2d 665. Thus, the purpose underlying a disciplinary sanction is not to punish the offender, but to protect the public. <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. O\u2019Neill, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 204, 2004-Ohio-4704, 815 N.E.2d 286, \u00b6 53.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-9\">{\u00b6 19} When imposing sanctions for attorney misconduct, we consider all relevant factors, including the duties violated and sanctions imposed in similar cases. <em>Stark Cty. Bar Assn. v. Buttacavoli, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 424, 2002-Ohio-4743, 775 N.E.2d 818, \u00b6 16. We also weigh evidence of aggravating and mitigating factors listed in Section 10(B) of the Rules and Regulations Governing Procedure on Complaints and Hearings Before the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline (\u201cBCGD Proc.Reg.\u201d). <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Broeren, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 473, 2007-Ohio-5251, 875 N.E.2d 935, \u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-10\">{\u00b6 20} Here, the panel accepted, and the board agreed with, the three mitigating factors stipulated by the parties: that Groner had no prior disciplinary record, that she has made full and free disclosure and has demonstrated a cooperative attitude toward these proceedings, and that she has good character and reputation. Groner also submitted 11 character-reference letters. BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2)(a), (d), and (e).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-11\">{\u00b6 21} In aggravation, the panel determined, and the board agreed, that Groner exhibited a selfish motive, committed multiple offenses, has refused to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>acknowledge the wrongful nature of her conduct, and has caused resulting harm to the victim. BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(1)(b), (d), (g), and (h).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">{\u00b6 22} Upon close review of the record, including oral argument during which Groner represented herself, we find that Groner exercised poor judgment and recklessly prepared objections using information she hastily obtained and inadequately reviewed. In doing so, she made false statements in a pleading and attached a document that, if believed, would mislead the court. Once Groner learned of the erroneous information, she filed a motion for mediation in which she moved to dismiss allegations she had made against Brenda Fowler.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">{\u00b6 23} The victim testified that it made relations with her siblings more uncomfortable, but that she already had a strained relationship with them. The case was successfully mediated, and disputes were resolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">{\u00b6 24} Groner requested dismissal of the complaint against her, or in the alternative, that she receive a public reprimand. Relator recommended a public reprimand for her violations of Prof.Cond.R. 3.1, 3.3, and 4.1, distinguishing Groner\u2019s misconduct from that of two other attorneys who improperly disseminated information and/or lied to a court as more egregious. In <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Rohrer, </em>124 Ohio St.3d 65, 2009-Ohio-5930, 919 N.E.2d 180, we imposed a six-month suspension on an attorney for directing a staff member to deliver a copy of a motion to a local newspaper in violation of a court order prohibiting communication with the media. Id. at \u00b6 34, 54. The respondent had blamed the breach on his staff person and had then discharged her. Id. at \u00b6 19. In <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Robinson, </em>126 Ohio St.3d 371, 2010-Ohio-3829, 933 N.E.2d 1095, we suspended respondent\u2019s license for one year after he removed confidential documents from his law firm and provided them to competitor firms with whom he was seeking employment. Id. at \u00b6 10, 49. He also destroyed some of the documents and then lied about his actions in a deposition. Id. at \u00b6 8, 11, 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">{\u00b6 25} However, the circumstances in this case are more akin to those in <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Agopian, </em>112 Ohio St.3d 103, 2006-Ohio-6510, 858 N.E.2d 368, in which we issued a public reprimand for the respondent\u2019s submitting inaccurate fee bills to a court for legal services rendered to indigent criminal defendants. Id. at \u00b6 6, 15. In light of Agopian\u2019s mitigating circumstances \u2014 no prior disciplinary record, cooperation in the disciplinary process, accepting responsibility for the misconduct, and character letters \u2014 we rejected the board\u2019s recommended sanction of a one-year stayed suspension. Id. at \u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-9\">{\u00b6 26} We do not condone what can only be described as reckless and sloppy conduct that resulted in Groner\u2019s filing false and misleading statements in probate court. Nevertheless, in light of the mitigating circumstances, including resolution of the underlying probate matter, we do not perceive that an actual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>suspension from the practice of law is necessary to protect the public from further misconduct. Therefore, we find that the circumstances in Groner\u2019s case warrant a six-month suspension from the practice of law with the entire six months stayed on the condition that she commit no further misconduct. If Groner fails to comply with the condition of the stay, the stay will be lifted, and she will serve the full six-month suspension. Costs are taxed to Groner.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A5p\">Gorman, Malarcik, Pierce &amp; Vuillemin and Donald J. Malarcik Jr.; and Alfred E.
