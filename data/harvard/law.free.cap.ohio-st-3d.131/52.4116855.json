Wasserman v. Fremont, </em>6th Dist. No. S-10-031, 2011-Ohio-1269, 2011 WL 941375, \u00b6 9. The Wassermans alleged that when the city constructed a reservoir on its property, the city damaged drainage tiles belonging to the Wassermans and that the city\u2019s actions interfered with the Wassermans\u2019 use of their drainage easement over the city\u2019s property and with their use of their property, due to inadequate drainage. Thus, the Wassermans alleged that the city\u2019s actions constituted a taking of their property.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-12\">{\u00b6 2} It is true that \u201c[mjandamus is the appropriate action to compel public authorities to institute appropriation proceedings where an involuntary taking of private property is alleged.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Shemo v. Mayfield Hts. </em>(2002), 95 Ohio St.3d 59, 63, 765 N.E.2d 345, judgment modified in part on other grounds, 96 Ohio St.3d 379, 2002-Ohio-4905, 775 N.E.2d 493; see also <em>State ex rel. Duncan v. Mentor City Council, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 372, 2005-Ohio-2163, 826 N.E.2d 832, \u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-13\">{\u00b6 3} But to be entitled to the requested writ of mandamus to compel an appropriation proceeding, relators in these cases must do more than merely allege a taking \u2014 they must establish that a taking of their property by a public authority has occurred. See <em>State ex rel. BSW Dev. Group v. Dayton </em>(1998), 83 Ohio St.3d 338, 344, 699 N.E.2d 1271 (relator in mandamus action seeking writ to compel city to commence appropriation proceeding had the burden of proving a compensable taking). That is, \u201c[i]n these [mandamus] actions, the court, as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>trier of fact and law, must determine whether the private property had been taken by the public authority.\u201d Id. at 342, citing <em>State ex rel. Levin v. Sheffield Lake </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 104, 108, 637 N.E.2d 319. Thus, \u201cappropriation proceedings may be compelled through mandamus, but * * * the court must initially determine that the pertinent property has been appropriated.\u201d <em>Levin </em>at 109; see also <em>State ex rel. Gilbert v. Cincinnati, </em>125 Ohio St.3d 385, 2010-Ohio-1473, 928 N.E.2d 706 (affirming judgment granting writ of mandamus to compel appropriation proceeding on physical-taking claim that had been established by relators and denying writ of mandamus on regulatory-taking claim that had not been proven).</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Aoh\">Davies, Ruck &amp; Speweik, Ltd., Corey J. Speweik, Nathan T. Oswald, and J. Douglas Ruck, for appellees.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b233-9\">Robert G. Hart, Fremont Law Director, for appellants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b233-10\">Michael DeWine, Attorney General, Alexandra T. Schimmer, Solicitor General, and Michael L. Stokes, Senior Assistant Attorney General, urging reversal for amicus curiae state of Ohio.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">{\u00b6 4} Therefore, the court of appeals erred in granting a writ of mandamus to compel the city and its mayor to commence an appropriation proceeding when the court had not yet determined that the Wassermans\u2019 property had been taken by the city. Based on the foregoing, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals granting the writ of mandamus and remand the cause to that court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. These further proceedings should permit the parties to submit evidence concerning whether a taking of the Wassermans\u2019 property has occurred. The Wassermans must establish their entitlement to the writ by clear and convincing evidence. See <em>State ex rel. Doner v. Zody, </em>130 Ohio St.3d 446, 2011-Ohio-6117, 958 N.E.2d 1235, paragraph three of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b233-7\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, Cupp, and McGee Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
