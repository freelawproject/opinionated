Ho Wah Genting Wire &amp; Cable SDNBHD, </em>10th Dist. No. 09AP-361, 2009-Ohio-6481, 2009 WL 4698618, on the following question: \u201cWhether R.C. 2315.21(B), as amended by S.B. 80, effective April 7, 2005 is unconstitutional, in violation of Section 5(B), Article IV of the Ohio Constitution, because it is a procedural law that conflicts with Civ.R. 42(B).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b416-12\">{\u00b6 2} In 1968, voters adopted an amendment to the Ohio Constitution commonly referred to as the Modern Courts Amendment that effectuated judicial reform. Ohio Constitution, Article IV, Section 5(B); see generally Milligan &amp; Pohlman, <em>The 1968 Modern Courts Amendment to the Ohio Constitution, </em>29 Ohio St.L.J. 811 (1968). The Modern Courts Amendment conferred authority on the Supreme Court of Ohio to promulgate rules relating to matters of procedure in courts of Ohio, while the right to establish the substantive law in Ohio remained with the legislative branch of government. Procedural rules promulgated pursuant to the Modern Courts Amendment supersede conflicting statutes that affect procedural matters but cannot \u201cabridge, enlarge, or modify any substantive right.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b416-13\">{\u00b6 3} Both R.C. 2315.21(B) and Civ.R. 42(B) deal with the issue whether the trial of a tort action should be bifurcated for the purpose of addressing claims for compensatory and punitive damages. R.C. 2315.21(B) provides that upon the motion of any party in a tort action in which a claim for compensatory damages and a claim for punitive damages are made, the trial <em>shall </em>be bifurcated. Civ.R. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>42(B), on the other hand, vests a trial court with <em>discretion </em>to order a separate trial of any claim, cross-claim, counterclaim, third-party claim, or issue, when doing so would promote convenience or avoid prejudice, or when it would be economically prudent or efficient to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">{\u00b6 4} In addition to the obvious question of judicial discretion regarding whether to bifurcate damages claims, the related question presented by this case is whether R.C. 2315.21(B) creates a substantive, enforceable right to bifurcation or whether it is a procedural matter that conflicts with Civ.R. 42(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">{\u00b6 5} In the uncodified language of 2004 Am.Sub.S.B. No. 80 (\u201cS.B. 80\u201d), 150 Ohio Laws, Part V, 7915, the legislature expressed its intent to create a right to bifurcate claims for compensatory damages from claims for punitive damages in tort actions. Thus, R.C. 2315.21(B) creates, defines, and regulates a substantive, enforceable right to separate stages of trial relating to the presentation of evidence for compensatory and punitive damages in tort actions. Accordingly, we answer the certified question in the negative because R.C. 2315.21(B) supersedes Civ.R. 42(B) and does not violate the separation of powers required by the Ohio Constitution, Article IV, Section 5(B), as it is a substantive law that prevails over a procedural rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">{\u00b6 6} On October 3, 2008, Villa St. Joseph, a nursing-home facility in Garfield Heights, Ohio, associated with the Village at Marymount, admitted John E. Havel for rehabilitation following hip surgery. While receiving care, he developed severe decubitus ulcers that required surgery. Following that surgery, on January 21, 2009, Maple Wood Care Centre, a nursing home in Streetsboro, Ohio, admitted him for continued care and rehabilitative assistance. There he contracted bacterial sepsis, necessitating treatment that he received at both Marymount and Lakewood Hospitals. Havel died on August 29, 2009, from bacterial sepsis caused by skin ulcers.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-9\">{\u00b6 7} Sandra Havel (\u201cHavel\u201d), as the personal representative of the estate of John Havel, filed a complaint seeking both compensatory and punitive damages from Villa St. Joseph, Village at Marymount, Maple Wood Care Centre and Northern Health Facilities, Inc., d.b.a. Maple Wood Care Centre, and Extendicare Health Services, Inc., alleging claims for medical malpractice, wrongful death, and violations of the Ohio Nursing Home Patients\u2019 Bill of Rights pursuant to R.C. 3721.13. Villa St. Joseph and Village at Marymount (collectively, \u201cVilla St. Joseph\u201d) moved to bifurcate the trial into two stages pursuant to R.C. 2315.21(B): an initial stage relating only to the presentation of evidence and determination by the jury as to the recovery of compensatory damages, and, if necessary, a second stage involving the presentation of evidence and determina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>tion by the jury with respect to the recovery of punitive damages. The trial court denied the motion to bifurcate without stating a reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">{\u00b6 8} Villa St. Joseph appealed to the Eighth District Court of Appeals, which affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The appellate court held that R.C. 2315.21(B) is unconstitutional because it conflicts with Civ.R. 42(B), in violation of the separation of powers required by the Ohio Constitution, Article IV, Section 5(B), by purporting \u201cto legislate a strictly procedural matter already addressed by the Civil Rules.\u201d 8th Dist. No. 94677, 2010-Ohio-5251, 2010 WL 4308208, \u00b6 27. The court further determined that R.C. 2315.21(B) did not grant a right, but rather \u201cspecifies \u2018the machinery for carrying on the suit\u2019 by telling courts \u2018the procedural prioritization\u2019 for determining compensatory and punitive damages at trial.\u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Norfolk S. Ry. Co. v. Bogle, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 455, 2007-Ohio-5248, 875 N.E.2d 919, \u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">{\u00b6 9} The court certified its decision to be in conflict with the Tenth District Court of Appeals in <em>Hanners, </em>and we agreed to resolve the conflict between these appellate districts, 127 Ohio St.3d 1530, 2011-Ohio-376, 940 N.E.2d 985.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">Constitutionality of R.C. 2315.21(B)</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">{\u00b6 10} Villa St. Joseph asserts that R.C. 2315.21(B) is constitutional because no conflict exists between the statute and Civ.R. 42(B), and therefore, the statute does not violate the Modern Courts Amendment. It further contends that even if a conflict exists, R.C. 2315.21(B), as specified in the uncodified language accompanying the statute, creates a substantive right. Villa St. Joseph argues that although the plain language of the statute setting forth the procedure for bifurcation is not ambiguous, it is ambiguous whether R.C. 2315.21(B) created a substantive right to bifurcation of the trial for determining compensatory and punitive-damages claims. According to Villa St. Joseph, the uncodified language of the statute eliminates that ambiguity and evinces the intent of the legislature to create a substantive right to bifurcation. For these reasons, Villa St. Joseph petitions this court to conclude that R.C. 2315.21(B) is constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">{\u00b6 11} Havel urges that R.C. 2315.21(B) is unconstitutional because it violates the Modern Courts Amendment, contending that bifurcation is a matter of procedural law, not substantive law, and the mandatory bifurcation process set forth in R.C. 2315.21(B) conflicts with the discretionary bifurcation procedure conferred by Civ.R. 42(B). Therefore, she argues, the rule prevails over the statute. Further, Havel relies on <em>State ex rel. Ohio Academy of Trial Lawyers v. Sheward, </em>86 Ohio St.3d 451, 715 N.E.2d 1062 (1999), for the proposition that this court has already determined that the statute does not create a substantive right. She also maintains that no ambiguity exists in the codified language of the statute to justify consideration of its uncodified language, which, in its final analysis, she asserts, supports her position that R.C. 2315.21(B) is a procedural law.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>Issue of Conflict</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">{\u00b6 12} The Modern Courts Amendment of 1968 empowers this court to create rules of practice and procedure for the courts of this state. In <em>Proctor v. Kardassilaris, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 71, 2007-Ohio-4838, 873 N.E.2d 872, we explained that Ohio Constitution, Article IV, Section 5(B) \u201cexpressly states that rules created in this manner \u2018shall not abridge, enlarge, or modify any substantive right.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 17. \u201cThus, if a rule created pursuant to Section 5(B), Article IV conflicts with a statute, the rule will control for procedural matters, and the statute will control for matters of substantive law.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">{\u00b6 13} The plain language of R.C. 2315.21(B) creates no ambiguity regarding <em>its application: </em>a trial court, on the motion of any party, is required to bifurcate a tort action to allow presentation of the claims for compensatory and punitive damages in separate stages. The statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-6\">(1) In a tort action that is tried to a jury and in which a plaintiff makes a claim for compensatory damages and a claim for punitive or exemplary damages, upon the motion of any party, the trial of the tort action <em>shall </em>be bifurcated as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-7\">(a) The initial stage of the trial shall relate only to the presentation of evidence, and a determination by the jury, with respect to whether the plaintiff is entitled to recover compensatory damages for the injury or loss to person or property from the defendant. During this stage, no party to the tort action shall present, and the court shall not permit a party to present, evidence that relates solely to the issue of whether the plaintiff is entitled to recover punitive or exemplary damages for the injury or loss to person or property from the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-8\">(b) If the jury determines in the initial stage of the trial that the plaintiff is entitled to recover compensatory damages for the injury or loss to person or property from the defendant, evidence may be presented in the second stage of the trial, and a determination by that jury shall be made, with respect to whether the plaintiff additionally is entitled to recover punitive or exemplary damages for the injury or loss to person or property from the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-9\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b419-10\">{\u00b6 14} The language of Civ.R. 42(B) is also unambiguous: it vests a trial court with discretion to order a separate trial of any claims or issues and applies to all civil actions. Specifically, it provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>The court, after a hearing, in furtherance of convenience or to avoid prejudice, or when separate trials will be conducive to expedition and economy, <em>may </em>order a separate trial of any claim, cross-claim, counterclaim, or third-party claim, or of any separate issue or of any number of claims, cross-claims, counterclaims, or third-party claims, or issues, always preserving inviolate the right to trial by jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">{\u00b6 15} Although, in some instances, the statute and the rule can be applied without conflict, such as when a tort action is not involved, there is an inconsistency between the statute and the rule when an action falls within the boundaries of R.C. 2315.21(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">Substantive versus Procedural Law</p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">{\u00b6 16} Given that an inconsistency exists, the statute\u2019s constitutionality depends upon whether the statute is a substantive or procedural law. In <em>Krause v. State, </em>31 Ohio St.2d 132, 285 N.E.2d 736 (1972), overruled on other grounds by <em>Schenkolewski v. Cleveland Metroparks Sys., </em>67 Ohio St.2d 31, 426 N.E.2d 784 (1981), paragraph one of the syllabus, we defined \u201csubstantive\u201d in the context of the constitutional amendment to mean \u201cthat body of law which creates, defines and regulates the rights of the parties. * * * The word substantive refers to common law, statutory and constitutionally recognized rights.\u201d <em>Krause </em>at 145. By contrast, procedural law \u201cprescribes methods of enforcement of rights or obtaining redress.\u201d <em>Roe v. Planned Parenthood Southwest Ohio Region, </em>122 Ohio St.3d 399, 2009-Ohio-2973, 912 N.E.2d 61, \u00b6 34, citing <em>French v. Dwiggins, </em>9 Ohio St.3d 32, 34, 458 N.E.2d 827 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-9\">{\u00b6 17} A right is defined as \u201c[a] power, privilege, or immunity secured to a person by law,\u201d as well as \u201c[a] legally enforceable claim that another will do or will not do a given act.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1436 (9th Ed.2009). <em>Compare </em>R.C. 2505.02(A)(1) (defining a \u201csubstantial right\u201d for the purpose of defining a final order as a \u201cright that the United States Constitution, the Ohio Constitution, a statute, the common law, or a rule of procedure entitles a person to enforce or protect\u201d). Thus, classification of R.C. 2315.21(B) as a substantive or procedural law depends upon whether the statute creates a right.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-10\">{\u00b6 18} We are aided in our analysis of whether R.C. 2315.21(B) is substantive or procedural by examining previous decisions from our court involving similar issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-11\">{\u00b6 19} In <em>State v. Hughes, </em>41 Ohio St.2d 208, 324 N.E.2d 731 (1975), we considered a conflict between R.C. 2945.68, which granted appellate courts the discretion to allow the state to file a bill of exceptions in a criminal matter, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>App.R. 4(B), which permitted the state to appeal as of right in criminal cases. In determining that the rule must yield to the statute, we held that R.C. 2945.68 granted the state \u201ca substantive right of appeal which did not exist at common law prior to the adoption of Section 6 of Article IV of the Ohio Constitution (now Section 3 of Article IV), and the implementing legislation contained in R.C. 2945.67 through 2945.70.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 210. The purpose of R.C. 2945.67 through 2945.70 also served as a basis for that determination: those statutes granted \u201cjurisdiction to appellate courts to hear appeals by the prosecution in criminal cases\u201d as well as created \u201ca <em>substantive </em>right in the prosecution to bring such appeals in the instances permitted by R.C. 2945.70 and the decisions interpreting that section.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) <em>Id. </em>at 210-211.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">{\u00b6 20} We also recognized the statutory creation of a right in <em>State v. Rahman, </em>23 Ohio St.3d 146, 148, 492 N.E.2d 401 (1986), which held that R.C. 2945.42 conferred a substantive right upon the accused in a criminal trial to exclude privileged spousal testimony concerning a confidential communication and, as a substantive right, the spousal privilege could not be limited by a rule of evidence addressing the competency of a spouse to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">{\u00b6 21} The statutes at issue in <em>Hughes </em>and <em>Rahman </em>did not contain express language declaring the creation of a substantive right. Nonetheless, in determining that those statutes created substantive rights, our analyses considered the operative effect of each statute. Similarly, here, the express language of the statute does not declare the creation of a right, but its operative effect creates a right because a party in a tort action is entitled to bifurcation upon request; thus, we must determine if application of the procedural rule would invalidate that right.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">{\u00b6 22} In <em>State v. Greer, </em>39 Ohio St.3d 236, 530 N.E.2d 382 (1988), we considered the interplay between R.C. 2945.21(A)(2), which allowed a defendant to exercise 12 peremptory challenges during voir dire, and Crim.R. 24(C), which limited the number of peremptory challenges that could be exercised to six. We held that the rule regulated the application of the substantive right created by statute but did not restrict the right to the extent that it constituted a <em>\u201cde facto </em>abrogation or modification of the right itself.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 245-246.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-9\">{\u00b6 23} In the instant case, applying Civ.R. 42(B) to tort actions in which a party has requested bifurcation pursuant to R.C. 2315.21(B) would nullify the statute to the extent that a judge\u2019s refusal to bifurcate the trial would constitute a \u201cde facto abrogation\u201d of the mandatory bifurcation provided by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-10\">Mandatory Bifurcation</p>\n<p id=\"b421-11\">{\u00b6 24} In <em>Norfolk S. Ry. Co., </em>115 Ohio St.3d 455, 2007-Ohio-5248, 875 N.E.2d 919, we addressed whether the prima facie filing requirements of R.C. 2307.92 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>and 2307.93 were substantive or procedural in the context of a federal preemption analysis. We concluded that the statutes were procedural in nature because they did not grant any rights or impose any duties that gave rise to a cause of action and stated, \u201c[T]he impact of these statutes is to establish a procedural prioritization of the asbestos-related cases on the court\u2019s docket. Nothing more. Simply put, these statutes create a procedure to prioritize the administration and resolution of a cause of action that already exists.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">{\u00b6 25} Unlike the statutes at issue in <em>Norfolk, </em>however, R.C. 2315.21(B) does more than set forth the procedure for the bifurcation of tort actions: it makes bifurcation mandatory. Indeed, mandatory bifurcation in tort actions did not exist prior to the amendment of R.C. 2315.21(B) by S.B. 80. <em>Compare Viers v. Dunlap, </em>1 Ohio St.3d 173, 438 N.E.2d 881 (1982) (former R.C. 2315.19(A)(1), which codified the doctrine of comparative negligence, was \u201csubstantive in nature and effect,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 177, because \u201c[w]here before a defendant was shielded from liability by a plaintiffs contributory negligence, this defendant no longer enjoys such protection. Where before a plaintiff who was contributorily negligent was denied recovery, he is now * * * entitled to damages. To characterize * * * such a fundamental change in the law as affecting only trial procedure and the mode by which a remedy is effected defies logic\u201d). <em>Id. </em>at 175. Even the dissent recognizes that the statute takes away the discretion granted to a judge to allow bifurcation, by permitting parties to <em>demand </em>bifurcation.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">{\u00b6 26} By eliminating judicial discretion, R.C. 2315.21(B) creates a concomitant right to bifurcation: because the court cannot deny a request for bifurcation under the specified circumstances, the statute turns a request into a demand for or an entitlement to bifurcation by controlling the outcome. We have previously recognized that a statute may create a right when it contains mandatory language and restricts judicial or agency discretion. <em>See, e.g., State v. Coffman, </em>91 Ohio St.3d 125, 127, 742 N.E.2d 644 (2001) (former R.C. 2947.061(B) did not create a right to shock probation because \u201cthe statute committed decisions regarding shock probation to the plenary discretion of the trial court\u201d and its terms \u201cwere permissive in nature\u201d); <em>State ex rel. Duganitz v. Ohio Adult Parole Auth., </em>77 Ohio St.3d 190, 672 N.E.2d 654 (1996) (relator did not have a clear legal right to be released from parole pursuant to former R.C. 2967.16 because the decision to grant a final release from parole rested with the Ohio Adult Parole Authority, and therefore, the statute did not mandate release); <em>Cleveland Produce Co. v. Dennert, </em>104 Ohio St. 149, 135 N.E. 531 (1922), syllabus (G.C. 11470, which required a trial court to issue findings of fact and conclusions of law when requested by a party following a bench trial, conferred \u201ca substantial right\u201d upon the requesting party; its provisions were \u201cmandatory,\u201d and the failure of a court to issue such findings constituted reversible error). <em>Compare Cleveland Constr., Inc. v. Cincinnati, </em>118 Ohio St.3d 283, 2008-Ohio-2337, 888 N.E.2d 1068, \u00b6 17 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>(contractor had no property interest in a contract because the city had \u201cextensive discretion\u201d in considering bids). R.C. 2315.21(B), like the statute in <em>Krause, </em>\u201cfalls within that body of law traditionally denominated substantive. It both defines and regulates the rights of parties.\u201d 31 Ohio St.2d at 145, 285 N.E.2d 736.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">Uncodified Statutory Language</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">{\u00b6 27} The express language of the codified portion of S.B. 80 does not convey whether R.C. 2315.21(B) is a substantive or procedural law. We confronted a similar situation in <em>State ex rel. Loyd v. Lovelady, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 86, 2006-Ohio-161, 840 N.E.2d 1062. The issue there concerned whether R.C. 3119.961 et seq. conflicted with Civ.R. 60(B), in violation of the Modern Courts Amendment. R.C. 3119.962 provided, \u201cUpon the filing of a motion for relief under section 3119.961 of the Revised Code, a court <em>shall </em>grant relief from * * * a child support order under which a person or male minor is the obligor\u201d pursuant to specified conditions. (Emphasis added.) R.C. 3119.961(A) allowed the motion to be filed notwithstanding provisions to the contrary in Civ.R. 60(B). Like the statute at issue here, R.C. 3119.961(A) contained no ambiguity as to its application; it divested trial courts of the discretion conferred by Civ.R. 60(B) in granting a motion for relief from judgment by mandating that, upon the filing of a motion, courts \u201cshall grant relief\u2019 from a child-support order provided that the obligor met the designated criteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-9\">{\u00b6 28} We began by acknowledging that all statutes enjoy a strong presumption of constitutionality and that legislative intent is the paramount concern of a court when interpreting a statute. <em>Loyd </em>at \u00b6 13. Applying the well-settled rule of statutory construction requiring a court to \u201c \u2018first look at the words of the statute itself to determine legislative intent,\u201d we concluded that \u201cit [was] not clear from the statute itself whether it was intended to be substantive or procedural.\u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Carnes v. Kemp, </em>104 Ohio St.3d 629, 2004-Ohio-7107, 821 N.E.2d 180, \u00b6 16. We resolved that lack of clarity by considering the statements expressed by the General Assembly in the uncodified language in connection with R.C. 3119.961 et seq., noting that \u201calthough R.C. 3119.961 and 3119.962 are necessarily packaged in procedural wrapping, it is clear to us that the General Assembly intended to create a substantive right to address potential injustice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 14. Thus, because R.C. 3119.961(A) created a substantive right, as stated in the uncodified language of the statute, it did not \u201cviolate the separation of powers required by Section 5(B), Article IV of the Ohio Constitution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-11\">{\u00b6 29} Similarly, in this case, the statements made by the General Assembly in the uncodified language of S.B. 80 compel the conclusion that although R.C. 2315.21(B) may be \u201cpackaged in procedural wrapping,\u201d it is a substantive law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>because it creates a right to \u201caddress potential injustice.\u201d As in <em>Lovelady, </em>resort to uncodified law is proper here because uncertainty exists whether R.C. 2315.21(B) is substantive or procedural, and no rule of construction precludes our review of uncodified law in an effort to ascertain legislative intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">{\u00b6 30} The uncodified language of S.B. 80 includes a \u201cstatement of findings and intent\u201d made by the General Assembly. S.B. 80, Section 3, 150 Ohio Laws, Part V, at 8024. In its statement, the General Assembly asserted, \u201cThe current civil litigation system represents a challenge to the economy of the state of Ohio\u201d and recognized that \u201ca fair system of civil justice strikes an essential balance between the rights of those who have been legitimately harmed and the rights of those who have been unfairly sued.\u201d Section 3(A)(1) and (2), <em>id. </em>The General Assembly further declared that \u201c[rjeform to the punitive damages law in Ohio [was] urgently needed to restore balance, fairness, and predictability to the civil justice system.\u201d Section 3(A)(4)(a), <em>id. </em>at 8025.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">{\u00b6 31} The uncodified language of the statute also distinguishes noneconomic damages, which \u201care intended to compensate person for the person\u2019s loss,\u201d from punitive damages, which \u201care intended to punish a defendant for wrongful conduct.\u201d Section 3(A)(6)(a), <em>id. </em>at 8027. Among its findings, the General Assembly explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-6\">(d) While pain and suffering awards are inherently subjective, it is believed that this inflation of noneconomic damages is partially due to the improper consideration of evidence of wrongdoing in assessing pain and suffering damages.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-7\">(e) Inflated damage awards create an improper resolution of civil justice claims. The increased and improper cost of litigation and resulting rise in insurance premiums is passed on to the general public through higher prices for products and services.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-8\">(f) * * * In cases in which punitive damages are requested, <em>defendants should have the right to request bifurcation </em>of a trial to ensure that evidence of misconduct is not inappropriately considered by the jury in its determination of liability and compensatory damages. As additional protection, trial and appellate courts should rigorously review pain and suffering awards to ensure that they properly serve compensatory purposes and are not excessive.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b424-9\">(Emphasis added.) Section 3(A)(6)(d) through (f), <em>id. </em>at 8028.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-10\">{\u00b6 32} These findings and statements by the General Assembly demonstrate its intent to create a substantive right to ensure that evidence of misconduct is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>inappropriately considered by the jury in its assessment of liability and its award of compensatory damages. The dissent claims that R.C. 2315.21(B) is \u201cno different\u201d from other \u201clegislative attempts to influence courtroom practice and procedure\u201d that \u201cwe have overruled\u201d in the past.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">{\u00b6 33} The cases cited by the dissent, however, merely underscore that when a statute and rule conflict, the statute will prevail in matters of substantive law and the rule will prevail in matters of procedural law. In none of those cases did we undertake a substantive-versus-procedural analysis, nor did any involve a statute where the divestiture of discretion created a right, as here. In addition, those cases actually bolster our analysis and our result because they recognize that it is appropriate to consider the operative effect of the statute or rule in question when determining whether the statute is substantive or procedural. In <em>Alexander v. Buckeye Pipe Line Co., </em>for example, we said that \u201cthe <em>effect </em>of Civ.R. 54(B) [was] purely procedural\u201d and did not \u201caffect\u201d a \u201csubstantive right.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Id., </em>49 Ohio St.2d at 159, 359 N.E.2d 702.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">{\u00b6 34} Contrary to the unsupported contention of the dissent, R.C. 2315.21(B) is not a procedural statute because it pertains to a procedural issue: as noted in <em>Lovelady, </em>which the dissent refers to but does not distinguish, a statute may create a substantive right despite being \u201cpackaged in procedural wrapping.\u201d <em>Id., </em>108 Ohio St.3d 86, 2006-Ohio-161, 840 N.E.2d 1062, at \u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">{\u00b6 35} Accordingly, R.C. 2315.21(B) does not violate the Ohio Constitution, Article IV, Section 5(B) and is constitutional because it is a substantive law that prevails over a procedural rule. Inherent in our conclusion is rejection of the argument that dicta contained in <em>Sheward, </em>which described the former version of R.C. 2315.21(B) as governing a procedural matter, should control our determination here. We have acknowledged that \u201cR.C. 2315.21 is admittedly similar to the punitive-damages statute struck down in <em>Sheward,\u201d Arbino v. Johnson &amp; Johnson, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 468, 2007-Ohio-6948, 880 N.E.2d 420, \u00b6 108, but despite the similarity, <em>Sheward </em>never considered the bifurcation question we confront in this case. Thus, we are not required to follow out-of-context dicta as precedent. <em>Arbino </em>at \u00b6 93, 108.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-9\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b425-10\">{\u00b6 36} R.C. 2315.21(B) creates a substantive right to bifurcation in tort actions when claims for compensatory and punitive damages have been asserted. Thus, R.C. 2315.21(B) creates, defines, and regulates a substantive, enforceable right to separate stages of trial relating to the presentation of evidence for compensatory and punitive damages in tort actions and therefore takes precedence over Civ.R. 42(B) and does not violate the Ohio Constitution, Article IV, Section 5(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>{\u00b6 37} Accordingly, we answer the certified question in the negative and reverse the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b426-6\">Lundberg Stratton, Lanzinger, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b426-7\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., concurs in judgment only.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b426-8\">Pfeifer and McGee Brown, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b426-9\">McGee Brown, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ATUy\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-10\">{\u00b6 38} The Modern Courts Amendment to the Ohio Constitution gives the Supreme Court of Ohio exclusive authority over standards for practice and procedure in Ohio courts. Ohio Constitution, Article IV, Section 5(B). The constitutional provision also prohibits the General Assembly from enacting laws that conflict with our court rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-11\">{\u00b6 39} The statute before us, R.C. 2315.21(B), clearly conflicts with the rule we have established, Civ.R. 42(B), which governs motions for bifurcation. Contrary to the express command of Article IV, Section 5(B), however, the majority concludes that the General Assembly may override our rule in this context. This conclusion represents a sharp turn in our jurisprudence, and it dangerously unsettles the balance of power struck by the Modern Courts Amendment. Therefore, I must respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-12\">{\u00b6 40} In the past, we have carefully guarded our rule-making authority against legislative attempts to influence courtroom practice and procedure. For example, we have overruled legislative attempts to undermine our rules with respect to the consolidation of claims, <em>Dir. of Highways v. Kleines, </em>38 Ohio St.2d 317, 320, 313 N.E.2d 370 (1974) (holding that \u201cthe management of cases lies within the discretion of the court\u201d); pleading requirements, <em>Rockey v. 84 Lumber Co., </em>66 Ohio St.3d 221, 225, 611 N.E.2d 789 (1993) (concluding that Civ.R. 8(A) prevails over R.C. 2309.01 with respect to pleading requirements because the court\u2019s rules \u201cmust control over subsequently enacted inconsistent statutes purporting to govern procedural matters\u201d); the joinder and separation of claims, <em>Alexander v. Buckeye Pipe Line Co., </em>49 Ohio St.2d 158, 159-160, 359 N.E.2d 702 (1977) (\u201cQuestions involving the joinder and separation of claims and the timing of appeals are matters of practice and procedure within the rule-making authority of this court * * * \u201d). R.C. 2315.21(B) is no different. While purporting to create \u201cfairness\u201d in the trial of tort cases, the General Assembly has usurped the court\u2019s authority by mandating how cases should be tried.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-13\">{\u00b6 41} Our precedent in this area is clear and well reasoned. We have followed the express language of the Modern Courts Amendment by invalidating statutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>that override our rules governing procedural issues in Ohio courts. The hallmark of such unconstitutional statutes is that they purport to influence the mechanics of the courtroom or \u201c \u2018the machinery for carrying on [a] suit.\u2019 \u201d <em>Norfolk S. Ry. Co. v. Bogle, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 455, 2007-Ohio-5248, 875 N.E.2d 919, \u00b6 16, quoting <em>Jones v. Erie RR. Co., </em>106 Ohio St. 408, 412, 140 N.E. 366 (1922). However, we have held that Article IV, Section 5(B) does not limit the General Assembly\u2019s authority to affect substantive rights, \u201c \u2018which give rise to a cause of action.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Jones </em>at 412. <em>See, e.g., State ex rel. Loyd v. Lovelady, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 86, 2006-Ohio-161, 840 N.E.2d 1062.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">{\u00b6 42} The majority largely sidesteps our precedent regarding the substantive/procedural dichotomy. Instead, it defers to the General Assembly\u2019s purported intention that R.C. 2315.21(B) relates to a substantive right. Setting aside the problematic nature of the majority\u2019s conclusion \u2014 which it divines from a compilation of uncodified \u201cfindings and statements\u201d rather than any express statutory language \u2014 the Ohio Constitution does not entitle the General Assembly to predetermine the constitutionality of its laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">{\u00b6 43} We look to legislative intent to clarify ambiguous statutory language, but this statute is not ambiguous. We should not resort to legislative intent to determine that a statute is constitutional simply because the General Assembly intended it to be so. Only the courts may rule on a statute\u2019s constitutionality.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">{\u00b6 44} To the extent that the majority undertakes an analysis of R.C. 2315.21(B), it apparently concludes that the statute creates a substantive right for defendants to limit the introduction of evidence of misconduct when juries consider compensatory damages. However, the conduct and control of trials are procedural, not substantive. Trial judges are in the best position to determine how a trial should proceed and to limit or prevent the introduction of prejudicial evidence. Civ.R. 42 provides this authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">{\u00b6 45} Moreover, the uncodified commentary on which the majority relies hardly marks the <em>creation </em>of a right. Am.Sub.S.B. No. 80, Section 3(A)(6)(f) suggests, \u201c[D]efendants should have the right to request bifurcation of a trial to ensure that evidence of misconduct is not inappropriately considered by the jury * * *.\u201d 150 Ohio Laws, Part V, 7915, 8028. But defendants, like plaintiffs, have long enjoyed that right under Civ.R. 42(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">{\u00b646} Bifurcation is a classic courtroom procedural issue. A motion for bifurcation involves a question of how best to manage the competing interests of efficiency and prejudice in the courtroom, and we have determined that judges are best situated to answer that question. <em>See </em>Civ.R. 42(B). Indeed, in some cases, judges may find bifurcation wasteful or unfair, and our rule recognizes the discretion of judges to manage their cases with an eye toward those practical and important considerations.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Aqr\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>The Dickson Firm, L.L.C., and Blake A.

Camillus, L.L.C., and John C.

R.C. 2315.21(B) is clearly distinguishable from the General Assembly\u2019s actions to define underlying rights, such as its recent amendments to criminal sentencing laws.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The statute is not about a substantive right; it is about court procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">{\u00b6 49} The Ohio Constitution vests this court with responsibility to superintend Ohio\u2019s courts. I would follow our jurisprudence and hold that trial courts, not the legislators, are best situated to determine when bifurcation is appropriate. In so holding, we would protect the independence of Ohio\u2019s judiciary and its rightful authority to determine how trials should proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">{\u00b6 50} R.C. 2315.21(B) is a procedural law mandating how judges should conduct their trials, and it clearly conflicts with Civ.R. 42(B). Therefore, pursuant to the Modern Courts Amendment of the Ohio Constitution, I would find the statute unconstitutional.
