Hulbert has helped care for Hodge, a quadriplegic, for decades. In 1993, the Industrial Commission of Ohio set Hulbert\u2019s hourly rate of pay for Hodge\u2019s care at $18.75, which was the maximum amount permitted under the agency\u2019s guidelines for a licensed practical nurse, absent special circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-12\">{\u00b6 2} Fourteen years later, Hodge asked the commission to increase Hulbert\u2019s hourly rate to $30. On January 29, 2008, a staff hearing officer (\u201cSHO\u201d) determined that he had no jurisdiction to order an increase because amendments to the Ohio Administrative Code had transferred nursing-service oversight to the bureau. This order apparently was never appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-13\">{\u00b6 3} A few months later, Hodge again moved the commission to increase Hulbert\u2019s wages. A district hearing officer (\u201cDHO\u201d) dismissed the motion on jurisdictional grounds, citing the January 29, 2008 SHO order. On September 16, 2008, a different SHO affirmed the DHO\u2019s order, and again Hodge did not appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-14\">{\u00b6 4} After twice failing to convince the commission to grant Hulbert a wage increase, Hodge sought a writ of mandamus against the bureau. Hodge cited the 1993 commission order that originally set Hulbert\u2019s hourly rate pursuant to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>licensed-practical-nurse schedule and accused the bureau of paying Hulbert at a lower unskilled-caregiver rate. The Court of Appeals for Franklin County denied the writ after finding, among other things, that Hodge\u2019s failure to appeal the January 29, 2008 and September 16, 2008 SHO orders constituted a failure to exhaust her available administrative remedies.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"ALKh\">Livorno &amp; Arnett Co., L.P.A., and John F.

Plymale, Assistant Attorney General, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">{\u00b6 5} Hodge now appeals to this court as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">{\u00b6 6} The record before us is minimal and leaves perplexing questions unanswered. We do not know why Hodge, rather than Hulbert, initiated proceedings to secure higher wages for Hulbert. We also do not find any evidence that Hodge ever formally moved the bureau for an increase, particularly after the January 29, 2008 order specifically stated that'it was the bureau, not the commission, that had jurisdiction over the matter. In any event, Hodge pursued the matter with the commission and twice failed to appeal orders adverse to her. It is well settled that mandamus will not issue when an individual has a plain and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law. <em>State ex rel. Berger v. McMonagle, </em>6 Ohio St.3d 28, 451 N.E.2d 225 (1983). Administrative remedies are plain and adequate remedies that preclude mandamus. <em>State ex rel. Buckley v. Indus. Comm., </em>100 Ohio St.3d 68, 2003-Ohio-5072, 796 N.E.2d 522. Hodge could have appealed the 2008 SHO orders to the commission but did not. The court of appeals was therefore correct in denying the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">{\u00b6 7} The judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b538-9\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, Cupp, and McGee Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
