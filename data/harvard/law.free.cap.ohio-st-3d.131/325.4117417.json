Because we answer in the affirmative, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>I. Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">{\u00b6 2} On March 27, 2008, Vandalia Police Officer Robert Brazel received a dispatch that there was a suicidal male driving a tow truck and that he was planning to kill himself when he arrived at 114 Helke Road in Vandalia. The dispatcher gave the name of the driver, Richard Dunn, defendant-appellee, and indicated that he had a weapon. The dispatcher also noted that the vehicle was a \u201cbig rig\u201d tow truck displaying the name Sandy\u2019s towing company.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">{\u00b6 3} Officer Brazel was familiar with the Helke Road address because he had seen a tow truck parked in front of the residence several times during his patrol route. Less than two minutes after he heard the dispatch, Brazel saw the tow truck, and it was approximately two miles from the Helke address. Brazel followed it until another officer arrived to assist him, and then the two officers signaled for Dunn to pull over.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">{\u00b6 4} After stopping the truck, Dunn, who was crying, got out of the vehicle and put his hands up. The officers saw that Dunn was holding a cell phone, but they did not see any weapon. Because they were dealing with an allegedly suicidal person, they handcuffed Dunn for their safety and his. The officers did not find any weapons on Dunn other than a small pocketknife. Dunn was placed in Brazel\u2019s cruiser.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">{\u00b6 5} Brazel testified that as he was walking Dunn to his police cruiser, Dunn stated: \u201c[I]t\u2019s in the glove box.\u201d Brazel asked him if he was referring to a gun, and Dunn said yes. The other officer checked the glove compartment and found a loaded gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-9\">{\u00b6 6} After the weapon was secured, Brazel spoke with Dunn about the events leading up to the stop. Dunn told the officer that the week before, he had had problems with his soon-to-be ex-wife and had been taken to a hospital for a mental-health evaluation. Dunn informed the officer that he had intended to shoot himself when he got to the place where he was to drop off the semi that he was towing. Brazel explained to Dunn that he could be involuntary committed or he could go to the hospital voluntarily. Ultimately, Brazel drove Dunn to the hospital in his patrol car.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-10\">{\u00b6 7} On August 10, 2009, Dunn was indicted on one count of improper handling of a firearm in a motor vehicle, R.C. 2923.16(B). On October 2, 2009, Dunn filed a motion to suppress, contending that the traffic stop violated the Fourth Amendment and that the officers had improperly interrogated him without informing him of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. Therefore, Dunn asked that all evidence resulting from the stop and his statements be suppressed, including the gun found in the glove compartment. Brazel was the only witness called at the suppression hearing, and the testimony focused on the facts surrounding the stop. Brazel testified that he had not observed Dunn commit any traffic violations or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>violations of any other laws while he followed him, and he admitted that the officers had not provided Dunn with <em>Miranda </em>warnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">{\u00b6 8} The trial court overruled the motion to suppress, holding that the stop was a \u201c \u2018legitimate response to an emergency situation,\u2019 \u201d quoting <em>State v. Stubbs, </em>2d Dist. No. CA 16907, 1998 WL 677510, *3 (Oct. 2, 1998), and was therefore not an unreasonable seizure under the Fourth Amendment. The court also held that Dunn\u2019s statements and the evidence obtained from them should not be suppressed, because the police officers had not engaged in custodial interrogation but rather, Dunn\u2019s statements were spontaneous and unsolicited.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">{\u00b6 9} On December 30, 2009, the court held a change-of-plea hearing at which Dunn pleaded no contest to the single count in the indictment. Dunn was sentenced to five years of supervised probation and was ordered to attend counseling and pay court costs. The Court of Appeals for Montgomery County reversed the judgment of the trial court, vacated the conviction, deemed Dunn\u2019s plea of no contest withdrawn, and granted the motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">{\u00b6 10} The case is now before this court upon our acceptance of the state\u2019s discretionary appeal. <em>State v. Dunn, </em>128 Ohio St.3d 1458, 2011-Ohio-1829, 945 N.E.2d 522.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-9\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b507-10\">{\u00b6 11} We begin by noting the irony that Dunn, who was suicidal when he was stopped by the police, now contends that the police should not have stopped his vehicle to render aid. If the police had not stopped Dunn, he may have harmed himself. And if the police had not acted and Dunn had harmed or killed himself, Dunn or his estate could have filed a civil lawsuit against the police for failure to respond to an emergency. Such is the balancing act of Fourth Amendment law.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-11\">{\u00b6 12} In analyzing the validity of the stop, the court of appeals relied on <em>Maumee v. Weisner, </em>87 Ohio St.3d 295, 720 N.E.2d 507 (1999), and held that the state had not demonstrated that the dispatcher had a reasonable basis for issuing the dispatch that caused the officers to stop Dunn\u2019s truck. The court of appeals appears to have determined that the officers were not authorized to stop Dunn unless there was evidence from which the dispatcher could have concluded that the information supplied to him or her had sufficient indicia of reliability. This was not the proper analysis to employ. As noted by the dissenting judge below, the evidentiary requirement that <em>Weisner </em>imposes on the state in a suppression hearing applies only to an \u201cinvestigative stop\u201d authorized by <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968), which entails seizure of a person to investigate a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity. Since this was not a <em>Terry </em>stop, the court of appeals erred in using this analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>\n<em>A. Fourth Amendment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">{\u00b6 13} The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cThe right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">{\u00b6 15} There are a number of exceptions to the Fourth Amendment warrant requirement, including the one applicable to this case, the community-caretaking exception, which courts sometimes refer to as the \u201cemergency-aid exception\u201d or \u201cexigent-circumstance exception.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">{\u00b6 16} The community-caretaking exception was first addressed by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Cady v. Dombrowski, </em>413 U.S. 433, 93 S.Ct. 2523, 37 L.Ed.2d 706 (1973). Dombrowski, an off-duty Chicago police officer, was arrested by police in Wisconsin on a charge of drunk driving following a one-car accident in which Dombrowski\u2019s rental car was heavily damaged. <em>Id. </em>at 435-436. The car was towed from the scene to a privately owned garage, and a few hours later, one of the arresting officers searched Dombrowski\u2019s vehicle without a warrant, looking for his service revolver, which the officer believed to be in his vehicle. <em>Id. </em>at 436-437. In the trunk of Dombrowski\u2019s vehicle, the officer found evidence linking him to a murder, a crime for which he was eventually convicted. <em>Id. </em>at 437, 439. Ultimately, the court concluded that because the trunk of the vehicle was vulnerable to intrusion by vandals and the officer reasonably believed that the trunk contained a gun, the search was not unreasonable within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment. <em>Id. </em>at 448.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-9\">{\u00b6 17} The court explained that local law-enforcement officers \u201cfrequently investigate vehicle accidents in which there is no claim of criminal liability and engage in what, for want of a better term, may be described as community caretaking functions, totally divorced from the detection, investigation, or acquisition of evidence relating to the violation of a criminal statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 441. As the court noted in <em>Dombrowski, </em>\u201c[t]he ultimate standard set forth in the Fourth Amendment is reasonableness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 439. Thus, the Fourth Amendment protects citizens from only <em>unreasonable </em>government searches and seizures. <em>United States v. Sharpe, </em>470 U.S. 675, 682, 105 S.Ct. 1568, 84 L.Ed.2d 605 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-10\">{\u00b6 18} The United States Supreme Court further elaborated on the communitycaretaking exception to the Fourth Amendment warrant requirement in <em>Mincey v. Arizona, </em>437 U.S. 385, 98 S.Ct. 2408, 57 L.Ed.2d 290 (1978). \u201cWe do not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>question the right of the police to respond to emergency situations. Numerous state and federal cases have recognized that the Fourth Amendment does not bar police officers from making warrantless entries and searches when they reasonably believe that a person within is in need of immediate aid.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 392. \u201cThe need to protect or preserve life or avoid serious injury is justification for what would be otherwise illegal absent an exigency or emergency.\u201d <em>Wayne v. United States, </em>318 F.2d 205, 212 (D.C.Cir.1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\">{\u00b6 19} The Supreme Court has also referred to this exception as the \u201cemergency-aid exception.\u201d For example, in <em>Michigan v. Fisher, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 130 S.Ct. 546, 175 L.Ed.2d 410 (2009), the court upheld an officer\u2019s warrantless entry into the defendant\u2019s residence as reasonable when the police officers who were responding to a call regarding a disturbance observed a tumultuous situation when they arrived at the home, including blood on a damaged vehicle parked in the driveway and witnesses reporting that the defendant was \u201cgoing crazy\u201d inside. <em>Id. </em>at \u2014, 130 S.Ct. at 547. The <em>Fisher </em>court noted that \u201c[officers do not need ironclad proof of \u2018a likely serious, life-threatening\u2019 injury to invoke the emergency aid exception.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u2014, 130 S.Ct. at 549. Rather, \u201c[a]n action is \u2018reasonable\u2019 under the Fourth amendment, regardless of the individual officer\u2019s state of mind, \u2018as long as the circumstances, viewed <em>objectively, </em>justify [the] action.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added in <em>Stuart.) Brigham City v. Stuart, </em>547 U.S. 398, 404, 126 S.Ct. 1943, 164 L.Ed.2d 650 (2006), quoting <em>Scott v. United States, </em>436 U.S. 128, 138, 98 S.Ct. 1717, 56 L.Ed.2d 168 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-10\">{\u00b6 20} Because police officers are duty-bound to provide emergency services to those who are in danger of physical harm, I <em>American Bar Assn. Standards for Criminal Justice, </em>Section 1-2.2 at 1-31 (2d Ed.1980), courts must frequently consider the reasonableness of an officer\u2019s actions in situations, such as the one at bar, where a person\u2019s life is in jeopardy. In <em>State v. Applegate, </em>68 Ohio St.3d 348, 626 N.E.2d 942 (1994), this court upheld a warrantless entry into a residence by police officers who, while responding to a report of domestic violence, heard sounds coming from inside the residence indicative of violence. Although we did not use the term \u201ccommunity caretaking,\u201d but rather \u201cexigent circumstances,\u201d we held that the warrantless entry was certainly justified by the officers\u2019 reasonable belief that entering the residence was necessary to investigate an emergency threatening life and limb. <em>Id. </em>at 349-350. In so holding, the court noted: \u201c \u2018[T]he business of policemen and firemen is <em>to act, </em>not to speculate or meditate on whether the report is correct. People could well die in emergencies if police tried to act with the calm deliberation of the judicial process.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added in <em>Applegate.) Applegate </em>at 350, quoting <em>Wayne, </em>318 F.2d at 212.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>{\u00b6 21} Thus, courts recognize that a community-caretaking/emergeney-aid exception to the Fourth Amendment warrant requirement is necessary to allow police to respond to emergency situations where life or limb is in jeopardy. For example, in <em>Turner v. State, </em>645 So.2d 444 (Fla.1994), the Florida Supreme Court upheld officers\u2019 warrantless entry into a motel room when the defendant had opened the door after the officers knocked, walked from the door to a bed, leaving the door ajar, and pulled out a gun and pointed it at his head. <em>Id. </em>at 447. Further, in <em>Seibert v. State, </em>923 So.2d 460, 470-471 (Fla.2006), the Florida Supreme Court held that the warrantless entry and search of an apartment in response to a call indicating that a person in the apartment had threatened to kill himself was lawful because of exigent circumstances indicating the need for help. And the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a warrantless entry into a man\u2019s bedroom when his wife reported to the police that he was suicidal and had locked himself in the bedroom with a gun. <em>United States v. Uscanga-Ramirez, </em>475 F.3d 1024 (8th Cir.2007). Finally, in <em>Goldsmith v. Snohomish Cty., </em>558 F.Supp.2d 1140, 1152 (W.D.Wash.2008), the court held that the community-caretaking exception to the warrant requirement applied to officers\u2019 temporary arrest of a violent injured man for the sole purpose of enabling paramedics to render necessary medical aid. <em>See also Ziegler v. Aukerman, </em>512 F.3d 777, 785-786 (6th Cir.2008); <em>State v. Oliver, </em>91 Ohio App.3d 607, 610, 632 N.E.2d 1382 (9th Dist.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">{\u00b6 22} Thus, we hold that the community-caretaking/emergency-aid exception to the Fourth Amendment warrant requirement allows police officers to stop a person to render aid if they reasonably believe that there is an immediate need for their assistance to protect life or prevent serious injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">{\u00b6 23} In this case, officers received a dispatch regarding an allegedly armed and suicidal person with an imminent plan to kill himself upon reaching a certain destination. Given that stopping a person on the street is \u201cconsiderably less intrusive than police entry into the home itself,\u201d <em>Illinois v. McArthur, </em>531 U.S. 326, 336, 121 S.Ct. 946, 148 L.Ed.2d 838 (2001), the officers\u2019 effecting a traffic stop to prevent Dunn from harming himself was reasonable under the Fourth Amendment. Thus, the community-caretaking/emergency-aid exception to the Fourth Amendment warrant requirement allows police officers to stop a driver based on a dispatch that the driver is armed and plans to kill himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">\n<em>B. Voluntary Statement</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">{\u00b6 24} As the trial court below held, the requirement that police officers administer <em>Miranda </em>warnings applies only when a suspect is subjected to both custody and interrogation. <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). Here, Dunn emerged from the vehicle on his own accord and almost immediately stated that a gun was in the glove compartment. An <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>unsolicited and spontaneous statement such as the one made by Dunn in this case is not the product of an interrogation, so <em>Miranda </em>does not apply. <em>See Rhode Island v. Innis, </em>446 U.S. 291, 100 S.Ct. 1682, 64 L.Ed.2d 297 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">{\u00b6 25} As Chief Justice Warren Burger once said, \u201c \u2018 \u201c[t]he policeman on the beat, or in the patrol car, makes more decisions and exercises broader discretion affecting the daily lives of people, every day and to a greater extent, in many respects, than a judge will ordinarily exercise in a week * * \u2019 \u201d Excerpted from an FBI Academy graduation address by then Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court Warren E. Burger. Dimino, <em>Police Paternalism: Community Caretaking, Assistance Searches, and Fourth Amendment Reasonableness, </em>66 Wash. <em>&amp; </em>Lee L.Rev. 1485, 1527 (2009), quoting Abadinsky, <em>Discretionary Justice </em>15 (1984), quoting Carlton, <em>A Crime Agenda for North Carolina </em>26-27 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">{\u00b6 26} The community-caretaking/emergency-aid exception to the Fourth Amendment warrant requirement allows a law-enforcement officer with objectively reasonable grounds to believe that there is an immediate need for his or her assistance to protect life or prevent serious injury to effect a communitycaretaking/emergency-aid stop. Thus, the officers in this case were authorized to stop Dunn based on the dispatch that Dunn was armed and planned to kill himself. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and reinstate the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b511-9\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, Cupp, and McGee Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b511-10\">Pfeifer, J., dissents.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b511-11\">Lanzinger, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AQE\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-12\">{\u00b6 27} I concur. As the majority opinion makes clear, the rule requiring evidence of a telephone tip\u2019s reliability is confined to investigatory stops. <em>Maumee v. Weisner, </em>87 Ohio St.3d 295, 720 N.E.2d 507 (1999). And in specifically holding that the eommunity-caretaking/emergency-aid exception exists, we clarify that police may approach citizens without a warrant in circumstances such as Dunn\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-13\">{\u00b6 28} What is troublesome here is that the state indicted Dunn for the crime of improper handling of a firearm in a motor vehicle 16 months after the police prevented his suicide. One wonders if it was reasonable for the state to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>prosecute Dunn under these circumstances after more than a year had passed. Nevertheless, a motion to suppress puts at issue the actions of police rather than prosecutors. Because the officers in this case acted reasonably and responsibly, I agree that there was no Fourth Amendment violation and that the court of appeals\u2019 judgment should be reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b512-4\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and McGee Brown, J., concur in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b512-5\">Pfeifer, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A7I\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">{\u00b6 29} Whether this case should have been prosecuted at all is questionable. But it was. It could have been properly prosecuted. But it wasn\u2019t. This case is before us because of the prosecution\u2019s simple failure to meet its burden in the suppression hearing of proving that the traffic stop leading to the charge against Dunn was reasonable. The prosecution\u2019s failure to meet its burden comes from its lack of any attempt to show that the telephone tip that led to the dispatch had sufficient indicia of reliability. This case should stand for the simple proposition that when criminal charges evolve from a traffic stop that is based entirely upon a citizen\u2019s call to a dispatcher, the state must prove that the citizen\u2019s call presented sufficient indicia of reliability to justify the stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">{\u00b6 30} This is a case about a telephone tip. Officer Brazel stopped Dunn based solely on a telephone tip that Dunn was suicidal and in imminent danger. In <em>Maumee v. Weisner, </em>87 Ohio St.3d 295, 720 N.E.2d 507 (1999), this court addressed whether a telephone tip can, by itself, create reasonable suspicion justifying an investigative stop. This court held that a telephone tip can, standing alone, create reasonable suspicion justifying an investigative stop where the tip has sufficient indicia of reliability: \u201cWhere an officer making an investigative stop <em>relies solely upon a dispatch, </em>the state must demonstrate at a suppression hearing that the facts precipitating the dispatch justified a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) <em>Weisner, </em>at paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-9\">{\u00b6 31} But the majority writes that \u201cthe evidentiary requirement that <em>Weisner </em>imposes on the state in a suppression hearing applies only to an \u2018investigative stop\u2019 authorized by <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968), which entails seizure of a person to investigate a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity.\u201d Majority opinion at \u00b6 12. First, although it did involve an arrest for driving while intoxicated, <em>Weisner </em>does not limit its holding to traffic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>stops involving suspicion of criminal behavior. Second, although the court stated in <em>Mincey v. Arizona, </em>437 U.S. 385, 392, 98 S.Ct. 2408, 57 L.Ed.2d 290 (1978), that \u201cthe Fourth Amendment does not bar police officers from making warrant-less entries and searches when they reasonably believe that a person within is in need of immediate aid,\u201d courts cannot take on faith that an emergency existed. \u201c[A] warrantless search must be \u2018strictly circumscribed by the exigencies which justify its initiation,\u2019 <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S., at 25-26, [88 S.Ct., at 1882, 20 L.Ed.2d 889,] and it simply cannot be contended that [the] search was justified by any emergency threatening life or limb.\u201d <em>Mincey </em>at 393. That is, as with any search or seizure, a stop based upon a suspected emergency situation must be objectively reasonable based on the totality of the circumstances. At heart, <em>Weisner </em>is about whether a stop based solely upon a telephone tip can be objectively reasonable, and there is no reason that Weisner\u2019s holding should not include traffic stops made for the purpose of investigating- an emergency situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">{\u00b6 32} The stop of Dunn had all the earmarks of an investigative stop. In the context of an investigatory stop of an automobile, stopping a car and detaining its occupants constitutes a seizure. <em>Delaware v. Prouse, </em>440 U.S. 648, 99 S.Ct. 1391, 59 L.Ed.2d 660 (1979). Officer Brazel testified that he had turned on his overhead lights and siren to alert Dunn to pull to the side of the road. He and the township officer also responding \u201cblocked the roadway and lit the area.\u201d When Dunn emerged from his vehicle, Brazel told him to put his hands in the air, and he eventually handcuffed him. The video recording of the stop was labeled by the police as a traffic stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">{\u00b6 33} Even if there were a requirement that a suspicion of criminal activity is necessary to gain the protection of <em>Weisner, </em>the evidence demonstrates that Brazel did suspect criminal activity by Dunn, i.e., the possession of a gun in his vehicle. Dunn was eventually charged with a violation of R.C. 2923.16(B), which states, \u201cNo person shall knowingly transport or have a loaded firearm in a motor vehicle in such a manner that the firearm is accessible to the operator or any passenger without leaving the vehicle.\u201d Brazel heard a dispatch that a male driving a tow truck was planning to kill himself when he arrived at a specific residence. At the suppression hearing, he was asked whether there was any information dispatched regarding a weapon. He responded affirmatively: \u201cYes, advised that he was going to kill himself. But, I don\u2019t remember if they said there was a \u2014 a firearm in the vehicle or anything like that. But, there was some indication of a weapon with the dispatch.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">{\u00b6 34} Brazel\u2019s behavior at the stop indicated that he feared Dunn had a weapon. He called for backup. He approached Dunn\u2019s vehicle with his own weapon drawn, ordering Dunn to put his hands up. He testified that he had seen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>a cell phone in Dunn\u2019s hand but \u201ccouldn\u2019t see the obvious other weapons on him at that time.\u201d He then handcuffed Dunn for the officers\u2019 safety because he \u201cwanted to check him for weapons.\u201d As Brazel led him to his cruiser (\u201cfor his safety and our safety,\u201d according to Brazel), Dunn told him, \u201c[I]t\u2019s in the glovebox.\u201d Brazel had no doubt as to what Dunn was referring: \u201cI said are you referring to the gun.\u201d Not a. gun, <em>the </em>gun. Brazel knew a gun was involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">{\u00b6 35} Brazel stopped Dunn because the dispatch indicated that Dunn had a weapon in his vehicle that could cause his imminent death. Dunn ended up being charged with \u201chav[ing] a loaded firearm in a motor vehicle in such a manner that the firearm [was] accessible to the operator or any passenger without leaving the vehicle.\u201d The allegation in the call justifying the stop \u2014 that he possessed a weapon in his vehicle \u2014 became the very basis of the charge. Thus, even assuming arguendo that <em>Weisner </em>applies only to situations entailing \u201cseizure of a person to investigate a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity,\u201d as the majority holds at \u00b6 12, the facts of this case demonstrate that there was sufficient suspicion of criminal activity in this case to trigger the protections of <em>Weisner.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">{\u00b6 36} The majority wants to make this a case only about exigent circumstances. Certainly, whether it is called the community-caretaking exception or the emergency-aid exception, there is an exception to the Fourth Amendment\u2019s warrant requirement in cases where police are responding to emergency situations. Regarding its line of cases addressing that issue, the United States Supreme Court recently wrote, \u201cA reasonable police officer could read these decisions to mean that the Fourth Amendment permits an officer to enter a residence if the officer has a reasonable basis for concluding that there is an imminent threat of violence.\u201d <em>Ryburn v. Huff, </em>565 U.S. \u2014, \u2014, 132 S.Ct. 987, 990, 181 L.Ed.2d 966 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-9\">{\u00b6 37} Of course it is reasonable to make a traffic stop in order to prevent a suicide; but if the state brings criminal charges based upon that stop, it still must prove that the officer making the stop had a reasonable basis to believe that the driver was suicidal. Where the stop is based entirely on an informant\u2019s call to a police dispatcher, the reasonableness of the stop must be based upon the reliability of the tip that generated the police dispatch.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-10\">{\u00b6 38} The majority cites many cases in which courts found that officers had a reasonable basis to conduct a warrantless entry, but none of those cases involve a telephone tip as the sole reason supporting the entry. In every case cited by the majority, the police officers in question also relied on their own observations.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>{\u00b6 39} In <em>Cady v. Dombrowski, </em>413 U.S. 433, 93 S.Ct. 2523, 37 L.Ed.2d 706 (1973), police opened and searched the trunk of the defendant\u2019s heavily damaged vehicle after they had had it towed to a privately owned garage. Because the searching officer knew the defendant to be an off-duty Chicago police officer and believed that Chicago police officers were required to keep their service revolver nearby at all times, he searched the trunk to retrieve the service revolver. The incriminating evidence he found \u2014 bloody clothing and other items \u2014 was not what he was originally looking for. The search of the trunk was not based upon an anonymous telephone report \u2014 it was based upon normal operating procedure and upon the officer\u2019s belief that he was retrieving a revolver from an unguarded location.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">{\u00b6 40} In <em>Michigan v. Fisher, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 130 S.Ct. 546, 175 L.Ed.2d 410 (2009), police responded to a disturbance call. Upon arriving at the residence in question, they saw blood on a damaged vehicle parked outside, as well as on a door of the house. They spoke to witnesses who told them the defendant was \u201cgoing crazy\u201d inside the house. <em>Id. </em>at \u2014, 130 S.Ct. at 547, 175 L.Ed.2d 410. Through a window, the officers could see the defendant, Jeremy Fisher, inside the house, screaming and throwing things. The back door was locked, and a couch had been placed to block the front door. The police entered the home, and the defendant pointed a rifle at one of the officers. Fisher was later charged with crimes related to the firearm. Again, police had entered the home based in part upon the officers\u2019 own observations.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-9\">{\u00b6 41} Likewise, in <em>Brigham City v. Stuart, </em>547 U.S. 398, 404, 126 S.Ct. 1943, 164 L.Ed.2d 650 (2006), police entered a home only after they had seen \u2014 through a window \u2014 a fight break out inside. After entering the house, they made arrests for intoxication and contributing to the delinquency of a minor.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-10\">{\u00b6 42} In <em>State v. Applegate, </em>68 Ohio St.3d 348, 626 N.E.2d 942 (1994), police entered a residence after they had personally heard sounds coming from inside the house indicative of violence. When the defendant refused to put down a whiskey bottle, a scuffle ensued. The defendant was arrested for disorderly conduct, and while he was being searched, a baggie of cocaine was found in his pocket.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-11\">{\u00b6 43} In cases cited by the majority involving threatened suicide, the warrant-less entries also came as the result of personal observations by the officers involved. In <em>Turner v. State, </em>645 So.2d 444 (Fla.1994), officers made warrantless entry into a hotel room when they saw the defendant holding a gun to his head. They then encountered evidence of murders that the defendant had committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-12\">{\u00b6 44} In <em>Seibert v. State, </em>923 So.2d 460, 470-471 (Fla.2006), police responded to a 9-1-1 call regarding a suicidal person. The call had come from the person\u2019s roommate. When they arrived at the residence, police spoke to the roommate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>who had placed the 9-1-1 call and were told that the defendant was inside the residence and was suicidal. They entered the defendant\u2019s residence after he cracked open the door, and while inside, they spotted a severed foot.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">{\u00b6 45} In <em>United States v. Uscangar-Ramirez, </em>475 F.3d 1024 (8th Cir.2007), the defendant\u2019s wife consented to the police officers\u2019 entry into the residence, and she told them that her husband was armed and despondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">{\u00b6 46} In all the above cases relied upon by the majority, at least some of the facts justifying the officers\u2019 warrantless entry into the defendant\u2019s property were gleaned from the officers\u2019 own investigation. Thus, the present case differs from all the cased cited by the majority. Officer Brazel\u2019s stop was not based on any personal observation. It was based only upon a police dispatch. And a dispatch alone can form a reasonable basis for a valid stop only when there is some evidence of the reliability of the information given to the dispatcher.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">{\u00b6 47} A determination of the reasonableness of a stop under <em>Weisner </em>\u201cinvolves a consideration of \u2018the totality of the circumstances.\u2019 <em>United States v. Cortez </em>(1981), 449 U.S. 411, 417, 101 S.Ct. 690, 695, 66 L.Ed.2d 621, 628-629. Under this analysis, \u2018both the content of information possessed by police and its degree of reliability\u2019 are relevant to the court\u2019s determination. <em>Alabama v. White </em>(1990), 496 U.S. 325, 330, 110 S.Ct. 2412, 2416, 110 L.Ed.2d 301, 309.\u201d <em>Weisner, </em>87 Ohio St.3d at 299, 720 N.E.2d 507.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">{\u00b6 48} Where the only information possessed by police prior to the stop is from an informant\u2019s tip, \u201cthe determination of reasonable suspicion will be limited to an examination of the weight and reliability due that tip,\u201d specifically, \u201cwhether the tip itself has sufficient indicia of reliability to justify the investigative stop.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The most important factors in determining the reliability of an informant\u2019s report are \u201cthe informant\u2019s veracity, reliability, and basis of knowledge.\u201d <em>Id., </em>citing <em>White </em>at 328.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-9\">{\u00b6 49} In <em>Weisner, </em>this court did not set a high bar on the type of evidence needed to prove that a call to a dispatcher presents sufficient indicia of reliability to justify a traffic stop. The state \u201cmust present evidence of the facts known to the dispatcher in these situations.\u201d <em>Weisner </em>at 298. The testimony of the informant who made the call is not required. The testimony of the dispatcher is not required. In <em>Weisner, </em>this court held that testimony from the arresting officer about the facts that precipitated the dispatch as relayed to him by the dispatcher was sufficient. This court was even willing to allow that testimony as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>support even though the dispatcher might not have told the officer all the facts that precipitated the dispatch until after the stop was completed. <em>Id. </em>at fn. 1.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A0c\">Mathias H. Heck Jr., Montgomery County Prosecuting Attorney, and Carley J. Ingram and Timothy J. Cole, Assistant Prosecuting Attorneys, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b517-11\">Gary C. Schaengold, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b517-12\">Michael DeWine, Attorney General, Alexandra T. Schimmer, Solicitor General, and Thaddeus H. Driscoll, Assistant Attorney General, urging reversal on behalf of amicus curiae Ohio Attorney General.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b517-13\">Timothy Young, Public Defender, and Jeremy J. Masters, Assistant Public Defender, urging affirmance on behalf of amicus curiae Ohio Public Defender.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">{\u00b6 50} Here, the state introduced no evidence regarding the facts known to the dispatcher regarding the caller. There was no way, then, for the trial court to judge the reliability of the information the caller gave to the dispatcher. Thus, the state failed to prove that the stop leading to Dunn\u2019s indictment was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">{\u00b6 51} Great police work does not have to result in a conviction. Whether they are assisting stranded motorists, helping lost children find their parents, or calming potentially dangerous situations, police officers serve their communities daily performing good deeds that do not show up on police blotters. In this case, Officer Brazel did exemplary work. He interrupted Dunn\u2019s potential suicide. He defused the situation with no injury to himself or Dunn. He did not arrest Dunn; instead, he took him to a local hospital to get him the mental-health help he needed. Why did Brazel drive Dunn himself? Because Dunn was upset over having been billed for an earlier trip to the hospital by ambulance. This was a mission of mercy performed with impeccable professionalism by a well-trained police officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-9\">{\u00b6 52} But the prosecutor decided to charge Dunn with a crime, and we therefore must consider whether the state properly proved the case against him. At the suppression hearing, the state failed to prove the reliability of its informant\u2019s tip in a situation where the informant\u2019s tip served as the entire basis for the stop leading to Dunn\u2019s indictment. The court of appeals was therefore correct in reversing the conviction. Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
