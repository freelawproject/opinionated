No. L-91-199, 1992 WL 23175 (Jan. 17, 1992); and two, its decision that an appellate court should apply a de novo standard of review to a probate court\u2019s decision regarding whether a biological parent\u2019s financial gift constitutes maintenance and support of the child \u2014 which it found conflicts with <em>In re Adoption of Kat P., </em>5th Dist. Nos. 09CA10 and 09CA11, 2009-Ohio-3852, 2009 WL 2372108.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">{\u00b62} When a biological parent has failed to make any of the court-ordered monthly child-support payments in the year preceding the filing of an adoption petition, two de minimis gifts given to a minor child for Christmas and the child\u2019s birthday do not constitute maintenance and support for the purposes of R.C. 3107.07(A). Accordingly, we answer the first certified question in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-9\">{\u00b6 3} Further, we recognize that the petitioner in an adoption proceeding bears the burden to prove by clear and convincing evidence the biological parent\u2019s failure to provide maintenance and support for a period of one year preceding the filing of the adoption petition and to show that the parent\u2019s failure was without justifiable cause. A probate court determination of whether a financial contribution constitutes maintenance and support for purposes of R.C. 3107.07(A) is reviewed for an abuse of discretion; but whether justifiable cause for the failure to pay child support has been proved by clear and convincing evidence is a separate question for the probate court and will not be disturbed on appeal unless it is against the manifest weight of the evidence. Thus, we clarify the dual standard of review for this question.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-10\">Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b367-11\">{\u00b6 4} M.B. is the biological daughter of Ann R. and Stephen B., appellee. They dissolved their marriage in 2000 in Florida, and the court granted custody of M.B. to Ann and ordered Stephen to pay $1,000 per month through the Florida Disbursement Unit as support for M.B. He made these payments until February 2007. However, in December 2007, he sent M.B. a $125 gift card for Christmas and in April 2008, $60 in cash for her birthday.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>{\u00b6 5} Ann remarried in 2001, and on September 12, 2008, her husband, Thomas, appellant in this case, filed a petition in the Summit County Probate Court to adopt M.B. The petition alleged that Stephen had failed without justifiable cause to provide for the maintenance and support of M.B. during the year preceding the filing of the adoption petition and therefore his consent to the adoption was not required by statute. Stephen objected to the adoption, denied that he had failed to provide maintenance and support for M.B. in the year preceding the filing, argued that he had given her both a Christmas gift and a birthday gift, and claimed that he had had justifiable cause for failing to pay his court-ordered child-support payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">{\u00b6 6} A probate court magistrate determined that the gifts did not constitute maintenance and support for purposes of R.C. 3107.07(A), that Stephen had failed without justifiable cause to provide maintenance and support for the year preceding the filing of the adoption petition, and that his consent was not needed for the adoption to proceed. The probate court adopted the recommendation of the magistrate.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">{\u00b6 7} Stephen appealed, arguing that the gifts he had given to M.B. constituted maintenance and support. Applying a de novo standard of review, the appellate court reversed the decision of the probate court, held that gifts did constitute support, and concluded that the adoption of M.B. could not proceed without Stephen\u2019s consent. The court further stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-7\">Despite the lack of child support payments, Father\u2019s monetary gifts to M.B. evidenced his intent not to abandon his child. * * * Although not child support pursuant to a judicial decree, those monies served to provide additional financial support for the benefit of the child. Accordingly, there was clear and convincing evidence that Father provided for the maintenance and support of M.B. during the adoption period by virtue of his two monetary gifts to the child. Although Father\u2019s total financial contribution to the child\u2019s welfare was small, the timing of the contributions was thoughtful and clearly evidenced his intent not to abandon the child.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">9th Dist. No. 25304, 2011-Ohio-1215, 2011 WL 899638, \u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-9\">{\u00b6 8} The appellate court certified that its ruling conflicted with a decision of the Sixth District Court of Appeals on the question whether a gift constitutes maintenance and support and with a decision of the Fifth District Court of Appeals on the applicable standard of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-10\">{\u00b6 9} The Sixth District held in the case <em>In re Adoption of McCarthy, </em>6th Dist. No. L-91-199, 1992 WL 23175, that gifts of $10 and $4 given from a biological <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>parent directly to a minor child on two separate occasions did not constitute maintenance and support.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\">{\u00b6 10} And in the case of <em>In re Adoption of Kat P., </em>5th Dist. Nos. 09CA10 and 09CA11, 2009-Ohio-3852, 2009 WL 2372108, the Fifth District stated that an \u201c[a]n appellate court will not disturb a trial court\u2019s decision on adoption unless it is against the manifest weight of the evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">{\u00b6 11} We accepted the following certified-conflict questions: (1) \u201cWhen a biological parent fails to provide any court ordered child support for one year, do small monetary gifts paid directly to the child constitute the provision of \u2018maintenance and support of the minor as required by law or judicial decree\u2019 for purposes of R.C. 3107.07(A)?\u201d and (2) \u201cWhen reviewing a probate court\u2019s decision regarding whether or not a biological parent\u2019s financial contribution constitutes \u2018maintenance and support of the minor as required by law or judicial decree\u2019 for purposes of R.C. 3107.07(A), is the standard of review de novo or whether the decision is contrary to the manifest weight of the evidence?\u201d 128 Ohio St.3d 1555, 2011-Ohio-2905, 949 N.E.2d 42.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">{\u00b6 12} Thomas urges that small monetary gifts paid by a parent directly to a child do not constitute maintenance and support pursuant to R.C. 3107.07(A) and further asserts that a probate court\u2019s determination whether a biological parent\u2019s financial contribution constitutes maintenance and support can be reversed only if it is contrary to the manifest weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">{\u00b6 13} Stephen argues that any financial contribution to a child constitutes maintenance and support for purposes of R.C. 3107.07(A) and only the complete failure to provide maintenance and support obviates the need for a biological parent\u2019s consent to adoption. He further contends that the proper standard of review when interpreting statutory language is de novo.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">{\u00b6 14} Accordingly, we are called upon to decide whether de minimis monetary gifts from a biological parent to a minor child constitute maintenance and support, thus requiring parental consent pursuant to R.C. 3107.07(A), and we are further asked to clarify the standard of appellate review for these questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-9\">R.C. 3107.07(A)</p>\n<p id=\"b369-10\">{\u00b6 15} R.C. 3107.07(A) provides that consent to adoption is not required of</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-11\">[a] parent of a minor * * * [who] has failed without justifiable cause * * * to provide for the maintenance and support of the minor as required by law or judicial decree for a period of at least one year immediately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>preceding either the filing of the adoption petition or the placement of the minor in the home of the petitioner.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">{\u00b6 16} We are primarily concerned with determining whether the gifts Stephen gave to M.B. are to be considered maintenance and support and whether, based on those gifts, his consent to her adoption is required by R.C. 3107.07(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">{\u00b6 17} We have previously held that \u201c[p]ursuant to R.C. 3107.07(A), the petitioner for adoption has the burden of proving, by clear and convincing evidence, both (1) that the natural parent has failed to support the child for the requisite one-year period, and (2) that this failure was without justifiable cause.\u201d <em>In re Adoption of Bovett, </em>33 Ohio St.3d 102, 515 N.E.2d 919 (1987), paragraph one of the syllabus, following <em>In re Adoption of Masa, </em>23 Ohio St.3d 163, 492 N.E.2d 140 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">{\u00b6 18} To determine whether a biological parent has failed to provide for the maintenance and support of a child, we must first determine the meaning of \u201cmaintenance\u201d and \u201csupport\u201d as those terms are used in R.C. 3107.07(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">{\u00b6 19} In <em>State ex rel. Steele v. Morrissey, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 355, 2004-Ohio-4960, 815 N.E.2d 1107, \u00b6 21, this court stated that when determining how to construe a statute, \u201cour paramount concern is the legislative intent in enacting the statute.\u201d To determine intent, we look to the language of the statute and the purpose that is to be accomplished by it. <em>Rice v. CertainTeed Corp., </em>84 Ohio St.3d 417, 419, 704 N.E.2d 1217 (1999). \u201cWhen we conclude that a statute\u2019s language is clear and unambiguous, we apply the statute as written, * * * giving effect to its plain meaning.\u201d <em>In re Estate of Centorbi, </em>129 Ohio St.3d 78, 2011-Ohio-2267, 950 N.E.2d 505, \u00b6 14. Further, this court construes a statute \u201cas a whole and give[s] [it] such interpretation as will give effect to every word and clause in it. No part should be treated as superfluous unless that is manifestly required, and the court should avoid that construction which renders a provision meaningless or inoperative.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Myers v. Spencer Twp. Rural School Dist. Bd. of Edn., </em>95 Ohio St. 367, 373, 116 N.E. 516 (1917); <em>see generally </em>R.C. 1.47(B) (in enacting a statute, it is presumed that the General Assembly intended the entire statute to be effective).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-9\">{\u00b620} The General Assembly did not define the terms \u201cmaintenance\u201d and \u201csupport\u201d in R.C. 3107.07(A). <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1039 (9th Ed.2009), however, defines \u201cmaintenance\u201d as \u201c[financial support given by one person to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>another\u201d and \u201csupport\u201d as \u201c[s]ustenance or maintenance; esp., articles such as food and clothing that allow one to live in the degree of comfort to which one is accustomed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1577. And, giving effect to every word in the statute, we note that the maintenance and support required by R.C. 3107.07(A) is that which is specifically \u201crequired by law or judicial decree.\u201d Further, the statute directs that the consent of a parent who has failed without justifiable cause to provide for the maintenance and support required by law or judicial decree of a minor child for a period of one year preceding the filing of the adoption is not required for the adoption of the child. De minimis monetary gifts from a biological parent to a minor child do not constitute maintenance and support, because they are not payments as required by law or judicial decree as R.C. 3107.07(A) requires. To decide otherwise would render the phrase \u201cas required by law or judicial decree\u201d meaningless.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Standard of review</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">{\u00b6 21} This court has held that it is a question of fact whether a parent of a minor has willfully failed to provide for the maintenance and support of a minor child. <em>In re Adoption of Biddle, </em>168 Ohio St. 209, 216, 152 N.E.2d 105 (1958). A probate judge has discretion to determine whether the biological parent provided support as contemplated by R.C. 3107.07(A) \u201cand his or her judgment should not be tampered with absent an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>See In re Adoption of Bovett, </em>33 Ohio St.3d at 107, 515 N.E.2d 919 (Douglas, J., concurring); <em>see also In re Adoption of Charles B., </em>50 Ohio St.3d 88, 552 N.E.2d 884 (1990), paragraph three of the syllabus (\u201cadoption matters must be decided on a case-by-case basis through the able exercise of discretion by the trial court\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">{\u00b6 22} We continue to adhere to <em>Bovett, </em>in which we held that \u201c[p]ursuant to R.C. 3107.07(A), the petitioner for adoption has the burden of proving, by clear and convincing evidence, both (1) that the natural parent has failed to support the child for the requisite one-year period, and (2) that this failure was without justifiable cause.\u201d 33 Ohio St.3d 102, 515 N.E.2d 919, paragraph one of the syllabus. We also remain mindful of the admonition in <em>Santosky v. Kramer, </em>455 U.S. 745, 747-748, 102 S.Ct. 1388, 71 L.Ed.2d 599 (1982), that \u201c[bjefore a State may sever completely and irrevocably the rights of parents in their natural child, due process requires that the State support its allegations by at least clear and convincing evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">{\u00b6 23} R.C. 3107.07(A) does not require parental consent to adoption if the parent either failed to communicate with or failed to support the child for a minimum of one year preceding the filing of the adoption petition and if there was no justifiable cause for the failure. In applying this statute, a probate court undertakes a two-step analysis. First, to determine if a parent made a financial contribution that comports with the requirements of R.C. 3107.07(A) to contribute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>maintenance and support and second, if it finds a failure of support, then to determine whether justifiable cause for the failure has been proved by clear and convincing evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">{\u00b6 24} And as we held in <em>Masa </em>and affirmed in <em>Bovett, </em>\u201c[t]he question of whether justifiable cause for failure to pay child support has been proven by clear and convincing evidence in a particular case is a determination for the probate court and will not be disturbed on appeal unless such determination is against the manifest weight of the evidence.\u201d <em>In re Adoption of Masa, </em>23 Ohio St.3d 163, 492 N.E.2d 140, at paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">{\u00b6 25} Today, we answer the question raised by Justice Douglas in his concurring opinion in <em>Bovett </em>\u2014 whether a parent\u2019s making a single payment of support or sending a Christmas card is sufficient support to frustrate R.C. 3107.07(A), or on the other end of the spectrum, whether a parent\u2019s missing one or two payments of support in the year preceding the filing of an adoption petition negates the need for parental consent to adoption. A trial court has discretion to make these determinations, and in connection with the first step of the analysis, an appellate court applies an abuse-of-discretion standard when reviewing a probate court decision regarding whether a financial contribution from a parent constitutes maintenance and support for purposes of R.C. 3107.07(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">{\u00b6 26} In the instant matter, a Florida court ordered Stephen to pay $1,000 per month as support for M.B., and he concedes that he failed to make <em>any </em>of those payments between September 12, 2007, and September 12, 2008, the year preceding the filing of the adoption petition. He did not provide for the maintenance and support of the child as required by law or judicial decree. Nonetheless, he contends that by providing M.B. with a $125 gift card for Christmas and a $60 cash gift for her birthday, he provided maintenance and support during the requisite year. However, these gifts were neither legally nor judicially required, and they represent only a small portion of one monthly child-support obligation and an even smaller portion of the annual obligation. A gift is a voluntary transfer of property to another made gratuitously by a donor. <em>Bolles v. Toledo Trust Co., </em>132 Ohio St. 21, 4 N.E.2d 917 (1936), paragraph one of the syllabus. The Christmas gift card and birthday cash are de minimis gifts, not maintenance and support triggering the requirement for Stephen\u2019s consent to the adoption, and they were not made pursuant to court order as the statute requires. Thus, Stephen failed to provide maintenance and support to M.B. as required by law or judicial decree for the year preceding the filing of the adoption petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">{\u00b6 27} A biological parent\u2019s consent to adoption would be required if that parent could show by clear and convincing evidence some justifiable cause for the failure to provide support. <em>See In re Adoption of Bovett, </em>33 Ohio St.3d 102, 515 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>N.E.2d 919, at paragraph two of the syllabus. In this case, however, the probate court concluded that no justifiable cause existed, and Stephen did not challenge that determination in the court of appeals and does not dispute it here.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AYR\">Carmen V. Roberto, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AXa\">Scot Stevenson, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">{\u00b6 28} The record before us demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that Stephen failed to provide maintenance and support without justifiable cause for the year preceding the filing of the adoption petition, and thus R.C. 3107.07(A) specifies that his consent to the adoption was not required.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">{\u00b6 29} De minimis monetary gifts from a biological parent to a minor child do not constitute maintenance and support, because they are not payments as required by law or judicial decree as R.C. 3107.07(A) requires. Accordingly, we answer the first certified question in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">{\u00b6 30} A probate court determination of whether a financial contribution constitutes maintenance and support for purposes of R.C. 3107.07(A) is reviewed for an abuse of discretion; but whether justifiable cause for the failure to pay child support has been proved by clear and convincing evidence is a separate question for the probate court and will not be disturbed on appeal unless it is against the manifest weight of the evidence. Thus, we clarify the dual nature of the standard of review on this question.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">{\u00b6 31} Accordingly, the judgment of the appellate court is reversed, and the judgment of the probate court is reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-9\">So ordered.</p>\n<judges id=\"b373-10\">O\u2019Connor, C. J., and Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, Lanzinger, Cupp, and McGee Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b370-10\">. The legislature amended this statute in 2008, after Thomas filed his adoption petition, to state that a court must find by clear and convincing evidence that a parent has failed to provide more than de minimis contact or to provide maintenance and support before an adoption can proceed without that parent\u2019s consent. This change does not affect the issues presented here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
