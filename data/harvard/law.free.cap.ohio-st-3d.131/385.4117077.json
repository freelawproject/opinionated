Stafford of Cleveland, Ohio, Attorney Registration No. 0023863, was admitted to the practice of law in Ohio in 1985. Stafford is the sole shareholder and managing partner of the law firm Stafford &amp; Stafford Co., L.P.A. Relator, disciplinary counsel, filed an amended three-count complaint in January 2010, charging Stafford with multiple violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-12\">{\u00b6 2} After a lengthy period of motions and discovery, a panel of the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline conducted a hearing to consider disciplinary counsel\u2019s allegations of misconduct. The hearings took place over the course of a week, during which the panel heard the testimony of Stafford and 14 additional witnesses and considered the hundreds of exhibits submitted by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-13\">{\u00b6 3} At the conclusion of evidence, the panel sua sponte dismissed Count Two of the complaint, due to a lack of clear and convincing evidence. On the remaining counts, the panel determined that there was clear and convincing evidence that Stafford had committed six violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct. The panel recommended that 14 additional alleged violations be dismissed for lack of sufficient evidence or due to redundancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-14\">{\u00b6 4} The panel recommended that Stafford be suspended from the practice of law for 12 months, with the entire suspension stayed on certain conditions. The board adopted the panel\u2019s report and added supplementary justifications for recommending the stay.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-15\">{\u00b6 5} Disciplinary counsel objects to the board\u2019s decision recommending dismissal of an alleged violation of Prof.Cond.R. 8.4(d) (prohibiting conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice) in Count One and to the board\u2019s decision to stay Stafford\u2019s suspension. Stafford objects to the entirety of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>board\u2019s findings of misconduct and argues that we should grant a full dismissal of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">{\u00b6 6} Having carefully considered the arguments of the parties and the evidence presented in this case, we overrule Stafford\u2019s objections, we overrule disciplinary counsel\u2019s objections in part, and we sustain disciplinary counsel\u2019s objections in part. We adopt the board\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law, and we adopt the board\u2019s recommendation that Stafford be suspended from the practice of law in Ohio for 12 months. We reject the board\u2019s recommendation to stay the suspension, however, and we impose an actual suspension of 12 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">Misconduct and Objections</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\"><em>Count One </em>\u2014 The <em>Tallisman Matter</em></p>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">{\u00b6 7} In divorce proceedings that spanned January 2005 to early 2008, Stafford represented Susan Tallisman. Stafford filed her complaint for divorce, naming the husband, Alan Tallisman, and a variety of asset-holders as defendants. The complaint sought spousal support and a division of property, but made no mention of the prenuptial agreement that the parties had signed prior to their marriage in 1993. In the husband\u2019s February 2005 answer and counterclaim for divorce, he asserted that a prenuptial agreement limited the wife\u2019s rights to support and property. Stafford failed to answer the counterclaim or file any further pleadings. The husband then filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that the prenuptial agreement controlled the division of the parties\u2019 property. Stafford filed a memorandum in opposition to summary judgment, asserting that the prenuptial agreement should not be enforced. Stafford\u2019s memorandum took no issue with the certification and service of the husband\u2019s answer and counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-9\">{\u00b6 8} The <em>Tallisman </em>case languished in domestic-relations court for two years, during which the case was riddled with continuances and discovery battles. On April 12, 2007, the husband, through counsel, filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings, asking for a finding that the wife\u2019s failure to answer his counterclaim constituted an admission to the averments in the counterclaim. On April 16, 2007, in correspondence pointing to the wife\u2019s failure to timely answer the husband\u2019s counterclaim, the husband\u2019s, counsel proposed settling the parties\u2019 property issues. He also asserted that Stafford had committed malpractice by failing to answer the counterclaim and that Stafford\u2019s interests may be in conflict with his client\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-10\">{\u00b6 9} The next day, Stafford filed, on the wife\u2019s behalf, a motion for leave to file an amended complaint. In support of his motion, Stafford claimed that he needed to include additional necessary parties, but he made no mention of the prenuptial agreement and failed to attach a copy of the amended complaint to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>motion. On the same day, the trial court granted the motion ex parte, without providing the husband with an opportunity to respond. In the amended complaint, Stafford named five new asset-holders, all of whom had long since been disclosed. But for the first time in a pleading, and without mention in the motion for leave to amend, Stafford acknowledged that the prenuptial agreement existed and claimed that it was the result of fraud, coercion, and duress. On April 26, 2007, Stafford filed a brief opposing the husband\u2019s prior motions for judgment on the pleadings, noting that the court had permitted the amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">{\u00b6 10} On April 18, 2007, Stafford filed a motion for leave to answer the husband\u2019s February 2005 counterclaim, \u201cpremised upon issues regarding service of the answer and counterclaim.\u201d Again, the court granted leave on the same day without allowing the husband to respond. Also on April 18, 2007, the court filed a judgment entry, which for some unknown reason had not been filed after being signed on October 20, 2005, denying the husband\u2019s June 2005 motion for summary judgment. In the wife\u2019s belated answer to the husband\u2019s counterclaim, Stafford asserted that the prenuptial agreement identified in the counterclaim was unenforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">{\u00b6 11} On April 19, 2007, the husband filed a series of motions arguing that Stafford had manipulated the Civil Rules in order to belatedly introduce arguments that he had previously failed to raise. Counsel for the husband also looked into the accusation that there were \u201cissues regarding service of the Answer and Counterclaim\u201d and found that the husband\u2019s original certificate of service in the answer and counterclaim had disappeared from the files of the clerk of courts. Counsel for the husband had retained duplicate copies, which showed that the originals of the answer and counterclaim sent to Stafford had included a certificate-of-service page. Counsel sent this information to the court in a notice and filing of a replacement certificate-of-service page of his original answer and counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">{\u00b6 12} At the disciplinary hearing, Stafford testified that he had not received the answer and counterclaim when it was filed in February 2005 and that he did not obtain a copy of it until April or May 2007. However, correspondence between Stafford and opposing counsel, as well as Stafford\u2019s own June 13, 2005 memorandum in opposition to the husband\u2019s summary judgment motion, discuss the husband\u2019s answer and counterclaim, which indicates that Stafford was properly served. Although it was evident that Stafford had long been aware of the husband\u2019s answer and counterclaim, both sides entered an antagonistic battle over the husband\u2019s proposed replacement certificate, involving a succession of motions, conferences, and bitter correspondence.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">{\u00b6 13} On May 24, 2007, Stafford, on behalf of the wife, filed a motion for leave to file a second amended complaint, again requesting the addition of allegedly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>newly disclosed parties. Stafford asserted in the motion that leave was not even required because of \u201cissues raised concerning the failure of the defendant to properly serve his answer and counterclaim.\u201d The court again granted the motion ex parte. Stafford\u2019s second amended complaint named additional defendants, all of whom had been disclosed as stakeholders in prior pleadings and discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">{\u00b6 14} Additionally, in a supplement to the wife\u2019s original opposition to the husband\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings, Stafford explicitly asserted that the husband had failed to comply with Civ.R. 5(D) by failing to include a certificate of service with his answer and counterclaim and argued that the answer and counterclaim were therefore not properly before the court. Stafford repeated this claim during the responsive briefing of issues related to the husband\u2019s counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">{\u00b6 15} On June 13, 2007, the husband filed motions to vacate the ex parte orders allowing Stafford\u2019s amended complaints and to strike the amended complaints from the record. On January 3, 2008, the trial court filed a judgment entry addressing motions filed by both parties from 2005 to 2007. The court declined to strike the husband\u2019s answer and counterclaim for divorce or the motions for judgment on the pleadings and to have averments deemed admitted, denied the motion for judgment on the pleadings, and partially granted the motion to have averments deemed admitted as to the existence of the prenuptial agreement, but reserved judgment on the agreement\u2019s enforceability. The decision also vacated the previously granted leave for the wife to respond to the husband\u2019s counterclaim for divorce, struck the wife\u2019s belated response to the husband\u2019s counterclaim, provided an opportunity for the wife to make a showing of excusable neglect to revive the response to the counterclaim, vacated the previously granted leave to amend, and struck the wife\u2019s second amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">{\u00b6 16} In the decision, the trial court explained the importance of quickly granting leave to amend pleadings to add new defendants in domestic-relations cases to protect the marital estate from dissipated or hidden assets. The trial court noted that Stafford\u2019s attempt to add defenses related to the prenuptial agreement was not appropriate for ex parte treatment and that it altered the pleading to require providing the opposing party with the opportunity to respond. The trial court noted that it was customary to grant immediate leave only to include newly found defendants and that Stafford\u2019s attempted action was not contemplated in the trial court\u2019s customary proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">{\u00b6 17} After the appointed receiver evaluated the parties\u2019 assets and evaluated their pleadings, a receiver\u2019s assessment allowed the parties to amicably settle the property-division issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>{\u00b6 18} The board determined that Stafford had \u201cintentionally misled the court by filing his motion for leave to file an amended complaint on specific grounds stated and then surreptitiously including an additional allegation regarding the prenuptial agreement omitted in the original complaint but critical to his client\u2019s interests.\u201d The board further noted that Stafford had misled the domestic-relations court into granting ex parte relief \u201cwithout the court\u2019s full knowledge of the extent and purpose of the relief sought and by taking advantage of local rules not designed for the purpose to do so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">{\u00b6 19} Based upon these factual findings, the board concluded that Stafford\u2019s conduct involved one violation of Prof.Cond.R. 8.4(c) (prohibiting conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation) and one violation of Prof.Cond.R. 3.3(d) (in an ex parte proceeding, requiring a lawyer to inform the tribunal of all material facts known to the lawyer that will enable the tribunal to make an informed decision, whether or not the facts are adverse). However, the board recommended dismissal of disciplinary counsel\u2019s two additional alleged violations of Prof.Cond.R. 8.4(c) (prohibiting conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation), one additional alleged violation of Prof.Cond.R. 3.3(d), and all remaining allegations of violations of Prof.Cond.R. 3.3(a)(1) (prohibiting a lawyer from knowingly making a false statement of fact or law to a tribunal), 8.4(d), and 8.4(h) (prohibiting conduct that adversely reflects on the lawyer\u2019s fitness to practice law).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">\n<em>Objections to Count One</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">{\u00b6 20} Disciplinary counsel objects to the board\u2019s recommendation that we dismiss the violation of Prof.Cond.R. 8.4(d), arguing that Stafford\u2019s actions as found by the board constituted conduct that was prejudicial to the administration of justice. Stafford objects to the board\u2019s decision on Count One in its entirety, arguing that disciplinary counsel has failed to prove that Stafford has committed any misconduct whatsoever.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">{\u00b6 21} In a disciplinary proceeding, the relator bears the burden of proving, an attorney\u2019s misconduct \u201cby clear and convincing evidence.\u201d Gov.Bar R. V(6)(J). The standard of clear and convincing evidence is an intermediate standard that requires \u201cmore than a mere preponderance\u201d of the evidence, but not \u201csuch certainty as is required beyond a reasonable doubt as in criminal cases. It does not mean clear and <em>unequivocal.\u201d </em>(Emphasis sic.) <em>Cross v. Ledford, </em>161 Ohio St. 469, 477, 120 N.E.2d 118 (1954), paragraph seven of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-9\">{\u00b6 22} To buttress his assertion that finding a violation of Prof.Cond.R. 8.4(c) is unsupported, Stafford recites his extensive and complex version of the events surrounding his motions to amend the pleadings and argues that the board misunderstood or misconstrued the evidence by failing to adopt his version.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>{\u00b6 23} The documents presented by the parties fully support the board\u2019s findings that the additional defendants that Stafford added to the wife\u2019s pleadings were known to Stafford far in advance of the motions. Although Stafford provides a number of reasons to justify his later addition of those parties in spite of this knowledge, the board found credible evidence that Stafford\u2019s justification was not appropriate. There was no danger of assets being dissipated because both parties were aware of the additional defendants. Stafford\u2019s conduct in seeking an ex parte order cannot be justified by fear of concealment or dissipations of assets. The board correctly concluded that Stafford unjustifiably alleged the existence of the prenuptial argument in the amended complaint without any mention of the issue in his motions for leave to amend the pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">{\u00b6 24} By insisting that he slipped the prenuptial-agreement argument in under the cover of a legitimate issue instead of a flimsy fagade, Stafford largely distracts from the core problem. He was not honest with the court when he amended the complaint to add a defense that he might have otherwise waived. Further, we reject Stafford\u2019s contention that the ultimate settling of the case somehow legitimized his unscrupulous procedural tactics.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">{\u00b625} By obtaining ex parte leave to file amended complaints, Stafford attempted to avoid responding to the husband\u2019s related motions and attempted to deprive the husband of the opportunity to file any opposition. By exploiting the peculiar ex parte motions practice of the Domestic Relations Division of the Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court, Stafford was able to surreptitiously add to the wife\u2019s pleadings an untimely denial of the validity of the prenuptial agreement. Stafford\u2019s actions contributed to extending the proceedings into a years-long war, replete with extensive, bitter battles over every minute detail. Almost a year after Stafford filed the first amended complaint, the trial court issued a decision overruling the previous order permitting the ex parte motions to file the amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">{\u00b6 26} While Stafford repeatedly claimed that there were problems with the service of the husband\u2019s answer and counterclaim, implying that the wife was never served, the record discloses that the answer and counterclaim were expressly acknowledged by Stafford during the proceedings in 2005. By belatedly manufacturing an issue with the service of the counterclaim, Stafford attempted to relieve the wife for two years of her obligation to justify her failure to answer the husband\u2019s counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-8\">{\u00b6 27} In this disciplinary case, both sides presented evidence to the panel over the course of a week, and hundreds of documents were considered by the panel and board. Because the panel was in the best position to assess the credibility of the witnesses and rejected Stafford\u2019s testimony that he did not intentionally mislead the trial court into considering additional pleadings, we defer to that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>determination. <em>See Cuyahoga Cty. Bar Assn. v. Wise, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 164, 2006-Ohio-550, 842 N.E.2d 35, \u00b6 24 (\u201cUnless the record weighs heavily against a hearing panel\u2019s findings, we defer to the panel\u2019s credibility determinations, inasmuch as the panel members saw and heard the witnesses firsthand\u201d). Accordingly, we overrule Stafford\u2019s objections and adopt the board\u2019s findings of fact and conclusion that Stafford\u2019s conduct constituted a violation of Prof.Cond.R. 8.4(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">{\u00b6 28} Stafford next objects to the board\u2019s conclusion that Stafford violated Prof.Cond.R. 3.3(d). Stafford argues that the board\u2019s conclusion is contradicted by the board\u2019s own finding that the use of ex parte orders was part of common procedure in the Domestic Relations Division of the Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court. However, Prof.Cond.R. 3.3(d) prohibits the omission of known material facts in ex parte proceedings, not ex parte proceedings themselves. The rule recognizes that in ex parte proceedings, an attorney has an enhanced responsibility to disclose any material information, whether it be favorable or unfavorable, due to the absence of the opposing advocate. Staff comment 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">{\u00b6 29} Stafford argues that his use of the ex parte motions practice \u201cis in no way evidence of misconduct on the part of the Respondent. If it were, then every attorney practicing in Cuyahoga County Domestic Relations Court would be guilty of ethical violations.\u201d During oral argument before this court, Stafford repeatedly stressed that his filing of ex parte motions was simply the way people practice in that county\u2019s domestic-relations court.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">{\u00b6 30} Without belaboring the point, Stafford\u2019s assertion \u2014 that his conduct is merely the way attorneys practice in Cuyahoga County Domestic Court \u2014 is simply not accurate, nor is it a defense. Moreover, it is an insult to every ethical attorney who practices in Cuyahoga County. Each attorney licensed to practice law in Ohio is required to abide by the Rules of Professional Conduct. The customary use of a particular procedure cannot condone the unethical exploitation of that procedure. It is axiomatic that \u201c[attorneys must use the tools of our legal system as they were intended,\u201d and they have \u201ca duty not to abuse legal procedure.\u201d <em>Columbus Bar Assn. v. Finneran, </em>80 Ohio St.3d 428, 430, 687 N.E.2d 405 (1997). Stafford abused the domestic-relations court\u2019s procedure and deceived the court by requesting leave to amend a pleading, bringing attention to a singular issue while surreptitiously including a completely different and unrelated amendment in the pleadings. Belatedly sneaking a defense into pleadings without the knowledge or permission of the court constitutes a failure to \u201cinform the tribunal of all material facts known to the lawyer.\u201d Prof.Cond.R. 3.3(d). Accordingly, we overrule Stafford\u2019s objections and adopt the board\u2019s findings of fact and conclusion that Stafford\u2019s conduct constituted a violation of Prof.Cond.R. 3.3(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>{\u00b6 31} Disciplinary counsel objects to the board\u2019s recommendation that we dismiss the portion of Count One charging Stafford with violating Prof.Cond.R. 8.4(d). Disciplinary counsel asserts that we have previously held that intentionally misleading a court can constitute conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice, citing <em>Cuyahoga Cty. Bar Assn. v. Hardiman, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 260, 2003-Ohio-5596, 798 N.E.2d 369, \u00b6 15; <em>Akron Bar Assn. v. Markovich, </em>117 Ohio St.3d 313, 2008-Ohio-862, 883 N.E.2d 1046, \u00b6 7-9; and <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Robinson, </em>126 Ohio St.3d 371, 2010-Ohio-3829, 933 N.E.2d 1095, \u00b6 20-22.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">{\u00b6 32} In all these cases, the respondents engaged in behavior that not only involved misrepresentations or dishonesty in violation of Prof.Cond.R. 8.4(c), but also encompassed a violation of 8.4(d) by having additional deleterious effects on the cases and clients. <em>Hardiman </em>at \u00b6 4-5 (the respondent led a litigant and opposing counsel to believe that respondent was representing the litigant and then did not appear for court, causing judgment to be entered against the litigant); <em>Markovich </em>at \u00b6 17 (among other violations, respondent was disruptive during proceedings and discourteous to the court and opposing counsel during proceedings, disobeyed court rulings, and was cited for contempt); <em>Robinson </em>at \u00b6 6-11 (respondent lied under oath and secretly destroyed evidentiary documents). Here, time and money were certainly wasted as a result of Stafford\u2019s behavior, but we defer to the board\u2019s findings and conclude that no actual legal prejudice occurred. Accordingly, we overrule disciplinary counsel\u2019s objections and adopt the board\u2019s findings of fact and conclusion that disciplinary counsel failed to establish by clear and convincing evidence that Stafford\u2019s conduct in Count One violated Prof.Cond.R. 8.4(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">{\u00b6 33} Both sides in this case have presented a considerable amount of evidence to the panel, which was reviewed by the full board. After thoroughly reviewing the record, we overrule the remaining objections of both parties. We defer to the panel\u2019s credibility determinations, and we adopt the board\u2019s findings of fact. In accordance with the board\u2019s recommendation, we hold that Stafford violated Prof.Cond.R. 3.3(d) and 8.4(c), and we dismiss the remaining charges in Count One.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\"><em>Count Two </em>\u2014 Events <em>Preceding the </em>Rymers <em>Matter</em></p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">{\u00b6 34} Although the hearing panel sua sponte dismissed Count Two, a brief account of the facts will help form the context in which the events in Count Three occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">{\u00b6 35} In November 2000, Eugene A. Lucci was elected judge of the Lake County Court of Common Pleas and held office from January 2001 through the time of the events recounted in Count Three. Lucci separated from his wife in November 2007, and the parties planned to divorce. Around December 2007, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>Lucci became involved with Amy Rymers, who was married to but separated from her husband, Jeffery Rymers.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">{\u00b6 36} On March 12, 2008, Lucci had a meeting with Stafford at Stafford\u2019s law firm to discuss his marital situation, his negotiations with his wife\u2019s attorney, and his preparation of a proposed separation agreement. Lucci and Stafford provided conflicting testimony as to whether there was any mention of Lucci\u2019s relationship with Amy Rymers, but Stafford\u2019s notes from the meeting were consistent with Stafford\u2019s contentions that there was no mention of it. Lucci and Stafford had no further meetings or discussions, no retainer agreement was signed, and no letter of undertaking was provided. Stafford took no part in Lucci\u2019s dissolution proceedings. Lucci testified that he believed that Stafford would have represented him if the matter had proceeded to a contested divorce. Amy Rymers and her children began living with Lucci in September 2008. The Luceis\u2019 dissolution was finalized in October 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\"><em>Count Three </em>\u2014 The Rymers <em>Matter</em></p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">{\u00b6 37} The Rymers\u2019 divorce proceedings began in 2009. Stafford represented Jeffery. Amy filed a complaint for divorce in the Lake County Common Pleas Court, and a visiting judge was assigned to preside over the case. After Stafford filed his notice of appearance, Lucci, through counsel, contacted Stafford and asserted that his representation in the <em>Rymers </em>case conflicted with Lucci\u2019s interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">{\u00b6 38} In a May 19, 2009 letter, Lucci\u2019s counsel explained Lucci\u2019s personal and financial involvement with Amy, as well as Lucci\u2019s past consultation with Stafford regarding his own divorce matters, and asked that Stafford withdraw from representation in the <em>Rymers </em>matter. A paragraph in the correspondence, with which Stafford would later take issue, reads as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b573-9\">{\u00b6 39} \u201cIn addition, in earlier discussions between the Rymers [sic], Mr. Rymers claimed that, among the issues he intends to raise in his custody fight, is the danger of Mrs. Rymers being involved .with Mr. Lucci, who as you know is a Common Pleas Judge in Lake County. Mr. Rymers said he is concerned for the children\u2019s safety if potential transgressors, etc. seek revenge against a judge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b573-10\">{\u00b6 40} After Stafford did not withdraw from the Rymers case, Lucci filed a motion to intervene and to disqualify Stafford as counsel, asserting that Stafford\u2019s prior consultation with Lucci caused a conflict of interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-11\">{\u00b6 41} Stafford sent his recently hired associate, Nicholas M. Gallo, to attend the June 3, 2009 pretrial conference with Jeffery. Neither Jeffery nor Gallo had ever met Lucci. While the parties were waiting for the conference to begin, the wife\u2019s attorney approached the husband and Gallo and personally delivered Lucci\u2019s motion to intervene. At about this time, Jeffery noticed a man, whom <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>Jeffery believed to be Lucci, in the hallway outside Lucci\u2019s chambers. Jeffery believed that the man was staring at him as if to intimidate him. Jeffery brought this circumstance to Gallo\u2019s attention, and Gallo contacted Stafford about the incident. Upon hearing Gallo\u2019s verbal description of the man in the hallway, Stafford concluded that the description matched that of Lucci and directed Gallo to prepare a motion to strike Lucci\u2019s motion to intervene as well as a motion for sanctions and attorney fees. Stafford directed both Gallo and the husband to complete affidavits about the incident to include with the motions. Both affidavits accused Lucci of threatening and intimidating the husband by staring at him.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">{\u00b6 42} On June 17, 2009, Stafford filed the motion to strike and/or dismiss the motion to intervene and the motion for sanctions and attorney fees pursuant to R.C. 2323.51 and Civ.R. 11. Stafford\u2019s memorandum in support of the motions not only contested the merits of Lucci\u2019s motion to intervene, but also accused Lucci of committing misconduct by filing the motion and abusing his position as judge of the Lake County Common' Pleas Court. Stafford\u2019s memorandum referred to Lucci as Judge Lucci, attacked Lucci\u2019s integrity, wisdom, and ethics in his position as a judge, and specifically accused Lucci of violating Jud.Cond.R. 1.3 (prohibiting abuse of the prestige of judicial office). Gallo\u2019s and Jeffery\u2019s affidavits were attached to the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">{\u00b6 43} Stafford claimed in the June 17, 2009 memorandum that Lucci had committed threatening conduct not only toward Jeffery, but also toward Stafford himself in Lucci\u2019s counsel\u2019s May 19, 2009 letter demanding that Stafford withdraw from Jeffery\u2019s case. Specifically, Stafford asserted that Jeffery had been \u201cintimidated and threatened by the conduct of [Lucci] in this matter, including but not limited to, his threats and his conduct at the most recent pretrial in this matter. This is especially so, given [Lucci\u2019s] position as a presiding [sic] in the Lake County Court of Common Pleas.\u201d Stafford also claimed that Lucci had \u201cengaged in a pattern of harassing and threatening conduct\u201d toward both the husband and Stafford and that Lucci had \u201cintimated on numerous occasions these threats, based upon [Lucci\u2019s] position as a presiding Judge in the Lake County Court of Common Pleas.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">{\u00b6 44} Stafford accused Lucci of using \u201cveiled threats\u201d in the May 19, 2009 letter. Stafford quoted the letter as stating: \u201c[I]n earlier discussions between the Rymers [sic], Mr. Rymers claimed that, among the issues he intends to raise in his custody fight, is the danger of Mrs. Rymers being involved with Mr. Lucci, <em>who as you know is a Common Pleas Judge in Lake County.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added by respondent.) By abridging this quote and using it out of context, Stafford created the appearance of a threat where there was none.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-8\">{\u00b6 45} Shortly after Stafford\u2019s filing of the above motions and memorandum, Gallo resigned from Stafford\u2019s firm. Gallo testified that he had based his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>averments in the affidavit on his conversation with Stafford, during which Stafford told Gallo that the description matched Lucci\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">{\u00b6 46} On June 26, 2009, Lucci filed a response to the husband\u2019s motion to strike and averred that he had not been in the hallway the day of the pretrial and had not engaged in any staring or intimidation. Despite Lucci\u2019s response, Stafford took no action to investigate, verify, or refute Lucci\u2019s sworn statement. Recorded video from the court later proved that the man in the hallway was not Lucci. On January 25, 2010, Stafford filed a motion to withdraw the affidavits of the husband and Gallo; however, Stafford filed no memorandum with the motion and did not move to withdraw his own June 17, 2009 motion, which included the incendiary statements at issue today.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">{\u00b6 47} The board determined that Stafford had personally instructed his subordinate associate to prepare a motion to strike Lucci\u2019s motion to intervene and to prepare the affidavits claiming that Lucci had threatened and intimidated the husband. The board found that the statement regarding intimidation was completely false and irrelevant to the legal issues presented in the motion and that Stafford had impugned Lucci\u2019s judicial' integrity by accusing him of violating the Rules of Judicial Conduct in an improper forum. The board further found that the excerpt of correspondence from Lucci\u2019s counsel was taken out of context and used \u201cin a deliberately misleading manner to imply a threatened abuse of judicial status that was not made.\u201d The board concluded that Stafford had made deliberate misrepresentations to the domestic-relations court regarding the conduct of both Lucci and Lucci\u2019s counsel with the intent to deceive the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">{\u00b6 48} Based upon these factual findings, the board concluded that Stafford\u2019s conduct violated Prof.Cond.R. 5.1(c)(1) (declaring that a lawyer shall be responsible for another lawyer\u2019s violation of the Ohio Rules of Professional Conduct if the lawyer orders or, with knowledge of the specific conduct, ratifies the conduct involved), 8.2(a) (prohibiting a lawyer from making a statement that the lawyer knows to be false or with reckless disregard as to its truth or falsity concerning the integrity of a judicial officer), 8.4(c), and 8.4(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">{\u00b6 49} However, the board recommended dismissal of alleged violations of Prof.Cond.R. 3.3(a)(3) (prohibiting a lawyer from offering evidence that he knows to be false and requiring remedial measures if the lawyer later comes to know that evidence is false), 4.1(b) (prohibiting a lawyer from failing to disclose a material fact when disclosure is necessary to avoid assisting a fraudulent act by a client), 5.1(c)(2) (declaring that a lawyer shall be responsible for another lawyer\u2019s violation of the Ohio Rules of Professional Conduct if the lawyer is a partner in the law firm in which the lawyer practices and knows of the conduct at a time when its consequences can be avoided or mitigated but fails to take reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>remedial action), and 8.4(h) (prohibiting conduct that adversely reflects on the lawyer\u2019s fitness to practice law).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">\n<em>Objections to Count Three</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">{\u00b6 50} As with Count One, Stafford objects to the board\u2019s decision on Count Three in its entirety, arguing that disciplinary counsel failed to prove that Stafford committed any misconduct whatsoever. Because the record does not weigh heavily against the board\u2019s findings, we again defer to the credibility determinations of the panel, and we adopt the board\u2019s findings of fact and misconduct. See <em>Cuyahoga Cty. Bar Assn. v. Wise, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 164, 2006-Ohio-550, 842 N.E.2d 35, \u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">{\u00b6 51} First, Stafford asserts that there was no proof of a violation of Prof.Cond.R. 5.1(c)(1) because there was no proof that Stafford had supervised Gallo, no proof that Stafford had participated in the motion to strike or the affidavits of Gallo and Jeffery, and no proof that Gallo committed misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">{\u00b6 52} Evidence clearly and convincingly supports the board\u2019s findings. Stafford is a partner in his firm and had supervisory authority over Gallo. Stafford was counsel of record in the Rymers case and had personally assigned Gallo to participate in it. Stafford was lead counsel for the motion to strike, the motion alleged that Stafford himself was one of the victims of Lucci\u2019s alleged threats, and Stafford\u2019s personal affidavit regarding his past interactions with Lucci is attached to the motion. Finally, the record reflects that Gallo personally made statements that were false, inflammatory, and irrelevant to the issues presented. Gallo has been publicly reprimanded for' his misconduct. <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Gallo, </em>131 Ohio St.3d 309, 2012-Ohio-758, 964 N.E.2d 1024. Accordingly, we overrule Stafford\u2019s objections and adopt the board\u2019s findings of fact and conclusion that Stafford\u2019s conduct constituted a violation of Prof.Cond.R. 5.1(c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-9\">{\u00b6 53} Stafford asserts that Prof.Cond.R. 8.2(a) is inapplicable because Lucci was not acting in his official capacity as a judge. However, Prof.Cond.R. 8.2(a) makes no differentiation among the different possible roles of the judge: the focus is on the conduct of the attorney. A judge need not be acting in his official capacity for an attorney to violate the prohibition against making a recklessly false statement concerning that judge\u2019s integrity as a judicial officer. <em>See, e.g., Disciplinary Counsel v. Baumgartner, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 41, 2003-Ohio-4756, 796 N.E.2d 495, \u00b6 8-9.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-10\">{\u00b6 54} Stafford further asserts that no violation of Prof.Cond.R. 8.2(a), 8.4(c), or 8.4(d) occurred because Stafford had no knowledge that the statements were false, because Stafford himself made no false statements, because any misrepresentation in Stafford\u2019s own motion regarding the Lucci correspondence was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>dispelled by the attached copy of the correspondence, and because the affidavits were withdrawn once the falsity of the statements came to light.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">{\u00b6 55} This court uses \u201c \u2018an objective standard to determine whether a lawyer\u2019s statement about a judicial officer is made with knowledge or reckless disregard of its falsity.\u2019 \u201d <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Gardner, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 416, 2003-Ohio-4048, 793 N.E.2d 425, at \u00b6 26, quoting Annotated Model Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 8, 566 (4th Ed.1999). This standard looks to \u201c \u2018 \u201cwhat the reasonable attorney, considered in light of all his professional functions, would do in the same or similar circumstances\u201d * * * [and] focuses on whether the attorney had a reasonable factual basis for making the statements, considering their nature and the context in which they were made.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Standing Commt. on Discipline of United States Dist. Court for Cent. Dist. of California v. Yagman, </em>55 F.3d 1430, 1437 (9th Cir.1995), quoting <em>United States Dist. Court, E. Dist. of Washington v. Sandlin, </em>12 F.3d 861, 867 (9th Cir.1993). Accordingly, we held that sanctions are appropriate when an attorney lodges accusations of judicial impropriety that a reasonable attorney would consider untrue. <em>Gardner </em>at \u00b6 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">{\u00b6 56} A failure to make any real inquiry into a judicial officer\u2019s integrity prior to making accusations of judicial impropriety demonstrates a reckless disregard for the truth. <em>Gardner </em>at \u00b6 33. Here, Stafford did nothing to verify the truth of the statements of Gallo and Jeffery when he instructed them to complete affidavits, and he further failed to conduct any inquiry after Lucci filed a sworn statement denying the allegations of Gallo and Jeffery.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">{\u00b6 57} Stafford intentionally and unnecessarily demeaned Lucci as a judge in a manner that was reckless and in the public record. He recklessly presented false evidence to the court. Stafford himself made false statements regarding the integrity of Lucci as a judicial officer in his memorandum in support of the motion to strike and/or dismiss the motion to intervene and the motion for sanctions and attorney fees, and failed to withdraw the memorandum even after the falsity of the statements had been exposed and after the supporting affidavits of Gallo and Jeffery had been withdrawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-8\">{\u00b6 58} As for Stafford\u2019s additional claim that Lucci made threatening statements in correspondence, a reasonable attorney would believe that Stafford\u2019s statement was false because the statements, when read in context, conveyed no threat whatsoever. Certainly Stafford\u2019s distortions regarding Lucci\u2019s letter are able to be dispelled by closer examination of the letter itself. However, Stafford\u2019s blatant use of the quote out of context, manipulation of the language, and accusations of violations of the Code of Judicial Conduct are histrionics that are unbecoming a member of the bar. Accordingly, we overrule Stafford\u2019s objections and adopt the board\u2019s findings that Stafford\u2019s conduct constituted violations of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>Prof.Cond.R. 5.1(c)(1), 8.2(a), 8.4(c), and 8.4(d), and we dismiss the remaining charges in Count Three.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">\n<em>Additional Objections</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">{\u00b6 59} In addition to the specific counts, Stafford introduces a panoply of objections, largely related to procedural matters. Stafford argues that the board violated his due-process rights by considering certain portions of Count One, even though the probable-cause panel had not reviewed them. Disciplinary counsel correctly points out that nothing presented to the probable-cause panel is ever before the hearing panel, the board, or this court. Pursuant to Gov.Bar R. V(11)(E), those proceedings are private.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">{\u00b6 60} Stafford also argues that disciplinary counsel should not have been permitted to bring the additional charges presented in Count Three, because the charges were not presented to a probable-cause panel. However, once a formal complaint is pending, a disciplinary complaint may be amended at any time \u201cprior to final order of the Supreme Court\u201d as long as the respondent is given a reasonable opportunity to respond. Gov.Bar R. V(11)(D); <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Heiland, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 521, 2008-Ohio-91, 880 N.E.2d 467, \u00b6 33-34; BCGD Proc.Reg. 9(D) (\u201cThe relator may not amend the complaint within thirty days of the scheduled hearing without a showing of good cause to the satisfaction of the panel chair\u201d). Stafford has not provided any evidence that he was prevented from preparing or responding to the amended' charges in the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">{\u00b6 61} Next, Stafford claims that disciplinary counsel violated Gov.Bar R. V(4)(D), which requires a disciplinary investigation to be completed within 60 days of filing a grievance, unless an extension is granted for good cause, and the disposition is to be decided within 30 days of the close of the investigation. Here, disciplinary counsel was granted multiple extensions of time for good cause. Stafford is correct that \u201c[investigations that extend beyond one year from the date of filing are prima facie evidence of unreasonable delay.\u201d Gov.Bar R. V(4)(D)(3). However, Stafford does not assert, let alone demonstrate, that he was prejudiced by the delay. Gov.Bar R. V(4)(D)(3) requires a showing \u201cthat the rights of the respondent to have a fair hearing have been violated\u201d before a grievance can be dismissed. We agree with the board\u2019s decision to deny Stafford\u2019s motion to dismiss and overrule Stafford\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-8\">{\u00b6 62} Stafford next claims that disciplinary counsel did not provide proper responses to some of the hundreds of requests for admission filed by Stafford regarding some specifics of the husband\u2019s assets in the <em>Tallisman </em>matter. Upon review of the record, we agree with the board\u2019s conclusion that Stafford\u2019s motions to compel merely disputed disciplinary counsel\u2019s statements and sought to introduce matters that were irrelevant and distracted from the question of Stafford\u2019s alleged misconduct. We review the board\u2019s decisions to deny Staf<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>ford\u2019s motions to compel for an abuse of discretion, and we find none. <em>See, e.g., Columbus Bar Assn. v. Ewing, </em>75 Ohio St.3d 244, 252, 661 N.E.2d 1109 (1996) (upholding the panel\u2019s discovery decisions that \u201cappropriately confined respondent to relevant matters\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">{\u00b6 63} Finally, Stafford objects to various prehearing rulings by the board, including an order preventing Stafford from presenting the argument that attorney James Cahn, Mr. Tallisman\u2019s attorney, had committed malpractice in the <em>Tallisman </em>matter and that Cahn had personal motives for filing the grievance against Stafford. He also objects to the orders separating witnesses and finding that the testimony of three additional witnesses would be irrelevant to the issues before the panel. Again, we find that Stafford\u2019s arguments were largely a distraction from facts and issues that were relevant to a determination whether Stafford had committed misconduct. We conclude that the board did not abuse its discretion by ruling adversely to Stafford on these motions. Accordingly, we overrule Stafford\u2019s objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">{\u00b6 64} When imposing sanctions for attorney misconduct, we weigh evidence of the aggravating and mitigating factors listed in BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B). <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Broeren, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 473, 2007-Ohio-5251, 875 N.E.2d 935, \u00b6 21. In making a final determination, we consider a number of factors, including the ethical duties that the lawyer violated and the sanctions imposed in similar cases. <em>Stark Cty. Bar Assn. v. Buttacavoli, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 424, 2002-Ohio-4743, 775 N.E.2d 818, \u00b6 16. Because each disciplinary case is unique, we are not limited to the factors specified in the rule but may take into account \u201call relevant factors\u201d in determining what sanction to impose. BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">{\u00b6 65} In terms of aggravating factors, the board found that Stafford had acted with a dishonest motive, committed multiple violations of the Ohio Rules of Professional Conduct, and refused to acknowledge the wrongful nature of his conduct. <em>See </em>BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(1)(b), (d), and (g). In terms of mitigating factors, the board found that Stafford had no record of professional misconduct. <em>See </em>BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2)(a). Although Stafford did not submit any evidence of his character or reputation, testimony from attorney Cahn and Judge Lucci indicated that Stafford was a \u201cvery good lawyer.\u201d The board found that Stafford enjoys a good professional reputation. <em>See </em>BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2)(e). The board recommended that Stafford be suspended from the practice of law in Ohio for a period of 12 months, with all 12 months stayed on the condition that he engage in no further professional misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-9\">{\u00b6 66} Disciplinary counsel objects to the board\u2019s recommended sanction and contends that we should impose an actual suspension of no less than 12 months. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>{\u00b6 67} In cases that involve multiple instances of misconduct that include a violation of Prof.Cond.R. 8.4(c), we impose an actual suspension. <em>See Disciplinary Counsel v. Robinson, </em>126 Ohio St.3d 371, 2010-Ohio-3829, 933 N.E.2d 1095, \u00b6 48; <em>Cincinnati Bar Assn. v. Farrell, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 529, 2008-Ohio-4540, 895 N.E.2d 800, \u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">{\u00b6 68} Stafford\u2019s six violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct stemmed from a course of conduct that was replete with dishonest, deceptive, and disrespectful acts. When an attorney engages in such conduct and violates Prof.Cond.R. 8.4(c), \u201cthe attorney will be actually suspended from the practice of law for an appropriate period of time.\u201d <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Fowerbaugh, </em>74 Ohio St.3d 187, 658 N.E.2d 237 (1995), syllabus. \u201cA lawyer who engages in a material misrepresentation to a court * * * violates, at a minimum, the lawyer\u2019s oath of office that he or she will not \u2018knowingly * * * employ or countenance any * * * deception, falsehood, or fraud.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 190, quoting former Gov.Bar R. I(8)(A). \u201cSuch conduct strikes at the very core of a lawyer\u2019s relationship with the court and with the client. Respect for our profession is diminished with every deceitful act of a lawyer.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">{\u00b6 69} Additionally, Stafford\u2019s misconduct in the <em>Rymers </em>matter included false statements concerning the integrity of a judicial officer. When an attorney engages in such conduct and violates Prof.Cond.R. 8.2(a), we \u201crequire an actual suspension from the practice of law.\u201d <em>Gardner, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 416, 2003-Ohio-4048, 793 N.E.2d 425, at \u00b6 36, citing <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. West, </em>85 Ohio St.3d 5, 706 N.E.2d 760 (1999), and <em>Columbus Bar Assn. v. Hartwell, </em>35 Ohio St.3d 258, 520 N.E.2d 226 (1988). In more extreme cases involving an unfounded attack against the integrity of a judicial officer, we have indefinitely suspended offending attorneys and have even imposed permanent disbarment. <em>See, e.g., Disciplinary Counsel v. Frost, </em>122 Ohio St.3d 219, 2009-Ohio-2870, 909 N.E.2d 1271 (indefinite suspension); <em>Baumgartner, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 41, 2003-Ohio-4756, 796 N.E.2d 495 (disbarment).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">{\u00b6 70} When an attorney exhibits a pattern of abusing legal procedures, be it for his own gain or for his client\u2019s advantage, an actual suspension from the practice of law is called for. <em>See, e.g., Finneran, </em>80 Ohio St.3d at 430, 687 N.E.2d 405; <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Holland, </em>106 Ohio St.3d 372, 2005-Ohio-5322, 835 N.E.2d 361, \u00b6 21. In <em>Finneran, </em>we indefinitely suspended an attorney from the practice of law after he engaged in a years-long pattern of \u201cserial refiling\u201d and other evasive and dilatory tactics, intending to procure a more favorable settlement offer from opponents in the face of even more protracted proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at 431. The attorney in <em>Holland </em>took advantage of the technicalities of a juvenile court\u2019s fee-payment process and obtained fees from the court for more hours than he possibly could have worked. <em>Holland </em>at \u00b6 7-8. This court rejected the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>attorney\u2019s argument that the juvenile court condoned his billing practices because it paid his requested fees, and we imposed a one-year suspension.. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 19, 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\">{\u00b6 71} It is true, as Stafford submits, that we have imposed partially or fully stayed terms of suspension in some disciplinary cases where an attorney\u2019s violations involved dishonest, deceitful, or fraudulent conduct. <em>See Cincinnati Bar Assn. v. Reisenfeld, </em>84 Ohio St.3d 30, 701 N.E.2d 973 (1998); <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Fumich, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 257, 2007-Ohio-6040, 878 N.E.2d 6; <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Niermeyer, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 99, 2008-Ohio-3824, 892 N.E.2d 434; <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Potter, </em>126 Ohio St.3d 50, 2010-Ohio-2521, 930 N.E.2d 307.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">{\u00b6 72} In <em>Reisenfeld, </em>an attorney had improperly executed and notarized affidavits in what the attorney claimed to be emergency circumstances. <em>Id. </em>at 31-32. We imposed a six-month, stayed suspension because the violations were isolated incidents in an otherwise unblemished legal career, they did not constitute an ongoing course of conduct, no client was harmed, and the attorney readily cooperated in the investigation. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">{\u00b6 73} The attorney in <em>Fumich </em>engaged in a more serious course of misconduct by accidentally causing a client\u2019s medical-malpractice case to be dismissed, failing to reveal the dismissal to the client, negotiating a nonexistent settlement, and then paying the \u201csettlement\u201d amount out of the attorney\u2019s own personal funds. <em>Fumich, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 257, 2007-Ohio-6040, 878 N.E.2d 6, at \u00b6 4-7. Notwithstanding this dishonesty, we imposed a 12-month, stayed suspension due to the absence of aggravating factors and the significant mitigating evidence that the attorney had no prior disciplinary record, cooperated fully in the disciplinary process, accepted responsibility for his wrongful conduct, submitted various character letters, and had not caused financial harm. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 11, 16-18.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">{\u00b6 74} In <em>Niermeyer, </em>the attorney committed a single act of misconduct by filing a falsified document with the Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation. <em>Niermeyer, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 99, 2008-Ohio-3824, 892 N.E.2d 434, at \u00b6 4. Despite finding that the attorney had acted with a dishonest or selfish motive, we imposed a 12-month, stayed suspension due to the significant mitigating evidence that the attorney had self-reported the misconduct, had made immediate efforts to rectify the matter, had no disciplinary record, cooperated fully in the disciplinary process, accepted responsibility for his wrongful conduct, and had submitted evidence of good character and reputation. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 9,13-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-8\">{\u00b6 75} In <em>Potter, </em>the attorney was the executor of an estate that held property that the attorney wanted to purchase. <em>Id., </em>126 Ohio St.3d 50, 2010-Ohio-2521, 930 N.E.2d 307, at \u00b6 6. The attorney asked a friend to purchase the property with the attorney\u2019s funds and did not disclose the situation to anyone involved with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>estate. <em>Id. </em>Again, despite a finding of dishonest or selfish motive, we imposed a stayed 12-month suspension due to the isolated nature of the incident and the significant mitigating evidence that the attorney self-reported the misconduct, made immediate efforts to rectify the matter, had no disciplinary record, cooperated fully in the disciplinary process, and accepted responsibility for his wrongful conduct. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 7, 9-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">{\u00b6 76} Stafford maintains that there is no difference between these latter cases and his own. However, they all involve attorneys who have a single, isolated incident of misconduct in an otherwise unblemished legal career and/or an abundance of mitigating factors. Stafford\u2019s case does not present such a situation, as he has engaged in multiple acts of misconduct over the course of multiple years, and the aggravating factors in his case far outweigh those offered in mitigation. Accordingly, we reject Stafford\u2019s argument for a lesser sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">{\u00b6 77} We also reject the board\u2019s recommended lesser sanction. The board justified staying Stafford\u2019s suspension by relying on <em>Stark Cty. Bar Assn. v. Ake, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 266, 2006-Ohio-5704, 855 N.E.2d 1206. In <em>Ake, </em>the attorney had represented himself in his own divorce proceedings and deliberately ignored the domestic-relations court\u2019s orders on five separate occasions during the proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 39. The attorney\u2019s actions constituted a number of violations, including the equivalents to the current Prof.Cond.R. 8.4(c), (d), and (h). <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 38. Because this court was confident that the attorney\u2019s violations arose out of unique circumstances and would not be repeated, we imposed a six-month suspension, with the entire period stayed upon certain conditions. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 46-47.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">{\u00b6 78} Here, the board determined that the circumstances surrounding Stafford\u2019s myriad violations were similarly unique and believed that neither the similar circumstances nor the violations committed by Stafford were likely to recur. Specifically, the board found that Stafford\u2019s misconduct in <em>Tallisman </em>arose in the peculiar ex parte practice of the local court and that the misconduct occurred before the trial judge actively took control, after which the proceedings were brought to order and were resolved through an amicable settlement. The board found that Stafford\u2019s misconduct in <em>Rymers </em>was inspired by an \u201coverreaction in kind to Lucci\u2019s claim of Stafford\u2019s breach of ethics by appearing as counsel in the Rymers case.\u201d The board found both counts to have arisen in \u201ca highly unusual circumstance unlikely to recur.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">{\u00b6 79} We agree with the board that the circumstances of any contested divorce proceeding are unique and complex. However, Stafford\u2019s circumstances \u2014 namely his role as an attorney in a contested-divorce proceeding \u2014 are certain to recur. We conclude that the circumstances in this case are not analogous to those in <em>Ake </em>and are more similar to eases such as <em>Finneran, </em>when the attorney\u2019s repeated attempts to mislead warranted an actual suspension. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>Although the violations in the present case are less extreme than those in <em>Finneran, </em>the penalty imposed in this case is less extreme than the indefinite suspension imposed in <em>Finneran.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">{\u00b6 80} Having considered Stafford\u2019s conduct, the applicable aggravating and mitigating factors, and the sanctions imposed for similar misconduct, we conclude that an actual 12-month suspension is the appropriate sanction for Stafford\u2019s ethical violations. Stafford\u2019s license to practice law is suspended for 12 months. Costs are taxed to Stafford.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b583-7\">O\u2019Connor, CJ., and Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b583-8\">O\u2019Donnell, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ASe\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-9\">{\u00b6 81} I concur with the majority in this case but write separately to address an assertion presented by respondent\u2019s counsel during oral argument regarding ex parte communications occurring in the Domestic Relations Division of the Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court. The following colloquy occurred during oral argument regarding respondent\u2019s conduct in obtaining an ex parte order granting leave to amend a pleading in a case pending in that court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-10\">Justice Lundberg Stratton: What about the allegations that [Stafford] continued to obtain ex parte amendments and \u2014 and\u2014such without fully disclosing what was going on \u2014 that\u2019s one of the allegations \u2014 and certainly that might be a reason the judge doesn\u2019t complain, because the judge is signing ex parte orders.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-11\">Counsel for Stafford: And I think it\u2019s been evidenced in this case that <em>it is in fact something that goes on in Cuyahoga County Domestic Relations Court. </em>In this instance, he filed a motion for leave. The judge signed it that day. That was the judge\u2019s decision to do or not to do. The motion to amend was not ex parte, your honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-12\">Justice Lundberg Stratton: So because this is a practice, it\u2019s ethical? It\u2019s allowed? It\u2019s OK?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-13\">Counsel for Stafford: I <em>think if both sides are engaging in it, yes, </em>but more importantly, several months later, Judge Celebrezze said\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-14\">Justice Lundberg Stratton: Don\u2019t you think maybe we have a duty to say, \u201cThat\u2019s it. I don\u2019t care if the judge does it or not, it\u2019s not allowable, it\u2019s not ethical, you\u2019re \u2018ex parte-ing,\u2019 and this is where it\u2019s stopping?\u201d Because the judges apparently aren\u2019t stopping it, according to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>Counsel for Stafford: I think if that\u2019s a decision this court makes, then it\u2019s certainly obviously the power of this court to do that, <em>but not retroactively to a litigant who is among thousands who do the same thing.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">{\u00b6 82} These statements of counsel appear to be incredible and very troubling. If true, the judges of the court must examine their practices to ensure that ex parte communications play no part in the way cases are litigated in their respective courts. Counsel who are under the mistaken impression that this is acceptable practice are on notice that such a practice subjects both the attorney and judge to potential discipline.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">Ex Parte Communications</p>\n<p id=\"b584-8\">{\u00b6 83} \u201cAn ex parte communication is one that excludes any party who is legally entitled to be present or notified of the communication and given an opportunity to respond.\u201d Garwin, Libby, Maher, and Rendelman, <em>Annotated Model Code of Judicial Conduct, </em>176 (2d Ed.2004). When exchanged between a judicial officer and counsel, such communications violate the right of the opposing party to receive a fair hearing, 2 Restatement of the Law 3d, The Law Governing Lawyers, Section 113, comment (b) (2011), and thus are prohibited by the Ohio Rules of Professional Conduct and the Ohio Code of Judicial Conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-9\">{\u00b6 84} To the extent that counsel engage in unauthorized ex parte communications or judges permit or condone them, they violate these rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-10\">Attorney Communications</p>\n<p id=\"b584-11\">{\u00b6 85} Prof.Cond.R. 3.5 prohibits an attorney from communicating ex parte with \u201ca judicial officer or other official as to the merits of the case during the proceeding unless authorized to do so by law or court order.\u201d <em>See also </em>2 Restatement of the Law 3d, The Law Governing Lawyers, Section 113(1) (\u201cA lawyer may not knowingly communicate ,ex parte with a judicial officer before whom a proceeding is pending concerning the matter, except as authorized by law\u201d). The comments to this section note that prohibited communications include those between counsel and judges, counsel and the judge\u2019s staff, and counsel and any other judicial officer permitted to rule on evidence or argument about a disputed matter, and ex parte communications that seek resolution of procedural matters that may result in a \u201csubstantial tactical or strategic advantage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at comment (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-12\">{\u00b6 86} We have routinely disciplined attorneys for participating in unauthorized ex parte communications. In <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Tomlan, </em>118 Ohio St.3d 1, 2008-Ohio-1471, 885 N.E.2d 895, \u00b6 31, we held that John Tomlan\u2019s ex parte <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>communication with a judge that occurred away from the courthouse, in which Tomlan asked the judge his thoughts on a pending probate matter and expressed hope that the judge would decide the latest issue in his client\u2019s favor, violated DR 7-110(B) (prohibiting attorneys from communicating ex parte on the merits of a case with a judicial officer).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In <em>Stark Cty. Bar Assn. v. Arkow, </em>104 Ohio St.3d 265, 2004-Ohio-6512, 819 N.E.2d 284, \u00b6 17, we held that Seth Arkow\u2019s communication with a judge, during which he presented a proposed child-custody order for judicial action at a hearing he requested without opposing counsel present and without providing notice reflecting the correct day of the hearing, violated DR 7-110(B). Further, in <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Stuard, </em>121 Ohio St.3d 29, 2009-Ohio-261, 901 N.E.2d 788, \u00b6 16, we held that assistant prosecutor Christopher D. Becker\u2019s ex parte communication with Judge John Stuard, in which Becker prepared a sentencing entry in a capital case without informing defense counsel, violated DR 1-102(A)(5) (prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice) and DR 7-110(B). Also, in <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Baumgartner, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 41, 2003-Ohio-4756, 796 N.E.2d 495, \u00b6 10, we held that Elsebeth Baumgartner\u2019s ex parte communication with a juvenile-court judge before whom a client\u2019s case was pending, in which she accused government officials of corruption and conspiracy and discussed the merits of a client\u2019s case, violated DR 7-110(B), <em>id. </em>at \u00b6 8, 10, and in <em>Cincinnati Bar Assn. v. Sauter, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 136, 2002-Ohio-3610, 772 N.E.2d 620, \u00b6 5, 10, we held that judicial law clerk Susan M. Sauter\u2019s ex parte communication with counsel for a party in a pending case, in which she recommended a strategy on appeal, violated DR 1-102(A)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">Judicial Communications</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">{\u00b6 87} Ex parte communications to judicial officers may be inaccurate or incomplete and may \u201cundermine a judge\u2019s impartiality and the integrity of the judicial process.\u201d 33 Am. Judicature Soc. Ctr. for Judicial Ethics, <em>Judicial Conduct Reporter </em>(Spring 2011). Jud.Cond.R. 2.9 prohibits a judge from initiating, receiving, permitting, or considering ex parte communications stemming from or directed to parties or their attorneys, except as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-7\">(1) When circumstances require it, an ex parte communication for scheduling, administrative, or emergency purposes, that does not address substantive matters or issues on the merits, is permitted, provided the judge reasonably believes that no party will gain a procedural, substantive, or tactical advantage as a result of the ex parte communication;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>(2) A judge may obtain the advice of a disinterested expert on the law applicable to a proceeding before the judge, if the judge gives notice to the parties of the person consulted and the subject-matter of the advice solicited, and affords the parties a reasonable opportunity to object or respond to the advice received;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-5\">(3) A judge may consult with court staff and court officials whose functions are to aid the judge in carrying out the judge\u2019s adjudicative responsibilities, or with other judges, provided the judge makes reasonable efforts to avoid receiving factual information that is not part of the record and does not abrogate the responsibility personally to decide the matter;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-6\">(4) A judge, with the consent of the parties, may confer separately with the parties and their lawyers in an effort to settle matters pending before the judge;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-7\">(5) A judge may initiate, receive, permit, or consider an ex parte communication when expressly authorized by law to do so;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-8\">(6) A judge may initiate, receive, permit, or consider an ex parte communication when administering a specialized docket, provided the judge reasonably believes that no party will gain a procedural, substantive, or tactical advantage while in the specialized docket program as a result of the ex parte communication.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b586-9\">{\u00b6 88} We have disciplined judges for participating in unauthorized ex parte communications in several instances. In <em>Stuard, </em>121 Ohio St.3d 29, 2009-Ohio-261, 901 N.E.2d 788, \u00b6 10, 16, we held that Judge Stuard\u2019s ex parte communications with a prosecutor, resulting in the prosecutor\u2019s preparation of a sentencing entry in a capital case without involving defense counsel, violated Canon 2, 78 Ohio St.3d CLXVIII (requiring a judge to \u201crespect and comply with the law and * * * act at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity of the judiciary\u201d) and Canon 3(B)(7) (prohibiting a judge from initiating, receiving, permitting, or considering communications as to substantive matters or issues on the merits made to the judge outside the presence of the parties or their representatives concerning a pending or impending proceeding).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. O\u2019Neill, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 204, 2004-Ohio-4704, 815 N.E.2d 286, \u00b6 20, we held that former Judge Deborah O\u2019Neill\u2019s ex parte communications with a prosecutor following the reversal of a conviction she entered, in which she encouraged the prosecutor to file an appeal, violated Canon 3(B)(7), and in <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Medley, </em>104 Ohio St.3d 251, 2004-Ohio-6402, 819 N.E.2d 273, \u00b6 10, 13, we held that former Judge William Medley\u2019s communications with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>criminal defendant, in which the judge unilaterally negotiated and accepted a plea bargain in the absence of the prosecutor and defense counsel, violated Canon 1 (requiring a judge to uphold the integrity and independence of the judiciary), 2, 3(B)(7), and 4 (requiring a judge to avoid impropriety and the appearance of impropriety in all the judge\u2019s activities) and DR 1-102(A)(5). More recently, in <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Plough, </em>126 Ohio St.3d 167, 2010-Ohio-3298, 931 N.E.2d 575, \u00b6 10, we determined that former judge John Plough\u2019s communications with a county prosecutor without the participation of defense counsel, in which the judge discussed his opposition to the assistant prosecutor\u2019s proposed plea agreement, violated Canon 3(B)(7).</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A7h\">Jonathan E. Coughlan, Disciplinary Counsel, Lori J. Brown, Chief Assistant Disciplinary Counsel, and Karen H. Osmond, Staff Attorney, for relator.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b587-10\">Stephen S. Crandall, for respondent.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">{\u00b6 89} In the instant case, disciplinary counsel did not charge respondent with a violation of the Ohio Rules of Professional Conduct in connection with an ex parte communication. What is disturbing is the cavalier attitude toward ex parte communication evidenced by counsel\u2019s colloquy with a member of this court and the incredible representation that thousands of lawyers do the same thing.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">{\u00b6 90} The Ohio Rules of Professional Conduct and the Ohio Code of Judicial Conduct prohibit ex parte communications unless otherwise authorized by the rules. Participating in unauthorized ex parte communications is prohibited conduct subject to sanction. Our adversarial system of justice is dependent upon attorneys who respect, understand, and adhere to the Ohio Rules of Professional Conduct and upon impartial jurists who strictly adhere to the Code of Judicial Conduct and who assertively resist ex parte engagements.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">{\u00b6 91} The statements of counsel during the oral argument of this case, if true, are troubling and raise concerns about the conduct of those engaged in the practice of law in the Cuyahoga County Domestic Relations Court. Counsel and judges are reminded of their obligation to adhere to the Ohio Rules of Professional Conduct and the Ohio Code of Judicial Conduct in this regard and to avoid the appearance of impropriety.</p>\n<judges id=\"b587-8\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Lundberg Stratton, J., concur in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b585-8\">.
