Ansted, to issue a new sentencing entry in Jones\u2019s criminal case. Jones argues that the entry issued in his case is not a final, appealable order because it fails to dispose of every firearm specification of which he was found guilty. Thus, Jones contends, the entry does not comply with Crim.R. 32(C) and is not a final, appealable order.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-15\">{\u00b6 2} The October 29, 2008 sentencing entry constituted a final, appealable order because it set forth the fact of Jones\u2019s convictions, the sentence, the judge\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>signature, and the time stamp indicating the entry upon the journal by the clerk. <em>State v. Lester, </em>130 Ohio St.3d 303, 2011-Ohio-5204, 958 N.E.2d 142, paragraph one of the syllabus; see also <em>State ex rel. Lockhart v. Whitney, </em>130 Ohio St.3d 95, 2011-Ohio-4896, 955 N.E.2d 994, \u00b6 2; <em>State v. Ford, </em>128 Ohio St.3d 398, 2011-Ohio-765, 945 N.E.2d 498, \u00b6 17 (\u201cfirearm specification is merely a sentence enhancement, not a separate criminal offense\u201d). \u201c[N]either mandamus nor procedendo will compel the performance of a duty that has already been performed.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Tenace v. Court of Claims of Ohio </em>(2002), 94 Ohio St.3d 319, 321, 762 N.E.2d 1009. And insofar as Jones contests the failure of the trial court to issue multiple sentences for his firearm-specification convictions, he has or had an adequate remedy by way of appeal to raise his claim of sentencing error. See, e.g., <em>State ex rel. Cunningham v. Lindeman, </em>126 Ohio St.3d 481, 2010-Ohio-4388, 935 N.E.2d 393, \u00b6 1.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AU\">Marquise Jones, pro se.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b306-8\">Thomas L.
