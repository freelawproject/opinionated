Watson v. Mohr, </em>10th Dist. No. 10AP-949, 2011-Ohio-402, 2011 WL 5005817, \u00b6 18. In effect, the court of appeals did not conclusively determine that Watson had submitted the applicable cost for the copies. A request for statutory damages under the Public Records Act, R.C. 149.43, is properly denied if the requester refuses to submit payment for the cost of the requested copies. <em>State ex rel. Dehler v. Kelly, </em>127 Ohio St.3d 309, 2010-Ohio-5724, 939 N.E.2d 828, \u00b6 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-11\">{\u00b6 3} Nor did the court of appeals specify that appellees had breached any duty owed to Watson under R.C. 149.43(B). To the contrary, the court of appeals concluded that \u201c[b]ased upon the record before us and the reality of the crowding of the penal system in Ohio, we cannot say that respondents failed to act promptly in response to Watson\u2019s requests for public records.\u201d 2011-Ohio-402, 2011 WL 5005817, \u00b6 18. An award of statutory damages is premised on the court\u2019s determination that \u201cthe public office or the person responsible for public records failed to comply with an obligation in accordance with [R.C. 149.43(B)].\u201d R.C. 149.43(C)(1); <em>State ex rel. Patton v. Rhodes, </em>129 Ohio St.3d 182, 2011-Ohio-3093, 950 N.E.2d 965, \u00b6 21.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A4G\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>Robert Watson, pro se.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b519-9\">Michael DeWine, Attorney General, and Jason Fuller, Assistant Attorney General, for appellees.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">{\u00b6 4} Finally, Watson\u2019s mandamus claim was based in part on his request for nonpublic records. The claim is not authorized by R.C. 149.43, and he cannot be awarded statutory damages for this claim under R.C. 149.43(C)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">{\u00b6 5} Therefore, the court of appeals did not abuse its discretion in denying Watson\u2019s request for statutory damages notwithstanding its judgment conditionally granting the writ. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b519-7\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, Cupp, and McGee Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
