See <em>Beer v. Griffith </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 440, 441-442, 8 O.O.3d 438, 377 N.E.2d 775 (\u201cSince only the Chief Justice or [the chiefs] designee may hear disqualification matters, the Court of Appeals was without authority to pass upon disqualification or to void the judgment of the trial court upon that basis\u201d); <em>Goddard v. Children\u2019s Hosp. Med. Ctr. </em>(2000), 141 Ohio App.3d 467, 473, 751 N.E.2d 1062; <em>State v. Ramos </em>(1993), 88 Ohio App.3d 394, 398, 623 N.E.2d 1336.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-13\">{\u00b6 3} Moreover, as Judge Saffold now contends, the chief justice has since granted Hough\u2019s affidavit to disqualify her, so his claim is now moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-14\">{\u00b6 4} Finally, contrary to Hough\u2019s assertions, Judge Saffold had no duty to issue findings of fact and conclusions of law in denying Hough\u2019s motion to supplement his previously denied, untimely, successive petition for postconviction relief. See <em>State ex rel. James v. Coyne, </em>114 Ohio St.3d 45, 2007-Ohio-2716, 867 N.E.2d 837, \u00b6 5 (court has no duty to issue findings of fact and conclusions of law when it dismisses an untimely petition for postconviction relief); see also <em>State v.
