Craig of Columbus, Ohio, Attorney Registration No. 0011244, was admitted to the practice of law in Ohio in 1976. On April 11, 2011, relator, Columbus Bar Association, charged Craig with professional misconduct arising from his forging a client\u2019s signature on an affidavit of transfer on death, notarizing that signature, and then filing the document with the Franklin County Recorder\u2019s Office.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-16\">{\u00b6 2} A panel of the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline considered the cause on the parties\u2019 consent-to-discipline agreement. <em>See </em>Section 11 of the Rules and Regulations Governing Procedure on Complaints and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>Hearings Before the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline (\u201cBCGD Proc.Reg.\u201d).</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A_P\">Bruce A. Campbell, Bar Counsel, and A. Alysha Clous, Assistant Bar Counsel; and Robert D. Erney, for relator.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b545-12\">Kegler, Brown, Hill &amp; Ritter Co., L.P.A., and Christopher J. Weber, for respondent.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">{\u00b6 3} In the parties\u2019 consent-to-discipline agreement, Craig stipulates to the facts as alleged in relator\u2019s complaint and agrees that his conduct violated Prof.Cond.R. 1.4(a)(3) (requiring a lawyer to keep his client reasonably informed about the status of a matter), 4.1(a) (prohibiting a lawyer from knowingly making a false statement of material fact or law), and 8.4(c) (prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation). Relator has agreed to dismiss alleged violations of Prof.Cond.R. 1.1 (requiring a lawyer to provide competent representation to a client) and 8.4(h) (prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct that adversely reflects on the lawyer\u2019s fitness to practice law).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">{\u00b6 4} The parties stipulated that no aggravating factors exist and that mitigating factors include the absence of a prior disciplinary record, absence of a selfish motive, a timely good-faith effort to rectify the consequences of the misconduct, full and free disclosure and a cooperative attitude toward the disciplinary proceedings, and Craig\u2019s good character and reputation aside from the charged misconduct. <em>See </em>BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2)(a), (b), (c), (d), and (e). Based upon these substantial mitigating factors, the parties have stipulated that a public reprimand is the appropriate sanction for Craig\u2019s misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">{\u00b6 5} The panel and board found that the consent-to-discipline agreement conforms to BCGD Proc.Reg. 11, and they recommend that we adopt the agreement in its entirety. We agree that Craig violated Prof.Cond.R. 1.4(a)(3), 4.1(a), and 8.4(c) and that, consistent with the parties\u2019 agreement, this conduct warrants a public reprimand. Therefore, we adopt the parties\u2019 consent-to-discipline agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">{\u00b6 6} Accordingly, Craig is hereby publicly reprimanded for his violation of Prof.Cond.R. 1.4(a)(3), 4.1(a), and 8.4(c). Costs are taxed to Craig.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-9\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b545-10\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, Cupp, and McGee Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
