Relator withdrew three alleged rule violations, and the parties agreed that a six-month stayed suspension was the appropriate sanction for Proctor\u2019s misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-10\">{\u00b6 4} The panel and board adopted many of the parties\u2019 stipulated findings of fact and all of the stipulated findings of misconduct. Although they adopted the stipulated mitigating factors, they also found that several aggravating factors were present. Citing those aggravating factors and <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Gardner, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 416, 2003-Ohio-4048, 793 N.E.2d 425, the panel and board recommend that Proctor serve an actual six-month suspension from the practice of law in Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-11\">{\u00b6 5} Proctor objects to the board\u2019s findings of fact and recommended sanction, arguing that the two motions to dismiss that he filed should have been considered by the entire board and granted, and that <em>Gardner </em>does not mandate the imposition of an actual suspension under the facts of this case. We overrule Proctor\u2019s objections and adopt the board\u2019s findings of fact and misconduct and its recommended sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-12\">Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b396-13\">{\u00b6 6} In 2002, Proctor filed a lawsuit on behalf of Julie Peterman in the Delaware County Court of Common Pleas. Proctor withdrew as counsel in 2003, and the following month, Peterman dismissed the action without prejudice. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>Thereafter, counsel for the defendants in that action moved the court for attorney fees. Judge W. Duncan Whitney granted the motion in 2005 and ordered Proctor and Peterman, jointly and severally, to pay the defendants $31,995.90. Proctor paid approximately $26,000 of that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">{\u00b6 7} Proctor moved the court to vacate the judgment pursuant to Civ.R. 60(B), and the trial judge recused himself and transferred the case to Judge Everett Krueger, who overruled the motion. Proctor\u2019s request for findings of fact and conclusions of law was denied. In a supplemental request regarding his motion for findings of fact and conclusions of law filed on October 18, 2007, Proctor alleged that Judge Whitney harbored a bias against him and had engaged in ex parte communications with opposing counsel in the case and then had \u201cgone to great effort to cover this up and/or deny that these things happened.\u201d Proctor reiterated these accusations in his appellate brief when he challenged the denial of his motion to vacate and for relief from judgment. When Proctor made these allegations, he did not have a reasonable belief that they were true, and therefore he has stipulated that the allegations were recklessly made.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">{\u00b6 8} Based upon these findings, the panel and board found that Proctor had violated Prof.Cond.R. 3.5(a)(6) (prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in undignified or discourteous conduct that is degrading to a tribunal) and 8.2(a) (prohibiting a lawyer from knowingly or recklessly making false statements concerning the integrity of a judicial officer) and Gov.Bar R. IV(2) (requiring a lawyer to maintain a respectful attitude toward the courts).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">Recommended Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">{\u00b6 9} In recommending a sanction, the panel and board considered the aggravating and mitigating factors listed in BCGD Proc.Reg. 10. <em>See Stark Cty. Bar Assn. v. Buttacavoli, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 424, 2002-Ohio-4743, 775 N.E.2d 818, \u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">{\u00b6 10} The parties have stipulated to the following mitigating factors: Proctor does not have a prior disciplinary record, he fully and freely disclosed information and cooperated with the disciplinary proceedings, and he paid $26,000 pursuant to the judgment for attorney fees in the underlying litigation. <em>See </em>BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2)(a), (d), and (f). They also stipulated that the appropriate sanction for Proctor\u2019s misconduct is a six-month stayed suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-9\">{\u00b6 11} The board adopted the parties\u2019 stipulations regarding mitigation but pointed out that Proctor\u2019s $26,000 sanction was the impetus for, rather than the result of, the conduct charged in this case. It also found that Proctor\u2019s pattern of misconduct involving multiple offenses and his continued claims that he had a reasonable belief to support the allegations he had made against Judge Whitney, despite his stipulations to the contrary, were aggravating factors. <em>See </em>BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(1)(c), (d), and (g). Citing these aggravating factors and the six-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>month actual suspension we imposed for comparable misconduct in <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Gardner, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 416, 2003-Ohio-4048, 793 N.E.2d 425, the board concluded that a six-month actual suspension was the appropriate sanction for Proctor\u2019s misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">Proctor\u2019s Objections</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">{\u00b6 12} Proctor objects to the board\u2019s findings of fact and misconduct, as well as its recommended sanction. In his first objection, he argues that the full board should have considered his two motions to dismiss relator\u2019s complaint after they were overruled by the panel chair. In his first motion to dismiss, Proctor argued that he should not be punished for the allegations he made against Judge Whitney, because Prof.Cond.R. 8.3 and 3.3 required him to report potential judicial misconduct to an appropriate authority. He renews this argument in his second objection and urges us to adopt the judgmental-immunity doctrine to protect him from the consequences of what he claims was required reporting of judicial misconduct. And in his second motion to dismiss, Proctor argued that because he had consulted with an assistant disciplinary counsel prior to making the allegations against Judge Whitney, relator\u2019s continued prosecution of the complaint violated his right to due process. Proctor renews this argument in his third objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">{\u00b6 13} At his disciplinary hearing and again at oral argument, Proctor denied having any intent to disavow the stipulations he entered in this case. Indeed, during oral argument, Proctor\u2019s counsel admitted that the single issue before this court is the board\u2019s rejection of the stipulated sanction of a six-month stayed suspension in favor of a six-month actual suspension. Therefore, we decline to address Proctor\u2019s first three objections to the board\u2019s report, which would require this court to disregard Proctor\u2019s stipulations of fact and misconduct and consider whether he had a reasonable belief that the statements in his supplemental request regarding his motion for findings of fact and conclusions of law and in his appellate brief were true. Furthermore, we adopt the board\u2019s findings of fact and misconduct, which are based upon the parties\u2019 stipulations and are amply supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">{\u00b6 14} In his fourth objection, Proctor argues that his conduct is less egregious than that of Gardner and that this court should therefore reject the board\u2019s recommendation of an actual suspension from the practice of law in favor of the parties\u2019 stipulated sanction of a six-month stayed suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-9\">{\u00b6 15} In <em>Gardner, </em>we recognized that ethical rules prohibiting false statements impugning the integrity of judges are necessary \u201c \u2018to preserve public confidence in the fairness and impartiality of our system of justice.\u2019 \u201d 99 Ohio St.3d 416, 2003-Ohio-4048, 793 N.E.2d 425, \u00b6 29, quoting <em>Standing Commt. on Discipline of the United States Dist. Court for the Cent. Dist. of California v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number><em>Yagman, </em>55 F.3d 1430, 1437 (9th Cir.1995). To further that compelling interest, we adopted an objective standard to determine whether a lawyer\u2019s statement about a judicial officer was made with knowledge of or in reckless disregard of its falsity, and we therefore held that \u201can attorney may be sanctioned for making accusations of judicial impropriety that a reasonable attorney would believe are false.\u201d <em>Gardner </em>at \u00b6 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">{\u00b6 16} Gardner\u2019s misconduct consisted of a diatribe in a motion for reconsideration filed with the appellate court that had affirmed his client\u2019s criminal conviction. <em>Gardner </em>at \u00b6 3. In that document, Gardner made reckless and unfounded accusations that the court was biased and corrupt. Id. at \u00b6 33-34. Gardner had no record of prior discipline, apologized for the manner in which he had expressed his frustration with the appellate court\u2019s ruling, and acknowledged that his motion was neither appropriate nor professional. Id. at \u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">{\u00b6 17} The parties recommended that Gardner be publicly reprimanded for his misconduct, and the panel adopted that recommendation. Id. at \u00b6 12. The board, however, citing Gardner\u2019s \u201c \u2018outrageous behavior toward a tribunal,\u2019 \u201d recommended a six-month stayed suspension. Id. But stating that \u201c[ujnfounded attacks against the integrity of the judiciary require an actual suspension from the practice of law,\u201d we imposed a six-month actual suspension from the practice of law. Id. at \u00b6 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">{\u00b6 18} We have similarly held that attorneys who engage in a course of conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation will be actually suspended from the practice of law for an appropriate period of time. <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Fowerbaugh, </em>74 Ohio St.3d 187, 191, 658 N.E.2d 237 (1995). But we have treated our pronouncement in <em>Fowerbaugh </em>as a presumptive sanction and have not hesitated to impose lesser sanctions in the presence of significant mitigating evidence. <em>See, e.g., Disciplinary Counsel v. Carroll, </em>106 Ohio St.3d 84, 2005-Ohio-3805, 831 N.E.2d 1000, \u00b6 13; <em>Dayton Bar Assn. v. Kinney, </em>89 Ohio St.3d 77, 728 N.E.2d 1052 (2000). And despite our proclamation that \u201c[ujnfounded attacks against the integrity of the judiciary require an actual suspension from the practice of law,\u201d <em>Gardner, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 416, 2003-Ohio-4048, 793 N.E.2d 425, at \u00b6 36, we have previously imposed lesser sanctions for attorneys who have knowingly or recklessly impugned the integrity of the judiciary when sufficient mitigating factors are present. <em>See, e.g., Akron Bar Assn. v. DiCato, </em>130 Ohio St.3d 394, 2011-Ohio-5796, 958 N.E.2d 938 (six-month stayed suspension imposed on an attorney who made a false statement impugning the integrity of a judge during a telephone conversation with the judge\u2019s bailiff, when mitigating factors included the absence of a prior disciplinary record and cooperation with the disciplinary investigation, as well as the attorney\u2019s apology and guilty plea to related contempt charges).</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Ak6m\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>Jonathan E. Coughlan, Disciplinary Counsel, and Stacy Solochek Beckman, Assistant Disciplinary Counsel, for relator.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b400-10\">James S. Adray, for respondent.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">{\u00b6 19} In this case, however, the board found that the two aggravating factors \u2014 Proctor\u2019s making recklessly false statements impugning the integrity of a judicial officer in at least two court filings and his refusal to acknowledge the wrongful nature of his conduct, as demonstrated by his repeated efforts to undermine his own stipulations with claims that he had reason to believe that the allegations were true \u2014 outweighed the mitigating factors. We agree and find that Proctor\u2019s conduct is comparable to that in <em>Gardner </em>and more serious than that in <em>DiCato. </em>Therefore, we adopt the board\u2019s recommended sanction of a six-month suspension from the practice of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">{\u00b6 20} Accordingly, Philip Lucas Proctor is suspended from the practice of law in Ohio for six months. Costs are taxed to Proctor.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b400-7\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Pfeifer, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, Cupp, and McGee Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b400-8\">Lundberg Stratton, J., dissents and would impose a 12-month stayed suspension.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
