Because the requested electronic images constitute records subject to disclosure under the Public Records Act and relators are entitled to copies of those electronic records at actual cost rather than at the higher statutory charge for photocopying documents, we grant the writ to compel the fiscal officer to provide the requested electronic copies at actual cost. Insofar as the current public-records policy of the recorder\u2019s office does not controvert this result, however, we deny the writ insofar as it seeks to amend the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">{\u00b6 2} Relators Data Trace Information Services, L.L.C. and Property Insight, L.L.C. are limited-liability companies that were created by separate title-insurance companies. Data Trace and Property Insight store and organize digital images of and information taken from deeds, mortgages, liens, leases, releases, and other public records that county recorders\u2019 offices record. Their clients are companies that evaluate and insure the quality of title to land.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">{\u00b6 3} From 1997 until mid-1998, Patrick O\u2019Malley served as the Cuyahoga County recorder. During O\u2019Malley\u2019s tenure as county recorder, the office changed from a paper-based system of managing recorded instruments to a computer-based system. By 1999, the recorder\u2019s office recorded deeds and other instruments by electronically scanning the originals to create digital images of them and storing those images in the office\u2019s computer system.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">{\u00b6 4} The office procedure is as follows. Persons desiring to file a deed, mortgage, or other instrument with the county recorder tender the instrument and the applicable recording fee to one of the cashiers in the recorder\u2019s office. The recorder\u2019s office assigns an automated file number to the instrument that shows the date the county recorded the instrument and the sequence in which the instrument is recorded that day. An adhesive label listing the file number and the time of filing is attached to the document, the person\u2019s name and telephone number are obtained in case any problem with the document arises, the document is scanned into the recorder\u2019s computer system with a digital scanner, and the original paper document is returned to the person tendering it.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-9\">{\u00b6 5} The recorder\u2019s office makes a backup copy of the digital images of all the instruments recorded every single day on a compact disc. These backup copies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>are referred to as master CDs. Using the information that appears on the electronically recorded instruments, the recorder\u2019s office also enters certain information into the computer system that results in the office\u2019s grantor-grantee index.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">{\u00b6 6} Beginning in 1999, the recorder\u2019s office copied the master CDs onto several blank CDs and provided the CDs for a fee of $50 to various companies, including Data Trace and Property Insight. Those companies also paid a fee of $5,000 each year for regularly updated copies of the recorder\u2019s office\u2019s grantor-grantee index.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">{\u00b6 7} Neither Data Trace nor Property Insight evaluates the quality of title to land. Instead, they provide access to their databases and searching capabilities, which are more detailed and comprehensive than Cuyahoga County\u2019s database and search options.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">{\u00b6 8} In July 2008, Lillian Greene became Cuyahoga County recorder. In September 2009, Greene notified Data Trace and Property Insight that she was increasing the $5,000 annual fee for the updated grantor-grantee index to $7,500 as a result of the \u201crecent county budget crisis\u201d but that the $50 fee for single CDs of the office\u2019s daily recordings would remain the same. In the spring of 2010, the recorder\u2019s office notified Data Trace and Property Insight that it would no longer be providing CD copies of its daily digital images from its master CDs. Instead, the recorder\u2019s office advised the companies that it would give them only paper printouts of the digital copies of the recorded instruments at a fee of $2 per page. The recorder\u2019s office purchases blank CDs for use in its routine course of business at a rate of $31.81 for 100 discs.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">{\u00b6 9} On October 5, 2010, Data Trace and Property Insight sent letters to the Cuyahoga County recorder requesting that Greene provide CDs containing electronic copies of all documents publicly recorded in her office in July and August 2010. The letters were sent on their behalf by relator Michael Stutzman, the operations manager of Data Trace, and relator Michael Carsella, the vice president of Midwest operations of Property Insight. The companies objected to the recorder\u2019s recently adopted policy or practice of imposing a charge for all copies of recorded documents, whether images or paper, of $2 per page or image, and requested that the recorder amend her policy of charging more than the actual cost of copying the electronic images of the recorded documents onto CD. The then existing public-records policy adopted by the recorder\u2019s office included a section that provided that \u201c[t]he charge for downloaded computer files to a compact disc is $1.00 per disc.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b437-9\">{\u00b6 10} After three weeks without a response from the recorder, Data Trace and Property Insight filed a public-records mandamus action against the Cuyahoga County recorder in this court in case No. 2010-1823. By letters dated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>November 16, 2010, the recorder\u2019s office finally responded to the companies\u2019 October 5, 2010 requests by specifying that it would provide the requested materials upon payment of the statutory fees required by R.C. 317.32. The recorder then moved to dismiss case No. 2010-1823 because the companies had not registered to do business in Ohio. The companies filed an application to dismiss the case, which we granted on November 30, 2010. <em>Data Trace Information Servs., L.L.C. v. Cuyahoga Cty. Recorder, </em>127 Ohio St.3d 1439, 2010-Ohio-5806, 937 N.E.2d 569.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">{\u00b6 11} Data Trace and Property Insight registered and paid the fees to do business in Ohio. On November 24, 2010, relators, Data Trace, Property Insight, Stutzman, and Carsella, filed this public-records mandamus case against the Cuyahoga County recorder. On January 5, 2011, relators deposed Recorder Greene, who claimed that the recorder\u2019s office\u2019s public-records policy, which provided that the charge for downloaded computer files to compact disc was $1 per disc, did not apply to the companies\u2019 requests for the electronically recorded instruments because they were not public records.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">{\u00b6 12} After the deposition, around January 10, 2011, the recorder adopted a public-records policy that deleted the fee of $1 per compact disc for downloading computer files and replaced it with a policy that provides that the \u201ccost for copies is $2.00 per page for recorded documents * * * and $.05 per page for all administrative or non-recorded documents,\u201d with public-records requests pertaining \u201cto any documents that document the organization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures and operations of the office, subject to certain exemptions under state and federal law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">{\u00b6 13} In January 2011, Cuyahoga County\u2019s new charter form of government became effective. The Cuyahoga County Council adopted a public-records policy that specified that \u201c[t]he charge for computer files downloaded to a compact disc shall be the actual cost, not to exceed $1.26 per disc.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b438-8\">{\u00b6 14} Under the charter, the Cuyahoga County fiscal officer \u201cshall exercise all powers and perform all duties now or hereafter vested in or imposed by general law upon * * * county recorders.\u201d Article V, Section 5.02(1), Cuyahoga County Charter. Therefore, the Cuyahoga County fiscal officer is substituted for the Cuyahoga County recorder as the respondent in this case. S.Ct.Prac.R. 10.2 and Civ.R. 25(D)(1). Athough there is no longer a county recorder, the recorder\u2019s office still remains. See http://recorder.cuyahogacounty.us.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-9\">{\u00b6 15} In February 2011, relators filed a motion for leave to file an amended complaint. In their amended complaint, relators request a writ of mandamus to (1) compel the fiscal officer to provide the requested copies of recorded instruments on compact discs, (2) amend the policy and practice to allow for copying electronically stored recorded instruments onto CDs and to provide electronic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>copies to relators and other members of the public at cost, and (3) restore the policy limiting the fee charged for electronic copies of records to $1 per CD with no per-page fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">{\u00b6 16} In March 2011, after relators became concerned that the county had misunderstood their request as asking the recorder\u2019s office to create new records in a CD format, they sent the fiscal officer letters stating that the recorder\u2019s office could comply with their October 5, 2010 requests by copying the master CDs for July and August 2010 onto blank CDs and charging them $1 per CD in accordance with former recorder Greene\u2019s previous public-records policy. In response, the fiscal officer specified that the county agreed that Data Trace and Property Insight could have copies of the records they requested, so the only question was how much the companies must pay, and it was his view that they must pay the fee of $2 per page specified in the Revised Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">{\u00b6 17} In his answers to relators\u2019 interrogatories, the fiscal officer stated that the total number of pages of instruments that the recorder\u2019s office recorded in July and August 2010 was 104,282, and pursuant to R.C. 317.32(1), Data Trace and Property Insight would be charged $2 per page \u2014 a total of $208,564 \u2014 for the requested copies.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">{\u00b6 18} In April 2011, we granted relators\u2019 motion for leave to file an amended complaint, granted an alternative writ, and issued a schedule for the submission of evidence and briefs. 128 Ohio St.3d 1442, 2011-Ohio-1618, 944 N.E.2d 693. The parties have submitted evidence and briefs. In addition, the fiscal officer has filed a motion for oral argument, and the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, Ohio Newspaper Association, and Ohio Land Title Association have filed amicus curiae briefs in support of relators.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">{\u00b6 19} This cause is now before the court for our consideration of the merits and the motion for oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-9\">Legal Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b439-10\">\n<em>Oral Argument</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b439-11\">{\u00b620} The fiscal officer requests oral argument. \u201cOral argument is not required in an original action in this court; instead, oral argument is discretionary in these cases.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Mun. Constr. Equip. Operators\u2019 Labor Council v. Cleveland, </em>114 Ohio St.3d 183, 2007-Ohio-3831, 870 N.E.2d 1174, \u00b6 42. \u201cNevertheless, we have discretion to grant oral argument pursuant to S.Ct.Prac.R. IX(2)(A) [now 9.2(A)], and in exercising this discretion, we consider whether the case involves a matter of great public importance, complex issues of law or fact, a substantial constitutional issue, or a conflict among courts of appeals.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Davis v. Pub. Emps. Retirement Bd., </em>111 Ohio St.3d 118, 2006-Ohio-5339, 855 N.E.2d 444, \u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>{\u00b6 21} First, the fiscal officer does not present any credible reason for oral argument. He merely states in conclusory fashion that oral argument \u201cwill assist this Court in resolving the important legal issues in this case.\u201d <em>See State ex rel. Lorain v. Stewart, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 222, 2008-Ohio-4062, 893 N.E.2d 184, \u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">{\u00b6 22} Second, this case does not involve complex facts, a conflict between courts of appeals, or any constitutional issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">{\u00b6 23} Finally, the parties\u2019 briefs are sufficient to resolve this public-records mandamus case. <em>State ex rel. Mahajan v. State Med. Bd. of Ohio, </em>127 Ohio St.3d 497, 2010-Ohio-5995, 940 N.E.2d 1280, \u00b6 65.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">{\u00b6 24} Therefore, we deny the fiscal officer\u2019s motion for oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">\n<em>Mandamus in Public-Records Cases</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b440-9\">{\u00b6 25} \u201cMandamus is the appropriate remedy to compel compliance with R.C. 149.43, Ohio\u2019s Public Records Act.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Physicians Commt. for Responsible Medicine v. Ohio State Univ. Bd. of Trustees, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 288, 2006-Ohio-903, 843 N.E.2d 174, \u00b6 6; R.C. 149.43(C)(1). \u201cRelators in public-records mandamus cases need not establish the lack of an adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Am. Civ. Liberties Union of Ohio, Inc. v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Commrs., </em>128 Ohio St.3d 256, 2011-Ohio-625, 943 N.E.2d 553, \u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-10\">{\u00b6 26} \u201cThe Public Records Act reflects the state\u2019s policy that \u2018open government serves the public interest and our democratic system.\u2019 \u201d <em>State ex rel. Glasgow v. Jones, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 391, 2008-Ohio-4788, 894 N.E.2d 686, \u00b6 13, quoting <em>State ex rel. Dann v. Taft, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 364, 2006-Ohio-1825, 848 N.E.2d 472, \u00b6 20. \u201cConsistent with this policy, we construe R.C. 149.43 liberally in favor of broad access and resolve any doubt in favor of disclosure of public records.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b440-11\">{\u00b6 27} The fiscal officer argues that relators are not entitled to the requested electronic copies of recorded documents at cost, because the documents are not records for purposes of the Public Records Act, and that R.C. 317.32(1), when read in pari materia with R.C. 9.01, requires the charge of $2 per page.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-12\">\n<em>Documents Recorded in County Recorder\u2019s Office as Records Subject to R.C. lj.9.13</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b440-13\">{\u00b6 28} The fiscal officer first claims that relators are not entitled to the requested electronic copies of documents recorded in the county recorder\u2019s office at cost because the documents, although otherwise publicly available, are not records subject to disclosure under R.C. 149.43.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>{\u00b6 29} R.C. 149.43(A)(1) defines \u201c[p]ublic record\u201d for purposes of the Public Records Act as \u201crecords kept by any public office, including, but not limited to, * * * county [offices].\u201d R.C. 149.011(G) provides that for R.C. Chapter 149,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-5\">\u201c[r]ecords\u201d includes any document, device, or item, regardless of physical form or characteristic, including an electronic record as defined in section 1306.01 of the Revised Code, created or received by or coming under the jurisdiction of any public office of the state or its political subdivisions, which serves to document the organization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures, operations, or other activities of the office.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">R.C. 1306.01(G) defines an \u201c[electronic record\u201d as \u201ca record created, generated, sent, communicated, received, or stored by electronic means.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">{\u00b6 30} In <em>Kish v. Akron, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 162, 2006-Ohio-1244, 846 N.E.2d 811, at \u00b6 20, we recognized the expansive scope of the R.C. 149.011(G) definition of \u201crecords\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-8\">We previously have held that the General Assembly\u2019s use of \u201cincludes\u201d in R.C. 149.011(G) as a preface to the definition of \u201crecords\u201d is an indication of expansion rather than constriction, restriction, or limitation and that the statute\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cany document\u201d is one encompassing all documents that fit within the statute\u2019s definition, regardless of \u201cform or characteristic.\u201d <em>State ex rel Cincinnati Post v. Schweikert </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 170, 172-173, 527 N.E.2d 1230. There can be no dispute that there is great breadth in the definition of \u201crecords\u201d for the purposes here. Unless otherwise exempted or excepted, almost all documents memorializing the activities of a public office can satisfy the definition of \u201crecord.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Beacon Journal Publishing Co. v. Bond, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 146, 2002-Ohio-7117, 781 N.E.2d 180, \u00b6 13.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-9\">{\u00b6 31} To establish that the electronically recorded documents are records for purposes of R.C. 149.011(G) and 149.43, they must be (1) documents, devices, or items, including electronic records, (2) created or received by or coming under the jurisdiction of the recorder\u2019s office, (3) that serve to document the organization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures, operations, or other activities of the office. R.C. 149.011(G); <em>see also State ex rel. Dispatch Printing Co. v. Johnson, </em>106 Ohio St.3d 160, 2005-Ohio-4384, 833 N.E.2d 274, \u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-10\">{\u00b6 32} Documents electronically recorded by the recorder\u2019s office satisfy the first two requirements of the three-part definition of \u201crecords\u201d under R.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>149.011(G) and 149.43. The documents are received by the recorder\u2019s office, and electronic images of them are created by the recorder\u2019s office when they are scanned into the office\u2019s computer system.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">{\u00b6 33} The dispositive issue for this preliminary question is thus whether the electronically recorded instruments serve to document the organization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures, operations, or other activities of the recorder\u2019s office.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">{\u00b6 34} The fiscal officer contends that documents recorded in a county recorder\u2019s office are not records subject to R.C. 149.43, because they do not document the organization, functions, policies, decisions, operations, or other activities of the recorder\u2019s office. Instead, according to the fiscal officer, they document the independent acts of third parties who present the instruments to the officer for recording.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">{\u00b6 35} The fiscal officer\u2019s contention lacks merit. In general, a \u201ccounty recorder is an elected public official charged with the performance of duties as prescribed by statute.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Preston v. Shaver, </em>172 Ohio St. 111, 114, 173 N.E.2d 758 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">{\u00b6 36} Under R.C. 5301.25(A), \u201c[a]ll deeds, land contracts * * *, and instruments of writing properly executed for the conveyance or encumbrance of lands, tenements, or hereditaments * * * shall be recorded in the office of the county recorder of the county in which the premises are situated.\u201d County recorders have various statutory duties, including keeping certain records (R.C. 317.08), recording certified matter in reference to bankruptcy (R.C. 317.10), indorsing the date, precise time of presentation, and file number of deeds or other written instruments that are required or authorized by statute to be recorded and that are presented to the recorder for that purpose (R.C. 317.13), making and keeping up direct and reverse indexes of the names of parties to instruments received for record (R.C. 317.18), and keeping a daily register of deeds and mortgages (R.C. 317.19).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-9\">{\u00b6 37} R.C. 317.13(B) authorizes county recorders, within their discretion, to \u201crefuse to record an instrument of writing presented to the recorder for recording if the instrument is not required or authorized by the Revised Code to be recorded or the recorder has reasonable cause to believe the instrument is materially false or fraudulent.\u201d R.C. 317.112 and 317.114 set forth certain standards for instruments presented to county recorders for recording and impose various duties on recorders should those standards not be met.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-10\">{\u00b6 38} The instruments that the county recorder\u2019s office electronically records and places into the office\u2019s computer system reflect the office\u2019s compliance with its many statutory duties and its exercise of discretion over the recording process. The electronic records thus manifestly document the organization, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>functions, policies, decisions, operations, or other activities of the recorder\u2019s office. Without these recorded instruments, the recorder\u2019s office could not perform its preeminent functions. In fact, the chief of staff of the recorder\u2019s office acknowledged that providing copies of recorded instruments to the public is a primary function of the office.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\">{\u00b6 39} The fiscal officer\u2019s reliance on a Pennsylvania appellate court case to argue otherwise is unpersuasive. <em>Inkpen v. Roberts, </em>862 A.2d 700 (Pa. Commw.2004). In <em>Inkpen, </em>the intermediate appellate court held that deeds and mortgages were not public records under the Pennsylvania Right-to-Know Act, but the definition of \u201cpublic record\u201d in that statute is significantly more limited than the definition of \u201crecords\u201d in the Ohio Public Records Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">{\u00b6 40} Notably, we are not addressing the issue of personally identifiable information in the requested electronically recorded instruments here. <em>Compare Johnson, </em>106 Ohio St.3d 160, 2005-Ohio-4384, 833 N.E.2d 274, syllabus (home addresses of state employees are not records for purposes of R.C. 149.43); <em>State ex rel.

Subsection (I) of R.C. 317.32 provides that the county recorder shall charge $2 per page for photocopying a recorded document:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-7\">The county recorder shall charge and collect the following fees, to include base fees for the recorder\u2019s services and housing trust fund fees * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-10\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-11\">(I) For photocopying a document, other than at the time of recording and indexing as provided for in division (A) of this section, a base fee of one dollar and a housing trust fund fee of one dollar per page, size eight and one-half inches by fourteen inches, or fraction thereof.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-12\">{\u00b6 46} In determining which statutory cost provision applies for the requested copies of electronically recorded documents, the fiscal officer claims that the more specific provision that applies to fees charged by county recorders for photocopying a recorded document \u2014 R.C. 317.32(I) \u2014 prevails over the more general public-records provision \u2014 R.C. 149.43(B)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-13\">{\u00b6 47} R.C. 1.51 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-14\">If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision, they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both.

R.C. 1.42. If, as here, a term is not defined in the statute, it should be accorded its plain and ordinary meaning.\u201d <em>Rhodes v. New Philadelphia, </em>129 Ohio St.3d 304, 2011-Ohio-3279, 951 N.E.2d 782, \u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">{\u00b6 50} The plain and ordinary meaning of \u201cphotocopy\u201d is \u201ca negative or positive photographic reproduction of graphic matter (as a drawing or printing),\u201d and the common definition of \u201cphotograph\u201d is \u201ca picture, image, or likeness obtained by photography.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 1702 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-8\">{\u00b6 51} In addition, relators\u2019 expert, Peter Shulman, an assistant professor of history at Case Western Reserve University, provided uncontroverted evidence that the modern meaning of photocopying emphasizes xerography \u2014 a process originally called electron photography. According to Professor Shulman, this process consists of the following five steps: (1) a special plate is charged with static electricity, (2) once the plate is charged, the document to be copied is placed above it, a light projects an image of the document onto the plate, and the charge drains away from the plate except in places where the ink on the document was projected, (3) a dry ink called toner is dusted over the selectively charged plate so that the toner forms an image of the document to be copied atop the charged plate, (4) a blank sheet of paper receives the duplicated image, and (5) the duplicated document is heated to fuse or melt the toner to the paper, creating a permanent copy, and the charged plate is wiped clean of the charge and residual toner. Photocopying relies on copying physical pages one at a time.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-9\">{\u00b6 52} By contrast, copying electronic images of recorded documents onto a CD involves no photography or xerography and is done through stored computer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>memory, and the data is stored not in terms of \u201cpages\u201d but in terms of sequences of Is and Os. No paper is involved in the process.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">{\u00b6 53} Therefore, the plain meaning of \u201cphotocopying\u201d does not encompass relators\u2019 requests that the fiscal officer copy onto a CD electronically recorded instruments. There is no conflict, much less an irreconcilable one, between R.C. 317.32(I) and 149.43(B)(1) for the requested records. In cases in which photocopying physical pages of recorded documents is requested, a county recorder shall charge $2 per page. R.C. 317.32(I). In cases in which CDs containing electronically recorded documents are requested, the county recorder shall charge the actual cost of the copies. R.C. 149.43(B)(1). We reached a similar result in <em>Slagle, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 89, 2004-Ohio-4354, 814 N.E.2d 55, in which we held that R.C. 2301.24 superseded the \u201cat cost\u201d provision of R.C. 149.43(B)(1) for copies of transcripts of court proceedings, but not for audiotapes of those proceedings. By so construing these provisions, we give effect to both.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">{\u00b6 54} The fiscal officer next relies on R.C. 9.01 to equate electronically copying recorded documents with photocopying for purposes of charging relators $2 per digital image of each page under R.C. 317.32(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">{\u00b6 55} R.C. 9.01 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-8\">When any officer, office, court, commission, board, institution, department, agent, or employee of the state, of a county, or of any other political subdivision who is charged with the duty or authorized or required by law to record, preserve, keep, maintain, or file any record, document, plat, court file, paper, or instrument in writing, or to make or furnish copies of any of them, deems it necessary or advisable, when recording or making a copy or reproduction of any of them or of any such record, for the purpose of recording or copying, preserving, and protecting them, reducing space required for storage, or any similar purpose, to do so by means of any photostatic, photographic, miniature photographic, film, microfilm, or microphotographic process, or perforated tape, magnetic tape, other magnetic means, electronic data processing, machine readable means, or graphic or video display, or any combination of those processes, means, or displays, which correctly and accurately copies, records, or reproduces, or provides a medium of copying, recording, or reproducing, the original record, document, plat, court file, paper, or instrument in writing, such use of any of those processes, means, or displays for any such purpose is hereby authorized. Any such records, copies, or reproductions may be made in duplicate, and the duplicates shall be stored in different buildings. The film or paper used for a process shall comply with the minimum standards of quality approved for permanent photographic records by the national <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>bureau of standards. All such records, copies, or reproductions shall carry a certificate of authenticity and completeness, on a form specified by the director of administrative services through the state records program.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-5\">Any such officer, office, court, commission, board, institution, department, agent, or employee of the state, of a county, or of any other political subdivision may purchase or rent required equipment for any such photographic process and may enter into contracts with private concerns or other governmental agencies for the development of film and the making of reproductions of film as a part of any such photographic process. When so recorded, or copied or reproduced to reduce space required for storage or filing of such records, such photographs, microphotographs, microfilms, perforated tape, magnetic tape, other magnetic means, electronic data processing, machine readable means, graphic or video display, or combination of these processes, means, or displays, or films, or prints made therefrom, when properly identified by the officer by whom or under whose supervision they were made, or who has their custody, <em>have the same effect at law as the original record or of a record made by any other legally authorized means, and may be offered in like manner and shall be received in evidence in any court </em>where the original record, or record made by other legally authorized means, could have been so introduced and received. Certified or authenticated copies or prints of such photographs, microphotographs, films, microfilms, perforated tape, magnetic tape, other magnetic means, electronic data processing, machine readable means, graphic or video display, or combination of these processes, means, or displays, shall be admitted in evidence equally with the original.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">{\u00b6 56} The fiscal officer\u2019s contention lacks merit. He relies on the sentence specifying that copies shall have \u201cthe same effect at law\u201d as the original record. But R.C. 9.01 merely provides that a copy of a recorded document shall \u201chave the same effect at law as the original record or of a record made by any other legally authorized means, and may be offered in like manner and shall be received in evidence in any court where the original record, or record made by other legally authorized means, could have been so introduced and received.\u201d The manifest meaning of this provision is that copies of recorded documents have the same substantive legal effect as the original recorded document regardless of the medium in which the copy is made. This provision does not cover the price a county recorder may charge for an electronic copy of a recorded instrument.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">{\u00b6 57} The fiscal officer relies on a 1933 attorney general opinion to support his interpretation of R.C. 9.01 and 317.32(I). 1933 Ohio Atty.Gen.Ops. No. 167. But <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>\u201cAttorney General opinions are not binding on courts; at best, they are persuasive authority.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Van Dyke v. Pub. Emps. Retirement Bd., </em>99 Ohio St.3d 430, 2003-Ohio-4123, 793 N.E.2d 438, \u00b6 40. In the opinion, the attorney general ruled that the photostatic or photographic process authorized by G.C. 32-1, a predecessor statute to R.C. 9.01, was included in the term \u201cprinting\u201d as used in G.C. 2778, a predecessor statute to R.C. 317.32. That opinion, however, recognized that the common dictionary definition of \u201cprinting\u201d in G.C. 2778 included the photostatic or photographic process. <em>Id. </em>at 196. By contrast, the definition of \u201cphotocopying\u201d in R.C. 317.32(I) does not include electronically copying documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">{\u00b6 58} In addition, the opinion addressed the fee charged for recording documents and not the fee for copying recorded documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">{\u00b6 59} Further, the sentence in R.C. 9.01 that confers the \u201csame effect at law\u201d and that the fiscal officer relies on was not included in the version of G.C. 32-1 construed by the attorney general in 1933 Ohio Atty.Gen.Ops. No. 167. 113 Ohio Laws 773.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">{\u00b6 60} In fact, in more recent opinions, the attorney general has not cited 1933 Ohio Atty.Gen.Ops. No. 167 and has instead adopted a strict construction of when the R.C. 317.32(I) fee of $2 per page for photocopying a recorded document is applicable. 2004 Ohio Atty.Gen.Ops. No. 2004-033, syllabus (\u201cA county recorder who makes available in her office a photocopying machine for use by the public may not charge the two dollar per page fee set forth in R.C. 317.32(1) where the photocopier is operated by the public without the assistance of the recorder or her staff. The recorder is, instead, subject to R.C. 149.43(B), which requires a public office to provide copies of public records \u2018at cost\u2019 \u201d); 2004 Ohio Atty.Gen. Ops. No. 2004-011, paragraph one of the syllabus (\u201cR.C.317.32(I) does not require or authorize a county recorder to impose the fees described therein upon a member of the public who is using a digital camera or other equipment to make copies of documents in the recorder\u2019s office, where the equipment is not provided by the county recorder. R.C. 149.43 requires a county recorder to make the public records he maintains available for inspection, without charge, to members of the public, including those that bring their own equipment to make copies of the records they inspect\u201d); 2000 Ohio Atty.Gen.Ops. No. 2000-046, paragraph three of the syllabus (\u201cA county recorder may not charge and collect the fee prescribed by R.C. 317.32(1) for photocopying a document when a person accesses an indexed public record by way of the Internet and prints a copy of the record on a computer printer that the recorder neither operates nor maintains\u201d); 1994 Ohio Atty.Gen.Ops. No. 94-006, paragraph three of the syllabus (\u201cIf a person requests copies of public records stored by the county recorder on microfiche or film, R.C. 149.43(B) requires the county recorder to make available in the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>medium a copy of the portions of the microfiche or film containing those public records, * * * if the person assumes the expense of making a copy in that medium, in lieu of the photocopying fee prescribed by R.C. [317.32(I)]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">{\u00b6 61} Finally, this result is consistent with the practice of most county recorders\u2019 offices in Ohio. In March and April 2011, a witness for relators asked each of the remaining 87 county recorders\u2019 offices to provide him with a CD containing copies of instruments recorded on August 25, 2010. Sixty of those counties complied with the requests, and they charged him fees ranging from $1 to $20 per compact disc. Only one county requested that he pay $2 per page for paper copies of the requested records. Cuyahoga County thus appears to be an outlier in requiring the $2 per page fee for electronic records of recorded instruments.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">{\u00b6 62} Therefore, relators are entitled to copies of the requested electronically recorded documents for July and August 2010 at actual cost rather than the fee of $2 per page in R.C. 317.32(I) for photocopies. Because relators claim that the actual cost is no more than $1 per CD, and the fiscal officer did not submit evidence establishing a different actual cost, relators are entitled to the requested records at that cost.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">\n<em>Electronic Copies of Master CDs</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">{\u00b6 63} Insofar as relators now claim that they are entitled to copies of the recorder\u2019s office\u2019s master CDs of the instruments recorded in July and August 2010, \u201c \u2018it is the responsibility of the person who wishes to inspect and/or copy records to identify with reasonable clarity the records at issue.\u2019 \u201d <em>State ex rel.

In addition, \u201c \u2018R.C. 149.43(C) requires a prior request as a prerequisite to a mandamus action.\u2019 \u201d <em>Am. Civ.

Instead, relators requested electronic copies of all documents publicly recorded in the office for those months. After relators filed an amended complaint, they informed the fiscal officer that copies of the master CDs would satisfy their record requests. But relators never amended their amended complaint to include a request for copies of the master CDs, and the fiscal officer has not consented to a modification of relators\u2019 records requests or the relief prayed for in relators\u2019 amended complaint. Therefore, the fiscal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>officer need not provide copies of the master CDs to comply with the relators\u2019 requests at issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">{\u00b6 65} Nevertheless, the fiscal officer could now comply with the requests by providing copies of the master CDs for July and August 2010, which also constitute records subject to the Public Records Act. <em>See </em>R.C. 149.011(G); <em>State ex rel. Margolius v. Cleveland, </em>62 Ohio St.3d 456, 459, 584 N.E.2d 665 (1992) (\u201ca compilation of information gathered from public records is a separate public record subject to disclosure under R.C. 149.43\u201d), citing <em>State ex rel. Cincinnati Post v. Schweikert, </em>38 Ohio St.3d 170, 527 N.E.2d 1230 (1988). The master CDs document the daily procedure and operation of the recorder\u2019s office of making backup copies of digital images of all instruments recorded every day on compact discs. And notwithstanding the fiscal officer\u2019s assertion, he has not established that the master CDs constitute security records, as defined in R.C. 149.433(A)(3), which would be exempt from disclosure. <em>See </em>R.C. 149.433(B); <em>see generally State ex rel.

Cuyahoga County adopted a new public-records policy in January 2011, which the fiscal officer claims superseded the recorder\u2019s office\u2019s policy that relators contest here. Relators do not claim otherwise. Because the policy adopted by the Cuyahoga County Council in 2011 does not have the same defect regarding the charge for electronic copies that was contained in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>recorder\u2019s office policy they contested, relators are not entitled to a writ of mandamus to compel the fiscal officer to amend a policy that, evidently, no longer exists.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AaB\">Baker &amp; Hostetler, L.L.P., David Marburger, Michael Mumford, and John Blanton, for relators.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">\n<em>Attorney Fees and Statutory Damages</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">{\u00b6 69} Relators request an award of attorney fees and statutory damages.

Because the county\u2019s existing public-records policy does not violate the requirement to charge the actual cost of these records, however, we deny the writ of mandamus insofar as it seeks to amend a policy that is no- longer effective.
