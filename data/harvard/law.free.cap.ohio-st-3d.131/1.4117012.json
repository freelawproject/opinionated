Special Prosecutors v. Judges, Court of Common Pleas </em>(1978), 55 Ohio St.2d 94, 9 O.O.3d 88, 378 N.E.2d 162. We hold that the trial court would have had jurisdiction over Davis\u2019s motion for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence and that the appellate court had jurisdiction to entertain the appeal of the denial of the motion for a new trial. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the appellate court, and we remand this case to the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">I. Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">{\u00b6 2} A jury convicted Roland Davis of aggravated murder, murder, kidnapping, aggravated burglary, and aggravated robbery in 2005 in connection with the murder of 86-year-old Elizabeth Sheeler in her Newark, Ohio apartment, despite Davis\u2019s contention that the perpetrator was his brother. Davis was sentenced to death, and this court affirmed his convictions and death sentence. <em>State v. Davis, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 404, 2008-Ohio-2, 880 N.E.2d 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">{\u00b6 3} On January 14, 2008, the trial court dismissed Davis\u2019s petition for postconviction relief without an evidentiary hearing. The court of appeals affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment. 5th Dist. No. 2008-CA-16, 2008-Ohio-6841, 2008 WL 5381695. We declined jurisdiction over his appeal. 122 Ohio St.3d 1409, 2009-Ohio-2751, 907 N.E.2d 1193.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">{\u00b6 4} On October 31, 2008, Davis filed a motion for leave to file a motion for a new trial based upon newly discovered evidence. Davis alleged that he was unavoidably prevented from discovering and producing the evidence at trial or within 120 days of the verdict, as set forth in Crim.R. 33(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-9\">{\u00b6 5} The newly discovered evidence was the affidavit of a DNA expert, Dr. Laurence Mueller, a professor in the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Department at the University of California, Irvine. Mueller stated that he had reviewed the state\u2019s DNA reports and tests, the testimony of the state\u2019s DNA experts, and other DNA evidence in the Davis case. In his affidavit, Mueller concluded \u201cwith a reasonable degree of scientific certainty that the DNA evidence recited in these reports and the testimony presented\u201d at trial was questionable for four reasons: (1) the state\u2019s DNA experts failed to account for the database \u201chit\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in the statistical analysis of the DNA test results, (2) there is no mention of laboratory error as a source of uncertainty in DNA profiling, (3) Meghan Clement, one of the state\u2019s DNA experts, incorrectly testified that it was impossible for nonidenti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>cal twins to have the same DNA, and (4) the state\u2019s experts overstated the value of the DNA evidence found on the bed sheets in the victim\u2019s bedroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">{\u00b6 6} In his motion for a new trial, Davis argued that Mueller\u2019s affidavit undermined the state\u2019s DNA evidence, which was essential to its case against him. Davis argued that the affidavit demonstrated that trial counsel were ineffective by failing to mount an effective challenge to the state\u2019s DNA evidence. Davis also asserted that based on this new evidence, he \u201cmay be actually innocent of this capital offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">{\u00b6 7} The trial court denied Davis\u2019s motion. The court found that Davis\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel did not demonstrate that he was unavoidably prevented from procuring Dr. Mueller\u2019s testimony within 120 days after the trial. The trial court also found that Davis failed to demonstrate that \u201cbut for trial error \u2014 the unavailability of Dr. Mueller\u2019s testimony \u2014 no reasonable factfinder would have found him guilty.\u201d The court stated, \u201cNothing in Dr. Mueller\u2019s testimony suggests that Roland Davis can be conclusively excluded as the source of the DNA evidence. Neither does Dr. Mueller\u2019s affidavit suggest that the DNA conclusively matches that of defendant\u2019s brother.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">{\u00b6 8} On appeal, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth District held that the trial court did not err because the trial court lacked jurisdiction to act on a motion for a new trial. The court relied upon <em>Special Prosecutors, </em>55 Ohio St.2d 94, 9 O.O.3d 88, 378 N.E.2d 162, in holding that \u201cthe trial court\u2019s granting of Appellant\u2019s motion for new trial would be inconsistent with the judgment of the Ohio Supreme Court, affirming Appellant\u2019s convictions and sentence.\u201d <em>State v. Davis, </em>5th Dist. No. 09-CA-0019, 2009-Ohio-5175, 2009 WL 3119881, \u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">{\u00b6 9} We accepted Davis\u2019s discretionary appeal on January 27, 2010, on one of two propositions of law presented: \u201cWhen the issue to be decided by the trial court does not fall within the judgment on appeal, the trial court retains jurisdiction to decide the motion before it. Further, to meet due process, a trial court must be able to consider a motion for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence even after an appeal has been taken. U.S. Const. amend. XIV.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">{\u00b6 10} We later ordered the parties to address \u201c[wjhether the court of appeals had jurisdiction to consider the trial court\u2019s denial of Davis\u2019 motion for new trial based on newly discovered evidence under Section 2(B)(2)(c) and Section 3(B)(2), Article IV of the Ohio Constitution.\u201d 127 Ohio St.3d 1483, 2010-Ohio-6371, 939 N.E.2d 182.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-9\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b183-10\">A. The Court of Appeals\u2019 Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b183-11\">{\u00b6 11} We will first address the question on which we ordered briefing, that is, whether the court of appeals had jurisdiction to consider Davis\u2019s appeal of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>trial court\u2019s denial of his motion for a new trial in his death-penalty case. Subject-matter jurisdiction cannot be waived and is properly raised by this court sua sponte. <em>State v. Lomax, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 318, 2002-Ohio-4453, 774 N.E.2d 249, \u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">{\u00b6 12} On November 8, 1994, Ohio voters approved an amendment to the Ohio Constitution to provide this court with direct appellate review of death-penalty cases. Section 2(B)(2)(c), Article IV, Ohio Constitution. Before the amendment, the Ohio Constitution granted jurisdiction to courts of appeals over appeals from a death sentence. Capital defendants were entitled to file an appeal as of right first to the court of appeals and then to file a second appeal as of right to the Ohio Supreme Court. The amendment eliminated direct review by the courts of appeals for all defendants sentenced to death for a crime that occurred on or after January 1, 1995. Section 3(B)(2), Article IV, Ohio Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">{\u00b6 13} Section 2(B)(2)(c), Article IV of the Ohio Constitution provides: \u201cThe supreme court shall have appellate jurisdiction as follows: * * * In direct appeals from the courts of common pleas or other courts of record inferior to the court of appeals as a matter of right <em>in cases </em>in which the death penalty has been imposed.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Section 3(B)(2), Article IV of the Ohio Constitution, however, provides: \u201cCourts of appeals shall have such jurisdiction as may be provided by law to review and affirm, modify, or reverse judgments or final orders of the courts of record inferior to the court of appeals within the district, except that courts of appeals <em>shall not have jurisdiction to review on direct appeal a judgment </em>that imposes a sentence of death.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">{\u00b6 14} The General Assembly then amended R.C. 2953.02 to provide: \u201cIn a capital case in which a sentence of death is imposed for an offense committed on or after January 1, 1995, <em>the judgment or final order </em>may be appealed from the trial court directly to the supreme court as a matter of right.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">{\u00b6 15} The foregoing language limits the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court to the appeal of a judgment sentencing a defendant to death.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">{\u00b6 16} We upheld the constitutionality of the amendments changing appellate review of death-penalty cases in <em>State v. Smith </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 89, 104, 684 N.E.2d 668: \u201c[T]he plain language of the amendments speaks of \u2018cases in which the death penalty has been imposed\u2019 and \u2018judgment that imposes the sentence of death.\u2019 * * * Section 2(B)(2)(c), Article IV and Section 3(B)(2), Article IV, Ohio Constitution. Thus the Supreme Court has jurisdiction over the whole case, instead of counts, charges, or sentences.\u201d (Emphasis deleted.) We did not, however, address postconviction motions in that opinion. We must now determine whether the constitutional requirement that we review all direct appeals of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>cases in which the death penalty was imposed includes review of appeals from a trial court\u2019s order denying a defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">{\u00b6 17} Davis argues that the wording of the amendments is critical. According to him, the court of appeals lost jurisdiction over only those appeals taken from the judgment that imposed a sentence of death. He asserts that the court of appeals has jurisdiction to consider appeals from all other postjudgment motions. Accordingly, Davis contends that the court of appeals properly ruled on his appeal from the trial court\u2019s judgment denying his motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">{\u00b6 18} The state points out that Davis fails to address the language of Section 2(B)(2)(c), Article IV of the Ohio Constitution in his argument. The state argues that every judgment in a case in which the death penalty was imposed must be appealed directly to the Supreme Court of Ohio. In support of this argument, the state asserts that Sections 2(B)(2)(c) and 3(B)(2), Article IV of the Ohio Constitution should be read in pari materia See <em>State ex rel. Toledo v. Lucas Cty. Bd. of Elections </em>(2002), 95 Ohio St.3d 73, 78, 765 N.E.2d 854, quoting <em>Toledo Edison Co. v. Bryan </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 288, 292, 737 N.E.2d 529 (\u201c \u2018Where provisions of the Constitution address the same subject matter, they must be read <em>in pari materia </em>and harmonized if possible\u2019 \u201d). Thus, the state argues, if the two sections appear to be ambiguous when read together, this court must \u201cmake every effort to resolve this dilemma in a way that will preserve the amendment[s], and give [them] that effect which [it] concluded] was the desire of the electorate at the time of its adoption.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Rhodes v. Broum </em>(1973), 34 Ohio St.2d 101, 103, 63 O.O.2d 189, 296 N.E.2d 538.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">{\u00b6 19} The purpose of Sections 2(B)(2)(c) and 3(B)(2), Article IV, Ohio Constitution, was to alleviate the general public\u2019s dissatisfaction with the delays in enforcing the death penalty by eliminating the intermediate appellate review of those cases. See <em>Smith, </em>80 Ohio St.3d at 100, 684 N.E.2d 668. However, as we noted in <em>Smith, </em>\u201cthe state has taken other steps to expedite the resolution of criminal cases, including capital cases, such as limiting the time within which to file postconviction petitions.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-9\">{\u00b6 20} Courts of appeals have routinely ruled on appeals of judgments denying motions for new trials in cases in which a defendant was convicted of a murder that occurred after July 1, 1995, and in which a death penalty was imposed. <em>State v. Stojetz, </em>12th Dist. No. CA2002-04-006, 2002-Ohio-6520, 2002 WL 31682231; <em>State v. Lindsey, </em>12th Dist. No. CA2003-07-010, 2004-Ohio-4407, 2004 WL 1877734; <em>State v. Jackson, </em>190 Ohio App.3d 319, 2010-Ohio-5054, 941 N.E.2d 1221; <em>State v. Bethel, </em>10th Dist. No. 09AP-924, 2010-Ohio-3837, 2010 WL 3239480.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-10\">{\u00b6 21} The Trumbull County Court of Appeals appears to have been the only court to address the jurisdictional issue in the context of a motion for a new trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>in a capital case. <em>State v. Jackson </em>(May 13, 2010), 11th Dist. No. 2009-T-0050. In <em>Jackson, </em>the state filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that the court of appeals did not have the authority to entertain the appeal because a decision denying a new trial in a death-penalty case can be appealed only to the Supreme Court. The court of appeals ruled on the motion before conducting oral argument. The court concluded: \u201c[Section 3(B)(2), Article IV, Ohio Constitution] refers expressly to a specific judgment that a court of appeals does not have the authority to review; i.e., the final sentencing judgment which sets forth the order regarding the imposition of the death penalty. Given the narrowness of the jurisdictional exception in Section 3(B)(2), logic dictates that the provision was not intended to totally deprive a court of appeals of all authority to review a final judgment stemming from a case in which the death penalty was imposed. Rather the wording of Section 3(B)(2) supports the conclusion that an appellate court has the jurisdiction to review final judgments rendered in such a proceeding, except for the entry containing the weighing exercise which leads to the imposition of the \u2018death\u2019 sentence.\u201d <em>Jackson </em>at 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">{\u00b6 22} We agree. A holding that the Supreme Court has exclusive jurisdiction over <em>all matters </em>relating to a death-penalty case would be contrary to the language of the constitutional amendments and the statute and would have the effect of delaying the review of future cases, a scenario that the voters expressly rejected in passing the constitutional amendments.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We see no reason why the courts of appeals may not currently entertain all appeals from the denial of postjudgment motions in which the death penalty was previously imposed. We now hold that pursuant to Sections 2(B)(2)(c) and 3(B)(2), Article IV of the Ohio Constitution, a court of appeals has jurisdiction to consider a trial court\u2019s denial of a motion for leave to file a motion for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence in a case in which the death penalty was previously imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">B. The Trial Court\u2019s Jurisdiction over the Motion for a New Trial</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">{\u00b6 23} Having resolved the issue of the court of appeals\u2019 jurisdiction over Davis\u2019s motion for a new trial, we now turn to the issue of the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction. As stated earlier, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth District, citing <em>Special Prosecutors, 55 </em>Ohio St.2d 94, 9 O.O.3d 88, 378 N.E.2d 162, held that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to act on Davis\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">{\u00b6 24} Crim.R. 33(B) sets forth the grounds on which the trial court may grant a motion for a new trial. The rule states:</p>\n<p id=\"b187-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>{\u00b6 25} \u201cApplication for a new trial shall be made by motion which, except for the cause of newly discovered evidence, shall be filed within fourteen days after the verdict was rendered, or the decision of the court where a trial by jury has been waived, unless it is made to appear by clear and convincing proof that the defendant was unavoidably prevented from filing his motion for a new trial, in which ease the motion shall be filed within seven days from the order of the court finding that the defendant was unavoidably prevented from filing such motion within the time provided herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">{\u00b6 26} \u201cMotions for new trial on account of newly discovered evidence shall be filed within one hundred twenty days after the day upon which the verdict was rendered, or the decision of the court where trial by jury has been waived. If it is made to appear by clear and convincing proof that the defendant was unavoidably prevented from the discovery of the evidence upon which he must rely, such motion shall be filed within seven days from an order of the court finding that he was unavoidably prevented from discovering the evidence within the one hundred twenty day period.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">{\u00b6 27} Crim.R. 33 does not otherwise limit the time for filing a motion for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence. The court of appeals in this case, relying on <em>Special Prosecutors, </em>held that the trial court did not have jurisdiction to entertain Davis\u2019s motion for a new trial after his conviction had been affirmed on appeal. 2009-Ohio-5175, 2009 WL 3119881, at \u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">{\u00b6 28} In <em>Special Prosecutors, </em>55 Ohio St.2d 94, 9 O.O.3d 88, 378 N.E.2d 162, the trial court granted a defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw a guilty plea after a conviction and sentence based on the plea had been affirmed on appeal. After a trial date had been set, we granted a writ of prohibition to prevent the trial from proceeding. This court stated, \u201c[T]he trial court\u2019s granting of the motion to withdraw the guilty plea and the order to proceed with a new trial were inconsistent with the judgment of the Court of Appeals affirming the trial court\u2019s conviction premised upon the guilty plea. The judgment of the reviewing court is controlling upon the lower court as to all matters within the compass of the judgment. Accordingly, we find that the trial court lost its jurisdiction when the appeal was taken, and, absent a remand, it did not regain jurisdiction subsequent to the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision.\u201d Id. at 97.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">{\u00b6 29} We addressed a similar issue in <em>State ex rel. Cordray v. Marshall, </em>123 Ohio St.3d 229, 2009-Ohio-4986, 915 N.E.2d 633. In that case, the defendant claimed in his appeal of a conviction for murder that the trial court had erred by failing to instruct the jury on a lesser included offense. The court of appeals rejected this claim and affirmed his conviction. Id. at \u00b6 3. Several years later, the defendant filed a motion for relief from judgment and raised the same claims that had been rejected in his appeal. Citing the law-of-the-case doctrine, we held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>that the trial court did not have jurisdiction to grant a posttrial motion that raised the same issues that had previously been rejected on appeal. Id. at \u00b6 27-28, 42.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">{\u00b6 30} The law-of-the-case doctrine holds that \u201cthe decision of a reviewing court in a case remains the law of that case <em>on the legal questions involved </em>for all subsequent proceedings in the case at both the trial and reviewing levels.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Nolan v. Nolan </em>(1984), 11 Ohio St.3d 1, 3, 11 OBR 1, 462 N.E.2d 410. This doctrine prevents a litigant from relying on arguments at retrial that were fully litigated, or could have been fully litigated, in a first appeal. See <em>Hubbard ex rel. Creed v. Sauline </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 402, 404-405, 659 N.E.2d 781.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">{\u00b6 31} Davis argues that under this doctrine, the trial court should have been permitted to rule on his motion for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence because a reviewing court had never considered Dr. Mueller\u2019s affidavit during previous appeals. Davis asserts that there would not have been a conflict between the trial court\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction over the motion for a new trial and the appellate courts\u2019 affirmances of his conviction and of the denial of postconviction relief because the issue to be decided was not \u201cwithin the compass\u201d of the appellate courts\u2019 judgments. See <em>Special Prosecutors, </em>55 Ohio St.2d at 97, 9 O.O.3d 88, 378 N.E.2d 162.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">{\u00b6 32} Several Ohio courts of appeals have permitted trial courts to consider motions for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence after judgments of conviction had been affirmed on appeal. See <em>State v. Gaines, </em>1st Dist. No. C-090097, 2010-Ohio-895, 2010 WL 877549, \u00b6 36 (the trial court abused its discretion in deciding defendant\u2019s new-trial motion without an evidentiary hearing); <em>State v. </em>Rossi, 2d Dist. No. 23682, 2010-Ohio-4534, 2010 WL 3722611 (due process requires that a motion for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence must, at some point, be considered on the merits); and <em>State v. Franklin, </em>7th Dist. No. 09 MA 96, 2010-Ohio-4317, 2010 WL 3554109 <em>(Special Prosecutors </em>does not provide grounds for denying motion for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">{\u00b6 33} In his motion, Davis argued that his counsel were ineffective for failing to present a DNA expert at trial to refute the testimony of the state\u2019s expert witness. The state points out that Davis raised the same issue on direct appeal when he claimed that his counsel were ineffective by stipulating to evidence establishing the admissibility of DNA evidence. See <em>Davis, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 404, 2008-Ohio-2, 880 N.E.2d 31, \u00b6 344.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-9\">{\u00b6 34} Contrary to the state\u2019s argument, the earlier claim is not related to Davis\u2019s present claim that newly discovered evidence (Mueller\u2019s affidavit) warrants a new trial. Indeed, this issue could not have been raised on direct appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>and decided by this court, because it rests upon evidence not considered by the trial court \u2014 an affidavit by a qualified DNA expert. A reviewing court on direct appeal could not have considered an affidavit that was not part of the record. <em>State v. Ishmail </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 402, 406, 8 O.O.3d 405, 377 N.E.2d 500 (a reviewing court is limited to the record made of the proceedings in the trial court).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">{\u00b6 35} The state also claims that <em>Special Prosecutors </em>is only a conditional bar on the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction to consider Davis\u2019s motion for a new trial, for we held there that \u201cthe trial court lost its jurisdiction when the appeal was taken, and, <em>absent a remand, </em>it did not regain jurisdiction subsequent to the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 55 Ohio St.2d at 97, 9 O.O.3d 88, 378 N.E.2d 162. Thus, the state argues that Davis has a remedy by filing a motion with <em>this </em>court showing that his motion for a new trial has merit and then seeking a remand of his case to the trial court, which would then consider the new-trial motion. The state maintains that this court is in the best position to determine what issues were addressed in its previous judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">{\u00b6 36} The state\u2019s suggested remedy is cumbersome. The trial court is better equipped than this court is to consider testimony and other evidence matters alleged to be newly discovered. The trial court is also capable of deciding whether Dr. Mueller\u2019s affidavit involved matters \u201cwithin the compass\u201d of this court\u2019s previous decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">{\u00b6 37} We did not decide <em>Special Prosecutors </em>based on the law-of-the-ease doctrine. However, that doctrine would not prevent the trial court from considering the effect of previous decisions on Davis\u2019s newly-discovered-evidence claim. We take this opportunity to specify that the holding in <em>Special Prosecutors </em>does not bar the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction over posttrial motions permitted by the Ohio Rules of Criminal Procedure. These motions provide a safety net for defendants who have reasonable grounds to challenge their convictions and sentences. The trial court acts as the gatekeeper for these motions and, using its discretion, can limit the litigation to viable claims only. In light of the foregoing, we hold that a trial court retains jurisdiction to decide a motion for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence when the specific issue has not been decided upon direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-9\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b189-10\">{\u00b6 38} We hold that pursuant to Sections 2(B)(2)(c) and 3(B)(2), Article IV of the Ohio Constitution, a court of appeals has jurisdiction in a case in which a death penalty has been imposed to consider the trial court\u2019s denial of a motion for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b190-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>Kenneth W.
