Insofar as Hayes sought to compel Judge Winkler to rule on his motions, the judge has already done so. Mandamus will not compel a judge to rule on motions that the judge has already ruled on. <em>State ex rel. Womack v. Marsh, </em>128 Ohio St.3d 303, 2011-Ohio-229, 943 N.E.2d 1010, \u00b6 10. And as for Hayes\u2019s claim that he could not appeal the rulings because the clerk never served notice of the judgments on him, he had adequate remedies in the ordinary course of law by delayed appeal and motion for relief from judgment to raise his claim. <em>State ex rel. McKinney v. Defiance Cty.
