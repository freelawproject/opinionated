As the court of appeals held, Nickelson previously unsuccessfully raised his claim of unreasonable delay in his sentencing in his direct appeal, <em>State v. Nickelson, </em>4th Dist. No. 09CA8, 2009-Ohio-7006, 2009 WL 5175204, \u00b6 11-12, and res judicata bars Nickelson from using habeas corpus to obtain a successive appellate review of the claim. <em>Shie v. Smith, </em>123 Ohio St.3d 89, 2009-Ohio-4079, 914 N.E.2d 369, \u00b6 2. Moreover, because Nickelson either raised or could have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>raised his claim in a previous habeas corpus case, <em>Nickelson v. Knab, </em>128 Ohio St.3d 1423, 2011-Ohio-1049, 943 N.E.2d 570, res judicata also bars him from filing a successive habeas corpus petition. <em>Hazel v. Knab, </em>130 Ohio St.3d 22, 2011-Ohio-4608, 955 N.E.2d 378, \u00b6 2.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A0W\">LeShawn Nickelson, pro se.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b380-11\">Michael DeWine, Attorney General, and Morgan A. Linn, Assistant Attorney General, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">{\u00b6 2} We also deny Nickelson\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Civ.R. 56, which governs motions for summary judgment, is inapplicable to cases in this court. <em>See State v. McGettrick, </em>31 Ohio St.3d 138, 141, 509 N.E.2d 378 (1987), fn. 5 (\u201cUnder ordinary circumstances, neither the Ohio Rules of Criminal Procedure nor the Ohio Rules of Civil Procedure are applicable to cases on appeal\u201d); <em>State ex rel. Physicians Commt. for Responsible Medicine v. Ohio State Univ. Bd. of Trustees, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 288, 2006-Ohio-903, 843 N.E.2d 174, \u00b6 17 (\u201cThe Rules of Practice that govern original actions filed in this court do not permit parties to file motions for summary judgment\u201d). And notwithstanding Nickelson\u2019s claim to the contrary, appellee did file a timely merit brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">{\u00b6 3} Further, we deny Nickelson\u2019s request for oral argument because the parties\u2019 briefs are sufficient for the court to decide this appeal. <em>State ex rel. Tindira v. Ohio Police &amp; Fire Pension Fund, </em>130 Ohio St.3d 62, 2011-Ohio-4677, 955 N.E.2d 963, \u00b6 55.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">{\u00b6 4} Finally, we deny Nickelson\u2019s motion to strike appellee\u2019s merit brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b380-9\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, Cupp, and McGee Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
