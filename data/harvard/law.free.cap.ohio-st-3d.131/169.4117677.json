Varnau, be entitled to the office. Because the court of appeals did not err in denying the writ or in denying an award of attorney fees to Wenninger, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-12\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b349-13\">{\u00b6 2} Wenninger has been the Brown County sheriff since January 2001, having won elections in 2000, 2004, and 2008. The board of elections certified that he had met the applicable qualifications to be a sheriffs candidate for each of the elections.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-14\">{\u00b6 3} In 2004, a protest was lodged against Wenninger\u2019s candidacy for sheriff, but it was withdrawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-15\">{\u00b6 4} In 2008, Varnau, an independent candidate for sheriff, filed a protest against Wenninger\u2019s candidacy for sheriff. The board of elections denied the protest because, among other reasons, it was not \u201cfiled by a member of the appropriate party.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b350-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>{\u00b6 5} Varnau then sought a writ of mandamus to compel the board of elections to accept as valid the protest he had filed against Wenninger\u2019s candidacy. The Brown County Court of Common Pleas dismissed the mandamus action because, among other reasons, \u201cthe extraordinary remedy of mandamus is not appropriate in that there is a legal remedy at law through a quo warranto action,\u201d and Varnau\u2019s protest was not \u201cfiled by a \u2018qualified elector who is a member of the same political party as the candidate and who is eligible to vote at the primary election for the candidate whose declaration of candidacy the elector objects to,\u2019 pursuant to R.C. 3513.05.\u201d The court of appeals affirmed the dismissal, finding: \u201cShould Wenninger be elected and take office, [Varnau] has other legal remedies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">{\u00b6 6} In February 2009, following the election victory by Wenninger, Varnau filed a complaint in the court of appeals for a writ of quo warranto to oust Wenninger from the office of sheriff and to place Varnau in that office. Varnau claimed that because he was the only lawful sheriffs candidate at the November 2008 election, he is entitled to the office. Wenninger moved to dismiss the complaint and attached his affidavit to the motion. The court of appeals converted the motion for dismissal to a motion for summary judgment, Varnau moved for summary judgment, and the parties submitted evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">{\u00b6 7} On August 16, 2010, the court of appeals granted Wenninger\u2019s motion for summary judgment and denied the writ. <em>State ex rel. Varnau v. Wenninger, </em>Brown App. No. CA2009-02-010, 2010-0hio-3813, 2010 WL 3212016.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">{\u00b6 8} On appeal, we held that the court of appeals erred in holding that the previous administrative determinations of the board of elections precluded the quo warranto action, and we remanded the cause to the court of appeals for further proceedings. <em>State ex rel. Varnau v. Wenninger, </em>128 Ohio St.3d 361, 2011-Ohio-759, 944 N.E.2d 663.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">{\u00b6 9} On remand, the court of appeals denied Varnau\u2019s motion for summary judgment, granted Wenninger\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and denied the writ of quo warranto. The court of appeals taxed the costs of the proceedings to Varnau, but it did not award Wenninger attorney fees as part of the costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">{\u00b6 10} This cause is now before the court upon Varnau\u2019s appeal and Wenninger\u2019s cross-appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-9\">Legal Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b350-10\">Varnau\u2019s Appeal: Quo Warranto</p>\n<p id=\"b350-11\">{\u00b6 11} In his appeal as of right, Varnau asserts that the court of appeals erred in denying the writ of quo warranto.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>{\u00b6 12} \u201cTo be entitled to the writ of quo warranto, the relator must establish that the office is being unlawfully held and exercised by respondent and that relator is entitled to the office.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Zeigler v. Zumbar, </em>129 Ohio St.3d 240, 2011-Ohio-2939, 951 N.E.2d 405, \u00b6 23. Moreover, \u201c[i]f a relator in a <em>quo warranto </em>proceeding fails to establish entitlement to the office, judgment may still be rendered on the issue of whether respondent lawfully holds the disputed office.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Myers v. Brown </em>(2000), 87 Ohio St.3d 545, 547, 721 N.E.2d 1053.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">{\u00b6 13} Varnau asserts that Wenninger is not entitled to the office of sheriff, because when he was elected in 2000 and took office for his first four-year term in January 2001, Wenninger did not meet the supervisory-experience requirement or the postsecondary-education requirement of R.C. 311.01(B)(9), and this deficiency resulted in Wenninger\u2019s having a break in service that invalidated his peace-officer certificate of training and led to Wenninger\u2019s not meeting the qualifications for sheriff under R.C. 311.01(B)(8) starting in January 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">{\u00b6 14} We disagree. As the court of appeals correctly concluded, \u201cany challenge to Wenninger\u2019s qualifications to run for or hold the office of sheriff for the 2000 and 2004 election terms has been rendered moot as those office terms have already expired,\u201d and \u201cVarnau cannot seek to invalidate Wenninger\u2019s present term of office based on an alleged prior disqualification from an expired term of office.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Varnau v. Wenninger, </em>Brown App. No. CA 2009-02-010, 2011-Ohio-3904, 2011 WL 3433024, at \u00b6 38, 44. Wenninger raised defenses of mootness and laches in his motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">{\u00b6 15} A quo warranto claim must be timely directed to challenge a current term of office rather than an expired one. See <em>Zeigler, </em>129 Ohio St.3d 240, 2011-Ohio-2939, 951 N.E.2d 405, \u00b6 14; <em>State ex rel. Devine v. Baxter </em>(1959), 168 Ohio St. 559, 7 O.O.2d 431, 156 N.E.2d 746 (appeal from judgment denying writ of quo warranto to remove members of board of trustees of a cemetery association dismissed as moot when one-year terms to which members were elected had expired, and those members who continued to hold office as trustees did so by authority of their reelection to new terms of office); <em>State ex rel. Paluf v. Feneli </em>(1995), 100 Ohio App.3d 461, 654 N.E.2d 360 (appointee\u2019s quo warranto claim to the office of city law director was rendered moot by the expiration of the law director\u2019s term of office).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">{\u00b6 16} Similarly, in <em>State ex rel. Newell v. Jackson, </em>118 Ohio St.3d 138, 2008-Ohio-1965, 886 N.E.2d 846, \u00b6 11, we held that \u201c[t]o be entitled to a writ of quo warranto to oust a good-faith appointee, a relator must take affirmative action by either filing a quo warranto action or an injunction challenging the appointment before the appointee completes the probationary period and becomes a permanent employee.\u201d Varnau could have raised his claims by filing an action for quo <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>warranto during Wenninger\u2019s first four-year term of office beginning in January 2001 instead of waiting until Wenninger had already begun his third four-year term of office beginning in January 2009 to raise his belated claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">{\u00b6 17} This result comports with our consistent requirement in election-related eases that relators \u201cact with the utmost diligence.\u201d <em>Blankenship v. Blackwell, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 567, 2004-Ohio-5596, 817 N.E.2d 382, \u00b6 19. \u201cIf relators in election cases do not exercise the utmost diligence, laches may bar an action for extraordinary relief.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Craig v. Scioto Cty. Bd. of Elections, </em>117 Ohio St.3d 158, 2008-Ohio-706, 882 N.E.2d 435, \u00b6 11. We have previously held that extraordinary-writ actions challenging a sheriff candidate\u2019s R.C. 311.01(B)(9) qualification may be barred by laches. See <em>Campaign to Elect Larry Carver Sheriff v. Campaign to Elect Anthony Stankiewicz Sheriff, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 256, 2004-Ohio-812, 804 N.E.2d 419; <em>State ex rel. Landis v. Morrow Cty. Bd. of Elections </em>(2000), 88 Ohio St.3d 187, 724 N.E.2d 775.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">{\u00b6 18} Although Varnau\u2019s status as a nonpartisan may have precluded him from instituting a timely protest against Wenninger\u2019s candidacy in the November 2000 sheriffs race, it did not preclude him from instituting a timely quo warranto action after Wenninger took office in January 2001 to oust him from office. Varnau did not do so, and he cannot belatedly raise his claim after the first term has expired and Wenninger has subsequently been elected to second and third four-year terms as sheriff.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">{\u00b6 19} As the court of appeals observed, \u201c[t]he focus must remain on Wenninger\u2019s eligibility to run for and hold the office of sheriff for the <em>present term, </em>not for the previous terms that have already expired.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) <em>Varnau, </em>2011-Ohio-3904, 2011 WL 3433024, at \u00b6 44. For purposes of a quo warranto claim, \u201c \u2018[h]is office\u2019 means his present office under his present commission, and not an old expired term in the same office under a former election or appointment. He could not be ousted from such former term of office, because the term has expired, and he is not now in office under that term, and is not now an officer under that term.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Wilmot v. Buckley </em>(1899), 60 Ohio St. 273, 299-300, 54 N.E. 272, construing the predecessor to R.C. 2733.35, which sets forth the statute of limitations for bringing quo warranto actions; see also <em>State ex rel. Fogle v. Carlisle, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 46, 2003-Ohio-2460, 788 N.E.2d 1060, \u00b6 10 (\u201cFogle\u2019s quo warranto claim is barred by R.C. 2733.35 because he brought his action more than three years after his cause of action arose\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">{\u00b6 20} The cases that Varnau cites are inapposite. For example, in <em>State ex rel. Huron Cty. Prosecutor v. Westerhold </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 392, 650 N.E.2d 463, the quo warranto action was instituted by the prosecuting attorney to challenge the appointment of a person to a veterans service commission only a month and a half after the appointment. And in <em>Zeigler, </em>129 Ohio St.3d 240, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>2011-Ohio-2939, 951 N.E.2d 405, \u00b6 15, the relator challenged his removal from office before he was removed and filed his quo warranto action only 15 days after his ouster. No comparable prompt action was taken by Varnau to challenge Wenninger\u2019s qualifications to be a candidate for sheriff in November 2000 or to thereafter hold office.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">{\u00b6 21} Therefore, Varnau has not established that Sheriff Wenninger lacks the qualifications under R.C. 311.01(B) to hold the office of sheriff for his third four-year term, and the court of appeals properly denied the writ. By so holding, it is unnecessary to address Varnau\u2019s remaining contentions contesting the court of appeals\u2019 evidentiary rulings, because even if these contentions had merit, he would not be entitled to the requested extraordinary relief in quo warranto.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">Cross-Appeal: Attorney Fees</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">{\u00b6 22} In his cross-appeal, Wenninger asserts that the court of appeals erred in not awarding him attorney fees when he prevailed on Varnau\u2019s quo warranto claim. During the proceedings in the court of appeals, Wenninger requested that Varnau pay his attorney fees as part of the costs of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">{\u00b6 23} \u201cOhio has long adhered to the \u2018American rule\u2019 with respect to recovery of attorney fees: a prevailing party in a civil action may not recover attorney fees as a part of the costs of litigation.\u201d <em>Wilborn v. Bank One Corp., 121 </em>Ohio St.3d 546, 2009-Ohio-306, 906 N.E.2d 396, \u00b6 7. \u201cAn exception to this general rule is that attorney fees may be awarded to a prevailing party when a statute specifically authorizes it.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Doe v. Smith, </em>123 Ohio St.3d 44, 2009-Ohio-4149, 914 N.E.2d 159, \u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-9\">{\u00b6 24} Wenninger claims that R.C. 309.13 provides statutory support for awarding him attorney fees in this case. That statute provides for an award of attorney fees as part of costs if a prosecuting attorney failed to institute a civil action for the protection of public funds after a taxpayer made a written request that he do so and the taxpayer, upon securing the costs, brought such an action and prevailed:</p>\n<p id=\"b353-10\">{\u00b6 25} \u201cIf the prosecuting attorney fails, upon the written request of a taxpayer of the county, to make the application or institute the civil action contemplated in section 309.12 of the Revised Code, the taxpayer may make such application or institute such civil action in the name of the state, or, in any case wherein the prosecuting attorney is authorized to make such application, such taxpayer may bring any suit or institute any such proceedings against any county officer or person who holds or has held a county office, for misconduct in office or neglect of his duty, to recover money illegally drawn or illegally withheld from the county treasury, and to recover damages resulting from the execution of such illegal contract.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Axh\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>Thomas G. Eagle Co., L.P.A., and Thomas G. Eagle, for appellant and crossappellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b354-13\">Gary A. Rosenhoffer, L.L.C., and Gary A. Rosenhoffer; and Patrick L. Gregory, for appellee and cross-appellant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">{\u00b6 26} \u201cIf such prosecuting attorney fails upon the written request of a taxpayer of the county, to bring such suit or institute such proceedings, or if for any reason the prosecuting attorney cannot bring such action, or if he has received and unlawfully withheld moneys belonging to the county, or has received or drawn public moneys out of the county treasury which he is not lawfully entitled to demand and receive, a taxpayer, upon securing the costs, may bring such suit or institute such proceedings, in the name of the state. Such action shall be for the benefit of the county, as if brought by the prosecuting attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">{\u00b6 27} \u201cIf the court hearing such case is satisfied that such taxpayer is entitled to the relief prayed for in his petition, and judgment is ordered in his favor, he shall be allowed his costs, including a reasonable compensation to his attorney.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">{\u00b628} Wenninger is not entitled to an award of attorney fees under R.C. 309.13, because he never demanded that the prosecuting attorney institute a civil action to protect public funds pursuant to R.C. 309.12, and he never instituted any such action. In fact, Wenninger did not institute any action at all. He simply responded to the quo warranto suit instituted by Varnau.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">{\u00b6 29} Therefore, the court of appeals did not err in not awarding him attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b354-9\">{\u00b6 30} Based on the foregoing, the court of appeals did not err in denying the writ of quo warranto and in not including Wenninger\u2019s attorney fees as part of the costs of the case that Varnau was ordered to pay. Therefore, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals. We also deny Varnau\u2019s motion for oral argument because he specifies no reasons for it, and the parties\u2019 briefs are sufficient to resolve this appeal. See <em>State ex rel. Lorain v. Stewart, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 222, 2008-Ohio-4062, 893 N.E.2d 184, \u00b6 18-19.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-10\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b354-11\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, Cupp, and McGee Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
