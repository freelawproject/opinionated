They seek declaratory and injunctive relief against respondents, the four Republican members of the five-member Ohio Apportionment Board \u2014 a declaration that the apportionment plan adopted by the board is invalid because the board failed to comply with Article XI of the Ohio Constitution, which governs the decennial apportionment of districts in the General Assembly, and the Open Meetings Law, R.C. 121.22, and a prohibitory injunction preventing these board members from calling, holding, supervising, administering, or certifying any elections under their apportionment plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-11\">Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b429-12\">{\u00b6 2} Relators claim that this court has original jurisdiction over their claims pursuant to the Ohio Constitution, Article XI, Section 13, which specifies that \u201c[t]he supreme court of Ohio shall have exclusive, original jurisdiction in <em>all cases arising under this Article.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b429-13\">{\u00b6 3} Relators\u2019 open-meetings claim, however, does not arise under Article XI; instead, it arises under R.C. 121.22. Nor do relators assert that they are invoking the court\u2019s original jurisdiction under Article IV, Section 2(B)(1). Instead, they specifically deny that they are. And without the applicability of Article XI, Section 13 to relators\u2019 open-meetings claim, we lack jurisdiction over this claim for declaratory and injunctive relief. <em>See ProgressOhio.org, Inc. v. Kasich, </em>129 Ohio St.3d 449, 2011-Ohio-4101, 953 N.E.2d 329, \u00b6 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-14\">{\u00b6 4} Therefore, we lack jurisdiction over relators\u2019 open-meetings claim and dismiss it.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>Laches</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">{\u00b6 5} We also deny relators\u2019 Article XI claims based on laches insofar as they relate to the 2012 election cycle. \u201cWe have consistently required relators in election cases to act with the utmost diligence.\u201d <em>Blankenship v. Blackwell, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 567, 2004-Ohio-5596, 817 N.E.2d 382, \u00b6 19. \u201cLaches may bar an action for relief in an election-related matter if the persons seeking this relief fail to act with the requisite diligence.\u201d <em>Smith v. Scioto Cty. Bd. of Elections, </em>123 Ohio St.3d 467, 2009-Ohio-5866, 918 N.E.2d 131, \u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">{\u00b6 6} To the extent that relators\u2019 claims contest the validity of respondents\u2019 apportionment decision for the upcoming 2012 elections, laches bars their claims. Relators unreasonably delayed 96 days from the apportionment board\u2019s September 30, 2011 decennial apportionment before commencing this action on January 4, 2012, challenging the apportionment: they do not have a legitimate excuse for much of this prolonged delay, they knew or should have known of the board\u2019s apportionment plan and its alleged constitutional defects near the time it was approved by the board in late September, and their unreasonable delay has caused prejudice to boards of elections, candidates, and the public, who have all relied on respondents\u2019 apportionment plan setting the state legislative districts for the imminent 2012 elections.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">{\u00b6 7} For the remaining state legislative elections \u2014 the 2014, 2016, 2018, and 2020 elections \u2014 affected by respondents\u2019 September 30, 2011 apportionment plan, however, laches does not bar relators\u2019 claims. These elections are, unlike the 2012 elections, not imminent. This result is consistent with the principles that laches is an equitable doctrine, <em>State ex rel. Commt. for the Referendum of Lorain Ordinance No. 77-01 v. Lorain Cty. Bd. of Elections, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 308, 2002-Ohio-4194, 774 N.E.2d 239, \u00b6 35, and that \u201cthe fundamental tenet of judicial review in Ohio is that courts should decide cases on their merits,\u201d <em>State ex rel. Becker v. Eastlake, </em>93 Ohio St.3d 502, 505, 756 N.E.2d 1228 (2001). <em>See also State ex rel. Walker v. Bowling Green, </em>69 Ohio St.3d 391, 393, 632 N.E.2d 904 (1994), quoting <em>Reynolds v. Sims, </em>377 U.S. 533, 585, 84 S.Ct. 1362,12 L.Ed.2d 506 (1964) (\u201cabsent special circumstances justifying the withholding of immediate relief such as where an election is imminent, \u2018once a State\u2019s legislative apportionment scheme has been found to be unconstitutional, it would be the unusual case in which a court would be justified in not taking appropriate action to insure that no further elections are conducted under the invalid plan\u2019 \u201d); <em>Martin v. Soucie, </em>109 Ill.App.3d 731, 736, 65 Ill.Dec. 339, 441 N.E.2d 131 (1982) (six-month delay in instituting a challenge to a June 1981 apportionment plan barred relief regarding imminent 1982 elections based on laches but did not bar relief regarding future elections).</p>\n<attorneys id=\"ACm\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>Wesp/Barwell/Pierre-Louis Co., L.L.C., and Lloyd Pierre-Louis; Murray &amp; Murray Co., L.P.A., and Dennis E.
