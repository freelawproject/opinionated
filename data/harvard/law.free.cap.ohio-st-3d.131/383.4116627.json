Chatfield, for a writ of mandamus ordering appellee, Perry County Prosecuting Attorney Joseph A. Flautt, to turn over certain records to him. R.C. 149.43(B)(8) required a finding by Chatfield\u2019s sentencing judge or the judge\u2019s successor that the requested information was necessary to support what appeared to be a justiciable claim. <em>State ex rel. Barb v. Cuyahoga Cty. Jury Commr., </em>124 Ohio St.3d 238, 2010-Ohio-120, 921 N.E.2d 236. Chatfield obtained the requisite judicial finding from the Perry County Court of Common <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>Pleas, but that court specified that the Columbus Police Department, not the Perry County prosecuting attorney, would provide the records. Because Chat-field\u2019s sentencing judge did not determine that the Perry County prosecuting attorney was the person responsible for the requested public records, Chatfield was not entitled to the requested extraordinary relief.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"ABY\">James L.
