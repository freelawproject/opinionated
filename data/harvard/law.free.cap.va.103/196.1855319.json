In the case at bar, the transferree knew the note was given for a deferred payment on a lot purchased of the then holder of the note; that there was a prior lien on the lot for much more than its value, which such holder was endeavoring to get released, and that unless it was released there would be a failure of the consideration of the note, and under these circumstances acquired title to it.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b230-9\">Appeal from a decree of the Circuit Court of the city of Roanoke, pronounced in a suit in chancery, wherein the appellants were the complainants, and the apxiellee was the defendant.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"b230-10\">Reversed.</disposition>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b230-11\">The opinion states the case.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b230-12\"><em>Scott &amp; Staples, </em>for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"ADY\"><em>H.

Andrews and Stone insisted that no such release had been executed, and they were subsequently informed that the Exchange Company, in obtaining the release, had accidentally omitted the lots in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">On the 9th of July, 1894, the Exchange Company conveyed to James E. Terry, trustee, all of its property to secure its creditors; and on the 16th of March, 1895, the Fidelity Company instituted an action against Andrews and Stone upon the unpaid note for $600, claiming that they held it as endorsee for value before maturity, and without notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">The deed of the Exchange Company to&gt; Andrews and Stone, dated April 9, 1891, contains the following covenants:</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">\u201cThe said Exchange Building <em>&amp; </em>Investment Company covenants that it has the right to convey the said land to the grantee; that it has done no act to encumber the said land; that the grantee shall have quiet possession of the said land free from all encumbrances; and that it will execute such further assurance of the said land as may be requisite.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b232-9\">From these facts it appears that the position of the plaintiffs, Andrews and Stone, may be stated as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b232-10\">That they purchased certain lots which were represented as being free from encumbrance for which they took a deed from their grantors containing the covenants just recited; that they paid a part of the purchase money; that there is a balance due by them, represented by a negotiable note which had been endorsed, which is now held by the Fidelity Company as endorsee for value and before maturity; that at the time of these transactions there was a lien upon these lots in favor of Thomas Lewis; that when the note was transferred to the Fidelity Company, it was agreed and understood between the Exchange Company and the Fidelity Company that the primary lien upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>lots purchased by Andrews and Stone was to be released by Thomas Lewis, but that owing to some inadvertence or accidental omission no such release was ever executed, and that the Fidelity Company took the note with full knowledge of these facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">Upon this bill an injunction was obtained. The Exchange Company filed its answer, which is unimportant, the issues having been made upon the answer of the Fidelity Loan <em>&amp; </em>Trust Company. That answer, besides immaterial averments which we do not deem it important to consider, says: \u201cThat if there was any failure of the consideration for said note, or fraud in its procurement, it had no notice of it, and having obtained the said note prior to its maturity, without such notice, in due course of trade, its right to collect the same is unimpaired by reason of such failure or fraud as may have existed. But respondent does not believe that there has been any fraud in procurement of said note, or failure in the consideration therefor, and calls for strict proof of the same.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">It was agreed between plaintiffs and defendant that in the suit of <em>Cocke, Trustee, </em>v. <em>Lewis and others, </em>brought to enforce the lien of the deed of trust given by the Exchange Building Company to secure Thomas Lewis the deferred payments of purchase money on a tract of land known as the Exchange Building &amp; Investment Company\u2019s addition to the city of Roanoke, the lots of Stone and Andrews constituted a part of said tract, and were sold to satisfy a lien in favor of Lewis. Depositions were taken in the cause, and the Circuit Court decreed \u201cthat the Fidelity Loan &amp; Trust Company is a <em>bona fide </em>holder for value, and without notice, of the note of complainants referred to in the bill\u201d which was dismissed, and the case is before us upon an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">As between Stone and Andrews and the Exchange Company, the original parties to the note in controversy, there has been a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>complete failure of consideration. Tlieir note was given as part of the purchase price of two lots bought by Stone and Andrew's of the Exchange Company, which in its deed covenanted that it had the right to convey, that it had done no act to encumber the land, and that the grantees should have quiet possession thereof free from all encumbrances. When that covenant w'as given there rested upon the land a lien for the purchase money, evidenced by a deed of trust of record, from the Exchange Company to Thomas Lewis, from whom it had derived title. This lien w-as superior to any right which the Exchange Company \u25a0could pass by its deed. Its covenant with Stone and Andrews, therefore, was broken at the instant when it was given, and the night of Stone and Andrews to set off this paramount lien \u2022against any demand by the Exchange Company for payment of their note was complete. By virtue of this paramount lien these lots were sold under decree of court, were purchased by Thomas Lewis to satisfy a lien in his favor, a deed made to him, \u2022and the lots, the purchase price of which constituted the consideration for the note now demanded of them, are wholly lost to Andrews and Stone; and it is plain that the Exchange Company could not recover as against them. The only question \u2022open for consideration is, did the Fidelity Company have notice \u2022of the equities of the appellants affecting the Exchange Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">In considering this question, we shall not rely upon implied or constructive notice, growing out of the fact that the same individual was president of both' companies, and that other officials were common to them; nor upon the recordation of the Lewis deed. In our opinion the evidence is sufficient to establish actual notice to the Fidelity Company of every important fact affecting the transaction between the Exchange Company and Stone and Andrews.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-7\">\u201cQ. It is alleged in the bill, Mr. Engleby, that one of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>notes, the note last maturing for $600.00, executed by Stone and Andrews, was transferred and assigned to the Fidelity Loan &amp; Trust Company, or acquired by it by virtue of a deed of trust executed by the Exchange Building <em>&amp; </em>Investment Company. Will you please state whether or not the Fidelity Loan &amp; Trust Company acquired that note, and under what circumstances ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-6\">\u201cA. My impression is that (and I know it to be a fact) these notes were transferred to the Fidelity Loan &amp; Trust Company some time before this deed of trust was given.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">The deed of trust here referred to is the general assigmnent from the Exchange Company to James B. Terry, trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">Continuing, the witness says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-9\">\u201cQ. Under what circumstances were they transferred to the Fidelity Company?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-10\">\u201cA. When the note due Col. Thomas Lewis by the Exchange Building Company became due, the Exchange Company did not have money enough in hand to pay the same to him. They arranged to borrow a part from the Fidelity Loan &amp; Trust Company, using the notes due the Exchange Company from lot purchases as collateral. The note of Stone and Andrews was amongst these notes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-11\">\u201cQ. Was the Fidelity Loan &amp; Trust Company aware of the object of this loan?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-12\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-13\">\u201cQ. Was it not aware of the existence of the deed of trust to Col. Lewis?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-14\">\u201cA. As president of the Fidelity Loan <em>&amp; </em>Trust Company I was aware of it myself. I do not know whether all the directors were or not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-15\">\u201cQ. Was the Fidelity Loan &amp; Trust Company or not aware of the fact that there was a lien on the lots, which secured these notes that were to be transferred to them for the loan ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-16\">\u201cA. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>\u201cQ. Did they make any arrangements, Mr. Eng'leby, with regard to that lien, as to what disposition was to be made of it, or whether or not the lien was to be released as to the lots which secured these notes, that were sold to the Fidelity Company ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-6\"><em>\u201cA. </em>It was understood that all of the notes taken in this deal were to be clear, except as to the deed of trust given by parties who had made these paper notes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-7\">\u201cQ. In other words, the deed of trust securing the notes themselves ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-8\">\u201cA. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-9\">\u201cQ. Do I understand that these notes were to be given to you and all liens on the property, securing these notes, were to be released except the liens which were given to secure the notes themselves ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-10\">\u201cA. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-11\">\u201cQ. Mr. Engleby, state whether or not this money which the Fidelity Company was to loan, was to be applied in securing the release of these notes?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-12\">\u201cA. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-13\">\u201cQ. Do you know why it was that the lien on the lots of Stone and Andrews was never released.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-14\">\u201cA. The only explanation I can give of that is, that it was an error, or oversight, in not having those particular lots released, as we did not contemplate taking a single note that was not properly released. The Exchange Company had some trouble in getting the release of their property, according to their former agreement with Lewis. He refused to carry out this part of the contract, until a suit was entered into, and has never carried out that part of the contract.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b236-15\">And upon cross-examination this witness further testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-16\">\u201cQ. Who negotiated that loan on behalf of the Exchange Building <em>&amp; </em>Investment Company ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>\u201cA. Mr. C. B. Moomaw and myself \u2014 Mr. Moomaw as secretary and treasurer, myself as president of the company.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-6\">\u201cQ. Is it not a fact that you appeared before the Board of Directors, or took the matter up with the officers of the Fidelity Company, and negotiated the loan yourself, without Mr. Moo-maw\u2019s having- any direct connection with the negotiations ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-7\">\u201cA. I do not recall that exactly. I know I had the most to do with it. Whether he appeared with me I am not able to state.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-8\">1&lt;Q. Was this matter submitted to the directors before the loan was granted, or was it negotiated with you as president of the Fidelity Company?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-9\">\u201cA. It was talked over with them, yes, sir; Col. Lewis himself being on the Finance Committee at the time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-10\">\u201cQ. So you are certain that it was discussed either before the Finance Committee, or the Board of Directors ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-11\">\u201cA. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-12\">\u201cQ. And that it was with their approval that the loan wTas made ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-13\">\u201cA. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-14\">\u201cQ. Was there any resolution of the hoard authorizing this loan?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-15\">\u201cA. I do not know that there was. They seldom did that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-16\">\u201cQ. How you say that the Fidelity Company knew of this lien in favor of Col. Lewis, and that the object of this loan was to pay off that lien ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-17\">\u201cA. I could state that the Board, or its directors or officials did, and the Finance Committee, before whom this matter was brought, and it was explained to them \u2014 the position.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-18\">\u201d\u201cQ. You say that the matter was gone over either with the Board of Directors, or the Finance Committee, at the time ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-19\">\u201cA. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-20\">\u201cQ. And that those facts were explained to them?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-21\">\u201cA. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>In Daniel on Negotiable Instruments, Vol. 1, sec. 196, the law is stated thus: \u201cIf the circumstances are of such a character as to create such a distinct legal presumption and <em>prima facie </em>proof of fraud, or of some equity between prior parties, it would operate as legal information and constructive notice to the transferee. This rule fixes a criterion for judgment which is definite, and seems to us the one which should be adopted. The proof of the existence of the circumstances amounting to implied notice must be clear. As said by Woodbury, J.: Tt must clearly appear that the indorsee was apprised of such circumstances as would have avoided the note in the hands of the indorser.\u2019 \u201d <em>Perkins </em>v. <em>Challis, </em>1 N. H. 254:.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">In conclusion, the case is as follows: As between Stone and Andrews and the Exchange Company, there was such a failure of consideration as precluded a recovery by the Exchange Company against Stone and Andrews; that the Exchange Company transferred the note in question, before its maturity, to the Fidelity Company, which therefore comes before the court with a presumption in its favor that it is a holder for value and without notice; that this presumption is overcome by the testimony, which proves notice of every fact affecting the transaction, as between the original parties to it, and the note in the hands of the Fidelity Company is affected by all the equities existing in Stone and Andrews as against the Exchange Company at the time of its transfer to the Fidelity Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">For these reasons we are of opinion that the decree of the Circuit Court must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-9\">\n<em>B-eversed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
