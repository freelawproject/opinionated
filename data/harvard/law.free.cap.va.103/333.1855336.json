The defense interposed was that the purchaser had not given the prescribed notice, and was therefore not entitled to demand a deed. But the court, after mature deliberation, reached the conclusion that the amended act had no application to a case in which the two years allowed for the redemption of the land had expired before it came into effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">It will be observed that the amendment in terms applies only to persons entitled to redeem; and appellant was clearly not of that class, since her right to redeem had already ceased by lapse of time. While it is true the statute comprises sales made before as well as those made after its passage, nevertheless, with respect to the former, it only includes those wherein the right to redeem was in force when the new law took effect. If only the last day of the two years remained at that time, the right to the four months\u2019 notice accrued, although it would have the effect of extending the right of redemption beyond the original limit of two years. But it was not the purpose of the legislature to revive a right of redemption already barred; if, indeed, it possessed the constitutional power to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">In the leading case of <em>Curtis </em>v. <em>Whitney, </em>13 Wall. 70, 20 L. Ed. 513 (and other cases relied on by appellant) the right of redemption under the prior law was a <em>subsisting right </em>at the date of the amendment; and the court properly held that a mere \u25a0change of procedure requiring notice, and enabling the former owner the more certainly to exercise his right of redemption, did not impair the obligation of the purchasers\u2019 contract. In that case the period of redemption had not expired, at the date of the amendment requiring notice, by more than thirteen months. The opinion of Justice Miller is in entire accord with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>the distinction which this court observes between an existent and non-existent right of redemption when the amendment attaches.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">If, however, the import of the Act under consideration were doubtful, the case would call for the application of the familiar rule, that where a statute is susceptible of two constructions, one of which is plainly within, and the other without, the legislative power, the courts must adopt the former construction. <em>Martin </em>v. <em>South Salem Land Co., </em>91 Va. 349, 33 S. E. 600.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">With respect to the remaining suggestion, that the proceedings are void because appellant\u2019s name did not occur in alphabetical order in the treasurer\u2019s original report of sales, it is sufficient to remark, that the statute does not require the observance of such alphabetical arrangement. <em>Code, </em>sec. 642.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">Upon the whole case, the court is of opinion that the decree complained of is without error, and it must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
