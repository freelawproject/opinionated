Ceiminal <em>Law </em>\u2014 Corporations\u2014Illicit <em>Business </em>\u2014 Liability <em>of Officers.\u2014 </em>The general manager of a corporation, in active charge of its affairs, who knows that the subordinate agents of the company are actively peddling the company\u2019s goods without license, and who receives reports of such sales indirectly from such agents, is criminally liable for the olfense of peddling goods without license.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b898-9\">Error to a judgment of the Circuit Court of Chesterfield county, on an information for peddling without license.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"b898-10\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</disposition>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b898-11\">The opinion states the case.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b898-12\"><em>R.

B. Price Mercantile Company, a corporation domiciled at Kansas City, in the State of Missouri; that the company had two depositories, or store-houses, in this State, the one located in the city of Norfolk, and the other in the city of Richmond. Crall was the vice-president of the company, and its general manager for the State of Virginia, with headquarters at Norfolk. Ostrander, under Grail\u2019s supervision, was in charge of the branch store-house in the city of Richmond. Freeman, who was employed by Ostrander for the L. B. Price Company, was equipped with a wagon, goods and printed contracts of sale, and conducted a regular peddling business on behalf of the company. He was sent out to peddle goods, and reported his sales to Ostrander, who made his reports to Norfolk.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-7\">Hpon the foregoing facts Crall was convicted of peddling, and a fine of $100 imposed upon him by the Circuit Court of Chesterfield county, to which court the case was carried by appeal from the judgment of a justice of that county.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-8\">For reasons stated in the opinion in the former case, the judgment complained of is without error and must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
