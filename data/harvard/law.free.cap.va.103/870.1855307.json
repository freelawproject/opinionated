Criminal <em>Law </em>\u2014 Competency <em>of Grand Juror </em>\u2014 Plea <em>in </em>Abatement\u2014 <em>Replication </em>\u2014 Verdict.\u2014Upon an issue of fact made on a plea in abatement to an indictment, to determine whether or not a grand juror was, at the time of finding an indicment, a resident of the city in which the indictment was found, the verdict of the jury will be considered in this court as upon a demurrer to evidence, and will not be disturbed if there was evidence in the case sufficient to sustain it. Where no right of the prisoner has been prejudiced, the court will not stop to enquire whether a replication to the plea should have concluded to the country instead of with a verification.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b906-15\">2. Criminal <em>Law </em>\u2014 Jurors\u2014Competency\u2014Opinions.\u2014The trend of recent decisions is in the direction of limiting rather than extending the disqualification of jurors by reason of mere opinion, hence the courts enquire into the character of that opinion. If it is a decided or substantial opinion as to the guilt or innocence of the accused, no matter upon what ground it was formed, the juror is incompetent, but if the opinion is merely hypothetical, and the court is satisfied from an examination of the juror on his <em>voir dire, </em>or otherwise, that he is not biased or prejudiced, and that he can give the prisoner a fair and impartial trial according to the law and the evidence, he should be accepted. No fixed and invariable rule can be laid down whereby to test the competency of jurors, but each case should be determined by its own facts and circumstances, and great weight should be attached by an appellate court to the opinion of the trial judge.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b906-17\">3. <em>Evidence- </em>\u2014 Admissibility\u2014Weight..\u2014It is for the court to determine what evidence should be admitted, and' for the jury to determine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>the credibility of witnesses and the weight to be given to their testimony.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b907-6\">4. <em>Evidence </em>\u2014 Statements <em>by Third Persons </em>\u2014 Efforts <em>of Prisoner to Induce Denial </em>\u2014 Accusation <em>by Third Person </em>\u2014 Demal.\u2014Where evidence has been introduced of a statement made by the prisoner\u2019s son, which was damaging to prisoner\u2019s case, a subsequent conversation between the prisoner and his son, while the former was in jail charged with the offense to which the statement related, may be given in evidence for the purpose of showing' that the prisoner endeavored to induce his son to deny the statement attributed to him; and the fact that the prisoner, in the conversation referred to, denied the conduct attributed to him in the son\u2019s statement does not render the son\u2019s allegations in the conversation an accusation of a third person denied by the prisoner.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b907-8\">5. <em>Evidence </em>\u2014 Opinion <em>of Expert </em>\u2014 Matter <em>of Common Knowledge. </em>\u2014 That a medical expert was permitted to express an opinion upon a matter of common knowledge is harmless error.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b907-10\">6. <em>Evidence </em>\u2014 Code, <em>Sec. 3351 </em>\u2014 Applicable <em>to Criminal Cases </em>\u2014 Adverse <em>Witness </em>\u2014 Prior <em>Inconsistent Statements. </em>\u2014 Section 3351 of the Code, as amended by Acts, 1899-1900, p. 124, allowing a party whose witness has unexpectedly proved adverse, with leave of the court, to prove his prior inconsistent statements, applies to criminal as well as civil cases. Its language is broad and general, and there is no suggestion on its face to limit its operation to civil cases. While it is true that the statute is found in the Code under the title of \u201cProceedings in Civil Cases,\u201d yet, in the same chapter with that section, there are other sections applicable alike, by their terms, to criminal and civil cases, and the mere collocation of that section cannot be permitted to over-ride every other consideration, and require the courts to confine it to civil eases, when it is a remedy for an evil as great in criminal cases as in civil, and the consequences of which may be even more serious.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b907-12\">7. <em>Evidence </em>\u2014 Impeaching <em>Onefs Own Witness </em>\u2014 Prior <em>Inconsistent Statements </em>\u2014 Details <em>of Statement. </em>\u2014 In proving the prior inconsistent statements of a witness who has unexpectedly proven adverse to the party calling, the party is not restricted by the provisions of Sec. 3351 of the Code (1904) to proof of the fact that such statements were made, but may give in evidence the details of such statements.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b907-14\">8. Criminal <em>Law </em>\u2014 Reasonable <em>Doubt. </em>\u2014 It is difficult, if not impossible, to define \u201creasonable doubt,\u201d but the instructions in this case fully protected the prisoner\u2019s rights in this regard.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b907-16\">9. <em>Instructions </em>\u2014 Fully <em>Instructed. </em>\u2014 It is not error to refuse* an in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>struction when the jury has already been fully and correctly instructed on the point upon which the instruetion is asked.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b908-6\">10. <em>Instructions </em>\u2014 \u201cninety <em>and nine Guilty Mm.\u201d </em>\u2014 The expression \u201cit is better that ninety and nine guilty persons should escape than that one innocent person should be punished\u201d is unobjectionable as a rhetorical phrase, but is of no value as a guide to a jury in reaching a conclusion, and it is not error to refuse to so instruct a jury which has already been fully and correctly instructed on the \u201cpresumption of innocence\u201d and \u201creasonable doubt.\u201d</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b908-7\">11. Criminal <em>Law </em>\u2014 Assisting <em>Prosecution </em>\u2014 Criticism\u2014Reply.\u2014The right of a public prosecutor to have associated with him an attorney to assist in the prosecution is established law in this State, and is not a proper subject of animadversion. The fact that such an assistant, in response to adverse criticism by counsel for a prisoner, replied that he had \u201crefused a large fee in this case to prosecute,\u201d is not good cause of exception or objection on the part of the prisoner.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b908-8\">12. Criminal <em>Law </em>\u2014 Jwors\u2014Reading <em>newspapers </em>\u2014 Waiving Objection.\u2014 While it is the safer and better practice to exclude newspapers from a jury sitting in a felony case, yet, when the court, in the presence of a prisoner and his counsel, and without objection on their part, at the instance of the jury, permits them to have access to newspapers under instructions that they shall scrupulously avoid reading any parts of said papers that have reference to the trial, the prisoner cannot after verdict make objection on that account. He has no right to sit mute, prepared to abide by the results if favorable, and to make objection if adverse.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b908-9\">13. Criminal <em>Law </em>\u2014 Writ <em>of Error not Matter of Right </em>\u2014 Refusah\u2014Pre<em>cedent. </em>\u2014 A writ of error <em>to the </em>judgment of a trial court is not one of the rights of one convicted of crime; neither is it a part of \u201cdue process of law,\u201d nor one of the inalienable rights guaranteed by the Constitution. It is a right regulated entirely by statute, and, under the statute of this State, it is as much the duty of this court to deny the writ when the decision complained of is plainly right, as it is to grant it when any doubt exists as to the propriety of the decision. While the accused is entitled to a fair and impartial trial, yet when he has had this, and has been rightly condemned, the safety of society demands that the administration of justice shall be swift and certain. Nor, where the judgment of the trial court is plainly right, is the refusal of a writ of error to one convicted of murder of the first degree an innovation, but is in strict accord with the practice in this State from the earliest date to the present time.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b909-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>Petition for a writ of error to a judgment of the Corporation Court of the city of Charlottesville, sentencing the petitioner to be hanged.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"AKv\">\n<em>Denied.</em>\n</disposition>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b909-7\">J. Samuel McCue resided in the city of Charlottesville, where he had been practicing law for twenty years prior to the commission of the offense for which he was convicted. He was a man of social standing, and reputed wealth. His family consisted of himself, his wife, Pannie Crawford McCue, and four children, three boys and a girl. The eldest of these children was J. William McCue, a boy of about seventeen years of age. J. Samuel McCue had been three times elected mayor of the city \u2014 his last term expiring September 1, 1904.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b909-8\">On September 2, 1904, he left home on a trip to the city of Washington, and on the same day his wife, went out into the country, about seven miles from Charlottesville, on a social visit. About five o\u2019clock in the evening, on Sunday, September 4, 1904, Mrs. McCue returned to her home. About an hour later, on the same day, her husband returned from Washington. When he reached home his wife was in the parlor entertaining a guest. He did not go in to see her, and the record is silent as to the character of their meeting, or whether they did meet prior to the evening meal. Shortly after supper Mrs. McCue went, unattended, to the Presbyterian church, several blocks from their home. Soon after that J. Samuel McCue also went to church and occupied the family pew, together with his wife. The services at the church seem to have lasted about one hour, and Mr. and Mrs. McCue returned to their residence about 9 :15 o\u2019clock. The weather was warm and the windows and doors of residences were open for purposes of ventilation, and many persons were sitting on their galleries.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b910-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>After Mr. and. Mrs. McCue entered the house they prepared to retire, and the details of what took place in the next few minutes is unknown. There were in the house at this time Mr. and Mrs. McCtie, and J ohn Perry, a colored boy, who occupied a servant\u2019s room on the second floor of the rear part of the house, which was shut off from the main residence by a hall door generally kept locked. The son, J. William McCue, was in the city of Charlottesville, but had not then come in, nor were any of the other children in the house. The next person who entered the house was Dr. Frank O. McCue, a brother of J. Samuel McCue, who was a practicing physician in the city, and resided three and one half or four squares off. He says that the first intimation that he had of any trouble was about 9:15 or 9:30 P. M. on September J; that he and his family had gone up stairs to retire, and that he was nearly undressed when the telephone rang; that he went to the \u2019phone and recognized his brother\u2019s voice, who said: \u201cFrank, come down right quick, somebody is in the house, has knocked me senseless, and has probably shot'Fannie.\u201d Dr. McCue says he hung up the receiver quickly, went to his room, dressed, with his wife\u2019s assistance, and started to his brother\u2019s house. As he started out he asked his wife for his pistol, but recalled that he had loaned it. He went to his brother\u2019s house, went up the front steps, and, finding the door ajar, pushed it open with his emergency grip. The first person he saw was the colored boy, John Perry, going from him toward the stairs. He did not take off his hat, and kept his grip in his hand. There was a low light in the hall. He met his brother on the steps, a little above the centre of the stairway. There was a dim light in his brother\u2019s room on the upper floor. His brother, J. Samuel McCue, had on a pair of dark trousers, a pair of slippers and an undershirt. There was a wound on his brother\u2019s right cheek, and some blood on the right side of his face. He did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>not reply to several of Dr. McCue\u2019s questions, but seemed dazed, and would give no definite history of the case. He pushed Dr. McCue back, and said: \u201cGo on and find Fannie.\u201d Dr. McCue went up the steps, put down his grip, took matches and struck a light. About that time Policeman Grady arrived and came up the steps before Dr. McCue made the first light. There was an odor and fumes of powder in the upper hall, and water running in the bathroom at the rear end of the hall. Going into the bathroom, he struck a light, and asked John Perry, the colored boy who was with him, where the gas jet was. Perry said behind the door. After lighting the gas jet, the first thing he saw was the body of Fannie McCue, wife of J. Samuel McCue, lying in the bath-tub. She was pulseless and lying almost stretched out \u2014 right leg drawn out against the base of the tub, and left knee raised, with her gown floating above her body. The water was within four inches of the top of the tub, but did not cover her. Her mouth was partially open, but no water had entered her body. There was no discoloration of the water. She was lifted out of the tub by Dr. McCue, Grady and John Perry, and laid on a rug on the bath-room floor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b911-7\">At a <em>post mortem </em>examination held later during the night there was found on the deceased an incised wound on the nose, from which a small amount of blood had flown, but no bones were broken. The right ear was cut almost in two, as if a lick had been struck from above downward and backward. It skinned the ear, and cut it in two for a short space, perhaps one-half an inch. There was a marked contusion on the front and back of the ear. The wound was such as might have been made by a baseball bat, and would probably have produced insensibility. There were finger prints on her throat \u2014 four on one side and one on the other \u2014 as if she had been choked. These could only have been made during life. On the back of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>the head there was a slight out \u2014 perhaps a quarter of au inch \u2014 which might have been made after death by falling into the bath-tub, and. there was a gunshot wound in the chest, which went in practically solid, and must have been made at close range, as the wound was full of powder. The physicians who made the examination were of opinion that the gunshot wound produced practically instantaneous death. They were also of opinion that Mrs. McCue could not have gotten into the bath-tub, in the position in which she was, after receiving that wound, and that the range of the wound was such that it was impossible for it to have been made while she was lying in the bath-tub.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b912-6\">The prisoner gave various accounts as to what had happened. To one witness, among the first to get to the house, he said: \u201cA burglar has shot and killed Fannie, and has escaped,\u201d and when asked about the slight wound on his face, replied: \u201cThe rascal must have shot me too.\u201d When his son William arrived he said: \u201cTour mother is dead \u2014 a burglar has killed her.\u201d He said to Policeman Grady that some one had nearly killed him, and had probably killed Fannie. He further said that he was \u201cundressing when he heard a rattling, and looked around. He saw a dirty, greasy man, as if a -railroad man. He reached for his gun, but the man got hold of him before he got the gun and got it in position.\u201d They had a tussle before he was knocked out. He stated that his wife was in the room when the man came in. To another witness he said that he heard a noise in the hall and went out and grappled with the man; that he backed away from the man, and went and got his gun. As he returned with the gun the man knocked him down and got the gun. To another witness he stated that some one had entered his room, knocked him senseless and shot his wife. He said he was in front of a chiffonier and his wife near the bureau; that he tried to get his gun out of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>case when the man knocked him senseless and took the gun. To another witness he stated that his wife was prepared for bed, and that he had on his undershirt; that the lights were turned low; and that he heard a sound' like a click and turned, and saw a man; that he went to his chiffonier where he kept, his pistol, but the pistol had-been removed; that he reached for the gun which was in the corner. When he got the gun he was struck by a bat or some object, and he knew nothing further after that.\u201d At a later time he stated to another witness that he saw a man in the mirror as he (McCue) was standing in front taking the buttons out of his shirt; that his wife was then in the bath-room; that he went and got his gun, put two shells in it and started to the door, but when he got to the door he was struck and knocked senseless. He described the man as a dirty, greasy looking white man. The testimony of the prisoner at the coroner\u2019s inquest was not introduced on his trial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b913-4\">Just outside of the bath-room door, in the hall, there was found a pump gun, which was identified as belonging to the prisoner. This gun was picked up by the negro boy, John Perry, who ejected an empty shell from the magazine. Just inside the bed-room, standing in one corner, was found a baseball bat, which was identified as belonging to one of the boys of the family. This bat had stains on it at the large end which appeared to be blood. Ho blood stains were found in the bedroom, nor in the hall leading therefrom to the bath-room, although diligent search was made therefor. Humerous blood spots were found on the prisoner\u2019s undershirt, a number of which had been washed, or had at least come in contact with water.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b913-5\">Although the bath-room was examined for traces of the criminal on the night of the murder and none were found, during the next day a piece of undershirt was found there, which was shown by witnesses for the Commonwealth to correspond with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>tlie undershirt worn by the prisoner the night before \u2014 being of same quality and material. The chain stitch and the thread hanging to the piece were torn from the back of the shirt, and that piece was missing from the shirt worn by the prisoner the night of the murder. The thread of the piece matched that of the shirt, and the chain stitch seemed to be the' same. The piece corresponded with the shirt.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b914-6\">Mrs. McCue wore her finger-nails long. One of these was found broken and turned back. Screams of a woman were heard by one witness in the McCue residence, and later a shot. The prisoner gave no alarm, but called a lady over the \u2019phone, and also claimed to have called in the same way his brother, Dr. McCue, but the latter was questioned by the Commonwealth. The first alarm was given from the central telephone office. Nothing was stolen from the residence, and there was no other evidence of attempted burglary.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b914-7\">The physicians also gave the prisoner a thorough examination, but could find no wounds upon his person, except an abrasion of the skin on one side of his face, such as a boy would receive from scraping his knee against a brick, or such as usual with foot-ball players. They expressed the opinion that this could not have been caused by a lick from a base-ball bat, and, by whatever instrument inflicted, it would not have caused unconsciousness. His scalp and body were carefully examined, but no other wounds or bruises could be found upon him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b914-8\">The theory of the defense was that the husband had been struck with a sand-bag, or something of that kind, and knocked senseless, and afterwards the wife had been shot, and that this had been done by some person, either for the purpose of burglary or for revenge.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b914-9\">There was evidence tending to show that the domestic relations of the husband and wife had not been pleasant for several years past. There was also evidence, however, tending to show the contrary, and letters of both husband and wife of the most <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"879\">*879</page-number>affectionate kind, during the years 1899 and 1900, and one as late as 1901, were introduced in evidence. It also appeared that the husband carried upwards of $60,000 of insurance on his life, payable to his wife, if living at the time of his death. Most of these policies were taken out during the two or three years immediately preceding the murder \u2014 one of them for $10,000 in the year 1904.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b915-6\">. Circumstances strongly pointed to the husband as the murderer of his wife. On Tuesday, September 6, Mrs. McOue was buried. On AVednesday afternoon, September 7, J. Samuel McOue was arrested on a warrant charging him with the murder of his wife. Subsequently, he was indicted, tried, and convicted of the offense.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b915-7\">The time for the execution was fixed for January 20, 1905. AYhen the Court of Appeals convened in Eichmond, January 5, 1905, an elaborate petition, covering 124 printed pages, was presented to the court, asking for a writ of error. Forty-five bills of exception had been filed during the trial. On January 12, 1905, the court unanimously refused a writ of error, on the ground that the judgment of the trial court was plainly right. Thereafter an amended petition, or a petition in the nature of .a petition for a rehearing was filed, and, as the day fixed for the execution was very near at hand, the Governor, at the request of the court, granted the prisoner a reprieve until February 10, 1905. On January 26, 1905, the court handed down the present opinion, unanimously refusing a writ of error. The prisoner was executed February 10, 1905.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b916-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>When this case was first called, the prisoner, in proper person, pleaded in abatement that one of the members of the grand jury which found the indictment was not, at the time of finding the indictment, and had not been for one year prior thereto, a resident of the city of Charlottesville, and was, therefore, incompetent to serve. The plea concluded with a verification, and prayer of judgment.

I think I could.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b919-15\">Q.

Yes, sir. Sorry to say so, but think I could.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b919-17\">Q. Are your opinions of such a character as to prevent your finding a verdict in a case punishable with death?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b919-18\">A. Hot at all.

Have those reports caused a very decided opinion?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b919-25\">A. Well, unfortunately, I have read a little law, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>while I know that all that comes in the newspapers is not proper, yet I have formed a decided opinion on the subject, which is on what I conceive to be the case.

As I understand, if you went on the jury you would go with bias in your mind?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b920-9\">A. Well, I would feel, if 1 were put on the jury, I would consider the evidence as offered in the trial and decide purely on that. I think I have character of mind and sufficient firmness to do that. Of course, 1 would have to leave everything else out that I have read and commence over anew.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b920-10\">Q. Still, as I understand you, you would go upon the jury with rather a fixed opinion in your mind?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b920-11\">A. Well, I have an opinion based on what I have read. Of course, that opinion was not formed like I would form it if I were on the jury. But I think in my mind, of course, I have formed an opinion, and don\u2019t think any sensible man could read the papers without forming an opinion, and perhaps a decided opinion; but I don\u2019t think I am so biased that I could not be changed, and change with ease, if necessary, according to the evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b920-12\">.

William McCue, the prisoner\u2019s son, was offered as a wit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>ness on behalf of the Commonwealth. Soon after his examination began, counsel for the Commonwealth announced that they were taken by surprise by the prisoner\u2019s testimony, and asked to be allowed to examine him according to the rules applicable to cross-examination, and this request was granted. The extent, character, and details of this examination will best appear from the examination itself.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"93\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b922-6\">J. William McCue stated that he was the oldest son of J. Samuel McCue, and would be seventeen years old in December. The night his mother was killed he was on Main street. His mother went to Bed Hill the Friday evening before she was killed, and his father took the fast train, Ho. 4, on the C. &amp; O., and he did not know exactly where he went. His father left that Friday, before his mother was killed, on the C. &amp; O. train going east. She returned about 5 P. M. Sunday, and he (William) met her at the Hnion Station with a buggy, and drove her home. He then went to his father\u2019s office, and read the papers, when his father came into the office down street, and they drove home. His father arrived about an hour after his mother. His father entered his house from the rear, coming through the back door near the kitchen, and went into the house. He (William) was at home during the absence of his parents, and his sister was with his mother and his brothers at Mr. Browning\u2019s. His sister always went with his mother. Buby (J. Samuel McCue\u2019s daughter) was left at Bed Hill for a couple of days. His father had written to him that he would be home Saturday or Sunday. John Perry was the manservant on the premises that night, and staid in the servant\u2019s room over the kitchen. The door leading from the servant\u2019s room to dwelling at the head of the passage near both rooms was locked that night, and John Perry could not possibly have gotten in the house. His father had three guns. Sometimes they kept one in witness\u2019 room, and the other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>two staid in his room right beside the wardrobe, near the chiffonier. When shown the pump gun that was found in the upper hall he identified it as one of his father\u2019s guns. Sometimes the guns were just set down loaded. He had done that often. He could not say if the pump gun was loaded that night. He had left it loaded. His father never gave any particular instructions as to 'leaving them loaded or unloaded. The base-ball bat shown him he identified as one that generally staid in the yard. He did not know where it was that evening, and had never seen it in the house. It generally staid at the woodpile. The last time he saw it, it was in the garden below the woodpile. It belonged to his little brother. The cartridges for the guns were lying all around the house \u2014 no special place at all.' He had a few in his wardrobe, some in the closet there and in the hall, and some in his room \u2014 mostly in his room \u2014 no definite place for them. He remained at home when he came with his father that evening. His mother was in the library when his father came, he thought, with a lady friend. That was about fifteen or forty-five minutes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"94\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b923-6\">Q.

We talked there in a general way; just anything that would come up; any question at all; just talking. I know they asked me about the horses, and the negro who worked for us had taken our horses and driven them to Keswick, and she told me that she did not want her phaeton to go there again, driven by the negro man, and she reprimanded me for that, and then my father came down afterwards from her room, and he told me he never wanted this man to take those horses out, that he was tired of this nonsense.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"98\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b924-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>Q.

I came down town and staid quite awhile.

Hadn\u2019t you better think this matter over now carefully and tell the truth about it\u201d?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"311\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b938-14\">A.

Mow, Mr. McCue, having laid the foundation for the question, I will ask you this: About two weeks after your mother was murdered, didn\u2019t you drop into the Gleason Hotel and see Albert Baldwin, and go with him down to Payne\u2019s stable, and didn\u2019t you, at Payne\u2019s stable, tell Mr. Baldwin that your father had tried to get you to forget, or not stand up to, that statement about his (your father\u2019s) having pursued your mother with a pistol and pointing it at her, and when you tried to interfere he pointed it at you, and that you said you could not forget it, or something to that effect?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"380\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b942-15\">A. I want to say that I was going home from school and Mr. Baldwin was sitting in Payne\u2019s livery stable.

I deny the statement he has made there.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"381\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b942-16\">(It was understood among counsel and the court that the defense excepted to all of the foregoing questions and answers, as illegal, and the court overruled their objections and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number>instructed the jury as to each question and answer that they could only he considered for the purpose of impeaching the witness and not as evidence of the guilt or innocence of the accused.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"382\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b943-6\">The witness further stated that he probably remained in Charlottesville two weeks after the death of his mother, and then went with his brothers and sister and Uncle Will MeCue to Mr. Uewton Dixon\u2019s, at Eonceverte, W. Va. Mr. Uewton Dixon was the father-in-law of Mr. Will McCue. They remained at Eonceverte three weeks lacking one day.'

He had spent most of his life at home, only spending half a session at the Episcopal High School, at Alexandria. The relations between his father and mother were generally cordial. Of course, they had family spats \u2014 about the children and horses \u2014 that was all. They were not serious. His father gave his mother everything she wished. She had a horse and buggy of her own, and went to the springs when she wished. Every wish of her heart was granted as far as his means would allow. She left for Eed Hill on the 12 M. train going South over the Southern railway on the Friday before the killing. When he came in from tieing the horse that Sunday evening he thought his father had gone to take a bath. His father arrived about 6 P. M. and he and mother came to the tea table together. There were no indications of any unpleasantness between them before they went to church. The front door was unlatched when he went out while his father and mother were at church. The back door in the hall leading to John\u2019s room was latched. It is al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number>ways latched.

He denied that she was crying, or that he had so told Earnest Crawford and Albert Baldwin, or had ever told them that his mother was jealous of his father. He denied telling Miss Gertrude Irving the Sunday after his mother was killed that his people were reticent, and that he dreaded going upon the witness-stand, and that he would rather die than tell what he would have to tell. He denied that he would have shot himself the night of the murder but for the fact that two weeks before the murder his mother asked him if anything happened to her to look after the little children.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"387\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b944-8\">Q.

G. Baldwin, Edgar Crawford, Earnest Crawford, Miss Irving and Mr. Paoli were then examined and contradicted the statements made by J. William McCue \u2014 severally declaring that he had made the statements to them, respectively, indicated in the questions propounded to him. As each of these witnesses was examined, the court instructed the jury that the statements of the witness were received only for the purpose of impeaching the witness, J. William McCue, and not as evidence of the guilt or innocence of the accused.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"401\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b945-11\">Exception was also taken to the action of the court in permitting W. W. Brand and Geo. Thomas to testify as to the-demeanor of the prisoner towards his wife. This exception was not deemed of sufficient importance to be specifically noticed in the opinion of the court. The testimony of these two witnesses was substantially as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"402\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b945-12\">W. W. Brand stated that he was a plasterer, residing in Charlottesville, and that last summer, while working at the-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>prisoner\u2019s house, he heard the prisoner speak \u201cvery rough and bitter to his \u00a1wife, like he would like to kill her in a second,\u201d but he could not recall the words used, nor the month when they were spoken.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"403\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b946-6\">Geo. Thomas (a colored man) is 60 years old, and janitor for the City Hall. He cleaned up McCue\u2019s office as Mayor of Charlottesville in the above hall. Once late in the evening he saw McCue come to the City Hall with a satchel, and Mrs. McCue drive up about the same time. Mrs. McCue spoke, but he never heard him speak. He went in his office and she waited for him. When he came out she asked him, \u201cMr. McCue, are you going home with me?\u201d He said, \u201cHo&gt;\u201d and went down the street. She remained until he had crossed the street, and went home. He had been away several days. This was in late spring or early summer of 1904. Mr. McCue\u2019s manner was not as pleasant as a man should use in speaking to an affectionate wife \u2014 like I speak to mine.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"404\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b946-7\">After the evidence was all in, the court gave -to the jury twenty-nine instructions.

McCue testified that he was a physician and surgeon and had resided in Charlottesville five years this coming December, and will be thirty-one years old next April, and is a brother of the accused. lie resided at 402 Park street, about three and a half or four squares from the residence of the accused, and on the same street \u2014 only he resided on the east side and the accused on the west. The first knowledge he received of the murder on September 4, 1904, was about 9 :15 P. M. or <em>9:30. </em>He and his wife\u2019s cousin, and his little baby, had gone upstairs to retire. He was nearly undressed when the telephone rang. He went to the \u2019phone, and the accused, whose voice he recognized, said: \u201cFrank, come down right quick. Somebody is in the house, has knocked me (accused) senseless, and possibly shot Fannie (the wife). He (Dr. McCue) hung up the receiver quickly, went to his room, dressed, with his wife\u2019s assistance, and started. As he started out he asked his wife for his pistol, and recalled that it had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"921\">*921</page-number>loaned ont. He usually carried a pistol. He went to his office door on High street, came up to the corner to Park street, went down on the right of Park street to Mrs. Pugh\u2019s, or between Mrs. Pugh\u2019s and Sinclair\u2019s, then crossed the street and did not get on the street until near Letterman\u2019s, and kept on that side until he reached his brother\u2019s gate. He went up the front steps, found the door ajar, pushing it open with his emergency grip. The first person he saw was the colored hoy, John Perry, going from him, with his hack to him, toward the staircase. Dr. McOue did not take off his hat, and kept his grip in his hand. There was a low light in the hall. He met his brother on the steps a little higher than the center. There was a dim light in his brother\u2019s room, on the upper floor. J. Samuel McOue had on a pair of dark pants, a pair of slippers, and undershirt. He had a wound on his right cheek, and some blood on'the right side of his face. He did not reply to several of Dr. McOue\u2019s questions, and seemed dazed, and would give no definite history of the case. He pushed Dr. McOue hack, and said, \u201cGo on and hunt Pannie.\u201d Dr. McOue went up the steps, put down his grip, took matches and struck a light. About that time Policeman Grady arrived in the door. Grady came up the steps before Dr. McOue made the first light. There was an odor and fumes of powder in the upper hall, and water running in the bath-room. Going into the bath-room he struck a light, and asked John Perry where the gas jet was. Perry said behind the door. After lighting the gas jet the first thing he saw was the body of Pannie McOue lying in the tub, with the right-hand spigot turned towards the base of the tub. She was pulseless, lying almost straight out, right leg drawn out against the base of the tub and left knee raised, with her gown floating above her body. She had a wound on her right ear, and on the left side of her nose, near the center, and her face towards the wall. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"922\">*922</page-number>She was without color, and her mouth was partly open. Some one asked if she was dead, and about that time Sam asked the question, while he stood outside the bath-room door. Dr. McOue replied, \u201cYes,\u201d and Sam said, \u201cOh, my God, my darling wife,\u201d and dropped. The window at the door was open. Some one came in just then. The water was within four inches of the top of the tub. Her arms were folded across her breast. Dr. McOue took hold of her head, Grady took hold of her body, and John Perry took hold of her feet, and lifted her out of the tub on a rug on the bath-room floor. Ho water had entered her body, and nothing passed from her nose, eyes, or mouth. There was no discoloration of the water. There was a slight hemorrhage from the side of her head, which trickled down at the head of the tub. The water did not cover her. Dr. McOue told Grady that he had nothing to protect himself with, and he had best remain with him (Dr. McOue). Dr. McOue lighted a gas jet in a back room, and Grady called his attention to a window being up in that room. This was in Ruby\u2019s room. Grady called out of the window, \u201cWatch out,\u201d or to \u201ckeep a watch out,\u201d as parties outside were surrounding the house. Then Dr. McOue and Grady came out of the room, down stairs to the front hall, entered the parlor, where there was no light. Dr. McOue struck a light. One o;f the parlor windows was up. They then returned to the bath-room and removed the body to Wm. McCue\u2019s room, and laid it on the bed, and covered it with a sheet, and then for the first time he noticed the gunshot wound. Dr. McOue and Grady returned to the bath-room, and for the first time noticed Sam McCue\u2019s pump-gun by the door leading into Perry\u2019s room, in the upper hallway. Perry picked up the gun, said it was Mr. Sam McOue\u2019s, and pushing back the fixtures an empty shell rolled out. Perry said he did not know what the gun was doing there. Dr. McOue was backwards and forwards through <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"923\">*923</page-number>the house. Then he let the water out of the. bath-tub. He observed before she was removed her feet, as above stated. The spigot was turned towards the base of the tub, and the water comfortably warm. Her gown was saturated with water, and her hair partially tucked up. The above were the only wounds he then observed. He went to his brother Sam several times, offering assistance. Sam was lying on a sofa, and seemed to be suffering pain. On his right cheek a hemorrhage was running from the side of his face. When Dr. McCue went into Sam\u2019s room some one back of him, while he sat holding his brother\u2019s pulse, observed, \u201cWhat is that bat doing there.\u201d It was to the right of the mantlepiece, standing on the floor. That was the first he had seen of the bat. . . He raised the bat and noticed a discoloration near the larger end, but could not say it was blood. He made no further examination of the bat. He never looked at the clock when he received the \u2019phone message \u2014 did not look at the clock until the next morning. He could not state how long it rook him to get ready and start, but it was not long. Tie went at once to his brother\u2019s house after receiving the \u2019phone message. While standing on the stairs Grady arrived. He thought he heard Grady behind him as he came down the street. He was past half way upstairs when Grady came in the front door. The body in the bath-tub was Mrs. Dannie McCue\u2019s, the wife of J. Samuel McCue, and she was between 45 and 48 years old. They had four children \u2014 one girl and three boys. She would weigh from 100 to 110 pounds. Her body was warm when first found. The warm water spigot was running. Her head was entirely out of the water, and the water close up to her shoulders, and had reached the wound in her bosom. The wound was an inch or inch and a half below the collar bone. There was no flow of blood from the wound, and her gown was entirely free from blood. There was no manifestation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"924\">*924</page-number>hemorrhage at all from the wound. It was discolored with powder, an irregular opening.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"469\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b960-6\">He was present later when a thorough examination of the body was made, but could not tell the time. The examination was made by Dr. Early and Dr. Venable. He was standing in the hallway when those doctors ashed him to go with them. They went to the bath-room and struck matches in addition to the gas light, and got down and searched the floor and wall, and found nothing. Then they searched the hall wall and stairway going to Sam\u2019s room. They asked Dr. McOue to go and examine the body with them. Dr. Early lighted a candle in addition to the gas. Dr. IVlcOue, as a spectator, held the candle for Drs. Early and Venable to examine the body, in the presence of the undertaker. Previously the undertaker had ripped her gown down in front, which was the only garment she had on. He told those present not to interfere with ,the body until the examination was made. To his knowledge nothing had been done to the body before the examination. When the examination commenced the body was still prone back on the bed, as it was taken in, and witness knew of no blood coming from the gunshot wound prior thereto. They first searched for the number of wounds. The first wound was on the right ear and side of the head, the next on the left side of the nose, about the center, a little scratch in the center of the head found by Dr. Early, and the gunshot wound. They were looking over the body, and he looking too. He saw no evidence of blows on the throat at that time. Dr. Early pulled her gown back, and introduced his finger in the cavity of the gunshot wound for the first time, and that was the first blood to come from the wound. They rolled her from front to back investigating what direction the gunshot wound took, and its effect. He could not say just what they did. That was the first time he observed the gown saturated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"925\">*925</page-number>with, blood. They had made an examination previously to the permanent examination. He could not say how long after the body had been placed in Willie\u2019s room. It was later in the night that Mr. G-ilmer called up Drs. Early and Venable and asked them to make a thorough examination. \u201cThere was no discharge of blood previous to the last examination. .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"470\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b961-6\">The undershirt that J. Samuel McOue had on was removed during the last examination of her body, later in the night. The undershirt was identified as like the one Sam had on when he arrived. He was not present when Sam removed his undershirt. It was delivered to him when the undertakers were working on her body, just before cleaning up everything \u2014 the bedding, sheets, &amp;c., blood, &amp;c., in the room by the undertakers. He was asked by Mr. Gilmer to get the shirt, and to place it with the other articles. He went to his brother\u2019s room and asked for the undershirt and found it in the clothes-basket by his dresser. At that time he thought his brother was on a sofa in the room. He did not remember whether he or some one else asked Sam where the shirt was. He did not remember whether he or some one else got the shirt out of the basket. There were some strangers in the room. Before going into his brother\u2019s room for the shirt, he was sitting in the room talking to the undertaker and Mr. Marshall Dinwiddie quite a while before deceased was dressed. Just as they were putting the clothes on her, and her gown lying to itself, and the bloody bed-clothes and sheets, mattress, &amp;c., were raised up by Mr. Dinwiddie and Mr. Biery and thrown out the window, he went and got the shirt from his brother\u2019s private room and brought it to Mr. Dinwiddie. Mr. Dinwiddie took the shirt in his hands, just as his hands were from handling the dirty, bloody bed-clothes, &amp;c., and handled it, and Mr. Biery, the undertaker, rolled it up with the gown and laid it aside, and Mr. Biery/went to the bath-room-and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"926\">*926</page-number>\u25a0washed his hands, accompanied by Mr. Dinwiddie, whom he asked to remove the blood stains from the. bath-tub. He could not say if the shirt was in the same condition as when he received it. The shirt was a little torn down the front lapel, and some evidence of hemorrhage down the front. There was some blood actually on it. He did not observe the back of the shirt particularly at that time. He could not recall the spots on the back of the shirt. He observed blood coming from his brother\u2019s face when he first saw him. He did not remember the shirt being damp when taken out of the clothes-basket, but it later came in contact with the gown, which was saturated with water and blood. Mr. Dinwiddie\u2019s and Mr. Biery\u2019s hands were bloody when they received the shirt. His hands were clean. He thought the shirt was dry when he received it, but would not say positively. There was only a little blood stain on the gown prior to the examination. When he went into his brother\u2019s room for the undershirt he had changed it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"471\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b962-6\">The base-ball bat was identified as the one looking like the one found in the room. When it was found some one said, \u201cI will take that for the Commonwealth.\u201d An inch, or an inch and a half, near the larger end was discolored. The stain shown him on the bat he presumes to be the stain he saw on the bat that night. He thought Cliff. Rogers, the City Sergeant, was the one remarking about keeping the bat for the Commonwealth, but would not swear to it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"472\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b962-7\">The gun was shown witness. After placing the body in Willie\u2019s room he saw the gun for the first time to the right of the door leading into John Perry\u2019s room, in the upper hall. He did not touch the gun. When the boy took it up he placed it on the left side of the hall. The gun shown looked like the \u2022gun, but he could not say for certain. Perry waits on his brother at his house, attending to his horses. Perry had been there some time. He could not say for certain where Perry <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"927\">*927</page-number>slept, but presumed in tbe room at tbe end of tbe upper ball, beyond tbe bath-room, just across a little passage, about two or three feet. John Perry is colored. When he arrived Perry was downstairs, and Sam coming down the steps. No one had gotten there to his knowledge before him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"473\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b963-6\">When he received the \u2019phone message he took no steps to notify the police. He only went as far as to discharge his duty. When called he attended to his business, and did not look out for trouble. He could not tell how long after he arrived before people began to come. The house began to get crowded with people very shortly. When the body was removed from the bath-room he heard a voice in the direction of his brother\u2019s room like a lady\u2019s. He could see Sam through the crack of the door. That was shortly after the body was laid on the rug. He had not been to his brother\u2019s house since September 4, and he did not think the sofa was now in the same place as the 4th, because they have a fire there now. Sam could see the body on the rug, but did not come farther than the bath-room door, and did not touch the body, to his recollection. He was only a spectator at the examinations of the body, and did not make an examination. He was present and held the candle and looked on. The undertaker was not present, and he could not say if he was in the house. He had been there before, and had asked the undertaker not to touch the body until after the examination. The only thing the undertaker had done was to rip the gown down in front. The undertaker was asked to go out of the room for the examination, and he could not say when he returned, but it was after the physicians had examined the body. Prom the completion of the examination the undertaker was not in the room all the time. Mr. Biery, the undertaker, placed her on the cooling board after the examination.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"474\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b963-7\">The wound on the right ear was contused, with bruised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"928\">*928</page-number>flesh, with break of flesh in. front of the ear. His emergency grip was about 8 by 16 inches, and from 1 to 6 inches deep. He did not give any alarm as he went to his brother\u2019s house. He went so fast he did not think about it. He thought some one would get there as fast as he did. He remembered his direction distinctly. There was no blood on the rug when the body was laid on it, to his knowledge. The rug was shown him, and he said he could not identify it. The gown was shown, but he could not identify it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"475\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b964-6\">Prior to that \u2019phone message he had not been out of his house since 5 P. M. He did not go to church. He did not observe fumes of smoke until he made a light in the hall. Hever before in his life had it been necessary to administer medicine to Sam. Sam did not take medicine, and he had been his family physician for the last two or three years. He offered to give Sam what he thought proper, but Sam refused it, remarking he thought he could stand it. The medicine was a hypodermic of strychnia and morphia\u2014 the strychnia to stimulate, and the morphia to calm, the system \u2014 but he refused it, \u2022 as he always had refused medicine. He had his instruments. Dr. Early had previously drawn his syringe out and was preparing it. He asked him to take care of William McOue, and he would attend his brother. Sam seemed to be suffering a good deal all the time he was there.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"476\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b964-7\">When he first entered his brother\u2019s room he could not recall the position of Mrs. McCue\u2019s clothes. Some of them were on her chair to the left of the wardrobe, but he did not know what clothes. He could not say if the chamber was in order.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"477\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b964-8\">The gun was shown him, but he could not say whose gun it was. He could not say if the chiffonier, bed, &amp;c., were in the same position as that night. He could say for certain if he could point out to the jury the position they were in that night. When he reached there his brother seemed dazed, and could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"929\">*929</page-number>only give him an indefinite history, and would not answer questions, and continued that way for a day or two afterwards. He could never get it .out of him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"478\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b965-6\">As well as he could remember, he heard water running in the bath-room while on the steps. Sam never told him where to look for Fannie, and stated nothing to indicate if he knew she was living or dead. He went and looked for her. Sam lives in Charlottesville, and she was killed in this city. He thought Sam was in his room when the gun was found, and John Perry stated whose it was. Sam came just inside the bath-room door while the body was on the rug. He acknowledged saying b\u00e9fore the coroner\u2019s jury, \u201cas well as I remember he was standing just outside the bath-room, in the doorway,\u201d but that was the first time Sam ever said anything. He did not put that in. It just did not come to his mind; it has come since.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"479\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b965-7\">On cross-examination this witness stated that he recognized his brother\u2019s voice at the \u2019phone, and the message was, \u201cCome down here, Frank, right quick. Somebody is in the house, knocked me senseless and possibly shot Fannie.\u201d That is all that was said. He did not stop on the way to his brother\u2019s, nor go into any other yard on the way, nor speak to any one. There cannot possibly be any mistake about that. He was perfectly sure that he went without pause or stop from his house to his brother\u2019s. The front door was ajar when he arrived. He went upstairs without going into the lower rooms. Sam was about five steps from the top of the stairs. When he entered the house John Perry was going towards the stairs, between the front door and the stairsteps. They went up the steps together, passing Sam on the steps. He observed the wound on his brother\u2019s face when he first saw him on the steps. There was a light in the hall. Sam was in a stooping position, with his head on one hand and the other on his side. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"930\">*930</page-number>He would not be positive that his brother had on slippers \u2022when he saw him on the steps, but after considering it was positive that he had on slippers. There was a gas jet in the upper hall, which he lighted, but no light in the bath-room when he entered. The cold water spigot was not running. He could not say whether the hot water spigot was running full force or partially. In the excitement he did not observe it. When he entered the bath-room Grady was just behind him. When he said she was dead Sam said, r&lt;Oh, my God, my darling wife,\u201d and sank at the window, and he could not see who lead him away, but the voice was that of a woman, but he could not see who she was. That could only have been a few minutes after he arrived. She was out of the tub then. Sam asked her condition, and when told made the above exclamation. He had not removed his hat. After taking her out of the tub, Grady and he shut the door and searched the back room, up the staircase, and then went downstairs and searched the parlor.- At first the bath-room door was partially opened. Position of the bath-tub was described. The door opens into the bath-room and comes in contact with the bathtub when opened. He was on his knees when searching the bath-room with Dr. Venable and Dr. Early that night. A careful search was made of it. While on his knees he used matches and the gas jet was turning. The search was made for evidences of this trouble. The gas jet was burning brightly. Hothing at that time was discovered. He was an active participant in the search. He looked all over the floor. He did not think it possible for a piece of shirt to have escaped his search. Ho such thing was seen by either searcher. That search was made just after the preliminary examination and the permanent examination called for \u2014 he could not state the time of night \u2014 late the same night of the death of Mrs. McCue.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"480\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b966-6\">The wound on her nose was small and contused, with some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"931\">*931</page-number>discoloration, with slight incision, about a quarter of an inch in length, about the center, and on the left side. It was not a severe wound. The wound on her right ear, or right side of her head, was a contused wound. He could not state its effect. He thought it would produce insensibility, but could not say how long insensibility would have lasted. Euby\u2019s room, with the window open, was in the rear of their chamber. The lower third, or right hand, window in the parlor was open, and the blinds were wide open. It opens on the front porch and has inside blinds. \u00bb They did not go into the dining-room and kitchen, and did not know their condition. His brother was on the sofa when he tendered him the physic, and complained of suffering with pain in the head. He seemed to be suffering from general pain in his head. Dr. Early gave my brother\u2019s son, William, some medicine to produce sleep, but he did not know what it was.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"481\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b967-6\">The wound on his brother\u2019s face produced swelling, discoloration, and the skin was broken, and some blood running from it. It was caused by a blunt instrument with some surface. It might have been made from a sandbag. He could not state certainly how a sandbag was made. It has a good deal of surface, and the contents solid. With a leather or cloth filled with sand or small shot, it would be possible to knock his brother unconscious \u2014 render him senseless. As to the injury produced by the surface of the bag, he could not say exactly, but it would be a good blow to produce that injury. The insensibility from such a blow is caused by concussion. He could not state if a base-ball bat would produce it. He could not state certainly that his brother\u2019s nose was bleeding when he first saw him. When called back in the chamber he noticed Sam was suffering a good deal of pain, and seemed overcome. The pillow showed his nose was bleeding. He saw blood issuing from his brother\u2019s nose. That is one of the symptoms <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"932\">*932</page-number>of a severe blow on the head. It is possible that his nose would bleed from a. severe blow on the head at some place other than the nose or face. It is one of the results looked for from such a blow. He found other soiled clothes on top of the undershirt in the basket. As far as he knew, it was found in the regular clothes-basket. He was told by some one it was in the clothes-basket, and that statement was made in Sam\u2019s presence and hearing. Ho objection was made to any article of clothing being taken. The undershirt was so torn as to expose his breast. After a while lady friends of his wife began to arrive. If he had been in his natural condition he would have thought that he should not go where ladies were with his shirt in that condition. It was some little time before he changed his shirt. T)r. McCue thought he put on a negligee shirt that was checked.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"482\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b968-6\">Re-examined:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"483\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b968-7\">\u25a0 Before Mr. Gilmer left the house the last time after the special examination, he asked witness to get the shirt, and leave it with Mr. Biery, as well as he remembered. It was early in the night when Mr. Gilmer asked for the shirt \u2014 about the time the doctors were sent for. He was not excited at the \u2019phone message. He did not tie his shoes or button, his collar before he set out for his brother\u2019s after receiving the message, lie had seen a sandbag, but had never examined its contents.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"484\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b968-8\">Dr. Charles S. Venable testified that he was a practicing physician, residing in Charlottesville. He first learned of the tragedy .while putting his horse in a livery stable, and went straight to McOue\u2019s house, and arrived there between half an hour and an hour after it occurred, accompanied by Dr. Browning. When he first entered the house he was asked to go upstairs. There were a great many people at the house, all excited. At the top of the steps he was met by Dr. McCue, who asked him in the bath-room, where the body was found. They <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"933\">*933</page-number>examined it. The floor was wet, a little rug was on the floor, which was saturated with water and a little blood on the head end of the tub, streaked down. From the bath-room he went into the hall. Later he asked Dr. McCue how his brother Sam was getting on. Dr. McCue said he was doing pretty well, and said go in and see him. He went into the front room to speak to J. Samuel McCue, found him on a lounge, lying down, and one or two other gentlemen in the room, including Judge Duke. Dr. Browning, going just about the same time, spoke to and shook hands with McCue. Fie sat on the edge of the sofa a moment talking to McCue, and expressing his sympathy, and McCue thanked him. He asked McCue how it happened, and McCue said he did not know, it was all so quick; that some one had run in, he thought, from Kuby\u2019s room, grappled with him, and it was all over so quickly he really did not know how it was. As witness was about to leave, some one mentioned something about a bat. McCue asked, \u201cIs she dead?\u201d Dr. McCue came from behind him to his brother\u2019s side and said in an undertone, \u201cYes, she is dead.\u201d McCue said, \u201cOh, my God.\u201d Witness then again expressed his sympathy for McCue, and bade him good night, after asking if there was anything he could do, and offering to do it, if there was. He was holding McCue\u2019s hand when he asked the question about Mrs. McCue, and Dr. McCue answered it. He noticed some change in his pulse, and nervousness at the time. He was surprised that McCue did not know she was dead, and at his question and expression. His expression was unchanged. There was neither excitement nor grief. There was no tremor of his hand. On McCue\u2019s face, just about his cheek, which he was wiping with a handkerchief, was oozing a little blood. (Dr. Venable shows place of wound on his own face.) It was an abrasion, just a\u00e1 a child will fall down and skin its knee on a brick pavement\u2014 scrape the skin off. There was no bruise or swelling observed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"934\">*934</page-number>by him. It was caused by a glancing lick. A heavy blow at that place would be bound to have a great deal of diffused blood under the skin, what is commonly called a black eye. The tissues there are much looser than in other parts, and, therefore, blood can diffuse, and does diffuse, more easily and from slighter injury there than elsewhere. You (to the jury) have all observed that a man\u2019s eye will swell there from kidney disease because it lets the fluid out into the tissues. The tissues are looser. Witness examined the wound the next day about noon. There was no swelling- or diffused blood (ecchymosis) in the skin at all. McCue said he had pain, or soreness, at the back of the head, but could not locate it. He looked through McCue\u2019s hair pretty carefully, but could find no evidence of a bruise or any other mark. It is possible for a man to be struck by a sapdbag on the hair and knocked insensible without causing any mark. Possibly there would be some swelling afterwards, he imagined. He never saw a sandbag, but did not see how such a lick could be had without causing a knot the next day, but there might not be an abrasion the next day. The only evidence of a blow he saw was the abrasion on the right cheek. Afterwards he examined McCue\u2019s hands, arms, and around his neck, but did not <em>go-down </em>to his waist or feet. He had seen wounds like it most frequently in foot-ball players, by scratching the face on the ground, or walking into the edge of a house or bricks that would be rough, and which would just scrape the skin off; remove the epidermis without producing a bruise. In addition, it would give a blueness and swelling before it would remove the top skin, without injuring the top skin. There was no evidence or sign.of any injury to his mouth or teeth \u2014 they were examined. If a lick had been struck on the cheek at that place sufficient to produce insensibility it would have produced an enormous swelling, the eye blackened, probably closed, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number>the bone in all probability fractured \u2014 if struck by a sandbag* even. A blow on the front of the face does not readily produce unconsciousness. As he was leaving the house Dr. Early asked him to see the body. He looked at it, and Dr. Early removed the sheet and showed him the wound. He did not care to see it. He did not think it had then been cleaned and prepared by the undertaker. At that time he made no examination of the wound \u2014 just stood at the head of the bed and saw there was a chest wound \u2014 the gown having been pulled back over it. There was a hole or burnt mark in the gown, and that was pulled up so he could see the wound. It was a gunshot wound. The gown was wet, but no blood stains on it at all at that time. There was a little stain about the neck, but none on the gown, which he imagined came from her nose or ear. At that time he went straight home, but was later called back to make a thorough examination \u2014 about twelve o\u2019clock that night, or a little after. He made that examination with Dr. Early; Dr. McCue requesting that he should not be called on to look into the case as an expert, but he went into the room with them to see them make the examination, of which they were very glad. Mr. Biery (the undertaker) was just outside the door when they went in the room. Dr. McCue had a candle; the gas being bad and on the far side of the room. The body had not been disturbed since he first saw it. After calling Dr. McCue\u2019s and Mr. Biery\u2019s attention to the fact that there was no blood on the gown except about the neck, they came to the breast of the gown where there was an angular place where the gunshot had gone through and torn the gown. Above was a linear tear up, and ripped across above the hole made by the gunshot. The lace around the collar, at the neck, was torn off, or not entirely off, but ripped away from the neck band. Eirst, her right-ear had been struck by a blunt instrument in a downward and backward direction, as the cartilage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>just at the angle of the ear was torn. There was an incised or lacerated wound torn right through the ear. The ear was much discolored. There was a discoloration all around that portion of the head and behind. The ear had bled freely, and the blood had worked down the side of her neck. The next wound examined was the one on the nose, which was a small lacerated wound on the left side of the nose, which had bled, and the blood streamed down her face, and was dried there. No bones were broken in the nose, or on the skull, or about the head. The next wound examined was a small transverse wound just at the back of the head, probably a quarter or a half inch long, but with no bruise, and a very small amount of blood, very little, which he concluded happened after death, as there was no blood or anything about it. He thought it was produced by a glancing lick very readily by falling and hitting the head on the bath-tub. The body was examined before the gunshot wound was, but there were no wounds or anything the matter anywhere else. When they came to the gunshot wound, the gown was pulled back, and there were powder marks right in the wound. There were none scattered around, but put your finger in the wound and you could get powder all over your finger. The shot went from the left downward, backward, and slightly to the right. It had entered right at the junction of the second rib and breast bone, leaving undisturbed the first rib and collar bone, where they join the breast bone. The breast bone was blown off backwards, so that its front half on the right side, or front quarter, was left intact, though fractured there. The shot went back through the aorta, which is the artery that comes from the heart and arches, and comes down. It went right through that arch, and there was an opening you could get your finger in. Shot was stuck in the spinal column on the right side, the majority going farther to the right, tearing all to pieces the fifth, sixth and seventh <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number>ribs on the right side. The wad was taken from the spinal \u25a0column, just behind the aorta. There was much disorganized blood all through the cavity. The lung had collapsed, and.the cavity was full of blood. The body was turned over to examine her back, to see if the shot came- through, and found they did not come through, but had come to the skin and were rolled with their fingers. All blood in the cavity passed through the hole, and the bed, gown, and everything became saturated with blood. That was all the examination that night. The next morning he was asked back to make a further examination, and found a broken finger nail and some marks on the neck as if they were left-handed marks. There were four on her right side; the second from the top being the deepest, third next, and fourth and first palest. On the other side was a single mark. He did not observe them the night before. They were discolored, bluish. In his opinion they indicated finger #iarks. That discoloration could not have been produced by handling the body after death. You cannot mark a body after death, nor bruise it. A bruise is the settling of blood in a part, and there is no blood circulating after death at all. They were produced before death. He saw no difference between McCue\u2019s physical and mental condition the night of the killing than the next day.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"485\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b973-6\">McCue did not go into details, and had no blood on his nose upon arrival. Dr. Browning went with him to see the body. When he first went to the house he went to the bath-room and examined it after the body had been removed. When he went to examine the body again about twelve he re-examined that room. The tub was empty. They examined the tub, the blood stains and streaks on the back of the tub, at the head end, extending from about the top and trickling down four or five inches, -and then stopped where it was washed and stopped. There was a rug on the floor. They got down and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"938\">*938</page-number>examined the floor and looked at the rug and floor, which was all saturated with water, and then they went up the hall looking at the floor and sides of the hall, looking for blood marks, and found none. He did not look under the bath-tub. He thought the wound on the ear could have been made with the base-ball bat. The gunshot wound caused death, momentarily\u2014 one or two, or possibly three, heart beats \u2014 practically instantaneous death. The body was measured. It was the same length as the bath-tub \u2014 -five feet and some inches \u2014 he could not remember the inches. He did not think it possible for a person shot as Mrs. McOue was to have gotten in the bath-tub and placed herself as Dr. McOue described her position when found. He did not think the wound on McCue\u2019s cheek would have caused unconsciousness. When they'examined the bathroom the door was opened, afterwards closed, and then opened when they were inside. They were looking for blood stains, but found none. They first saw the undershirt McOue had o:% Monday or Tuesday, during the coroner\u2019s inquest. Witness takes shirt and shows to the jury on the front of the shirt, at the lower end, where the buttons come together from the bottom, are what he took to be blood stains, and also lower down there is a faded condition of stains, such as would be produced by washing out blood, where it has been weted, as though done by washing out blood \u2014 water evidently having been on it. Over towards the left side there is another stain, which does not look like it had any water on it, and about the left shoulder of the arm, near the elbow, there is some more, a very dark one and with the characteristic stiffness about it, and it does not appear to have had water on it. On the wristband is a mark, then up to within an inch of that (indicating) there has .been water, and there is washed blood along the wrist-band, and along the edge, and on the back and all around the wrist-band, on the left side. This wrist-band (indicating) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"939\">*939</page-number>lias also been weted, and washed, and there is blood on that, just a little on the- front, on the right side, and it is washed around to the side. Blood on the back of the collar, back to the neckpiece, that has not been washed, and some further down and back over on the left side there are three marks which have not been washed. On the right side, about below the shoulder blade, some that have been washed. That is all he could find.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"486\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b975-6\">The gunshot wound could not have been inflicted on Mrs. McCue while in the bath-tub in the position described by Dr. McCue, because that would have put her left side against the wall. The wound was about an inch long, or an inch and a half, and an inch from above downward. The powder stains Avere in the wound, and right at the edges of the wound. The muzzle of the gun must have been very close because there was no scattering of powder or powder marks about the wound at all. It went in solid. The goAvn was identified, and the gunshot wound pointed out on it, and shown to the jury, and the tear and torn lace also. The gown was the only garment she had on when first seen. When she Avas turned over, the gown Avas torn down all the way and stripped back of her arms, and back under her. McCue was perfectly rational the night of the killing and the next day.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"487\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b975-7\">Cross-examined:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"488\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b975-8\">He meant that some blood spots on the shirt had been washed, not scrubed.

They did not get down on the floor. Many people were in and out the bath-room that night. He could not state if Dr. Early was present at the first examination of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"940\">*940</page-number>the bath-room. The gas was lighted, and he had a faint recollection of some one striking one or two matches. In the second examination of the bath-room, candle and matches, in addition to the gas, were used. They examined the room carefully for evidences of the crime. He could not say if any one else engaged in the search looked under bath-tub, but he never looked under it. He was not prepared to say that Dr. McCue did not look under the bath-tub. He imagined that the bath-tub was on iron legs, but could not swear what kind of legs. The bottom of the tub is two or three inches from the floor. He said he did not see the small piece of undershirt with blood on it while looking under the bath-tub, and did not know that he would have seen it if it had been there. The gas jet was over the tub, and a candle used to give better light on the floor. Dr. Early and Dr. McCue were present when the second search was made, and all three were looking over the room. It was not a scrutinizing search. The bath-room is not big; a good portion is taken up with the tub.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"490\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b976-6\">\u25a0 He might have stated before the coroner\u2019s jury that a person wounded like Mrs. McCue might have had six of seven heart beats, meaning a few, not literally two or three, and that she might have fallen into the tub after she was shot. A violent blow on the back of a man\u2019s head is likely to produce unconsciousness, but in his opinion there would be a swelling. It is practically impossible for a man with a heavy suit of hair like McCue to be hit on the back of the head with a sandbag a blow sufficient to cause unconsciousness, and not leave some external evidence of it. He did not see finger marks on Mrs. McOue\u2019s throat the night .she was killed, although he made a right careful examination, and she had been dead over an hour. The marks on a dead body become deeper the longer after death, because decomposition sets in, and the settling is greater. Decomposition sets in more rapidly and markedly where there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"941\">*941</page-number>has been an injury before death. Those marks must have been made during life, and could not have been done after death. She wore her finger nails quite long, and on the left\u2018hand one was broken to the end and turned back. He saw the undershirt while on McCue, but made no examination of it then, and also saw it the next morning.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"491\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b977-6\">Re-examined:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"492\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b977-7\">Did not see McCue touch his wife\u2019s body.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"493\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b977-8\">To a juror:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"494\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b977-9\">There was an oil-cloth matting on the bath-room floor.

At the time of the homicide he resided on Park street, just outside the corporation, about half a mile from McCue\u2019s. On his way to church the evening of the tragedy, when between Dr. H. T. Mels on\u2019s and Dr. Browning\u2019s, he saw Mrs. McCue cross the street in front of him, going from High street on the cross street to the Presbyterian church. She walked in front of him, to the Baptist church, when she stopped and spoke to a colored man. When he came up he told her, \u201cGood evening,\u201d and she replied, \u201cHold on, I wiE go with you.\u201d They then walked together to church, each going to his and her usual seat. She sits on the right and he on the left. Dr. Petrie is the pastor. Church opens at eight o\u2019clock. Service had not begun when he entered. It begun within not over three minutes. Mo one was with Mrs. McCue when he first saw her. It was two or three minutes of eight o\u2019clock.. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"942\">*942</page-number>She asked him if he had seen Sam. Sam came in a very short while after he did, and toook a- seat by his wife. The services had not regularly commenced, he thought, when Sam came in, but they might have played the voluntary, may be the first hymn. He did not see either of them after church, until they turned from High street into Park street. He did not know which left church first. He came from church up Market street to Fourth, and then across the courthouse yard, entering High street at the corner of that yard \u2014 the nearest way to come. He was alone. When he got on Park street, near Edward McCue\u2019s house, and wanting to see Sam and his wife, he stopped to see if they were coming; being satisfied he was ahead of them, and seeing them enter Park street. He walked leisurely until he came to their gate, and stopped until thej came up. When they came up he said, \u201cYou all walk slower than usual to-night.\u201d Mrs. McCue remarked that they had been talking to some one on High street who walked very slowly,- which delayed them. Both of them asked that he should go into their house, but, having been to the country all day, was tired, and his wife being at home, he went home. He did not remember the time, but was under the impression he looked at his watch and it was five minutes after nine when he got to the corner of High and Park streets, but he did not know, and was not accurate \u2014 probably between five and ten minutes after nine when he got to High street. He did not know how long Mr. Petrie\u2019s service lasted that night. It never lasts over an hour, sometimes shorter, but there is no specified time. He did not stop in front of McCue\u2019s house over three' minutes. He told them of the death of one of McCue\u2019s cousins in Maryland, and asked Mrs. McCue after friends at Bed Hill and where her little girl was. When they parted he went home and to bed. He received information of the killing from a negro <em>man </em>who had just come from McCue\u2019s. He got up, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"943\">*943</page-number>and lie and^his wife went to McCue\u2019s. The colored man who told him of the killing said it was eleven, and he supposed it took half an hour to get to McCue\u2019s. The streets were lighted that night, but he did not remember about the moon and stars. When they arrived McCue was lying on a lounge, and said he was suffering from a lick in his face and on the back of his head, and Mrs. McCue was dead. He said some one had come in the room, knocked him down, and shot his wife. He said he was knocked senseless while he was standing near the chiffonier and Mrs. McCue on the other side of the room, at a dressing case. He did not remember or ask McCue the exact part of the room he was in when struck. McCue said it was all done so quick he could not tell how it was done, and Mrs. McCue ran out, he (Hinwiddie) supposed. McCue said when the man first came in-he (McCue) tried to get his gun, and did get it partly out of the case when the man took it from him. The gun was between the wardrobe and the' wall. McCue did not say he was standing or what, but was in that part of the room farther from the door than Mrs. McCue was standing when the man entered. McCue said he had his gun partly out of the case when it was taken from him and he knocked senseless. This conversation took place in his room between 11:30 and 12 o\u2019clock. McCue said he was also suffering from \u25a0a fall, and seemed to be rational while talking. He saw a bruise on McCue\u2019s face \u2014 some abrasion and bruise on the right cheek. He did not examine McCue. Several doctors had been in there. McCue asked him to see about the house, and he went from place to place looking after the house and things, not staying long in any place. He left the house at six o\u2019clock the next morning, and went home. After staying two hours he returned to McOue\u2019s. Hot to his knowledge did Sam see his wife that night. Most of that Monday morning he was about McCue\u2019s, and McCue, to his knowledge, never saw his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"944\">*944</page-number>wife. After her body was dressed he asked McCue if he wished to see the remains. McCue said he would prefer remembering, her as she lived. He again asked McCue when they were' ready to place the body in the coffin, and McCue went to see it. several times afterwards. He would not 'have asked McCue to see his wife until she was dressed, under any circumstances. It was morning when he first asked McCue if he wished to see his wife. The body was not put in the casket until the next afternoon. Mrs. Dinwiddie remained all that night. He did not know of the house being robbed of anything, and never heal\u2019d McCue or anyone else say the house had been robbed of anything.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"498\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b980-6\">Cross-examined:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"499\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b980-7\">McCue and his wife were walking together when he saw them on Park street. Ho one was with them then. They gave him a cordial invitation to come in their house that night. He saw nothing unusual about them \u2014 nothing at all that indicated strained relations. Their deportment to each other and to him was pleasant. Her body was in the boy\u2019s room when he arrived. Afterwards, and after the physicians had . examined the body, he assisted in handling and dressing it to prepare it for burial. At that time there was a great deal of blood on the body and bed, and he got a great deal of blood on his hands. After they had finished dressing the body and covered it up with the undertaker\u2019s cloth, they went to work to get the. bedding out of the room. The bedding and her gown were bloody, and they had to handle it to get it out the window. Biery said he had been requested to save the gown for the coroner\u2019s jury, and he was rolling the gown up in a piece of paper, and then he said he had been requested to get the shirt too \u2014 the undershirt McCue had worn. Dr. McCue offered to get it. Dr. McCue went and brought it in his hands and handed it to Dinwiddie, and Dinwiddie handed it to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"945\">*945</page-number>Biery. They had been handling the bloody clothes and had not washed their hands. Biery had not washed his hands after* handling the clothes saturated in blood when he handled the-shirt, and so did he (Dinwiddie). He supposed that Biery' rolled the shirt up and put it with the gown. McCue said he= had his gun partly out of its case when the man took it from him. The bruise on McCue\u2019s right cheek was about the size of a quarter. It did not require a critical examination to see the bruise on his cheek. A mere casual glance would show the bruise and some swelling. After the body was prepared he (McCue) took his little children and went in the room where the body was. There was nothing unusual about McCue\u2019s distress, and he seemed much distressed, just like any other man. They cannot realize it at first or comprehend it. McCue was excited, like any other man. The coroner\u2019s inquest was held in McCue\u2019s house, in Willie\u2019s room, and McCue was subject to all the excitement and agony natural thereto.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"500\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b981-6\">Be-examined:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"501\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b981-7\">When McCue went first to see the body Monday evening he only went with him, and it was afterwards the children went-with their father. He did not hold the- undershirt long, passed it to Biery, and right straight Biery rolled it up. He could not recall who went in the room where the body was with McCue and his children, but think there were others. McCuewent that time at his own instance. He knew nothing about the gun.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"502\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b981-8\">Chas. A. Skinner (a colored man) testified that he was borrc. December 18, 1870, and lived at Mr. Moran\u2019s the night of the' killing. That night he\u2019 was in his room in an outhouse back o\u00a3 Moran\u2019s house, occupying an upstairs room nearest McCue\u2019s.On the night of Sunday, the 4th day of September, he was lying\" on his bed in his room, with his night shirt on, reading the Wash<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"946\">*946</page-number>ington Sunday Post, when he heard crying and screaming. He .did not pay much attention to it at first, and kept on reading. After a while he got up and looked out the window on the lane. At first he did not know where the crying and screaming came from, but while at the window ascertained it came from McDue\u2019s. It was like some one in distress, as if some one was .dead. He had not heard of any one being sick or dead at Mc-.Oue\u2019s. He remained at the window a little while, and returned \u2022to his bed and reading. Then he heard a shot, when he dropped the paper, and in a few minutes went to the window again. James Lewis was talking under Moran\u2019s back porch to Lelia Henderson, the maidservant. He told them something had happened at McCue\u2019s and called James Lewis to the window. When James came to his window they talked awhile, may be <em>&amp; </em>minute. He (Skinner) had on his night-shirt, and he put on his pants, shoes, coat and hat, and came down and stood prob.ably a minute. Presently he heard footsteps running in front \u00abof Moran\u2019s on the pavement. He started out of the back gate into the lane, and asked two men who went into McOue\u2019s back gate what had happened. They said look out, and he said, \u2022\u201cWait a few minutes; let me get out,\u201d and he came out of 'McOue\u2019s back gate into Moran\u2019s back gate, which are nearly \u00abopposite, and came around in front of Moran\u2019s and McCue\u2019s 'houses. Lots of people had then come \u2014 kept going in and \u00abcoming out of McCue\u2019s gate. After awhile a gentleman told him what had happened. After awhile he called Moran and -told him what had happened. Mrs. Moran answered and told Mr. Moran, who presently came down and went into McCue\u2019s house. He was looking out of a small window nearest McCue\u2019s house. Mr. Moran was occupying the room upstairs and farthest from McCue\u2019s on the opposite side. The crying and screaming he heard was like a woman, and was going on three or five minutes before he got up, probably longer. He did not re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"947\">*947</page-number>member hearing a man\u2019s voice at all. There was a light upstairs at McCue\u2019s, but could not say in which room. It seems as if he saw only one light, towards the front of the house. It was a pretty fair night. He had only his night-shirt on, and all the windows were up. After the shot he heard no noise there for awhile, but when he got downstairs he heard heavy crying, like a man. He heard no crying or screaming after the shot until he' dressed and came into the yard. He saw no one run out of McCue\u2019s back yard after the shooting. He had lived with Moran two years in the coming December, most of the time in Washington. They only spend the summer here. He had been living in Charlottesville two or three months this summer. He had never been in McCue\u2019s house or yard until the coroner\u2019s inquest.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"503\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b983-6\">Dr. J. E. Early testified that he practiced medicine in the Marine Hospital one year, and then had practiced in Charlottesville over ten years, and resides at 409 Park street. He had retired the night of September 4, and heard a police whistle diagonally across the street at E. O. McCue\u2019s, or in that neighborhood. He got out of bed, went to his window, and stood there to hear and find out what was going on. He heard a colored man say some one had broken into Sam McCue\u2019s house. Thinking it was only a trivial affair, he went to bed again. The police whistle continuing to blow, he went to the window again. He noticed some one going into G. B. Sinclair\u2019s house. There was a light inside. He went to the \u2019phone and- asked what was the matter. Some one in a lady\u2019s voice said Sam McCue\u2019s house had been broken into and Mrs. McCue shot. He dressed and went to see what he could do. When he arrived at McCue\u2019s, in his lower hall, some one asked him to\u00b0go upstairs and see what he could do for them. He went into Me Cue\u2019s chamber and found McCue lying on the floor, face down, crying, and William on the bed. There were several <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"948\">*948</page-number>ladies in the room, hut he could not recall them. Not seeing; any physician there, he fixed something to quiet them. He took out his hypodermic case and started to fix something,, when Dr. McOue came in. He told him he was fixing something for Sam, and he could go ahead and attend him. Dr. McOue said, \u201cYou attend to William, and I will attend to. Sam.\u201d He induced William to go into another room. William is McCue\u2019s oldest son. He treated William, and quieted him. He then returned to Sam\u2019s chamber. As he entered Dr. McOue said, \u201cDoctor, I wish you would give this to Sam. He will not. take it 5 won\u2019t let me give it to him.\u201d He went to Sam, who was then lying on the sofa, and said, \u201cSam, I want to give-you something to quiet you.\u201d Sam said, \u201cEmmet Early, you nor Prank (Dr. McOue) either one can\u2019t give me a hypodermic-of morphia\u201d; that he had never taken it, and did not want to. They put up their hypodermics. Sam spoke rather commandingly. He did not remember what transpired during the next few minutes. He had no conversation with Sam at all that night. He was requested that night to examine Mrs. McOue\u2019s body for the coroner\u2019s inquest. When he saw Sam lying on the floor he saw no injuries, but when he returned to the room saw a bruise-on Sam\u2019s right cheek, and he was wiping it with his handkerchief, and there seemed to be blood. He did not examine the-injury at all that night. It seemed to be a slight abrasion,, but he did not make a thorough examination until the next-day. -It was just over his cheek bone. The next day the-coroner asked him and Dr. Yenable to examine McOue from head to feet. On his cheek they found a slight abrasion, like-a foot-ball man, or some one sliding on the face, or like a boy knocking his knee on the sand, a very slight contusion, and\" looked as if it had been scratched with something. Then they examined McCue\u2019s head, parted his hair and examined it thoroughly, and found no bruise or contusion. Then they looked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"949\">*949</page-number>from the top of his head to his toes, and found no bruise or cut of any hind. The scalp was examined thoroughly, but there was no sign of injury. This examination was made Monday morning, after the tragedy. It was the following day, he could not say whether morning or afternoon. There was comparatively no swelling on his cheek' \u2014 no bruise or discoloration whatever.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"504\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b985-6\">He saw Mrs. McOue\u2019s body Sunday night shortly after he arrived there. He got there about 9 :30, and about three-quarters or half an hour afterwards the coroner got his jury. The coroner asked him to examine the body for the jury, which he did. He noticed a cut on the bridge of the .nose, and some bleeding. The body was then in the northwest room. He pulled down the sheet, and noticed an incised wound on the nose, from which a small amount of blood had flown; but no broken bones. The right ear was cut almost in two, as if a lick had been struck from above downward and backward like. It skinned the ear, and cut it in two for a short space, perhaps half an inch. -Then there was a marked contusion on the front and rear of the ear. The ear was held together by a small part, and had bled a good deal. On the back of the head there was a very slight cut, perhaps a quarter of an inch. Turning her gown down there was an opening in her chest, at the left of the chest bone, about an inch below the clavicle, under the collar bone. He made no further examination at that time, thinking what he had done was sufficient. In his opinion the gunshot wound caused the death. After that he returned home and retired. At the first examination there was no blood on the gown, except a little near the neck. There was only a little blood stain near the wound, no spurting or arterial bleeding. After returning home and retiring, about 12 o\u2019clock, some one knocked at the door. He went to the door, and found the Attorney for the Commonwealth. The Attorney for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"950\">*950</page-number>Common-wealth requested him to return, and to make a more thorough examination with another physician. He suggested Dr. Venable, who was then \u2019phoned up. Afterwards he returned to McCue\u2019s, and, with Dr. Venable, accompanied by Dr. McCue, made a more thorough examination of the body, finding the wound on the head as described. In the chest wound he introduced his finger to find the direction .of the load. It penetrated downward, backward and to the right, cutting* off the inner extremity of the second rib, tearing away a portion of the breast bone, the left side of it, where it joins the second rib, and breaking the bone above in small pieces where it joins the first rib. It went downward and backward, cutting in two on the back of the right side the ends of the fifth, sixth, and seventh ribs, or fourth, fifth, and sixth ribs. He tried to get out some shot, but they were very small, perhaps sixes or sevens, or perhaps eights. He found gun wads on the front of the back bone \u2014 one was of leather. The flesh around the wound, and going into it, was colored with powder marks. The gown had been penetrated by the load. There was a tear abov\u00e9 the gunshot hole. Then the body was turned over, and the blood flowed from the cavity. The whole cavity seemed filled with clotted blood. It poured out on the bed and gown. Just under the skin the shot had come through. Ho other-' injury was found. Then Dr. Venable, Dr. McCue and himself went and examined the bath-room. There was some blood on the north side of the tub, at the top. Then they struck matches and looked on the sides of the walls, facings, &amp;c., to see if blood could be found, but found none. There was a rug on the floor, and that and the floor were saturated with water. This examination was between 12 and 2 A. M. Monday morning. He did not look under the bath-tub, as it was wet. He did not think the floor was examined. He did not think the blow on McCue\u2019s cheek could have produced insensibility. There <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"951\">*951</page-number>was no indication of a blow on the head found when examined the next morning. If McCue had been struck by a sandbag,, or any instrument sufficiently hard to have produced insensibility, there would have been some evidence of it at the point-struck. It would be impossible to knock a man senseless without some contusion, no matter what the instrument used. There-were marks on Mrs. McCue\u2019s neck as if she had been choked by a left-hand grip. There were the impression of four fingers in a vertical line as if it had slipped somewhat, and on the left side one horizontal line. It looked as if the tissues had been a little disintegrated before death, and some blood forced into those tissues. He paid little attention to them that night, but the next day they were marked. If a person were choked and died shortly afterwards there would be some slight disintegration of the tissues, and after death the blood from the surrounding tissues would be forced into this from low vitality. It was bruised, a contusion like. Those bruises could not have been produced after death. Any lick about the eye nearly always causes a swelling and discoloration. There was the least little swelling on McCue\u2019s cheek when he saw him that night \u2014 no discoloration.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"505\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b987-6\">That gunshot wound would have caused almost instantaneous death. She might have breathed once or twice. After that wound he thought she would have dropped in her tracks. The gun inflicting that wound was not over two feet from her. The wound on the ear might have been caused by the base-ball bat. He did not see McCue\u2019s nose bleeding. The wound on McCue\u2019s face could not have been caused by a base-ball bat. The undershirt is proved to be in the same condition as when shown to the coroner\u2019s jury. The stains on it look like blood. The spots that have not come in contact with water, and those that have come in contact with water, were pointed out on the shirt. McCue always appeared as a stout, vigorous man. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>thought McOue about 45, and weighed from 150 to 160, and his wife would weigh about 115 to 125 pounds.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"506\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b988-6\">Oross-examination:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"507\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b988-7\">They saw nothing of the piece of undershirt while searching the bath-room floor. If it was under the tub he would not have .seen it. He did not make a thorough examination of the floor, .and did not know if Dr. McOue and Dr. Venable did. The wound on McOue\u2019s face could not have been struck by an instrument, or sandbag, so as to have produced unconsciousness. .A lick to cause unconsciousness would produce some contusion, \u2022or laceration. He never saw an injury from a sandbag. The blow on Mrs. McOue\u2019s temple is too low to have produced \u2022death by itself. He did not examine the skull to see if there was a fracture, but there was no incision, and it was not probed. He could not say if any bones were broken there.

It was impossible for both parties to have been standing when she was shot. The charge was practically not deflected, and from its direction the position of the parties could be ascertained. McOue\u2019s mind was perfectly clear. The shot lodged in her back about 3 inches to the right and 4 inches below the entrance. He put his finger in the wound and felt shot in her back and broken ribs. She was about 4 or 5 inches through \u2014 very thin. She was about 5 feet 1 inch.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"513\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b988-13\">O. L.

There was a partial draft on the spigot below, or at some other part of the house, at the time at which the tub was full to the overflow' spout. The total time from turning on the water until it reached the overflow spout was twenty-five minutes and fifteen seconds. The water was stopped in part three times for ten seconds, twenty seconds, and ten seconds, respectively, caused by partial draft on the pipe at other places. In his opinion the pipe was running only half of its capacity. It required twenty-four minutes and fifty-five seconds to fill the tub. The tub wras first emptied. To the overflow pipe the tub holds forty-five gallons. Prom the bottom of the tub to the overflow spout is 11 3-4 inches at the centre of the tub, measuring endwise and crosswise. The human body weighs about the same as water. A body weighing about 115 pounds would displace 115 pounds of water. Water weighs about eight pounds to the gallon, therefore, that body would displace about twelve gallons of water. It would depend on how much of the body was immersed as to how much it would displace. Placing a body of the weight as Mrs. McOue\u2019s body is represented to have been, and the tub as represented, it would take thirty gallons of water to fill that tub, requiring 16 2-3 minutes; if the entire body was submerged, and more if less of it was submerged. He turned the spigot at right angles and straight up, and it took the same time to fill a two-gallon bucket, viz., one minute and fifteen seconds. In the day time a steam pump throws water into the main, and at night less is used, and the pressure is about the same day and night. More water is consumed in the day time than at night. The pressure, when he tested it, was about the same as on Sunday night.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"515\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b989-6\">H. A.

Dinwiddie passed him the undershirt. The shirt was identified, and was in just about the same condition as then. When he first received it he laid it at the foot end of the bed on the floor, and no blood was there. Afterwards he wrapped it up separately. The shirt was laid to itself. Afterwards he took it to his home and put it in his office and locked it up. It was wrapped up in a newspaper \u2014 in two 'or three thicknesses of newspaper. The next morning a party came for the shirt and gown. They were wrapped up separately. They were delivered to Mr. John Gilmore (his employer) and Mr. Rogers, the sergeant. He did not think there was any blood on his hands when he received the shirt from Dinwiddie. He had washed his hands before he took the shirt. He did not remember how long after the body was cleansed before the shirt was delivered to him. The body had then been embalmed, and was on the cooling board. Her body had finger marks on her throat when he first took charge of it. He observed them when he washed the body. He saw the marks the next day, and they were a little more distinct.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"516\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b990-6\">Cross-examined:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"517\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b990-7\">He did not see McOue until the next day.

He got a paper to wrap the shirt in from off the wardrobe and wrapped up the gown afterwards. He thought later he wrapped up the gown first, but could nbt say for sure. He knew he did not wrap the shirt and gown together, so no blood from the gown could get on the shirt. The Attorney for the Commonwealth told him to keep them separate. Dinwiddie was there and heard it, but he could not say as to Dr. McOue. He could not say who brought him the undershirt, but Mr. Dinwiddie handed it to him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"518\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b991-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"955\">*955</page-number>D. O. Grady testified that lie is a policeman of Charlottesville. He first heard of the hilling when he went into the police office at the City Hall to get a drink of water, about two squares from the court-house. The \u2019phone rang and he answered it. Some one asked who he was, and he replied, \u201cPoliceman Grady,\u201d and they either said, \u201cCome or go to Sam McCue\u2019s as quick as you can get there; there is a robber in the house.\u201d He dropped the \u2019phone, went out, and rapped to see if he could get another policeman, but getting\u2019 no answer, started as fast as he could go, and at the next corner recognized Percy Payne. He called Payne to come with him to McCue\u2019s, as there was trouble there, and they ran on ont Park street. On Park street he met two young men, one of whom had a shotgun on his shoulder. That was somewhere near Randolph\u2019s house. They put a shell in the gun and joined us. When we got to McCue\u2019s lane he sent Percy Payne with the gun and the others down the lane into McCue\u2019s back yard, to surround the house, with orders not to let any one come out of the house or yard. After giving them a chance to get to the rear of the house, as they had farther to go than he, he went in the front yard at McCue\u2019s and up into the house. He met Dr. McCue and a colored boy in the lower hall. It was the colored boy that works there, and he thought his name was John Perry, and he asked them what was the trouble, and McCue said, \u201cSomebody had nearly killed him, and he reckoned had killed his wife,\u201d or something to that amount. That is what Sam McCue told him. McCue was holding his head with one hand and his chest with the other, and said his head hurt awfully, or his chest.or breast hurt him worse than his head. McCue said he believed they were in the house. He told the boy to bring a lantern, and, hearing Dr. McCue on.the upper floor, he went up there until they met.. They went into the bathroom, and he told the boy to light all the lamps and fix the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"956\">*956</page-number>lantern quickly, so' the house could be searched. The boy did it. They went from room to room, and the house was searched. Mrs. McOue was lying flat on her back in the bath-room, and he thought the gas was lighted. McOue was inside the door, or just about the door, and Dr. McOue told him his wife was dead. She was lying on the rug when he first got there. When Dr. McOue said she was dead McOue said, \u201cOh, my God, my Maker, who could have had enough against me to ldll my poor wife and do me as they have done,\u201d or something to that amount. Dr. McOue asked witness to assist him place her on a bed, and they took her in a room and placed her on a bed. Perry was right around there then, seeing about the lamps and things. It was not many minutes before Mr. Tom Williams came. He thought Williams the first after him to come, but would not be certain, but it was not long before several came. McOue and the boy were about the parlor door when he first got there. After searching the house he searched the yard, trying to keep people off the grass so as not to interfere with any bloodhounds that might be brought. He remained there that night. When he got in the house William and his father had just met, and he heard the father tell the son \u201chis dear mother was dead,\u201d and William broke out into, a powerful scream, both seemed to be taMng it mighty hard, crying and screaming. Afterwards McOue told him \u201che (McOue) was undressed and heard a rattling at the door, and turned his head' and looked, and from what time he had to see the person, that he seemed to be a tall, dirty looking white man, like he had be\u00e9n on the train or tramping. He seemed to be greasy and dirty. Pie had such little time he could hardly describe him. McOue said he reached for his gun, but the man grabbed him before he could get the gun, and he and the man had a considerable scuffle before .he was knocked out, and did not remember anything after he was knocked out. He said the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"957\">*957</page-number>man got hold of him before he got his gun, or got it in position to shoot him. He (Grady) did not remember exactly how McCue expressed it. McCue was excited and seemed to be suffering, and did not explain everything as it was, and Grady was in a hurry too. McCue did not say exactly where he was when he heard the rattling, but he was undressing, and Grady presumed McCue was near the bed. McCue said he and his wife were in the room undressing when the man came in, but did not say where his wife was. The young man he met near Randolph\u2019s was young Page, and he did not know the other. He was running down Park street when he met Page. He saw no one running in front of him as he came down Park street. Those two young men were the only persons he met on that street, but Tom Randolph said some one was ahead, but he never listened to what he had to say, as he was aiming to get there as soon as he could. When he first went in McOne\u2019s chamber there was a dim light, but there was light enough to see very well. He thought McCue said there was a lantern there, and he told the colored hoy to get it. McCue looked rational, but very much out of fix, and seemed to be suffering a good deal, complaining of his head and breast. One of the young men he met near Randolph\u2019s had the gun on his shoulder, in a cloth case, but full length. He noticed it was a gun before they met, but would not be certain if it was in a cloth case. The colored boy showed him through the house, and Dr. McCue assisted part of the time. Ho one was near McCue when Dr. McCue told him his wife was dead but Grady. The colored boy was near. The gun was in the upstairs passage when he got there, in the right hand corner by the bathroom door. He did not examine the gun that night, but the colored boy did. In his presence the colored boy broke the gun, and an empty cartridge fell out, and said there was no more loads in it. Grady never had it in his hands. He did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"958\">*958</page-number>not know whose gun it was, but they said it was McOue\u2019s. When they announced that his wife was dead he thought McOue retired to his room. At first he (McOue) looked like he was going to sink down when he heard his wife was dead. The gun was broken before Mrs. McOue\u2019s death was announced. A joolice whistle blew just before he got to McOue\u2019s. He did not know whose whistle it was, but later heard it was E. O. McOue\u2019s. Later heard a police whistle and went to it at E. O. McOue\u2019s. Everything was in all right condition in McOue\u2019s. chamber when he entered it. He did not notice Mrs. McCue\u2019s clothes. He did not remember if he found a gun besides the pump gun, with the empty shell, but he thought he saw another in the house somewhere. The door leading to the kitchen steps was opened, one of the parlor windows was opened, with a lace curtain over it, and upstairs two Avindows were unlocked, and partly up. He Avatched a large white oak tree near the open window, thinking some one might be up that, as he might probably get off the porch on to the tree. Nothing about the house appeared to be broken, but he did not examine it very closely. Lie saw no Aveapon on McOue in the hallway.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"519\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b994-6\">A man could get out of the open window in Ruby\u2019s room on the porch roof to the ground easily.

From the roof of front porch a man could easily get on that white oak there. He could have gotten out of house from front and rear, through Avindows or doors on ground floor, or upstairs through Avindows.

She remembered no \u2019phone message from McCue to Dr. McCue, and thought she would have remembered it. The messages from McCue\u2019s were in his voice. There are six boards right in a row in the telephone office. McCue\u2019s \u2019phone is Ho. 45, and Dr. McOue\u2019s Ho. 866, about five feet distant from each other, and if such a message had been received she wordd have had to pass it to Miss Busic, another operator. She took no notice of the strength of the voice from McCue\u2019s house. McCue never called up over the \u2019phone for a policeman.

There were several scratch marks on the right side of McCue\u2019s face, or cheek bone. It was like a child had fallen down on the pavement or little rough surface. There was no swelling at all, and the wound very slight. A blow on a man\u2019s cheek that would produce unconsciousness would produce instant swelling, with immediate blackness, swelling to a considerable amount, and unless done with the fist would break the bone.

About 9 o\u2019clock she and her husband were on their front porch and saw Mr. and Mrs. McCue come down the street, stop at their gate and talk to Mr. Dinwiddie, but did not hear what passed. She did not hear Mrs. McOue\u2019s voice, but heard Mr. McCue invite Mr. Dinwiddie in. They were under the electric light. Then the McOues went into their house.

She saw no blood from it. McOue put his hands to his face, and said, \u201cThe rascal must have shot me, too.\u201d Said he could not see him plainly. He was a dingy-faced fellow.

The circumstance is not only trivial, and its admission over objection calculated to magnify its importance and mislead the jury, but no reasonable inference touching guilt of accused could be fairly drawn from it.

Inferences from inferences and presumptions resting on the basis of another presumption are not admissible. The circumstance, therefore, too remote for consideration of the jury. Law requires open, visible, connection or causal relation between the circumstance adduced and the fact, to be deduced therefrom. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>92 U.

When the alleged occurrence between accused and his wife, which was the subject of the alleged conversation in jail, transpired, the evidence not only does not disclose, but there is not the slightest suggestion or approximation of the time. Whether it was a week, or a month, or a year, or five years, or ten years before the homicide nowhere appears. Thus no causal relation, connection or proximity in time between the alleged occurrence and the homicide was shown. Commonwealth not showing the alleged occurrence or circumstance was not too remote to justify the inference intended to be drawn from it, the evidence was inadmissible. The testimony is also inadmissible because it tended to establish merely an accusation against accused brought by a third person, which accused then and there controverted and denied.</p>\n<p data-order=\"580\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b1008-7\">While admissions may, under certain circumstances, be implied from silence or acquiescence, it was gross error to permit an admission to be implied from a distinct and unqualified denial.

Commonwealth, having introduced the witness, should not have been allowed to impeach him by proving by other witnesses that he had made contradictory statements out of court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"586\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b1010-6\">(b) The statute (sec. 3351 of Code, as amended by Act of January 24, 1900), under color of which the Commonwealth was permitted to prove not only statements alleged to have been made by the witness out of court, but <em>mere opinions </em>alleged to have been expressed by him as to the very fact of the guilt of the accused, and the acts, conduct, bearing and behavior of' the witness out of court as well, has no application to a criminal prosecution. The genesis of section 3351 was an act passed by the General Assembly of the \u201cRestored Government of Virginia\u201d on the 29th day of January, 1864 (page 17 of the Acts of 1864, published at Alexandria). This act, in terms, applied only to civil actions or proceedings at law or in equity. On March 2, 1866 (Acts 1865-6, page 87), the General Assembly passed an act purporting to repeal-the Act of January, 1864, but in fact amending it. This act also, in terms, applied to \u201cactions, suits or other proceedings of a civil nature at law or in equity,\u201d and it contained the identical language of section 3351 of the Code of 1887 as it stood before the Act of January 24, 1900.</p>\n<p data-order=\"587\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b1010-7\">At the revisal of 1887 the provisions of the Act of March 2, 1866, were embodied in \u201cTitle 48\u201d of the Code relating to \u201cProceedings in Civil Oases,\u201d and not in \u201cTitle 53\u201d relating to \u201cProceedings in Criminal Cases,\u201d nor in \u201cTitle 52\u201d relating to \u201cCrimes and Punishments.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"588\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b1010-8\">In \u201cTitle 52\u201d of the Code, embracing \u201cGeneral Provisions Concerning Crimes and Punishments,\u201d are found the corresponding provisions of the statute law applicable to criminal cases, while in \u201cTitle 53\u201d \u2014 \u201cProceedings in Criminal Cases\u201d \u2014 we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"975\">*975</page-number>find it <em>specially </em>provided (section 4059) that sections 8475, 8476, 3488, 3492 and 3507, all of which except the last are embraced in \u201cTitle 48,\u201d \u201cProceedings in Civil Cases,\u201d shall apply as well to civil as to criminal cases. <em>Uxpressio umus ex-clusio alterius. </em>Thus it\u00b0is manifest, both from the history of section 3351 and from its arrangement, classification or collocation in the Code, that it was never intended or considered to be applicable to criminal cases. Indeed, the necessary import of its very language restricts it to civil cases. \u201cA party called to testify for another,\u201d the Commonwealth has no right, of course, to call an accused person to testify on her behalf and against himself, while equally, of course, that entity known as \u201cThe Commonwealth\u201d is incapable of being a witness. Section 3351, therefore, being plainly applicable to civil cases only, it must be assumed that when the Legislature amended that section, without in terms extending it to criminal cases, it was not intended so to extend it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"589\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b1011-6\">In <em>Anderson\u2019s Gase, </em>100 Ya. 860, accused was tried and convicted at the December term, 1901, of County Court of Campbell. lie applied to the judge of Circuit Court for a writ of error, which was granted, but the writ was dismissed at the hearing upon the ground that the bills of exception taken to the rulings of the County Court vyere not tendered to, and signed by, the judge until after the adjournment. Section 3385 of the Code in reference to bills of exception (Title 48) had been .amended February 15, 1901, so as to allow bills of exception to be signed within thirty days after the end of the term, but the amendment did not (as a subsequent one does) apply, in terms, to criminal cases. The statute in reference to bills of exception in criminal cases is contained in section 4050 of the Code, Title 53. This court reversed the judgment of the Circuit Court, not upon the ground that section 3385 applied, which would have been an end of the matter, but upon the ground that this court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"976\">*976</page-number>must presume from the record that the bills were signed <em>during the term.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"590\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b1012-6\">(c) Independently of the statute Commonwealth could not impeach a witness introduced by her.

McCue. The only question as to which the witness had \u201cproved adverse\u201d up to the time when Commonwealth sought to lay the foundation for impeachment was the one as to what took place between his mother and father at the tea table on the evening of the homicide, the witness testifying that there was no disagreement or unpleasantness between them at the table. If Commonwealth was surprised at the unfavorable answer of the witness, she had no right to continue to ask him scores of questions after he was shown uncompromisingly adverse, and knowing that the answers would be unfavorable, but witness should have been stood aside and the impeachment confined to answers made by him up to that time. But 'a large and material part of the testimony, introduced ostensibly for the purpose of impeaching the witness, was wholly inadmissible for the reason that it related to matters entirely irrelevant to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"977\">*977</page-number>issue and in respect to which Commonwealth had no right to&gt; impeach the witness.

McOue to the effect that there was no disagreement between' his mother and father at the tea table, and that they had not had frequent and violent quarrels, the Commonwealth was permitted to show, for instance, that the witness had stated out of court that if he told the truth and his father was hung, people would point at him and say his evidence hung his father; that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"978\">*978</page-number>he had written a certain paper purporting to be a statement made by <em>John </em>Perry <em>to </em>the witness and very damaging to the accused; that he had said that he dreaded going upon the witness stand, and would rather die than tell what he would have to tell; that he had said out of court that <em>as soon as he heard of the hilling of his mother he hnew his father had hilled her; </em>that when asked by the detective if he <em>believed </em>his father killed his mother, he had stated two or three times that he did <em>believe </em>his father killed his mother; that he was satisfied his father had killed his mother, etc. These statements of the <em>mere opinion and belief of </em>witness, when tested by the rule, laid down by this court in <em>Langhorne </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra, </em>were plainly inadmissible in any conceivable view of the case, because Commonwealth was not entitled to prove them as a part of her case and as tending to establish the guilt of the accused.</p>\n<p data-order=\"598\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b1014-6\">(e) The opinion and belief of the witness, expressed out of court, were not inconsistent with his answers to the questions propounded to him with reference to what transpired between his father and mother at the tea table, and whether or not they had had frequent and violent quarrels, because it might be true that the witness <em>did </em>expi\u2019ess the opinion and belief that his father had killed his mother, and still be true also that there was <em>no </em>quarrel between his parents at the table, and that they had <em>not </em>had frequent violent quarrels, just as in <em>Welsh </em>v. <em>State, supra, </em>the court said that the fact that a witness may have said that the accused was the murderer and offered to bet $250 that he was guilty was not inconsistent with the testimony of the witness that he did not hear an alleged confession of the accused. It is easy to conceive that in any doubtful case the scale may be turned against the accused by the sheer weight and force of such testimony, theoretically, indeed, relevant to an entirely collateral issue only, but which no one should be so uncandid as to deny is, in fact, decisive of the main issue.</p>\n<p data-order=\"599\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b1015-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"979\">*979</page-number>(12) The court erred in permitting the Commonwealth\u2019s witness, Brand, to testify that on one occasion accused spoke very \u201crough and bitter\u201d to his wife, \u201clike he could kill her in a second.\u201d The witness could not give, in substance, the language used, and his testimony, therefore, was nothing more than an expression of opinion on his part as to the character of the language used by accused. It was for the jury, not the witness, to say whether the language was \u201crough and bitter,\u201d and whether or not it indicated that the accused \u201ccould kill her in a second.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"600\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b1015-6\">(13) The court erred in permitting the witness, Geo. Thomas, to testify that the accused\u2019s manner and bearing towards his wife on a certain occasion was not as pleasant as witness thought it should have been, and not as affectionate as witness\u2019 conduct towards his own wife. This evidence was inadmissible for the additional reason that no reasonable inference touching the guilt or innocence of the accused could be drawn from it. See Gillett on Indirect and Collateral Evidence, sections 54 and 55, where it is said that there exists a sharply defined exclusionary rule that remote and collateral facts, from which no fair and reasonable inference can be drawn, are to be excluded.</p>\n<p data-order=\"601\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b1015-7\">(14) The court erred in permitting the witness, John Perry, whose testimony, though not introduced by accused, was most favorable to him, to be impeached by a paper permitted to be read in evidence, written by Wm. McCue, and which the Commonwealth\u2019s detective witnesses testified that Wm. McCue said out of court embodied the statement made to him (Wm. Mccue) by John Perry. Both McCue and Perry denied in court that Perry made the statement embodied in the paper, nevertheless it was admitted by the trial court for the purpose of discrediting John Perry \u2014 that is to say, permitted witness to be impeached by a paper he did not write, which was not written in his presence, which he repudiated and refused to sign when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"980\">*980</page-number>shown to him, and, in the absence of any testimony tending to connect him with it, except that Baldwin said that Wm. McOue said that John Perry (the witness) said that the statement was correct.</p>\n<p data-order=\"602\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b1016-6\">(15) The court erred in its definition of reasonable doubt in the eighth and ninth instructions in telling the jury that reasonable doubt must be \u201cbased upon the evidence,\u201d or \u201csuggested by the evidence,\u201d or \u201cgrow out of the evidence itself,\u201d and not be \u201cwithout evidence to sustain it,\u201d and must be serious and substantial \u201cin order to warrant an acquittal,\u201d thus plainly putting the burden of raising the doubt upon the accused, and telling the jury that there must be positive, affirmative evidence creating the doubt. That this definition is erroneous is attested by the overwhelming weight of authority. As has been well said, this definition implies that the doubt must be created or produced by the proof made, and excludes all reasonable doubts which might arise from the lack or want of evidence. <em>Wright </em>v. <em>State, </em>69 Ind. 163, 35 Amer.

Rep. 96.</p>\n<p data-order=\"603\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b1016-7\">\u2022 Besides making reasonable doubt a matter of positive defense, the instructions gave an improper standard or test .by which to determine if a doubt be \u201creasonable,\u201d in that they told the jury that \u201ca doubt to justify acquittal\u201d must be such as \u201cif interposed in the graver transactions of life would cause a reasonable and prudent man to hesitate and pause.\u201d The judgment of reasonable men in the ordinary affairs of life, however important, is influenced and controlled by the preponderance of evidence, while in criminal cases something more is required. The conviction reached by each of the jurors must be such as would lead him to venture <em>to act upon it </em>in matters of the <em>highest </em>concern and importance to his own interests. <em>Burt </em>v. <em>State, </em>48 Amer. St. Rep. 576; <em>Territory </em>v. <em>Bannigan </em>1 Dak. 451; <em>Jenkins </em>v. <em>State, </em>48 Amer. St. Rep. 292; <em>Jane </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>2 Met.

This instruction, while doubtless proper in cases in w\"hich there is no question as to the identity of the slayer, was wholly improper here, because there was no evidence that the gun with which the deceased was killed was ever in the possession of the accused, except the statement made by him to the effect that he was trying to get the gun out of the case when he was knocked insensible by an unknown intruder. There was no other evidence on the subject, and a statement of the accused which was intended to be, and was exculpatory, could not, by being garbled, be made the inculpatory basis of the instruction in question. See <em>Bowles </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, ante </em>p. 816, 48 S. E. Rep. 527; <em>Parrish </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>81 Va. 1.</p>\n<p data-order=\"605\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b1017-6\">(17) The court erred in refusing to instruct the jury that the law considers it better that ninety and nine (that is, an indefinite number of) guilty persons should escape than that one innocent person should be punished. This court has reiterated this principle. <em>Smith\u2019s Case, </em>21 Gratt. <em>809; Johnson\u2019s Case, </em>29 Gratt. 820. The principle is peculiarly applicable to cases resting on circumstantial evidence as much so as the doctrines of presumption of innocence and reasonable doubt. It is the logical outgrowth of these. If this court itself deals with cases resting on circumstantial evidence in the light of the principle invoked, why should it refuse to enlighten the jury in respect to it ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"606\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b1017-7\">(18) In respect to the statement made by Captain Woods that he had refused a large fee to prosecute accused it is submitted that that was not a matter which the Commonwealth could have given in evidence, or which the jury were entitled to know. If this statement had been made out of court to any member of the jury, or to the jury as a whole, and the matter had been brought to the attention of the court, it would, or should, have discharged the jury. When attention was called to it the court did not ask the jury to disregard it. ETor was the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"982\">*982</page-number>improper statement justified by the \u201ccriticism\u201d of Captain Woods by counsel for accused. He had no right to state that he had been the friend of the accused for twenty years, thus using his friendship for the accused to his disadvantage and undoing. In <em>Cohn </em>v. <em>State, </em>11 Tex. App. 399, the district attorney said: \u201cGood men in this county, and the best men in Gonzales county, desire the conviction of this man and his partner.\u201d To the defendant\u2019s objection the court responded: \u201cHe speaks at his peril. I will sign your bill of exception.\u201d The Appellate Court, after characterizing the response of the trial judge as astounding, and the remarks of the district attorney as obnoxious and flagrant, said: \u201cWe will not permit one accused of theft, or any other offense, to be convicted by such means though all the good, better and best men of this State desire his conviction.\u201d (See 9 Amer. St. Hep. 563-4.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"607\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b1018-6\">(19) The evidence was wholly circumstantial and was insufficient to justify the verdict. See <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>29 Gratt. 796, in which this court held that the circumstances, taken singly or all together, while they created a strong suspicion of guilt, were yet inconclusive and insufficient to prove such guilt, being consistent with either the guilt or the innocence of the accused, and in which <em>Moncure P., </em>commenting on <em>Smith\u2019s Case, </em>21 Gratt. 809, said: \u201cEvery one who reads the evidence in the case must be morally convinced that a murder had been committed, and that the accused was guilty of the offense, but there was not sufficient evidence of the <em>corpus delicti </em>for his conviction, and this court, therefore, reversed the judgment against him.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"608\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b1018-7\">(20) The motion to set aside the verdict was also based upon the ground that the jury were permitted during the progress of the trial to read certain newspapers containing reference to- and comments upon the case. The jurors were examined upon this question by the court, of its own motion, and while some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"983\">*983</page-number>claimed not to have read anything about the trial it appears from the testimony of others of the jurors themselves that the headlines of the articles relating to the trial were read by them, which headlines, in the language of one juror, \u201canybody taking up a paper was obliged to see,\u201d and, in the language of another juror, \u201ca man who looks at a paper is bound to read.\u201d Copies of the newspapers which appeared during the progress of the trial are made parts of the record, and in these headlines we find such expressions as these: \u201cHeeling in Charlottesville decidedly against the prisoner\u201d; \u201cProsecution scores a victory\u201d; \u201cGeneral belief in guilt of accused\u201d; \u201cJohn Perry knocked out\u201d; \u201cAccused\u2019s house boy impeached and thus prosecution greatly strengthens case\u201d; \u201cHow Oapt. Woods nailed him.\u201d These headlines also teem with scandalous matters aff \u00e9cting the moral character of accused and calculated to degrade him in the estimation of his triers, and to furnish a motive for the crime with which he stood charged, matters of which there was not a spark of testimony given in court. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Robertson, </em>20 W. Va. 760, it was held to be error in the trial court to refuse to set aside the verdict where the jurors, in a murder case in which the main defense relied on by the accused was insanity, were permitted to read articles in the <em>Washington Post </em>containing the testimony of Dr. Gray, who was examined as an expert in Giteau\u2019s case (which happened to be on trial at the same time), notwithstanding the jurors swore that they \u201cwere not in any manner affected or influenced, even in the remotest degree, in their consideration of this case by any newspaper, or newspapers, had or received by any of the affiants.\u201d The statement of a juror will not be received to show by what motive he was actuated, or that any admitted fact, misconduct, or irregularity had no influence or effect upon his mind in producing the verdict. <em>State </em>v. <em>Harmon </em>(W. Va.), 15 S. E. Rep. 982 (3d paragraph of <em>syllabus by the </em>court). If it be said that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"984\">*984</page-number>the jury asked and were given permission by the court to.read newspapers, and that accused did not then object, we answer\u2014</p>\n<p data-order=\"609\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b1020-6\">(1) The matter was not mentioned to accused, or his counsel, whose views in regard thereto it was deemed material to con.sult or consider;</p>\n<p data-order=\"610\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b1020-7\">(2) It was understood that the jurors were pledged not to read .anything in reference to the case on trial, whereas, in fact, they ,(or some or them) did do so.</p>\n<p data-order=\"611\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b1020-8\">But it was unjust to place accused in the position of being \u25a0 called upon to object, or be concluded by his silence. The trial was likely to last a month. The jurors were brought from their Tomes and taken from their business, and were to remain in substantial captivity for an indefinite period. They were, not likely to submit kindly to the denial of the privilege of reading the newspapers, but would undoubtedly esteem it a hardship; .and, in view of the understanding that they were not to read anything about the case, would have regarded any objection as a reflection upon their integrity as well. <em>Accused\u2019s life was in the hollow of their hands! </em>Is it not then a monstrous proposition that the trial judge could shift the responsibility of dealing with this matter from his own shoulders to those of accused ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"612\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b1020-9\">(21) The motion in arrest of judgment should have been sustained. The verdict was in these words: \u201cWe, the jury, find the defendant guilty as charged in the within indictment for murder in the first degree.\u201d The indictment was in the common law form, and was, therefore, an indictment for <em>murder generally, </em>embracing both degrees. <em>Livingston </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>14 Gratt. 596; <em>Kibler </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>94 Va. 809. The statute (Code, sec. 4041) provides that if a person indicted for murder be found by the jury guilty thereof, they shall in their \u25a0 verdict find whether he is guilty of murder in the first or second degree, and if the accused confess the indictment to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"985\">*985</page-number>be true, the court shall examine the witnesses and determine the degree of the crime and give sentence accordingly. It was necessary, therefore, that the jury should fix by their verdict the degree of the crime. The last five words in the verdict \u2014 \u201cfor murder in the first degree\u201d- \u2014 -refer to, and are descriptive of, the indictment. The jury found the accused guilty as charged in the indictment, which <em>indictment </em>\u2014 not <em>verdict </em>\u2014 is misdescribed as one for murder in the first degree. These misdescriptive words, therefore, must be discarded as surplusage, and what remains is a verdict finding accused guilty as charged; and inasmuch as the accused was charged with murder generally, no judgment could be entered upon the verdict.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"613\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b915-8\">Note by the Reporter. \u2014 Immediately after the execution, the following signed paper was given out by the late spiritual advisers of the prisoner:</p>\n<p id=\"b915-9\">\u201c J.

McCue. At a subsequent term of the court he was tried upon this indictment, and on the 5th day of November the jury found him guilty of murder in the first degree. The court sentenced him to be hanged, and he thereupon applied to this court for a writ of error, which was refused, the court being of opinion that the judgment complained of was plainly right. At a subsequent day a supplementary petition was filed, asking the court to rehear its judgment refusing the writ of error, and upon the original and supplemental petitions the case is now before us for consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-8\">The first assignment of error is to the judgment of the Corporation Court upon a plea filed by the petitioner, in which he alleges that Lyman, one of the grand jurors finding the indictment, was not a resident of the city of Charlottesville. To this plea the Commonwealth, by its attorney, filed a replication.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"986\">*986</page-number>Thereupon the court empaneled a jury, and made up and propounded to it the issue, whether or not said Lyman was at the time of finding the indictment a resident of the city of Charlottesville. This issue was found by the jury in the affirmative, and the action of the court in overruling prisoner\u2019s motion to set aside the verdict, and entering judgment thereon, constitutes the petitioner\u2019s first assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-6\">It was decided in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cherry, </em>2 Va. Cas. 20, that by force of the common law, where a bill of indictment is found by a grand jury, one of whom is an alien, or otherwise disqualified by law, the bill or presentment may be avoided by plea. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Long, </em>2 Va. Cas., Ib. 318.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-7\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>St. Clair, </em>1 Gratt. 568, it was pleaded in abatement to the indictment that one of the grand jurors was not a free-holder. Upon that plea an issue was made up, tried at the bar of the court by a jury, the issue found for the defendant, and the indictment quashed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-8\">In <em>Day </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>2 Gratt. 563, the prisoner pleaded in abatement that one of the grand jurors was at the time of finding the indictment a surveyor of a highway. To this plea the attorney for the Commonwealth replied generally, and thereupon the court decided the issue against the prisoner. The General Court was of opinion that the issue so joined was one of fact, and that it should have been submitted to a jury, and for this error the judgment was reversed a\u00f1d a new trial awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-9\">Counsel for petitioner criticise the replication which the court permitted to be filed to the plea in this case upon the ground that it concludes with an offer \u201cto verify\u201d when it should have been \u201cto the country.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-10\">We shall not stop to inquire into this nicety of pleading. The injury of which the petitioner complained was that he had been indicted by a grand jury upon which there was a juror <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"987\">*987</page-number>incompetent by reason of the fact that he was not a resident of the city of Charlottesville. That issue was submitted to a jury, which heard the evidence and decided it against him. We cannot permit .the grave interests presented in this case to be determined upon a consideration so trivial. It is certain that no right of the prisoner was prejudiced by the ruling of which he complains. The verdict of the jury upon this issue must be considered in this court as upon a demurrer to evidence, and the evidence, when so considered, was, in our judgment, sufficient to sustain it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-6\">The second assignment of error is as to the qualification of the petit juror, J. Y. Stockdell, who was challenged by the petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-7\">He was asked if he had formed or expressed an opinion, to which he replied: \u201cI formed an opinion on the newspaper evidence.\u201d He was reminded by counsel that in law the prisoner was presumed to be innocent, and was asked, \u201cIn your present state of mind could you go on that jury, starting out with that presumption of innocence in your mind ?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-8\">A. \u201cI could not say that I could, sir, for the reason that I have read this evidence. Haturally there is some impression on my mind, but I cannot say that it is biased or prejudiced. The only thing I have heard is one side as published in the newspapers. I must say that everything I read in the newspapers was one side.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-9\">After further question and answer counsel asked the juror this question: \u201cIn spite of what you have read and heard, you could go upon this jury and give the prisoner a fair and impartial trial according to the instructions of the court and the evidence as detailed by the witnesses?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-10\">A. \u201cI feel that I am a fair-minded man.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-11\">Q. \u201cBut I also understand, Mr. Stockdell, that what you have read of this case has destroyed in your mind the presumption <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"988\">*988</page-number>of the prisoner\u2019s innocence; that you would not go on the jury presuming him to be innocent ?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-6\">A. \u201cI don\u2019t know about that. It is a question as to drawing a line between thinking him innocent and knowing him to be guilty, which I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-7\">In answer to other questions the juror stated \u201cthat as a fair-minded man I could render a verdict according to the law and the evidence; not biased. I have no prejudice one way or other\u201d; and that as to innocence or guilt he would be governed by the evidence and the instructions of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-8\">After numerous questions had been asked and reiterated, the object of which was to ascertain the precise character and strength of the opinion which the juror had formed and expressed, counsel asked him the following question:</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-9\">\u201cDo you feel at this moment that there is a presumption in your mind that this defendant is an innocent man ?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-10\">To which he replied: \u201cI would like to say this: that I feel that I am an honest and unbiased man, and as such that I could enter this jury unprejudiced and unbiased, and give the prisoner a trial according to the law and the evidence. If I did not feel so, I would want to be turned out, but at the same time I feel that I could serve, and am called here to serve, and that it is therefore my duty to serve.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-11\">(By the court): \u201cDo you feel that you can go into this trial leaving your mind open to the evidence, free from any previously read accounts in the newspapers, and go through the trial believing him innocent until he is proved guilty \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-12\">A. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-13\">And thereupon the juror was accepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-14\">The cases upon this subject are almost without number, and they are not to be reconciled. The trend of recent decisions is in the direction of limiting, rather than extending the disqualification of jurors by reason of mere opinion. Whatever <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"989\">*989</page-number>the mind receives has an effect upon it, passing with almost infinite gradation from a mere impression to a fixed belief. The State strains every nerve to disseminate knowledge. By the diffusion of education it hopes to create a higher citizenship and to find the means of repressing vice and crime; but if the courts take an extreme position upon this subject, and hold that every opinion shall work a disqualification for service as a juror, the administration of justice will be confided, not to the most intelligent, but to the most ignorant of our citizens. The courts, therefore, while resolute in seeing that every man shall be tried by an impartial jury, inquire into the quality and degree of the opinion, and to that end search the conscience of the juror upon his <em>voir dire, </em>and look into the sources of the information upon which his opinion rests.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-6\">jSTo man can read the rigid examination to which this juror was subjected without being impressed with his fairness, with his desire to deal justly by the prisoner, and with his conscientious purpose to discharge his duty as a citizen.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-7\">In <em>Moran\u2019s Gase, </em>9 Leigh. G51, two jurors were examined upon their <em>voir dire. </em>One stated that he had heard the case spoken of in the town, and rumors in regard to its circumstances, upon which he had expressed no opinion, though he believes those rumors to be true, and if they should turn out upon the trial to be true, he has a decided opinion in regard to the case; but he feels no prejudice, and is satisfied that he shall be able to decide the case upon the evidence which may be given in, uninfluenced by the rumors he had heard. Ilis opinion was that if the prisoner had stabbed the deceased under the circumstances which he had heard, he ought to be punished. The other juror stated that he had made up no decided opinion; that he had heard a part of the evidence of one witness and formed an impression, and if the residue of the testimony should run that way, that impression would be confirmed; that so far as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"990\">*990</page-number>tlie evidence went lie had a decided opinion, if the rest should not run against it; hut that he had no prejudice, had not expressed any opinion, and was prepared to decide the case according to the evidence which might he given in, uninfluenced by the portion of evidence he had heard. Both jurors were held to be competent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-6\">In <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>6 Gratt. 696, a juror stated that he had read the evidence as published in the newspapers, and had formed and expressed the opinion, though it was not a decided one, that the prisoner was guilty; that he was satisfied that he could give the prisoner a fair and impartial trial, notwithstanding his impressions, and without being influenced by them, on hearing the evidence adduced at the trial. Another stated that he had formed and expressed a decided opinion, founded on a report of the evidence before the mayor, published in the papers, but not such an opinion as would influence his mind if accepted as a juryman; that the opinion so formed would naturally be recalled to his memory, but that he would be governed solely by the evidence which might be given in court. Held that both were competent jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-7\">In <em>Clore\u2019s Case, </em>8 Gratt. 606, a juror stated that he had not heard any of the evidence, nor had he heard any report of it from those who had heard it, but from the rumor of the neighborhood he had formed an opinion which at the time he spolce was existing on his mind, and which he should stick to unless the evidence turned out to be different from what rumor had reported it to be; that he had no prejudice nor partiality for or against the prisoner, and believed he could give him a fair and impartial trial according to the evidence that should be given in. Held that he was a proper juror.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-8\">In <em>Jackson\u2019s Case, </em>23 Gratt. 919, Judge Moncure, delivering the opinion of the court, goes fully into this subject. He says: \u201cThere is no question, perhaps, about which there has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"991\">*991</page-number>been, more apparent conflict of decision in this State, or in regard to which it is more difficult to derive from our many 'cases on the subject any definite rules which will apply to all cases that may arise. The object of the law is to secure to every man who is charged with a criminal offense a trial by an impartial jury. And this rule has been established by the cases, if no other, that if a venireman has formed, and still more, if he has formed and expressed, a <em>decided </em>or <em>substantial </em>opinion as to the guilt or innocence of the accused, no matter upon what ground it was formed, whether from having heard the evidence on some former trial or examination, or from mere rumor or otherwise, he is an incompetent juror to try the case; and if, on the other hand, his opinion be merely hypothetical, he is not incompetent on that ground. The difficulty is in determining in any given case, whether the opinion be decided or substantial, or merely hypothetical, there being in almost every case some peculiarity of circumstance. And the desire to remove or lessen this difficulty by laying down certain other rules for our guidance has been the fruitful source of the apparent conflict in many of the cases. Thus, if a venireman has formed an opinion as to the guilt or innocence of the accused from having heard the evidence on a former trial or examination of the case, it would be difficult, if not impossible, to regard such opinion otherwise than as decided or substantial, within the meaning of the rule, and he would generally, if not always, be considered an incompetent juror, even though he might think and say that he could give the accused an impartial trial. So, on the other hand, if a venireman has formed an opinion as to the guilt or innocence of the accused, from mere rumor, the presumption, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, is that such opinion is merely hypothetical, \"and will be so considered, even though he speak of it as a decided or substantial opinion, if he says he has no prejudice against the accused and thinks he can give him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"992\">*992</page-number>a fair and impartial trial. But if the court he satisfied, either from the venireman\u2019s own statement or otherwise, that the opinion is in fact decided or substantial, he will be an incompetent juror. There are intermediate cases which often give rise to difficulty on this 'subject. The venireman may have formed an opinion from having heard a part only of the evidence on a former trial, or from having heard the whole or part of the evidence given on a former trial, through persons who were present, in whose veracity and accuracy he may have more or less confidence, or from having read an account of such evidence in a newspaper. We cannot lay down any rule for the government of such cases except the general rule before stated, and the court must determine, as best it may, whether the opinion be decided or substantial, or merely hypothetical. It would be dangerous to lay down a rule, and no case has ever decided that a venireman who has formed an opinion from accounts received from witnesses out of court, and still less from accounts received from others, as to statements made by witnesses, either in or out of court, is therefore necessarily an incompetent juror, even though he may regard the persons from whom he received his information as persons of general veracity and accuracy, and may credit what he has heard from them. We know that witnesses who make statements out of court of transactions about which they may have testified in court, still more persons who profess to detail what they may have heard in or out of court often speak carelessly, and generally omitting particulars which may be very material. And we know that those who listen to them often listen carelessly, and, though they almost always form some impression or opinion of the case from what they hear, yet that opinion is not always, and perhaps not often, decided or substantial in the meaning of the rule aforesaid. The court must determine that question in all such cases, in view of all the circumstances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-6\">In the course of his opinion he cites numerous authorities, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"993\">*993</page-number>and quotes with approval the language of Judge Summers, in <em>Moran\u2019s Case, supra, </em>in which he uses the following language: \u201cSustaining challenges to jurors for favor on slight grounds tends to place the administration of public justice in the hands of the most ignorant and least discriminating portion of the community, by which the safety of the accused may be endangered and the proper administration of the laws put to hazard; and we are therefore not disposed to enlarge the grounds of challenge beyond those properly deducible from the eases heretofore decided.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-6\">As we have said, the cases are not reconcilable, but we believe those we have cited establish a wise and salutary rule. When to these considerations it is added, as has been frequently reiterated by this court, that great weight is justly due to the opinion of the trial judge, who sees and hears the venireman, we have no hesitation in rejecting this assignment of error. \u00bb</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-7\">These considerations lead to the same conclusion with reference to the juror Wood.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-8\">The next exception is as to the competency of the witness, Kaufman, who was introduced by the Commonwealth to prove that a piece of cloth found in the bath-room on the day following the alleged homicide was a-part of the undershirt worn by the prisoner on that occasion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-9\">Kaufman, it appears, is engaged in the clothing business, and is a salesman of and dealer in underwear, but has never manufactured it. Fontaine Eddins, a clerk in a clothing store, was introduced for the same purpose, and both were permitted to testify over the objection of the prisoner.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-10\">\u2022In this there was no error. It was for the court to say what evidence should be admitted. It was for the jury, before whom the witnesses were subjected to investigation as to their source of knowledge, to determine upon their credibility, and the weight to be given to their testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"994\">*994</page-number>The eleventh exception is to the admission of a conversation between the prisoner and his son, William McOue, as testified to for the Commonwealth by the witness, Martin. In this conversation petitioner, according to the witness, said that he (his son) knew that the statement made by Ernest Orawford about petitioner\u2019s having drawn a pistol upon his wife was not true, to which petitioner\u2019s son replied by aflirming that petitioner did draw a pistol upon his wife. This is objected to upon the ground that there is no suggestion or approximation with respect to the time at which the occurrence took place, which was the subject of this conversation; that it nowhere appears \u201cwhether it was a week, or a month, or a year, or five years, or ten years before the homicide.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-6\">The testimony with respect to the incident in the jail was not introduced as proof of the circumstance narrated. It does not prove* or tend to prove, and there was no purpose in its introduction to prove, that the accused at any time threatened his wife with a pistol and that she sought the protection of her son. Ernest Orawford had testified before the jury that William McOue so stated to him, and Martin\u2019s testimony was introduced solely for the purpose of showing that McOue endeavored to induce his son to deny the statement attributed to him by Orawford. If the eircumstance to which Orawford referred was inadmissible for remoteness in point of time, or for any other reason, objection to it should have been made when Orawford was upon the stand, but there could be no objection to it when introduced for the purpose indicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-7\">The precise language of the prisoner on that occasion was as follows: The prisoner said to his son: \u201cYou know it is not so about what Ernest Crawford said about my drawing a pistol on your mother.\u201d To which the son replied: \u201cYou did; and she run in the room and got in the bed with me, and asked me not to let you shoot her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"995\">*995</page-number>IN or is the testimony of Martin inadmissible because \u201cit was, in effect, an accusation against the prisoner which he then and there controverted and denied.\u201d The conversation was brought about by the prisoner who was apparently seeking to find the means of weakening the force of Crawford\u2019s statement, and he said to his son, \u201cYou know it is not true that I drew a pistol on your mother\u201d; and the denial comes from the son: \u201cYou did; and she run in the room and got in the bed with me, and asked me not to let you shoot her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-6\">What was said, with all the attending circumstances, was before the jury, and we are of opinion that there was no error in this ruling of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-7\">There are several exceptions to evidence which seems to us to be immaterial, and to discuss which would unduly protract this opinion. That, for instance, of the witness Covington, who testified that he spoke to petitioner\u2019s wife at about twenty minutes before 8 o\u2019clock; that he took off his hat and bowed to her, but that she did not speak. Of the witness Hurley, who heard the prisoner say that his wife\u2019s jealousy diminished his pleasure and enjoyment in life.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-8\">The fifteenth exception is to the testimony of Dr. Helson, who was permitted to testify as to the effects of a blow struck by a sandbag or other similar instrument.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-9\">It hardly requires the learning or experience of a practitioner of medicine to know that if a man was struck by a sandbag a blow sufficient to render him unconscious, there would be, at least, some slight discoloration or ext\u00e9rnal mark or after effect consequent upon the blow. This assignment of error is also overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-10\">The assignments of error from the 16th to 33d, inclusive, present a question of much importance in this prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-11\">William McCue, a son of the prisoner, was introduced as a-witness by the Commonwealth; and it speedily appearing that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"996\">*996</page-number>he was adverse to the Commonwealth and favorable to the prisoner, the Commonwealth, alleging that it was surprised, asked and was permitted to introduce evidence to show that the witness had made statements inconsistent with his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-6\">So much of sec. 3351 of Va. Code (1904) as is pertinent to this inquiry is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-7\">\u201cA party called to testify for another, having an adverse interest, may be examined by such other party according to the rules applicable to cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-8\">\u201c(1) A party producing a witness shall not be allowed to impeach his credit by general evidence of bad character, but he may, in case the witness shall, in the opinion of the court, prove adverse, contradict him by other evidence, or, by leave of the court, prove that he has made, at other times, a statement inconsistent with his present testimony, but before said last mentioned proof can be given, the circumstances of the supposed statement, sufficient to designate the particular occasion, must be mentioned to the witness, and he must be asked whether or not he has made such statement. In every case the court, if requested by either party, shall instruct the jury not to consider the evidence of such inconsistent statements except for the purpose of contradicting the witness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-9\">The law just quoted is so comprehensive in its terms that we shall content ourselves with observing that it warrants the action of the court in this case unless, as the petitioner insists,' its operation is to be confined to civil cases. The law of evidence is in general the same in civil and in criminal cases. In each case the object is the same \u2014 to place evidence before the jury which will enable it to arrive at a just decision upon the issues. It has long been a subject of investigation before courts, text-writers and legislatures how far it is permissible for a party to contradict his own witness. .</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-10\">In Wigmore on Evidence, Vol. 2, sections <em>891 </em>to 908, in-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"997\">*997</page-number>elusive, the whole subject is exhaustively discussed, and the views of eminent authorities given.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-6\">Lord Ellenborough is quoted as saying, in <em>Alexander </em>v. <em>Gibson, </em>2 Camp. 555: \u201cIf a witness is called on the part of the plaintiff who swears what is palpably false, it would be extremely hard if the plaintiff\u2019s case should for that reason be sacrificed; but I know of no rule of law by which the truth is on such an occasion to be shut out and justice is to be perverted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-7\">Chief Justice Tindal\u2019s remarks, in <em>Bradley </em>v. <em>Rieardo, </em>8 Bing. 58, are cited. \u201cThe object of all the laws of evidence is to bring the whole truth of a case before the jury; . . . but if this contradicting evidence were excluded, that would no longer be the just ground on which the principles of evidence would proceed, but we should compel the plaintiff to take singly all the chances of the tables, and to be bound by the statements of a witness whom he might call without knowing he was adverse, who might labor under a defect of memory, or be otherwise unable to make a statement on which complete reliance might be placed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AgA\">The reasoning and authorities range all the way from permission to refresh the memory of an adverse witness by cross-examination to the practice which finds expression in the statute under consideration of proving his inconsistent statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-10\">In England the subject was referred to a commission composed of eminent jurists, and they reported in favor of the admission of impeaching testimony by proof of contradictory statements. Eor the admissibility of the proposed evidence it is said that this course \u201cis necessary as a security against the contrivance of an artful witness who otherwise might recommend himself to the party by the promise of favorable evidence (being really in the interest of the opposite party), and afterwards by hostile evidence ruin his cause; that such a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"998\">*998</page-number>power is necessary for the purpose of placing the witness fairly and completely before the court, and for enabling the jury to ascertain how far he deserved to be believed; that the ends of justice are best attained by allowing the fullest power for scrutinizing and correcting evidence, and that the exclusion of the proof of contrary statements might 'be attended with the worst consequences. The chief objection to the proposed evidence appears to be that a party, after calling a witness as a witness of credit, ought not to be allowed to discredit him. The objection proceeds upon the supposition that the party first acts on one principle, and afterwards, being disappointed by the witness, turns around and acts upon another, thus imputing to the party something of double dealing or dishonest practice. But it is evident that this does not apply to the case where a party, having given credit to a witness, is deceived by him, and first discovers the deceit at the trial of the cause. To reject the proposed evidence in such a case, and repress the truth, would be to allow the witness to deceive both jury and. party.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-6\">In <em>Babcock </em>v. <em>People, </em>13 Colo. 519, 22 Pac. 818, Judge Elliott said: \u201cThe tendency of recent legislation, as well as of modern decisions, has been to relax somewhat the rules of evidence, so as to afford better opportunity for the development of truth. Modern experience has also shown that a party may sometimes, be deceived in the character and animus of a witness whom he has called, as well as in the testimony he is expected to give; and he learns after the witness begins to testify \u2014 a very inopportune time \u2014 that he has to encounter bitter and unscrupulous opposition where he had expected to receive only fair and honorable treatment. This may be evidenced by reluctance or evasion on the part of the witness in answering questions, or by too great readiness in making or volunteering damaging statements contrary to his previous version of the matter. Under such circumstances, .... in extreme cases, where it is ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"999\">*999</page-number>parent that a witness is giving testimony contrary to the reasonable expectation of the party calling him, such party should be allowed to cross-examine such witness for the purpose of refreshing his recollection with the view of modifying his testimony or of revealing his animus in the case, . . . and to ask him if he has not theretofore made other or different statements from those he has just given in evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-7\">In this whole discussion, as given in Wigmore, the reasoning adduced and the authorities cited apply indifferently to civil and criminal cases, the civil cases being, of course, far the more numerous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-8\">The English statute is given, passed in pursuance of the recommendation of the commission on procedure heretofore referred to. \u201cA party producing a witness shall not be allowed tq impeach his credit by general evidence of bad character; but he may, in case the witness shall, in the ojnnion of the judge, prove adverse, contradict him by other evidence, or by leave of the judge prove that he has made at other times a statement inconsistent with his present testimony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-9\">\u201cIt is easy to imagine,\u201d says the author, \u201cthe confusion caused by this bungling paragraph, for the showing of an error by ordinary contradiction provided for in clause 3 was already freely permissible without interference by the judge and whether or not the witness was adverse; . . . As the statute stands, the present class of evidence, self-contradictipns, is admissible only by leave of the judge, and in case of a witness deemed adverse by the judge. In the United States fortunately only a few jurisdictions have adopted the English statute. But the variety of attitude in the different jurisdictions, and the indiscriminate citation of rulings from other courts, together with the indecision of the earlier English precedents, has tended to produce confusion in our law, even within the rulings of the same jurisdiction. The sound and simple remedy would be by statute to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1000\">*1000</page-number>abolish all limitation on this kind of evidence, and this step has in some States already been taken.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-6\">The English statute quoted was passed in the seventeenth and eighteenth of Victoria. It applied only to civil cases; but by statute of the twenty-eighth and twenty-ninth of Victoria it was extended to criminal cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-7\">In <em>Hickory </em>v. <em>U. S., </em>151 U. S. 303, 34 L. Ed. 170, 14 Sup. Ct. 334, which was upon an indictment for murder, Chief Justice Fuller says: \u201cWhen a party is taken by surprise by the evidence of his witness, the latter may be interrogated as to inconsistent statements previously made by him for the purpose of refreshing his recollection and inducing him to correct his testimony.; and the party so surprised may also show the facts to be otherwise than as stated, although this incidentally tends to discredit the witness. . . . But proof of contradictory statements of one\u2019s own witness, voluntarily called and not a party, inasmuch as it would not amount to substantive evidence, and could have no effect but to impair the credit of the witness, was generally not admissible at common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-9\">\u201cBy statute in England, and in many of the States, it has been provided that a party may, in case the witness shall, in the opinion of the judge, prove adverse, by leave of the judge, show that he has made at other times statements inconsistent with his present testimony, and this is allowed for the purpose of counteracting actual hostile testimony with which the party has been surprised.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-10\">This citation is of value in two aspects. In the first place, it shows what the common,law was; it shows the tendency of modern thought upon the subject; and, although made in a case where a man was on trial for his life, rests the statements of law upon adjudications in civil cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-11\">Under these circumstances the Legislature of Virginia adopted the statute which we are now considering. Its lan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1001\">*1001</page-number>guage is broad and general; there is not a suggestion upon its face of the purpose to limit its operation to a particular class \u2022of cases. The evils are the same in criminal cases as in civil. It is invoked to-day by the Commonwealth. It may be tomorrow the last hope of an innocent man.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-6\">Against all this it is urged that the statute is found in the Code under the title of \u201cProceedings in Civil Oases.\u201d Embraced in that title are a number of chapters upon a great variety of subjects, many of which are obviously of a civil nature, others specifically declared to be of that character. In the chapter upon \u201cEvidence,\u201d in which section 3351 is found, there are sections which, either from their subject matter or by their express terms, apply to civil cases. There are other sections which by their express terms apply to criminal cases \u2014 for example, sections 3346, 3352 and 3352a, the first mentioned referring to the competency of husband and wife to testify for or against each other in civil and criminal cases. We find, therefore, section 3351 placed in the midst of sections applicable alike by their terms to criminal and civil cases; and the operation of that section not extended upon the one hand, nor limited upon the other to a particular class of cases, but its application to be determined by other considerations. We cannot think that the mere collocation of this section should override every other consideration, and require the courts to confine it to civil cases, when it is a remedy for an evil as great in criminal as in civil cases, and the consequences of which may be even more serious.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-7\">We are of opinion that these assignments of error are not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-8\">A careful perusal of the instructions' satisfies us that they fairly submitted to the jury the principles of law by which they should be governed in the consideration of the evidence. It would be impossible to prepare instructions to which an ingenious critic might not present plausible objection. The defini<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1002\">*1002</page-number>tion of \u201creasonable doubt\u201d is attempted by the court. It is a difficult, if not an impossible, task so to define it as to satisfy a subtle and metaphysical mind bent upon the detection of some X3oint, however attenuated, upon which to hang a criticism. But no unbiased person can. read those instructions without having the conviction forced upon him that every safeguard which the benignity of the law throws aroiuid a prisoner upon trial was accorded to the petitioner in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-6\">Two instructions asked for by the petitioner were refused by the court, one of which undertakes to define reasonable doubt, as follows: \u201cThe court instructs the jury that by reasonable doubt is meant such doubt as would cause a man of average X3rudence to hesitate about a matter of his own of like importance to himself as the case on trial is to the accused.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-7\">It would have been impossible for the jury to make any practical ax3plication of the proposition sought to be formulated in this instruction. There could be no case of importance to a man such as \u201cthe case on trial was to the accused,\u201d unless he himself stood upon his deliverance before a jury charged with a capital offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-8\">But the instruction was properly refused upon the further ground that the instructions of the court upon the subject of reasonable doubt were ample and correct guides to the jury ux&gt;on that branch of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-9\">The court was asked to instruct the jury \u201cthat under the humane policy of the law of this State it is considered infinitely better that ninety and nine (that is, an indefinite number of) guilty persons should escape punishment than that one innocent person should be punished; and, therefore, it is far better that the jury should err in acquittal than err in convicting.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-10\">We have heard it said, and it is sometimes stated in the opinions of courts, that it is better that ninety and nine guilty persons should escape than that one innocent person should be pun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1003\">*1003</page-number>islied. W e have no fault to find with the expression as a rhetorical phrase, but as a guide to a jury in reaching a conclusion it is of no value. .That no guilty man should escape is equally indisputable, but it would hardly find a proper place in an instruction to a jury. The object of courts and juries is to shield the innocent and to punish the guilty, and in this case the jury were told that the accused was presumed to be innocent until his guilt was established by the Commonwealth beyond a reasonable doubt; that this presumption of innocence goes with him through the entire case and applies at every stage thereof, and that if, after having heard all of the evidence, the jury have a reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused, upon the whole case, or as to any fact essential to prove the charge made against him in the indictment, it is their duty to give him the benefit of the doubt, and find him not guilty. And, further, that if upon the whole evidence there is any reasonable hypothesis consistent with the innocence of the accused, they must find him nor guilty; that the failure of the evidence to disclose any other criminal agent than the accused, is not a circumstance which may be considered by the jury in determining whether or not he was guilty of the crime wherewith he is charged; that he is presumed to be innocent until his guilt is established, and he is not to be prejudiced by the inability of the Commonwealth to point to any other criminal agent, nor is he called upon to vindicate his own innocence by naming the guilty person.</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-6\">It is also to be observed that the court was careful in instructing the jury as to the weight to be given to the evidence of contradictory statements made by the witness William McCue, and others. The jury was warned that this evidence was admissible only to contradict the witness, and not to be taken as substantive proof of the facts related by the witness or, in the terms of the statute, that they were not to consider the evidence of such inconsistent statements except for the purpose of contradicting the witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1004\">*1004</page-number>During the closing argument for the prosecution Captain Micajah Woods, who had assisted the prosecution, arose, and in the presence of the jury, said to the court: \u201cWith the gracious consent of the gentlemen on the other side and the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney I would like to make one statement, not pertaining to the merits of this case, but in view of the attack, which may not have been so intended, but which sounded to me ungenerous, as an ungenerous attack made upon me by the distinguished gentleman, and who has made so able a speech, I desire to say that I refused a large fee in this case to prosecute\u201d--</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-6\">Counsel for the prisoner objected to the statement and asked that the jury be discharged in view of that statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-7\">It appears in the bill of exceptions that counsel for the prisoner had, in his argument, criticised the position of Captain Woods in acting as prosecutor, under the compulsion of public opinion, of a man he admitted had been his friend for twenty years.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-8\">The right of the public prosecutor to have associated with him an attorney to assist in the prosecution is established law in this State, and is not a proper subject of animadversion. He is as lawfully there to assist the prosecution as counsel for the defense to defend the prisoner; and, so long as he keeps within proper bounds, he is not open to criticism before the jury. It would be a strange thing if counsel for the accused were permitted to criticise opposing counsel, and that the latter should be obliged to submit in silence under the penalty we are asked to impose in this case. There is no merit in this exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-9\">The jury having rendered a verdict of guilty of murder in the first degree, the accused moved to set aside the verdict, among other reasons, because the jury were permitted during the pro-, gress of the trial to read, and did read, certain newspapers containing references to, and comments upon, the case, pending the trial of the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1005\">*1005</page-number>It appears that \u201cbefore the jury was sworn, and in response to. a request from one of the jurors, the court stated to the members of the jury that they might be permitted to read such portions of the daily newspapers as in no way related to this trial, but that they must scrupulously avoid any parts of said, papers as had any reference to this trial, which the said members of the jury then and there severally promised to do.. And. the sergeants were then instructed to carry out this instruction of the court. At the time this instruction was given neither the. prisoner or his counsel, they being present, made objection,, though they were not asked by the court if they had objection.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-6\">In <em>Hunter </em>v. <em>State, </em>43 Ga. 483, after some of the jury were-in the box, but the whole not impaneled, and in the presence of the court, those sworn were seen by counsel for accused reading a newspaper which contained an article reflecting upon the counsel for prisoner, and no motion was made or notice then taken in regard thereto. -It was held that this was not such, irregularity upon the part of the jury as would be sufficient to-set aside the verdict, and that such acts transpiring in the court room, and in the presence of the court and of counsel, when not. objected to, will not be favorably regarded after the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-7\">In <em>Bulliner </em>v. <em>People, </em>95 Ill. 394, counsel for a defendant, handed a juror a newspaper to read after he was sworn, but before the panel was filled, and afterwards, on the trial, his attention was called to the fact that another juror was reading a newspaper in which was an article purporting to contain a report of the trial, and commenting upon the case unfavorably to the defendant, and made no objection thereto, but stated privately to the court that it was best to say nothing about the matter, as it might give -the article undue prominence and do the defendant more harm than good, it not appearing that the prosecution was responsible for the act. It was held that the irregularity was waived, and could not be urged by the defendant in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1006\">*1006</page-number>error to reverse a judgment of conviction, and that a prisoner on trial has no right to stand by and suffer irregular proceedings to take place, and then seek a reversal for the same. Like any other defendant, if he neglects in proper time to insist upon his rights, he waives them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-6\">In <em>McKinney </em>v. <em>People </em>(Ill.), 2 Gilm. 556, 43 Am. Dec. 65, it is said: <em>\u201cA </em>prisoner on trial, under our laws, has no right to stand by and suffer irregular proceedings to take place, and then ask to have the proceedings reversed on error on account of such irregularities. The law, by furnishing him with counsel to defend him, has placed him on the same platform with all other defendants, and if he neglects in proper time to insist upon his rights, he waives them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-7\">So it is uniformly held in civil as Avell as in criminal cases, for, as Ave have already remarked, the mode of procedure is substantially the same in both. A party who stands by without objection and sees proper evidence excluded, or improper evidence admitted, without objecting, will not be heard to make the objection after verdict. And so with instructions. In other words, litigants are not permitted to play fast and loose with the court. If they are silent when it is their duty to speak, they are not permitted to speak when it is their duty to be silent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-8\">The case under consideration is far stronger than those cited. The court, in the presence of the prisoner and of his counsel, at the instance of the jury, permitted them to have access to newspapers under rules which it pi\u2019escribed. It does not appear that the limits imposed by the court were exceeded, or that the prisoner was prejudiced by what occurred. But, however that may be, he had no right to sit mute, prepared to abide by the results if they were favorable, or to make objection if they were adverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-9\">We think it is the safer and better practice to exclude neAvs<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1007\">*1007</page-number>pap\u00e9is from the jury. They are called upon to exercise the most sacred duty which can devolve upon a citizen, and in its discharge they must make such personal sacrifice as is necessary to its due performance; but under the circumstances of this case no reversible error is disclosed in this respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-6\">hi o one can read the petitions for a writ of error in this case without being satisfied that the accused has had every advantage that could accrue to him from the efforts of able and astute counsel. But no one can read the facts presented in evidence without being convinced that no advocacy, however skilled to make the worse appear the better reason, could have brought about any other result than that which has been reached. The evidence precludes every reasonable hypothesis of innocence, and points with unerring certainty to the guilty man. The record discloses a homicide, remarkable only for its atrocity, and the fact that it was committed by a member of the profession of the law who had been entrusted by his fellow-citizens with a responsible office, and that the victim was his wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-7\">We have gone through the record and discussed what seemed to us to be its more important features. There are exceptions to which we have not adverted. Some of them we deemed unimportant, others as controlled by principles well established, or covered by what we have said with reference to kindred exceptions, and there is but one other view which we are called upon to present.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-8\">Bunning through the petitions, and more particularly the supplemental petition, there is a subtle suggestion that this \u2022court has introduced a practice which tends to undermine the rights and abridge the privileges of those who stand accused of crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-9\">The theory propounded seems to be that a writ of error to the judgment of a trial court is one of the rights' of a person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1008\">*1008</page-number>convicted of crime; while the truth is that a review by an appellate tribunal, whether upon an appeal or writ of error, is no-part of due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-6\">The inalienable rights of a person accused of crime are thus-stated in the bill of rights: That in all criminal prosecutions a man hath a right to demand the cause and nature of his accusation, to be confronted with the accusers and witnesses, to call for evidence in his favor, and to a speedy trial by an impartial jury of his vicinage, without whose unanimous consent he cannot be found guilty; nor can he be compelled to give evidence^ against himself; that no man be deprived of his life or liberty,, except by the law of the land or the judgment of his peers.\u2014 Va. Constitution, sec. 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-7\">Our statute prescribes the rule which controls the action of' this court. With reference to appeals and writs of error, section 3466 of the Code says: \u201cIn a case wherein the court shall deem the judgment, decree, or order, complained of plainly right, and reject it on that ground, and the order of rejection so states,, no other petition therein shall afterwards be entertained.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-8\">We have no such practice as an absolute right of appeal, in civil or criminal cases. But the law requires a petition, accompanied by a transcript of the record, to be presented to the court, or one of its judges, whose duty it is to examine the errors assigned and to grant or refuse a writ, as may seem, proper. It is as much the duty of the court, or judge, to deny the petition when of opinion that the decision complained of is-plainly right as it is to grant it when any doubt exists as to the propriety of the decision. The statute in its present form is-found in the Code of 1849. Just when it took its place in the statute law we are not informed, but the uniform practice of this court, and of the General Court, its predecessor, as an appellate tribunal in criminal cases has been in accordance with the letter and spirit of that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1009\">*1009</page-number>In <em>Vance v. Com'th, </em>2 Va. Cases 162, a case of homicide which ended in a conviction of murder in the first degree, the report of the case shows that it was highly litigated, and that many errors were assigned; but an application for a writ of error was unanimously refused by tbe judges of tbe General-Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-6\">Running through the \u201cVirginia Cases,\u201d and other reports im which the judgments of the General Court appear, numerous-instances mil be found of writs of error refused in every description of felony. In some cases opinions are delivered; some are heard upon the petition only, while in others the attorney-general is permitted to reply.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-7\">By the Constitution of 1851 the General Court was abolished and appellate criminal jurisdiction was given to the Court of Appeals. Beginning with 1854, our records disclose cases involving every form of felony, and every degree of punishment applicable to that crime, in which the order entered upon the petition is that \u201cthe court, deeming the judgment complained of plainly right, doth reject the petition\u201d upon that ground.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1046-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1010\">*1010</page-number>We think that it has been made sufficiently to appear that our practice is not an innovation upon that of our predecessors; that we are not perverting or diverting the administration of justice from its ancient and accustomed course; but that we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1011\">*1011</page-number>walk in the beaten path prescribed to us from the earliest period in this Commonwealth, by judges whose names will always be remembered and revered.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-6\">While those accused of crime have rights which should be held inviolable, society has rights which are no less sacred. While the accused is entitled to a fair and impartial trial, the safety of the law-abiding citizen demands that the accused, having had a fair and impartial trial, and been adjudged guilty according to the law of the land, should suffer with certainty and without delay the penalty imposed by the law upon his offense. Therefore, in obedience to the mandate of the statute, and in strict accordance with established precedent, having given careful consideration to the petitions and record, and being of opinion that no error is shown to the prejudice of the accused, we abide by the order entered at a former day of the term and deny a writ of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-7\">\n<em>Writ of error denied.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1045-8\"> Writs of error were refused in tbe following cases:</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-9\">Order Book No. 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-10\"><em>Archer </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>p. 559; <em>Baxter </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>p. 344; <em>Cronin </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>murder, p. 679; <em>Gebhart </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>p. 479; May 25, 1854, <em>Helms </em>v. <em>Common</em>wealth, burglary, p. 514; May 15, 1854, <em>Keith </em>v.
