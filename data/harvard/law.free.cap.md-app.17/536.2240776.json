Ann. Code Art. 27, \u00a7 240) and received a six month suspended sentence and a fine of $200.00. He was placed on probation for a period of six months, during which time the fine was to be paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-9\">The sole question presented by this appeal is whether or not the trial judge erred in denying a motion to suppress evidence on the ground that there was no probable cause for the issuance of a search and seizure warrant. We conclude for the reasons stated <em>infra </em>that the evidence should have been suppressed. We accordingly reverse the judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-10\">The record reveals that the Maryland State Police obtained a search and seizure warrant from a judge of the District Court for the search of \u201cBrownie\u2019s Pool Hall\u201d in Crisfield, Maryland. The affidavit upon which the warrant was issued states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-11\">\u201cAPPLICATION is herewith made for a Search and Seizure Warrant in that there is probable cause to believe the laws relating to the Illegal Manufacturing, Distribution and Possession with intent to Distribute Controlled Dangerous Substances, as defined in Article 27, Sections 286 and 287 of the Annotated Code of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>Maryland, 1957 Edition as amended and revised, dealing generally with narcotics, Hallucinogenic and dangerous drugs are being violated in and upon a certain two story building situated at Fourth Street, Crisfield, Somerset County, Maryland, more particularly described as a two story, white frame building, the said building divided into two floors.

Your affiant White was greeted at the door by colored male known as George Rolley and had conversation with Rolley and asked him if he had any \u2018stuff?\u2019 George Rolley then advised affiant White to wait for J.B. Then affiant White observed two colored males known as Pee Wee and J.B. pass a hypodermic syringe between the two of them. Approximately 20 minutes later J.B. came outside the building and dumped a half a glass of water. The affiant White then had conversation with J.B., J.B. then told the affiant White to park on the corner of Fourth and Broadway Street, Crisfield, Maryland while he went to get his stash (meaning drugs). J.B. went to his residence and was unable to get his stash, however, he gave the affiant White a small glassine bag containing a white powder substance. The affiant White then advised J.B. he would see him tomorrow.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-5\">That the affiant White has assisted your affiant Horner and other members of the Maryland State Police Narcotic Section in many investigation [sic] involving similar cases of Controlled Dangerous Substances Laws; and as such has lead to the conviction of many of the defendants involved in these cases.

Horner</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-7\">Before me, a District Court Judge of the State of Maryland, in and for Somerset County, this 23rd day of September, 1971, personally appeared Edwin Horner, personally known to me or properly identified, and he made oath that the contents of the aforegoing document are true and correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-8\">S/Lloyd L. Simpkins</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b559-9\">The warrant was issued thirty days after White\u2019s initial and only stated observation of Brownie\u2019s Pool Hall. It was executed on the thirty-first day after the observation. It is to be noted that the named informer, for reasons not explained in the record, did not subscribe and swear to the facts stated in the affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-10\">When the police executed the warrant on September 24, 1971, they found no evidence of narcotics, but did discover in the pockets of a coat and three jackets that were hanging in the premises slips of paper identified as lottery slips. The coat belonged to the appellant. A \u201cpolicy book\u201d and additional slips were also found in the pool hall. The appellant, who was brought to the scene of the \u201craid\u201d by the State police after the search had commenced, was placed under arrest. He was discovered to have in his wallet two lottery slips. Appellant was indicted by the Grand Jury of Somerset County on four counts charging violation of Md. Ann. Code Art. 27, \u00a7 240 (bookmaking on horse races, bookmaking on other contests, receiving a bet and recording a bet). Appellant\u2019s counsel filed a timely motion to suppress the evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>dence and submitted a \u201cbrief\u201d in support thereof. The State answered the motion and the appellant replied thereto. On June 23, 1972, the trial court, apparently without a hearing, denied the appellant\u2019s motion. Because the appellant interposed no objection to the admission into evidence of the seized inculpatory material at the trial, the State, in oral argument before this Court, urged that the question was not properly before us inasmuch as it had not been preserved for our review. We disagree. Md. Rule 729 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-5\">\u201ca. <em>Scope.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-6\">This rule shall be applicable whenever property is claimed in a court to have been obtained by an unlawful search or seizure even though the offense charged or threatened to be charged may not be within the exclusive jurisdiction of a court or even though the search warrant, pursuant to which the property was seized, may not have been issued by a court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-7\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-8\">f. <em>Objection Preserved on Appeal or New Trial Motion.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-9\">If such motion, petition or objection is denied or overruled, the objection of the accused to the evidence sought to be suppressed, excluded or returned shall be preserved on appeal to the appropriate appellate court or on a hearing on a motion for a new trial, even though no further objection was made to the introduction of such evidence at the trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b560-10\">In <em>Silbert v. State, </em>10 Md. App. 56, 59, 267 A. 2d 770 (1970), it is stated in unequivocal terms that when a motion to suppress has been made, there need not be a further objection to the admission of the evidence during the trial. We said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-11\">\u201cRule 729, \u00a7 f. . . . expressly preserves the question on appeal without further objection at trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>We think the State\u2019s contention to be devoid of merit, and the law to be so clearly established as to require no further discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">Appellant attacks the warrant on the basis that there was no probable cause for its issuance. He asserts that the affidavit of Trooper Horner was conclusionary and lacked a showing of sufficient factual background to justify the Trooper\u2019s assertion that there was \u201cprobable cause to believe that the laws relating to . . . Controlled Dangerous Substances . . . are being violated in and upon the premises. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">To determine probable cause for the issuance of a warrant, we look to the four corners of the affidavit upon which the warrant was based. If the affidavit establishes \u201cprobable cause\u201d the warrant is valid. <em>Hudson v. State, </em>16 Md. App. 49, 294 A. 2d 109 (1972); <em>Dawson v. State, </em>11 Md. App. 694, 276 A. 2d 680 (1971); <em>Ger-stein v. State, </em>10 Md. App. 322, 270 A. 2d 331 (1970), <em>cert. denied </em>402 U. S. 1009 (1971); <em>Scarborough v. State, </em>3 Md. App. 208, 238 A. 2d 297 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">In the instant case, the affidavit indicated that the informer went to Brownie\u2019s Pool Hall and from the doorway thereof observed a hypodermic syringe pass between two persons, neither of these being the owner or the appellant. The informer sought to make a buy from \u201cJ.B.\u201d but was told that he, \u201cJ.B.,\u201d would have to go and get his \u201cstash.\u201d \u201cJ.B.\u201d left the premises and met the informer at another location where he gave to the informer a glassine bag containing codeine phosphate.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">The sole observation by the informant of two patrons of Brownie\u2019s Pool Hall passing a hypodermic syringe between them does not, in and of itself, give rise to a rational inference that narcotics were being kept or stored in the premises any more than a single observation of a lottery slip being passed between two customers of a restaurant would give rise to a rational inference that an illegal gambling operation was being conducted in that restaurant. In this case, the probable cause for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>the issuance of the warrant is non-existent, particularly in view of the fact that the \u201cbuy\u201d of the proscribed narcotics occurred away from the premises. There was nothing in the affidavit that would, in our opinion, justify a fair and impartial magistrate\u2019s concluding that probable cause existed for the issuance of the warrant. \u201cProbable cause\u201d has been defined as a non-technical conception of a reasonable ground for belief of guilt requiring less evidence for such belief than would justify conviction but more evidence than mere suspicion. <em>Carroll v. United </em>States, 267 U. S. 132, 45 S. Ct. 280, 69 L. Ed. 543, 39 A.L.R. 790 (1925); <em>Cuffia v. </em>State, 14 Md. App. 521, 287 A. 2d 319 (1972); <em>Cleveland v. State, </em>12 Md. App. 712, 280 A. 2d 520 (1971). We think it patent that in the instant case there was nothing more than \u201cmere suspicion\u201d that trafficking in narcotics was occurring in Brownie\u2019s Pool Hall.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">Inasmuch as we hold that there was no probable cause for the issuance of the warrant for the reasons herein stated, we need not consider the question of the staleness of the information embodied in the affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
