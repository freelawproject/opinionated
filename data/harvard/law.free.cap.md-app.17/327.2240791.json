Ann. Code Art. 101, \u00a7 58. It is concerned with the question of whether <em>vel non </em>an employee, after an award by the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Commission, may recover from a third party tortfeasor and continue to derive some benefits under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-12\">The factual situation out of which this case arose is undisputed. On April 11, 1970, William Maddox Mash-burn, then age 30, was seriously and permanently injured as the result of an automobile collision occurring on the northern approach to the Baltimore Harbor Tunnel. At that time, a vehicle operated by Mrs. Mary C. Vallone sustained a tire blowout, left the south bound lane in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>which it had been operated, hurtled the concrete median wall that divided north and south bound traffic, and landed atop the vehicle being driven by Mashburn. That Mashburn was in the course of his employment, and that he is now in a state of akinetic mutism, is not challenged.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">A claim was filed with the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Commission and after a hearing the Commission passed an award in which it ordered the payment of temporary total disability to Mashburn. Subsequently, on September 16, 1970, the Commission found Mashburn to be totally permanently disabled and ordered the payment of compensation at the rate of $70.00 per week, not to exceed $30,000.00, to the claimant. The next day, the award was amended so that compensation was ordered to be paid at the rate of $85.00 per week, not to exceed $45,000.00. Md. Ann. Code Art. 101, \u00a7 36(1). In the meantime, the claimant\u2019s wife, Diane F. Mashburn, had apparently qualified as the guardian of her husband, Md. Ann. Code Art. 93A, \u00a7 201 (b), and had instituted suit against Mrs. Vallone in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland. The litigation was settled by the payment of the sum of $100,000.00 to Mrs. Mashburn, as guardian of her husband. The Circuit Court of Baltimore City, having assumed jurisdiction over the guardianship, approved the settlement. Aetna Casualty and Surety Company (Aetna), Mashburn\u2019s employer\u2019s insurer, joined in the release to Mrs. Vallone. Mrs. Mashburn also settled her loss of consortium claim against Mrs. Vallone for $140,000.00.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">The draft in payment of Mashburn\u2019s third party claim was delivered to Aetna\u2019s counsel. From the draft, Aetna <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>deducted $29,466.49, as reimbursement for monies it had expended on behalf of Mashburn. Md. Ann. Code Art. 101, \u00a7 58. The deduction represented the following sums previously paid by the insurer:</p>\n<p id=\"A12\">Temporary total disability $ 2,051.49</p>\n<p id=\"A9o\">Permanent total disability 9,000.00 <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Aty\">Medical bills 15,470.00</p>\n<p id=\"AH7\">Hospital bill 9/15/70 to 10/19/70 2,945.00</p>\n<p id=\"A8q\">The balance of $70,533.51 was delivered to appellee\u2019s then counsel. An attorney\u2019s fee of $33,333.33 was deducted, so that the claimant actually received the net sum of $37,200.18.</p>\n<p id=\"AmL\">Aetna, on October 29, 1970, notified the City Hospitals, where the claimant was a patient, that it was no longer responsible for the payment of medical bills that the claimant might incur from October 16, 1970 forward.3 <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Age\">Mashburn\u2019s then counsel, upon learning of Aetna\u2019s position, sought and obt\u00e1ined a hearing before the Commission on the following issue: \u201cPayment qf Medical Expenses in accordance with Art. 101, \u00a7 37.\u201d The hearing was held on December 22, 1970, and on February 4, 1971, the Commission concluded that the \u201cemployer and insurer are not liable for payment of medical expenses as a result of the claimant\u2019s accidental injury on April 11, 1970.\u201d The claimant, through his guardian, promptly filed a \u201cPetition For Appeal\u201d to the Circuit Court for Baltimore County. Appellants filed a demurrer to the petition. Before there was a ruling on the demurrer, the appellees submitted a \u201cSuggestion For Removal\u201d and the matter was transferred to the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County, where the demurrer was overruled. The appellants then filed an answer to the petition. The case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>was decided on its merits by a judge on the basis of a written stipulation of facts, argument of counsel and memoranda of law. The trial court vacated the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Commission\u2019s order of February 4, 1971, and remanded the case to the Commission \u201cfor entry of an award consistent with the findings in the Memorandum Opinion\u201d dated November 3, 1972. The court declined to hear testimony \u201cregarding the circumstances surrounding the . . . settlement\u201d of Mrs. Mash-burn\u2019s claim and denied a request for further hearing. The trial judge rejected the employer\u2019s and insurer\u2019s contention that the settlement of the third party claim acted to relieve them of the obligation to pay medical expenses, and held that the employer and insurer were \u201cliable for . . . medical expenses from and after October 19, 1970.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">Here, the appellants argue that the order of the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County should be reversed because:</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">1. \u201cSettlement Of Third Party Claim Instituted By An Employee Constitutes A Bar To Any Subsequent Workmen\u2019s Compensation Claim For Payment Of Medical Expenses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">2. \u201cThe Employer And Insurer Are Entitled To a Credit Of The Net Amount Received By The Claimant In His Third Party Action Against Subsequent Awards By The Workmen\u2019s Compensation Commission.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">3. That the employer and insurer are entitled to a credit \u201cfor some portion\u201d of the wife\u2019s settlement, and they should be allowed to present testimony in order to determine what \u201cportion\u201d they are entitled to receive.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-9\">It is patent that arguments 1 and 2 are in the alternative.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b350-11\">The Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act was first adopted in Maryland in 1914, Ch. 800, Md. Laws. Section 57 thereof <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>conferred upon an injured employee an election of remedies whereby he could proceed under the Compensation Act or against the third party, but not both. <em>Hagerstown v. Schreiner, </em>135 Md. 650, 109 A. 464 (1920). If a claim was made under the Act, then the employer was given the right to proceed against the third party for his own benefit and that of his insurer, provided that any excess over and above their actual expenses was to be paid to the injured employee. <em>Baltimore Transit Co. v. State, </em>183 Md. 674, 39 A. 2d 858 (1944). By the Acts of 1920 and 1922, the employee was granted the right to sue the third party if the employer had not done so within two months following an award of compensation to the injured employee or his dependents. The employee, or his dependents, if successful, were required to reimburse the employer or his insurer out of the proceeds that were recovered. <em>Clough &amp; Molloy, Inc. v. Shilling, </em>149 Md. 189, 131 A. 343 (1925). In 1957, \u201cThe Commission to Study Maryland\u2019s Workmen\u2019s Compensation Laws and the Operation of the State Industrial Accident Commission\u201d submitted a report to then Governor McKeldin in which they said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-5\">\u201cThe Study Commission believes that the fact that disability or death resulted under circumstances giving rise to <em>an action against a third party tortfeasor, should not operate, under any circumstances, to decrease the benefits properly allowable under Article 101. </em>To this end we recommend the repeal of Section 59 [now Section 58] and its reenactment with amendments . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (Emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">The amendment proposed by the Study Commission was adopted, Ch. 814 [1957] Md. Laws. Section 58 [then \u00a7 59] reads in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>\u201cWhere injury . . . for which compensation is payable under this article was caused under circumstances creating a legal liability in some person other than the employer to pay damages in respect thereof, the employee . . . may proceed either by law against that other person to recover damages or against the employer for compensation under this article, or in case of joint tortfeasors against both; and if compensation is claimed and awarded or paid under this article, any employer, if he is self-insured, [or] insurance company . . . may enforce for their benefit . . . the liability of such other person; provided, however, if damages are recovered in excess of the compensation already paid or awarded to be paid under this article, and also any payments made for medical or surgical services, funeral expenses or for any of the other purposes enumerated in \u00a7 36 of this article, then any such excess shall be paid to the injured employee . . . less the expenses and costs of action incurred by the employer [or] insurance company. ... If any such employer [or] insurance company . . . shall not, within two months from the passage of the award . . ., start proceedings to enforce the liability of such other person, the injured employee . . . may enforce the liability of such other person, provided, however, that if damages are recovered the injured employee . . . may first retain therefrom the expenses and costs of action incurred by the said employee . . ., and the employer [or] insurance company . . . shall be reimbursed for the compensation already paid or awarded and any amount or amounts paid for medical or surgical services ... or for any of the other purposes enumerated in \u00a7 36 of this article, except court costs and counsel or attorney\u2019s fees, which shall be paid by the injured employee . . . and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>employer [or] insurance company ... in the proportion that the amount received by each shall bear to the whole . . . and the balance in excess of these items shall inure to the injured employee . . ., and the amount thus received by the injured employee . . . shall be in lieu of any award that might otherwise have been made thereafter in the same case under the provisions of this article and said case shall thereupon be deemed to have been finally settled and closed <em>unless the amount thus received by the injured employee . . . from such other person shall be less than the injured employee . . . would be otherwise entitled to receive under the provisions of this article, in which event he </em>. . . <em>shall have the right to reopen the claim for compensation under this article to recover the difference between the amount thus received by the injured employee . . . and the full amount of compensation which would be otherwise payable under this article.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">Appellants read \u00a7 58 to preclude any recovery by the injured employee after settlement of his third party action. They point to the words \u201cshall be in lieu of any award that might otherwise have been made thereafter in the same case under the provisions of this article and said case shall thereupon be deemed to have been finally settled and closed.\u201d They acknowledge that the validity of the employee\u2019s claim for medical expenses is controlled by the 1957 amendment which added the words to \u00a7 58 (then \u00a7 59) \u201cunless the amount thus received by the injured employee . . . from such other person shall be less than the injured employee . . . would be otherwise entitled to receive under the provisions of this article. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">Appellants, nevertheless, urge upon us that \u00a7 58 contemplates not medical benefits but \u201ccompensation\u201d payments measured by \u00a7 36. They contend that, \u201cIt is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>unreasonable to conclude that the Legislature in 1957, in departing from the principle of election previously incorporated in Article 101 did so only to a limited extent, and that the Legislature in doing so used the schedules of Section 36 as a measure of the degree of such departure.\u201d They further aver that it is \u201cnot unreasonable to conclude that the Legislature conceived that an employee in the settlement of a third party suit would certainly recover at least his medical expenses, past, present and future.\u201d We think appellants misread \u00a7 58 and misinterpret the legislative intent. The report of the Study Commission above quoted, from which the General Assembly adopted <em>in toto </em>the 1957 amendment to \u00a7 58, makes it vividly clear that the purpose behind the amendment was to prevent an injured employee, who obtains recovery from a negligent third party, from receiving less in <em>benefits </em>under the Act than he would have been entitled to receive absent a third party claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">This Court, in <em>Uninsured Employers\u2019 Fund v. Booker, </em>13 Md. App. 591, 284 A. 2d 454 (1971), stated that the word \u201ccompensation\u201d as used in Art. 101 was sometimes employed to convey a \u201cbroad meaning,\u201d including medical benefits, and at other times used in a \u201climited sense, referring to the payments called for by the schedules in \u00a7 36.\u201d We said, \u201cWhich meaning is intended by a particular use of the word must be determined in each case by the context in which it is used.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">In <em>Subsequent Injury Fund v. Chapman, </em>11 Md. App. 369, 274 A. 2d 870 (1971), <em>aff\u2019d mem., </em>262 Md. 367, 277 A. 2d 444 (1971), it is stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-7\">\u201c. . . [W] here there is ambiguity in the compensation law the uncertainty should be resolved in favor of the claimant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-8\"><em>See also Uninsured Employers\u2019 Fund v. Booker, supra; Board of County Commissioners v. Fleming, </em>13 Md. App. 261, 282 A. 2d 512 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>The late Mr. Justice Holmes, sitting as a Circuit Judge, spelled out in <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>163 Fed. 30, 32 (1908), the test for applying legislative intent. He said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-5\"><em>\u201cThe Legislature has the power to decide what the policy of the law shall be, and if it has intimated its will, however indirectly, that will should be recognized and obeyed. </em>The major premise of the conclusion expressed in a statute, the change of policy that induces the enactment, may not be set out in terms, but it is not an adequate discharge of duty for the courts to say: We see what you are driving at, but you have not said it, and therefore we shall go on as before.\u201d (Emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">\n<em>See Board of County Commissioners v. Fleming, supra.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">We think it clear that the intent of the 1957 amendment was, in essence, that an injured employee may, by the combined result of his compensation claim and a proceeding against a negligent third party, recover more than he could recover under the Act, but he can never recover less. If he were to receive less from the third party than he is entitled to receive under the Act, he may then \u201creopen the claim ... to recover the difference between the amount . . . received [from the third party] . . . and the full amount of compensation which would be . . . payable\u201d under Art. 101. A reading of the Study Commission\u2019s Report, together with the 1957 enactment can, in our opinion, lead to no other reasonable interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-10\">The construction placed upon \u00a7 58 by appellants would deprive the appellee of benefits under the Act by limiting recovery to the amount obtained from the negligent third party (less any sum he is called upon to reimburse the employer-insurer), and would almost certainly discourage third party actions by other claimants where there is a possibility, such as here, of large future medical payments and thereby defeat the will of the General Assembly.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>We hold that the trial judge was correct in reversing the Commission\u2019s order of February 4, 1971, denying the \u201cpayment of medical expenses\u201d to the appellee, but we think the trial court\u2019s order to be too broad.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">The effect of the trial judge\u2019s order, appellants contend, and we agree, is to allow the claimant both to have his cake and eat it. He would be entitled, by virtue of the ruling of the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County, to retain the $37,200.18 and at the same time continue to receive payments under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">In <em>Gray v. State Roads Commission, </em>253 Md. 421, 252 A. 2d 810 (1969), the Court of Appeals cited with approval <em>Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation Commission, </em>Vol. 2, \u00a7 71.20, wherein Professor Larson said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-8\">\u201cIt is equally elementary that the claimant should not be allowed to keep the entire amount both of his award and his common-law damage recovery. <em>The obvious disposition of the matter is to give the employer so much of the negligence recovery as is necessary to reimburse him for his compensation outlay, and give the employee the excess. </em>This is fair to everyone concerned: the employer, who, in a fault sense, is neutral, comes out even. . . .\u201d (Emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-9\">When Md. Ann. Code Art. 101, \u00a7\u00a7 37 and 58 are read together, the legislative mandate is pellucid. The employer and insurer, under \u00a7 37, are responsible for thfe medical expenses incurred by the employee as a result of an accidental injury arising out of and during the course of his employment. No limitation is placed upon the dollar amount of the benefits conferred by that section. Under the provisions of \u00a7 58, an injured employee may assert a third party tortfeasor claim and may keep any excess over and above the amount necessary to reim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>burse the employer and insurer for the sums they have been called upon to pay to or on behalf of the injured employee under the provisions of the Act. The reimbursement requirement of \u00a7 58 precludes \u201cdouble recovery\u201d by the injured employee, and the 1957 amendment prevents his receiving less in benefits from a third party recovery than he would have received under Art. 101.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">The litigants have referred us to cases in other juris- , dictions <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> which support the position herein taken. We, however, need not rely upon them because as we read our statute it is susceptible of but one rational interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">The rule is that when a recovery is made by an injured employee from a negligent third party pursuant to \u00a7 58, the proceeds are to be distributed as of the time of settlement [or payment of judgment], and future payments by the employer and insurer are suspended until such time, if it occurs, that the net amount received by the injured employee from the negligent third party is exceeded by the benefits to which the injured employee would have been entitled in the absence of third party liability. At that point in time, the employer and its insurer shall recommence the payment of all benefits provided for in Art. 101.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">Applying the rule to the instant case, the appellants shall, when the compensation benefits (including the weekly award and the medical payments required by \u00a7 37) for which they would have become liable subsequent to October 19, 1970 exceed $37,200.18, the employer and insurer shall forthwith recommence payment of compensation benefits to or for the claimant.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">Appellants\u2019 third argument is totally devoid of merit. They assert that they should be entitled in some manner to participate in the proceeds that Mrs. Mashburn recovered in her derivative suit against Mrs. Vallone. It is obvious that, under the circumstances of this case, Mrs. Mashburn was not entitled to proceed against her husband\u2019s employer under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act for recovery for loss of consortium.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">Although the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act provides a right of subrogation to an employer and insurer, \u00a7 58, <em>Cogley v. Schnaper and Koren Construction Co., </em>14 Md. App. 322, 286 A. 2d 819 (1972), there must be some act performed or committed by, for, or against the subrogee that gives rise to the right to subrogate; In the instant case the appellants did not, nor were they legally obligated to, pay any sum to Mrs. Mashburn. We perceive no act performed or committed by Mrs. Mashburn that would justify the appellants\u2019 being subrogated to any of her claim against Mrs. Vallone. It is difficult to follow the appellants\u2019 reasoning that they should be allowed to present testimony in order to show in some vague way that they are entitled to participate in the proceeds recovered by Mrs. Mashburn. Appellants attempt to imply that the amount paid to Mashburn was insufficient and disproportionate to his injuries and that the amount received by Mrs. Mashburn was in excess of a reasonable sum for loss of consortium. Appellants, we observe, joined in the release of Mashburn\u2019s claim against the third party tortfeasor and knew, or should have known, that Mrs. Mashburn did not execute that release individually, but only in her capacity as guardian of her husband. The Circuit Court of Baltimore City approved the settlement. After the amount of the wife\u2019s individual recovery had been called to the attention of the Chancellor, he investigated and again approved the guardian\u2019s settlement <em>nunc pro tunc. </em>We know of no theory of law, nor have we been referred to any by appellants, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>would justify this Court\u2019s authorizing appellants to conduct a \u201cfishing expedition\u201d into the circumstances surrounding Mrs. Mashburn\u2019s individual settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">We hold that the trial judge properly refused to consider appellants\u2019 assertion of a right to share in the monies recovered by Mrs. Mashburn in her derivative action.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">\n<em>Order affirmed in part; reversed in part; and remanded to the Circmt Court for Anne Arundel County for the passage of an order not inconsistent with this opinion.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">\n<em>Costs to be paid by appellants.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">\n<em>Mandate to issue forthwith.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b348-7\">. The issues of accidental injury and disability arising out of the course of employment were resolved adversely to the employer and insurer by the Commission on July 21, 1970. No appeal was taken therefrom.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b348-8\">. We were advised at oral argument that the Circuit Court of Baltimore City had been apprised of the amount of Mrs. Mash-burn\u2019s settlement at the time it approved the settlement of the claim institued for Mashburn by his guardian.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"A6y\">.
