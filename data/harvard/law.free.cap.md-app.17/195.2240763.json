The vehicle was owned by Mr. &amp; Mrs. Auffort. As the Aufforts have not filed an appeal, the question of liability is not an issue. The appellants\u2019 main contention on appeal is the trial court was in error in failing to grant a requested instruction that Mrs. Sipe was entitled to recover lost earnings already incurred and for the potential loss of future earnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-11\">At the time of the accident, Mrs. Sipe, a registered nurse, was a 53 year old married woman with two adult children and one minor.son; she was employed by a physician, Dr. Richard P. Delaney. The day of the accident was the first day of her annual two-week vacation which she and her family had planned to spend in Ocean City, Maryland. Within an hour after the accident, her neck began to hurt; the next day she saw Dr. Benack as her employer was also on vacation. Dr. Benack prescribed moist heat treatments.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-12\">On August 15, 1969, the day she was scheduled to return to work, Mrs. Sipe telephoned her employer and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>requested further time off from work because of her injuries. When she did return, Dr. Delaney continued the heat treatments until February of 1970 when he referred her to Dr. Mayle, a neurologist, who in turn referred her to Dr. George Thorpe for physical therapy treatments. Dr. Thorpe and Dr. Mayle continued treating her throughout 1970. In April, 1971, Dr. Mayle referred her to Dr. Oliver, an orthopedist, because her lower back and hip were still bothering her. She was still under Dr. Oliver\u2019s care at the time of trial. Shortly before trial, her employer, Dr. Delaney, also referred her to Dr. Lord, a neurosurgeon, for additional consultation. After examination, Dr. Lord recommended she wear a back brace, which she was wearing at the time of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">Mrs. Sipe stated that prior to the accident she had no problem with her back or hip but that they had been bothering her continuously thereafter, and that she had to sleep with a heating pad every night since the accident. She testified that the injuries had adversely affected her in the performance of her work at the office and in her chores at home as well as her social and recreational activities. During the summers she had had to take extra time off without pay and that in addition to the two weeks in 1969, she took two weeks in 1970 and one month in 1971. She had already informed Dr. Delaney that she would be unable to work after June 22 of the current year. She testified that her salary in 1969 had been $100 to $125 a week, in 1970, $130 to $135 per week. In 1971 she made $3.10 an hour or about $138 or $140 a week. She testified that before the accident she was working approximately 48 hours a week but that she was now working 4% days.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">George Sipe, her husband, testified that since the accident his wife was unable to perform her household chores in the usual manner and she now needed assistance; she could not lift anything, was unable to finish ironing, could not do any stretching and had difficulty climbing stairs. Dr. Delaney testified that after the accident, Mrs. Sipe had to spend more time away from the job because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>of her back pain and that although she came to work in pain, there were times when it got to be too much for her and she just could not come. While at the office, she frequently had to sit down, interrupting the performance of her duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">Dr. Norman Oliver testified that as a result of the accident Mrs. Sipe had suffered a \u201csoft disc at L-5\u201d which meant a partial denervation in the muscles at the fifth lumbar vertebra. In his opinion the condition was permanent. Dr. George Thorpe testified that Mrs. Sipe suffered an injury to a \u201cL-5 nerve root on the right side which showed a slight partial denervation, which indicates that some of the nerve fibers in the muscle are broken.\u201d In his opinion the injury was caused by the accident and was permanent.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">In the line of cases cited in the note<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and more recently in <em>Bender v. Popp, </em>246 Md. 65, 227 A. 2d 237, the Court of Appeals has considered what testimony would support an instruction as to the plaintiff\u2019s right to recover for impairment of future earning capacity. The evidence supporting the impairment was no more definite in those cases than in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">Appellees argue that the damage instructions given by the trial judge and quoted in the note <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> sufficiently de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>limited for the jurors the extent of what they should consider as damages. It will be observed that various classes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>of damages were itemized but without reference to impairment of earnings. Appellees ignore <em>Bender v. Popp, supra, </em>which holds specifically to the contrary on somewhat similar evidence and somewhat similar instructions ; rather they rely on <em>Wilhelm v. State Traffic Safety Commission, </em>230 Md. 91, 185 A. 2d 715, wherein the trial judge stated that the plaintiff was entitled to recover for the loss of services she \u201chas sustained.\u201d The Court held that although the instructions could have been clearer, when considered as a whole they fairly presented the issue as to future losses to the jury and there appeared to be no prejudice. The appellees also cite <em>Hartman v. Meadows, </em>243 Md. 158, 220 A. 2d 555, wherein the plaintiff felt that a portion of the court\u2019s charge indicated that one of the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses may have been untruthful with reference to a collateral issue. The Court looking at instructions as a whole decided that the average jury of the day would not be likely to draw such a conclusion from his instruction to ignore certain evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\"><em>Wilhelm </em>and <em>Hartman </em>are not applicable as the cases cited <em>supra </em>hold that the trial judge, in a case such as this, is required, on request, to grant a specific instruction as to impairment of future earnings. It follows that if the evidence presented was sufficient to support an instruction concerning impairment of future earnings that it was more than sufficient to support an instruction that Mrs. Sipe was entitled to recover for loss of prior earnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">Appellants also raise a question concerning the instructions as to future medical expenses. This item was specifically covered by the instructions given.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">\n<em>Judgments reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">\n<em>Case remanded for new trial on the issue of damages.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b218-9\">\n<em>Appellees to pay costs.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b216-8\">. <em>Ihrie v.
