Garrity </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b228-10\">Submitted by <em>Francis B. Burch, Attorney General, Arrie W. Davis, Assistant Attorney General, Arthur A. Marshall, Jr., State\u2019s Attorney for Prince George's County, </em>and <em>Richard P. Arnold, Assistant State\u2019s Attorney for Prince George\u2019s County, </em>for appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b228-11\">Thomas, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AE1\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-12\">The appellant, Clovis E. Jones, was tried and convicted by Judge Robert B. Mathias, sitting with a jury, in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County, on April 6, 1972, on a charge of committing robbery with a deadly weapon and was sentenced to a term of twenty years imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-13\">The questions presented on appeal are:</p>\n<p id=\"b228-14\">1. Was there sufficient identification evidence to sustain appellant\u2019s conviction ?</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>2. Did the lower court err in not admonishing the jury that th,e gun was not formally admitted into evidence ?</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">3. Was a reasonable doubt created as to the appellant\u2019s guilt by the alibi testimony ?</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">4. Did the lower court properly instruct the jury?</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">This opinion concerns the first question.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">On December 12, 1970, Douglas R. Wills was closing the 7-11 Store of which he was manager at approximately 10:58 P.M. when a man entered and demanded \u201call your money\u201d. Mr. Wills handed over the cash drawer containing about $200.00 and food stamps and was shot in the hand. Another employee was shot in the leg.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-9\">At the trial, Mr. Wills was asked on direct examination, \u201cAre you able to point out the person who is sitting in this courtroom who walked up to you with a gun and who shot you?\u201d His reply was, \u201cNo.\u201d Subsequently, in the same examination, the State\u2019s Attorney asked, \u201cCan you say whether or not the man who came into the store and approached you with a gun and told you it was a robbery, can you say definitely whether or not that man is in the courtroom today?\u201d, to which Wills responded, \u201cI can\u2019t say it definitely.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b229-10\">During his cross-examination, Wills testified that on January 8, 1971, he picked out a photograph of the appellant from among photographs of others and said, \u201cThis looks like the guy that shot me.\u201d He further testified that he wrote on the back of the photograph, \u201cPositive this is the man that shot me, 1-8-71, 5:00 p.m.\u201d, and that he signed the statement. In explanation, he testified that on January 8th, he felt the appellant was the person who shot him, but after fifteen months, he could not make a positive identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-11\">Detective Raymond E. Daniels testified as a State\u2019s witness that Wills identified the appellant\u2019s photograph from a group of six pictures. On cross-examination by defendant\u2019s counsel, Detective Daniels was asked to whom he talked at the scene of the crime, and he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>answered, \u201cMr. Ryan and Mr. Hill personally\u201d. On the basis of this question, on cross-examination, the State\u2019s Attorney argued that he was now \u201c. . . entitled at this time to find out what the conversation was, and specifically in regard to the photographic identification we would, with the Court\u2019s consent, proceed on these lines.\u201d Over objection, the State\u2019s Attorney elicited from Detective Daniels that Mr. Hill and Mr. Ryan, who were in the store at the time of the robbery, picked out the appellant\u2019s photograph and signed it. Hill also inscribed the date and wrote a comment on the back of the photograph. Subpoenas were unable to be served on Hill and Ryan, and they were not in Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">The State established through the testimony of Mr. Wills and Detective Daniels that Wills picked out appellant\u2019s photograph shortly after the holdup although he failed to identify appellant in Court positively. Presumably to bolster the identification, the State had the police officer testify as to the actions of Hill and Ryan, two witnesses to the crime, in identifying appellant\u2019s photograph. This testimony was admitted upon the theory that the selection of appellant\u2019s photograph was a mere physical action rather than something of communicative significance. We believe that the photographic identification was essentially communicative in nature and is, therefore, subject to the strictures of the hearsay rule, when the persons making that identification are not in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">In <em>Smith &amp; Samuels v. State, </em>6 Md. App. 59, beginning at page 63, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-7\">\u201cTHE ADMISSIBILITY OF IDENTIFICATION EVIDENCE</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-8\">At the time the <em>Wade-Gilbert-Stovall </em>trilogy of. opinions were decided by the Supreme Court of the United States <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> it was the general rule in this State that a judicial identification of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>accused, made under the impartial eye of the court, was admissible. It was also the general rule that a witness\u2019 testimony as to a prior extra-judicial identification \u2018should be admitted for the purpose of corroborating the witness and bolstering his credibility * * *.\u2019 <em>Judy v. State, </em>218 Md. 168, 174. And testimony by a police officer or some third party as to an extrajudicial identification by an eye-witness was admissible when made under circumstances precluding the suspicion of unfairness or unreliability, <em>Walters v. State, </em>242 Md. 235, 239, <em>where the out of court declarant was present at the trial and subject to cross-examination, Johnson v. State, </em>237 Md. 283. It was admissible whether or not the out-of-court declarant made a positive in-court identification, and thus was admissible not only as corroboration of a judicial identification but as substantive evidence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Johnson v. State, supra, </em>289. See also <em>Proctor v. State, </em>223 Md. 394; <em>Basoff v. State, </em>208 Md. 643; <em>Wilkins v. State, </em>5 Md. App. 8; <em>Crumb v. State, </em>1 Md. App. 98. The weight to be given a judicial or extra-judicial identification was a matter for the trier of fact. <em>Barnes v. State, </em>5 Md. App. 144; <em>Crosby v. State, 2 </em>Md. App. 578. An extra-judicial identification is usually made either by a personal confrontation between the witness and the accused or by a viewing of photographs by the witness and the rules above discussed were applicable to both. See <em>Austin v. State, </em>3 Md. App. 231.\u201d (footnotes as in original)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">Also see <em>Jones v. State, </em>10 Md. App. 420, at 423.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number><em>Dorsey v. State, </em>9 Md. App. 80 at 85, states the law succinctly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-5\">\u201cThe rule is that evidence of an identification . at a pretrial confrontation or viewing of photographs is admissible as substantive, independent evidence of identification or as corroborative of a judicial identification, not only when received through the testimony of the out of court declarant, but also when received through the testimony of a police officer or some third party observing the extrajudicial identification, when the out of court declarant is present at the trial and subject to cross-examination.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">In his article on \u201cExtrajudicial Identification\u201d in 19 Md. Law Review 201 at 219 and 220, Martin A. Dyer comments on the hearsay aspect of extrajudicial identification :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-7\">\u201cFor the same reasons for which it has been contended that an exception to the hearsay rule should exist to admit testimony of an extrajudicial identification, where declarant and witness are identical, one might conceivably argue also that an exception should exist to admit such testimony where the witness and declarant are different persons. It would seem that the result to be achieved in either case, supporting an identification made in court which has little testimonial force, is the same. The element of necessity, however, upon which exceptions to the hearsay rule are usually predicated, seems to be lacking. Where the declarant is available as a witness, there is no necessity for having the evidence introduced by some other person, since the same testimony can be elicited from the declarant-witness. Where the declarant is unavailable by reason of incapacitation, death or other acceptable rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>son, then, within the existing framework of the law of Evidence, adequate necessity might be said to exist for admitting the evidence of the extrajudicial identification through the testimony of a third-person-witness, as an exception to the hearsay rule.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> In both of these situations, however, there looms a tremendous question as to the reliability of a third-person-witness, the possible inaccuracies of whose testimony cannot be demonstrated by cross-examination. The cross-examiner cannot show that the declarant did not observe accurately, that his powers of perception were inadequate, that his recollection is imperfect, or indeed that he was not telling the truth. Testimony from the relation of a third person to the event, even where the declarant is known, cannot be subjected to such tests. Obviously, such testimony is subject to every conceivable hearsay objection.\u201d (footnote as in original)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">Certainly the hearsay aspect of identification cannot be avoided by eliminating words of identification but permitting evidence of demonstrative identification. Should such evasion of the hearsay rule be countenanced, the door would be open to testimony as to pointing of fingers, shaking of heads, grimaces of joy or disgust, all suggestive of the game of Charades. To permit the detective to testify that the absent witness picked appellant\u2019s photograph from a group of photographs is fully as effective as testimony of an actual spoken identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">The admission of the hearsay identification in the absence of the identifying witnesses was here not harm<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>less beyond a reasonable doubt. See <em>Chapman v. State of </em>California, 386 U. S. 18. In this instance, such identification could have contributed to the conviction. Although Wills made an extrajudicial identification, he was unable to identify positively the defendant in court. The ingredient necessary to convince the jury may well have been the testimony of Detective Daniels as to the out of court identification by the absent witnesses. Therefore, in view of the complete lack of any in-court identification of the appellant by anyone, and considering the nature of Wills\u2019s extrajudicial photographic identification, we are not convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the erroneously admitted extrajudicial identifications of both Ryan and Hill did not contribute to the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">As the case will be reversed on the first issue, there is no need to consider the remaining issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed; case remanded for a new trial.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b230-9\">. <em>United States v.
