Louisiana, </em>391 U. S. 145, 152. \u201cTo the Englishman of the fourteenth century ... it had already become an \u2018ancient prerogative\u2019 to have twelve laymen stand between him and the vengeance of the king in a criminal prosecution of any kind, whether the charge were tippling at the inn or murder.\u201d Frankfurter &amp; Corcoran, <em>Petty Federal Offenses and the Constitutional Guaranty of Trial by Jury, </em>39 Harv. L. Rev. 917 (1926) at 923 (hereinafter referred to as Frankfurter &amp; Corcoran).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Blackstone considered jury trial to be a strong barrier between liberties of the people and the prerogative of the Crown. 4 Blackstone, <em>Commentaries on the Laws of England </em>349. The colonists recognized trial by jury as preventing oppression by the Government, see <em>Williams v. Florida, </em>399 U. S. 78, 100, and deeply resented royal interference with it. This resentment is apparent in resolutions adopted by the First Congress of the American Colonists [The Stamp Act Congress], declarations by the First Continental Congress, and statements in the Declaration of Independence. The constitutions adopted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>by the original states guaranteed jury trial.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Constitution of Maryland was framed \u201cin free and full Convention assembled\u201d which met at Annapolis 14 August 1776 and completed its labors 11 November 1776.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The delegates, \u201ctaking into [their] most serious consideration the best means of establishing a good Constitution in this State, for the sure foundation and more permanent security thereof\u201d, assented to and passed a Declaration of Rights. As to trial by jury, they declared :</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">\u201cIII. That the inhabitants of Maryland are entitled to the common law of England, and the trial by jury, according to the course of that law, . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">\u201cXIX. That, in all criminal prosecutions, every man hath a right ... to a speedy trial by an impartial jury, without whose unanimous consent he ought not to be found guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">\u201cXXI. That no freeman ought to be taken, or' imprisoned, or disseized of his freehold, liberties, or privileges, or outlawed, or exiled, or in any manner destroyed, or . deprived of his life, liberty, or property, but by the judgment of his peers, or by the law of the land.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">The declarations with respect to jury trial remained intact as Articles 3, 19 and 21 in the Declaration of Rights of the Constitution of Maryland of 1851.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In the Declaration of Rights of the Constitution of 1867, still in effect, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>the jury trial provisions were designated respectively as Articles 5, 21 and 23.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">The concern for the right to jury trial was also evident with respect to the federal government of the new United States of America as proposed after separation of the colonies. The Constitution of the United States, \u201cDone in Convention by the Unanimous Consent of the States present<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the Seventeenth Day of September in the Year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and Eighty-seven and of the Independence of the United States of America the Twelfth\u201d, provided in Article III, Section 2: \u201cThe Trial of All Crimes, except in Cases of Impeachment, shall be by jury; . . .\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The first ten amendments to the Constitution were proposed by Congress on 25 September 1789, and declared ratified on 15 December 1791. Article VI of the amendments guaranteed that \u201cIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed ...\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">It has been the constant course of litigation in England, for centuries past, to confer summary jurisdiction upon justices of the peace for the trial and conviction of parties for minor and statutory police offenses. <em>State v. Glenn, </em>54 Md. 572, 600. Blackstone found that criminal proceedings were divisible into two kinds: summary and regular. \u201cBy a <em>summary </em>proceeding I mean principally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>such as is directed by several Acts of Parliament (for the common law is a stranger to it, unless in the case of contempts) for the conviction of offenders, and the inflicting of certain penalties created by those Acts of Parliament. In these there is no intervention of a jury, but the party accused is acquitted or condemned by the suffrage of such person only as the statute has appointed for his judge. An institution designed professedly for the greater ease of the subject, by doing him speedy justice, and by not harassing the freeholders with frequent and troublesome attendances to try every minute offence.\u201d 4 Blackstone, <em>Commentaries on the Laws of England </em>280-281.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Thus it was that a great number of offenses were disposed of in justices\u2019 courts by summary trials, prompted by a constant effort to adjust the machinery of jury trial with the volumes of litigation which came before the Sessions. There was no unifying consideration as to the type of criminal offense subjected to summary trial, although the great majority of instances were aptly characterized as \u201cpetty\u201d violations. See Frankfurter &amp; Corcoran, 922-934. The colonists in America, facing problems comparable to those experienced by England, and having brought with them legal traditions of which summary jurisdiction by justices of the peace was a familiar part, \u201cresorted to summary jurisdiction for minor offenses with full loyalty to their conception of the Englishman\u2019s right to trial by jury.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 936. In Frankfurter and Corcoran the printed record of seven of the colonies, of which Maryland was one, was examined to ascertain evidence as to their use of summary procedure. The record showed that those colonies \u201cacted on the conviction that the much-cherished jury procedure was not imperative for small offenses\u201d, and that \u201cthe practice of summary procedure, pursued in varying measure by the different colonies, persisted unchallenged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>through the acrimonious controversy with the Crown over the denial of the jury in admiralty courts, through the framing of the jury clauses in state constitutions, and through the enactment of the jury clauses in the Federal Constitution.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 937.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">Our Court of Appeals recognized that not every criminal prosecution is within the ambit of the provisions of the Constitution of Maryland relating to trial by jury. <em>Maryland Constitutional Law, </em>Niles, 42-44 (1915). It has held the various acts providing summary proceedings for certain offenses to be constitutional. In <em>State v. Glenn, supra, </em>the court, after tracing the course of English justice, noted, at 602: \u201cThe exercise of the summary jurisdiction, therefore, is not, in England at least, regarded as being in violation of the fundamental guarantees of the rights and liberties of the people; and the personal liberty of the subject at this day is as well and jealously protected in England as in any other country, where the principles of <em>Magna Charta </em>and of the common law are enforced.\u201d It observed: \u201cWith us there has been no time since the earliest days of the colony that the summary jurisdiction by justices of the peace has not been exercised, in one form or another, over parties offending against the peace and good order of society. This jurisdiction has been exercised, some<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>times under British statutes in force here, but more generally under statutes passed by the Colonial and State Legislatures.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>It stated: \u201cThe framers of all our Constitutions were well acquainted with the history of legislation in regard to the exercise of summary jurisdiction, both in England and in this State, and of the needs of society for summary protection against the vicious, idle, vagrant and disorderly portion of its members ; and it is difficult to suppose that, by any provision incorporated in those instruments, it was intended to nullify previous legislation, altogether interdict the use of a long and well-established summary jurisdiction for the protection of society, and thus radically change and seriously impair the whole police system of the State.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 604-605. It construed the constitutional jury trial provisions, at 605-606: \u201cThe meaning of the provisions of the Declaration of Rights would seem to be plain. . . . [W]hen it is declared that the party is entitled to a speedy trial by an impartial jury, that must be understood as referring to such crimes and accusations as have, by the regular course of the law and the established modes of procedure, as theretofore practiced, been the subjects of jury trial. It could never have been intended to embrace every species of accusation involving either criminal or penal consequences. . . . The design, manifestly, of the provisions of the Declaration of Rights to which we have referred, was simply to declare and make firm the pre-existing rights of the people, as those rights had been established by usage and the settled course of law.\u201d <em>Glenn </em>was quoted and followed in <em>Danner v. State, </em>89 Md. 220, which then discussed the types of offenses which commanded a jury trial and those which did not. \u201cThe right to demand a jury trial, being as we have thus seen guaranteed only to such crimes and accusations as have by the regular course of the law and established mode of procedure as theretofore practiced, it becomes necessary to inquire as to what class of offences entitle the party to its enjoyment. It is clear that it cannot be demanded in many minor offences. These could always <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>be reached by summary proceedings. <em>State v. Glenn (supra); </em>but it is difficult to define with precision the class of cases that could be so tried. It may, however, be stated as a general rule that for any criminal oifence for which a person is liable to infamous punishment, a trial by jury cannot be denied him.\u201d 89 Md. at 226. The Court held that confinement in the penitentiary was infamous punishment. In <em>Lancaster v. State, </em>90 Md. 211, 215-216, the Court asserted: \u201cThere can be no question since the decision of this Court in the case of <em>State v. Glenn, </em>54 Md. 599, and <em>Danner v. State, </em>89 Md. 220, that the Legislature can, under the provisions of the Constitution of this State, confer summary jurisdiction upon justices of the peace to try persons for assaults and batteries.\u201d See <em>State v. Ward, </em>95 Md. 118; <em>State v. Loden, </em>117 Md. 373; <em>Norwood v. Wiseman, </em>141 Md. 696.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">Such was the status of the law in Maryland until 1968. It was believed that the right to jury trial in criminal causes flowed from provisions in the Declaration of Rights of the Maryland Constitution and that the federal constitution did not demand the use of jury trials in state criminal proceedings. <em>Bristow v. State, </em>242 Md. 283, 289. Even so, there seems to be no real distinction between the right as bestowed by the State constitution and the right as bestowed by the federal constitution. \u201cCertain it is\u201d, concluded Frankfurter &amp; Corcoran, at 969, \u201cthat the framers [of the federal constitution] did not mean to provide for jury trial in criminal cases under the new government beyond the established practice in their various states.\u201d <em>Duncan v. Louisiana, </em>391 U. S. 145, decided 20 May 1968, held that the right to jury trial extended by the Sixth Amendment with respect to federal criminal proceedings is also protected against state action. \u201cBecause we believe that trial by jury in criminal cases is fundamental to the American scheme of justice, we hold that the Fourteenth Amendment guarantees right of jury trial in all criminal cases which \u2014 were they to be tried in a federal court \u2014 would come within the Sixth Amendment\u2019s guarantee.\u201d 391 U. S. at 149. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>right of jury trial guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment qualifies for protection under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment \u201cand must therefore be respected by the States.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 156. Thus the federal constitutional guarantee is impressed upon Maryland, and we are obliged to follow it as the Supreme Court has construed it.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">Having determined that the right to jury trial guaranteed by the federal constitution was applicable to state criminal prosecution, the Court addressed itself to the extent of the right.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Looking to the past, it saw that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>\u201c[s]o-called petty offenses were tried without juries both in England and in the Colonies and have always been held to be exempt from the otherwise comprehensive language of the Sixth Amendment\u2019s jury trial provisions.\u201d <em>Duncan </em>at 160. It found \u201cno substantial evidence that the Framers intended to depart from this established common-law practice.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>It noted that \u201cthe possible consequences to defendants from convictions for petty offenses have been thought insufficient to outweigh the benefits to efficient law enforcement and simplified judicial administration resulting from the availability of speedy and inexpensive non-jury adjudications. These same considerations compel the same result under the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>It concluded: \u201cIt is doubtless true that there is a category of petty crimes or offenses which is not subject to the Sixth Amendment jury trial provision and should not be subject to the Fourteenth Amendment jury trial requirement here applied to the States.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 159. It held \u201cno constitutional doubts\u201d about the practice of prosecuting petty crimes without extending a right to jury trial. <em>Id., </em>at 158.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">Necessarily, the boundaries of the petty offense category, which the Court in <em>Duncan </em>thought had always been \u201cill-defined, if not ambulatory\u201d, must be ascertained. It said, at 160:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-6\">\u201cIn the absence of an explicit constitutional provision, the definitional task necessarily falls on the courts, which must either pass upon the validity of legislative attempts to identify those petty offenses, which are exempt from jury trial or, where the legislature has not addressed itself to the problem, themselves face the question in the first instance. In either case it is necessary to draw a line in the spectrum of crime, separating petty from serious infractions.\u201d ,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">The Court, however, refused to give a precise definition of a petty crime. \u201cWe need not, however, settle in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>case the exact location of the line between petty offenses and serious crimes.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 161. It did provide some guidelines. \u201cCrimes carrying possible penalties up to six months do not require a jury trial if they otherwise qualify as petty offenses\u201d, <em>id., </em>at 159, citing <em>Cheff v. Schnackenberg, </em>384 U. S. 373. The Court observed that in determining whether the length of the authorized prison term or the seriousness of other punishment is enough in itself to require a jury trial, there should be reference \u201cto objective criteria, chiefly the existing laws and practices in the Nation,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 161. It then referred to the federal system in which petty offenses are defined by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1, as those punishable by no more than six months in prison and a $500 fine. <em>Ibid. </em>And it made clear that in any event \u201ca crime punishable by two years in prison is, based on past and contemporary standards in this country, a serious crime and not a petty offense.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 162. See <em>Williams v. Florida, </em>399 U. S. 78; <em>Frank v. United States, </em>395 U. S. 147; <em>Dyke v. Taylor Implement Mfg. Co., </em>391 U. S. 216; <em>Bloom v. Illinois, </em>391 U. S. 194. In <em>Baldwin v. New York, </em>399 U. S. 66, the Court went a step further. It accepted the task before it as \u201cThe essential if not wholly satisfactory one ... of determining the line between \u2018petty\u2019 and \u2018serious\u2019 for the purposes of the Sixth Amendment right to jury trial.\u201d At 68. It concluded, at 69, \u201cthat no offense can be deemed \u2018petty\u2019 for purposes of the right to trial by jury where imprisonment for more than six months is authorized.\u201d <footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>This Court has used the \u201csix months, $500 fine\u201d criterion in deciding cases before it. <em>In re Kinlein, </em>15 Md. App. 625; <em>Staten v. State, </em>13 Md. App. 425; <em>In re Martin, </em>10 Md. App. 385.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">With respect to the trial of criminal causes originating in the circuit court of a county or the Criminal Court of Baltimore, there is no statutory standard prescribing the line between \u201cpetty\u201d and \u201cserious\u201d other than the penalty authorized for a particular crime or offense. By the maximum penalty authorized the legislature has included within the definition of the crime itself a judgment about the seriousness of the offense. <em>Frank v. United States, supra, </em>at 149. In such cases, the <em>Duncan-Baldwin </em>test applies, namely, for purposes of right to trial by jury, the offense is petty where imprisonment for no more than six months or fine of not more than $500 is authorized. Maryland Rule 741, providing that \u201cAn accused may elect to be tried by jury or by the court\u201d, must be read in this light.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> It does not entitle an accused to a jury trial in all criminal proceedings, but only in those in which he has the constitutional right to jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">On the other hand, there is a statutory prescription of the right to jury trial with respect to offenses within the jurisdiction of the District Court. See Code, Art. 26, \u00a7 145 (b). In every such case brought in the District Court \u201cthe defendant shall have a right at any time prior to trial to demand a trial by jury if the punishment for the particular offense with which he is charged permits imprisonment for a period in excess of 3 months. If a right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>to jury trial exists and such a trial is demanded by the defendant the matter shall be removed for trial to the circuit court in the county in which the alleged offense occurred or to the Criminal Court of Baltimore if the alleged offense occurred in that city.\u201d Code, Art. 26, \u00a7 145 (b) (5) (ii) ,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The result is that as to any criminal or traffic case within the jurisdiction of the District Court, be it a case over which that Court has exclusive original jurisdiction or a case over which that Court has concurrent jurisdiction with a circuit court or the Criminal Court of Baltimore, the accused is entitled to jury trial when the authorized sentence is in excess of 3 months. This is so whether the case originated in the District Court and was removed by demand for jury trial, or whether, when subject to concurrent jurisdiction, originated in the Circuit Court or Criminal Court of Baltimore. And this is so, despite the fact that as to cases not within the jurisdiction of the District Court, an accused is entitled to a jury trial only if the sentence authorized is imprisonment in excess of 6 months or a fine in excess of &lt;j&gt;500.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>There is another manner in which an accused charged with a crime or offense within the jurisdiction of the District Court may ultimately have his case tried by a jury. An appeal from a judgment of the District Court in a criminal or traffic case is taken to the circuit court in the county in which the judgment was rendered or to the Criminal Court of Baltimore if the case was originally tried in Baltimore City. It is then tried de novo, unless otherwise agreed by the parties. Code, Art. 26, \u00a7 156 (a). Rule 1314 provides: \u201cUpon the filing of an order for appeal to the appellate court in a case to be heard de novo, the rules of procedure governing cases instituted in the appellate court shall apply, except as they relate to the form and sufficiency of the pleadings.\u201d Then Rule 741, dealing with election of jury trial at the circuit court level, becomes applicable, and that Rule, in this frame of reference, must be viewed in the light of the provisions of Code, Art. 26, \u00a7 145 (b) (5) (ii). Thus, as a statutory right, an accused is entitled to be tried by a jury at the de novo trial if the punishment for the offense charged permits imprisonment for a period in excess of 3 months, and as a constitutional right, he is entitled to be so tried if the punishment for the offense permits a fine in excess of $500.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">On 19 January 1972 DENNIS D. SMITH was issued two summonses for violation of the traffic laws. No. 0371612 charged him with exceeding 25 miles per hour, viz. speeding 41 miles per hour in a 25 mile per hour zone. No. 0371613 charged him with \u201cfleeing or attempt to elude police officer.\u201d He was tried in the District Court and was found guilty of each offense. He was fined $50 and costs on the speeding conviction and $100 and costs on the \u201cfleeing\u201d conviction. He appealed. The cases were heard de novo in the Criminal Court of Baltimore at a bench trial after his request for a jury trial was denied. He was found guilty of each offense and again fined $50 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>and costs and $100 and costs respectively. Upon Ms petition, we certified the cases to this Court for review and determination. Code, Art. 5, \u00a7 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">The offense charged by summons 0371612 is proscribed by Code, Art. 66%, \u00a7 11-801. The offense charged by summons 0371613 is proscribed by \u00a7 11-904 of that Article. As to each offense the punishment upon conviction as authorized by \u00a7 17-101 (b) is a fine of not more than $500 or imprisonment for not more than 2 months or both. In addition, the Legislature has mandated that the Motor Vehicle Administration, upon receiving a record of the licensee\u2019s conviction of a violation of \u00a7 11-904, forthwith revoke any operator\u2019s license when the conviction has become final, \u00a7 6-205. There is no appeal from such mandatory revocation, \u00a7 6-211. Smith\u2019s license was revoked with permission to request an application for reinstatement 60 days from the date his license was turned in, \u00a7 6-208. The order of revocation was cancelled when the Administration received notice that the judgments had been appealed, as they were then, not final.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">Smith contends that the refusal of the Criminal Court of Baltimore to extend to him a trial by jury \u201cis a violation of his constitutional rights under article 3, section 2, . . . and the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States.\u201d The contention is bottomed only on the right to jury trial guaranteed by the federal constitution. Smith does not suggest that he was denied a trial by jury in violation of the Declaration of Rights of the Maryland Constitution, and, in the light of the judicial construction of those Rights it is quite apparent that they were not here violated. Nor does he claim that he was denied a jury trial in violation of any statute, and we think it plain because of the punishment permitted for the particular offenses with which he was charged that he was without the ambit of Code, Art. 26, \u25a0\u00a7 145 (b) (5) (ii).He does not argue, as he did below, that he was entitled to elect a jury trial under Rule 741. In any event, as we have indicated, that Rule b\u00e9stows <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>no right to jury trial. It merely authorizes an accused entitled to a jury trial to elect between a jury trial and a court trial. Smith attempts to invoke Art. Ill, \u00a7 2 of the federal constitution. He may not do so. He was convicted through State prosecution, and Art. Ill, \u00a7 2 concerns the judicial power of the United States, not of the individual states. The jury provisions of that Article have not been held to be applicable to state judicial power or proceedings; it is the Sixth Amendment guarantee that is protected from state action by the Fourteenth Amendment. Therefore the contention is to be determined only with respect to Smith\u2019s right to jury trial under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">The precise question is, \u201cWere the cases before us to be tried in a federal court would they come within the Sixth Amendment\u2019s guarantee of the right of jury trial?\u201d If they would, Smith had the right to jury trial under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment in the trial de novo on appeal.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">It is patent that on the basis of the maximum authorized punishment of imprisonment for not more than 2 months and fine of not more than $500, Smith did not have to be extended a jury trial. What Smith urges is that a jury trial was compelled with regard to the offense under Code, Art. 66*4, \u00a7 11-904, not because of the possible punishment of imprisonment and fine alone, but because of the added possible penalty of the mandatory revocation of his operator\u2019s license upon final conviction. It is this legislative mandate to revoke his license to drive, he argues, that raises the offense, in the constitutional sense, from petty to serious. He supports this argument with cases in other jurisdictions which he cites as so holding. <em>Bell v. Burson, </em>402 U. S. 535 (1971), is not apposite. It dealt with Georgia\u2019s Motor Vehicle Safety Responsibility Act and held that because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>statute significantly involved the issue of liability, before the State may deprive an individual of his license and registration, it must provide a procedure for determining the question whether there is a reasonable possibility of a judgment being rendered against him as a result of the accident. <em>Berberian v. Lussier, </em>87 R. I. 226, 139 A. 2d 869 (1958) concerned the suspension of an operator\u2019s license without hearing of a motorist who failed to deposit security as provided in the financial responsibility act. It is equally inapposite. In the case before us there was no discretion involved in the revocation of the license. It had to be revoked on the fact of final conviction of the designated offense. The trial of the substantive offense and the appeal proceedings satisfied due process as to hearings. The other cases cited by Smith deal with drunk driving offenses.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> They uphold the right to jury trial, some on the basis that the offense is serious because some degree of moral turpitude attaches to the drunken driver, and in those in which the revocation of driver\u2019s license is mandatory, because that penalty makes the offense severe. He refers us to no cases <em>contra, </em>but we find that the decisions are in conflict and that there is a clear division of judicial opinion on the question. The cases contrary to Smith\u2019s contention rely on a finding that the offense was petty, and, when license revocation was involved, regarded it as an incidental consequence rather than a punishment for conviction of the offense.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>We are not persuaded that the misdemeanor proscribed by Code, Art. 66%, \u00a7 11-904 is raised to the category of a \u201cserious\u201d crime in the frame of reference of the constitutional right to jury trial because of the mandatory revocation of the violator\u2019s operator\u2019s license upon final conviction. We deem the revocation requirement to be an incidental or collateral consequence. From the types of offenses to which the mandatory revocation of a license is applicable, we find the legislative intent in revoking the privilege to drive a motor vehicle on the highways of this State to be the furtherance of the public safety and welfare, necessary to the proper administration of the traffic laws, rather than punishment. See Code, Art. 66%, \u00a7\u00a7 6-205 and 6-205.2. And we believe the same rationale applies with respect to the authority given by the legislature to suspend, revoke or refuse a license after a hearing as provided by \u00a7 6-206. We considered the effect of collateral consequences in <em>In re Martin, supra. A </em>trial by jury was denied on the ground that a citation for contempt for having taken a photograph in the courthouse in violation of a rule of court was a petty offense. It was forcefully asserted that it could not be considered as petty \u201cbecause, as a family man, more than sixty years of age, the stigma of a six months sentence and a $500 fine<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> as to [appellant] \u2018would spell ruin, financial, social and psychological,\u2019 particularly in that as a newspaper editor his \u2018veracity, honesty and obedience to the law is as much his stock in trade as is his publication.\u2019 \u201d We said, 10 Md. App. at 388:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-5\">\u201cThe difficulty with appellant\u2019s position is that in none of its rulings on the question has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>the Supreme Court considered the likely impact on the individual of a sentence of six months or less as an appropriate guidepost by which to determine, for constitutional purposes, whether the offense was a \u2018petty\u2019 one.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">We are not convinced that we should consider collateral or incidental consequences in determining whether an offense is petty or serious. We find support for our position in <em>Frank v. United States, supra. </em>The Court pointed out, 395 U. S. at 151, that \u201cthe maximum penalty authorized in petty offense cases is not simply six months\u2019 imprisonment and a $500 fine.\u201d Under the United States Code, \u201c[a] petty offender may be placed on probation for up to five years and, if the terms of probation are violated, he may then be imprisoned for six months.\u201d It held that penalties authorized for petty offenses, including a term on probation, may be imposed without a jury. \u201cProbation is, of course, a significant infringement of personal freedom, but it is certainly less onerous a restraint than jail itself.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">We find that the offense proscribed by Code, Art. 66V2, \u00a7 11-904 is a petty offense.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Were the cases before us to be tried in a federal court they would not come within the Sixth Amendment\u2019s guarantee of the right to jury trial. Therefore, Smith did not have the right of jury trial under the Fourteenth Amendment, and the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>below did not err in refusing to extend him one.

An Act \u201cfor the Authority of Justices of the Peace\u201d of the second Colonial Assembly of Maryland in 1638 adopted wholesale the English practice of summary powers for magistrates. 1 Archives of Maryland 52. The offenses so punishable included threatening to harm the person or goods of another, residing among Indians, swearing, drunkenness, fornication, adultery, refusal to care properly for servants, labor on Sabbath or holy days, eating flesh in Lent, raising an alarm without cause by shooting of guns, fishing with seines or other .unlawful nets. There followed in the colonial period a steady succession of laws for the summary trial of offenses. They covered disorderly conduct, promotion of public health, safety and convenience, regulation of vagrancy and slaves and servants, regulation of the tobacco trade and other trades and miscellaneous matters such as prohibiting fishing with spears and lights, the failure of the county clerk to perform his duties, and refusal of the mother of a bastard child to discover the father. By various Acts from 1776 through 1789 the practice continued under the State government in the same general areas.

Zimmerman, </em>261 Md. 11, the Court of Appeals quoted at length from the opinion of Bond, C. J., in <em>Rose v. State, </em>177 Md. 577 (1940) and his article entitled \u201cThe Maryland Practice of Trying Criminal Cases by Judges Alone, Without Juries,\u201d in 11 A.B.A.J. 699 (1925). It was stated in <em>Bose, </em>at 581: \u201cStrictly speaking, there is no waiver of a requirement of jury trial,\u201d and the <em>Bose </em>opinion seemed to suggest that in Maryland the_ right to a jury trial and the right to a court trial are two equal rights. Of course, both Judge Bond\u2019s article and opinion were written long before the decision in <em>Duncan, </em>which told us that the federal constitutional provision guaranteeing jury trial applied _ to state criminal prosecutions. We do not construe <em>State v. Zimmerman </em>as indicating that an accused must \u201celect\u201d a jury trial or that his right to a jury trial is lost by the <em>mere </em>election of a court trial. An accused comes to trial cloaked in the Sixth Amendment right to be tried by a jury, and he may lose that right only upon a waiver of it in the constitutional sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">We are aware that Maryland Rule 741, as rewritten effective 1 September 1971, now speaks in terms of an \u201celection\u201d between a court trial and jury trial rather than a \u201cwaiver\u201d of a jury trial. The Rule must be considered in the light of the Supreme Court\u2019s construction of the Sixth Amendment jury trial provision. So considered, we think it clear that the \u201celection\u201d applies only when the accused is entitled to a jury trial, and, when he is so entitled, the right is lost only by a constitutionally effective waiver. We point out that the Supreme Court said in <em>Duncan, </em>at 158, that it held no constitutional doubts about the practice, common in both federal and state courts, of accepting <em>waivers </em>of jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-9\">This is not to say that a court trial may not be as equally attractive, or more attractive, to an accused than a jury trial or that a court trial is in any way \u201ca second class mode of trial.\u201d See <em>Miller v. Warden, </em>16 Md. App. 614. The court trial plays a most important part in the orderly and effective administration of justice in this State.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b244-10\">. In so holding the Court was expressly aware of prior cases decided by it in which the prevailing opinion contained statements contrary to its holding in <em>Duncan. </em>It cited <em>Maxwell v. Dow, </em>176 U. S. 581; <em>Palko v. Connecticut, </em>302 U. S. 319; <em>Snyder v. Massachusetts, </em>291 U. S. 97, particularly relied on in Louisiana\u2019s argument.

It expressly rejected the premise \u201cthat since prosecutions for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>crimes punishable by imprisonment for less than six months may be tried without a jury, they may also be tried without a lawyer.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 30-31.
