For example, he chose a capitalization rate of 10% which was advocated by both parties; he utilized a royalty per net ton valuation method which was advocated by the municipality\u2019s expert; he found the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>testimony in support of the municipality\u2019s 100% location premium to be \u201cquite weak,\u201d and he determined that the appropriate royalty figure per ton was $12, not $20 as advocated by the township.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">The second point is almost equally meritless. The township sought a mistrial because of an alleged misstatement between plaintiff\u2019s answers to interrogatories and testimony of the taxpayer\u2019s expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">Affirmed for the reasons expressed by Judge Conley in his letter opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
