Before the organization of the company, Carpenter ordered the poles of the plaintiff, directing him to ship them to \u201cValley Electric Light Co., West Valley Falls.\u201d The plaintiff shipped the poles as thus directed before the defendant was organized. The de-' fendant was organized for the purpose of \u201cmanufacturing and using light, heat, or power, and lighting streets,\u201d etc., in Valley Falls and other places, and Carpenter is one of the incorporators, and a trustee. There is evidence tending to show that the poles were received and set by the defendant. It is clear that the purchase of such poles was in the line of its authorized business: There is no evidence tending to show that the defendant acquired the poles by purchase or otherwise from anybody other than the plaintiff. Evidence of the declarations of Carpenter, in negotiating with plaintiff for the poles, to the effect that he was acting for the defendant, and not for himself, in anticipation of its organization, was received over defendant\u2019s objection. Standing alone, this evidence was incompetent, but was competent in connection with defendant\u2019s subsequent use of the poles, as tending to show what agency Carpenter assumed, and thus who-t defendant adopted and ratified. Judgment affirmed, without opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-15\">Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
