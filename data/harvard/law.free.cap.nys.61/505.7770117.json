Koenig, etc., to \u2022recover money paid under duress. From a judgment entered in favor of plaintiff on the report of a referee, defendant appeals. Affirmed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b534-6\">The report of the referee is as follows:.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b534-7\">This action was brought by the plaintiff to recover from the defendant the \u2022 sum of \u00a7300, which she claimed she paid to' him under duress and fear pro\u2022duced by threats to imprison her husband for alleged thefts. She pleaded in her complaint a certain receipt or agreement under which she claimed the \u25a0money was paid. The defendant by his answer made first a general denial, then admitted the genuineness of the receipt pleaded by the plaintiff, admitted \u25a0receiving $300 from plaintiff, and then alleged, in substance, that the defendant, \u25a0on the 9th day of November, 1896, had commenced an action in the city court of New York against Simon Jaeger, the husband of the plaintiff, \u201cfor larceny \u2022 of divers sums of money\u201d and property, amounting to $2,000 \u201cdamages,\u201d and made affidavit to obtain an order of arrest therein; that various steps had been taken, when the plaintiff herein entreated and persuaded the defendant herein, who was plaintiff in that action, to settle the same, which was reluctantly done, and resulted in the agreement set forth in the complaint; that the \u2022plaintiff in that action could not, however, prove accurately damages to a greater extent than $555.25. There was no testimony or evidence offered upon the part of the defendant herein, and so we must judge the cause by such evidence as is in, and by the admissions contained in the pleadings. The testimony, so far as it is material, shows that on the 8th of November 1896, the \u25a0 defendant, who kept a saloon, charged Simon Jaeger, his bartender, with the theft of fifty cents. Simon Jaeger was the husband of the plaintiff. He denies the theft, claiming that he had only \u201cheld out\u201d the money because it was marked, to see what Koenig would do about it. A man named Horn said to \u2022 Jaeger, in the presence of Koenig, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you leave this $430 [which \u2022 Jaeger had admitted he had in his pocket] here, in case you run away tonight.\u201d He answered, \u201cIf you are afraid I will run away, why don\u2019t you have \u2022me locked up now, and make sure of it.\u201d Then Koenig told him to go home; that there was plenty of time \u201cto-morrow\u201d to settle the matter. The plaintiff then called upon the defendant, and asked him what was the matter with her 'husband. He said that her husband had stolen fifty cents from him. on November 8th, twenty-five cents the Sunday before, and also a bottle of whisky. He made no mention of any other property at this time. He further said that the detectives were going to have her husband locked up. \u201cIf I [meaning this plaintiff] paid, it would go no further,\u201d she testified he said to her. Theh \u25a0she, crying, left the place. She returned to Koenig afterwards,' and he told , her on this occasion that he had lost $1,800 in his business while her husband was working for him. Koenig wanted to know what-she was willing to- do about the matter. She said she didn\u2019t know. A man named Laurenson, who was present, asked Koenig if he was satisfied with $400, and he replied, \u201cYes.\u201d The plaintiff said that she did not understand \u201cthis business like this,\u201d but would bring the money over in the evening. She returned in the evening, and met the defendant, his wife, his son, Mr. Derrickson, his attorney, and Mr. Laurenson. \u2018 A receipt was drawn by Derrickson, and signed by all the parties except Mrs. Koenig and her son. The plaintiff thereupon paid over the $300, which was taken by Mrs. Koenig; and she promised to pay $100 later, which, however, has never been demanded. Upon paying the money she asked the \u2022defendant, \u201cWell, everything is all right now?\u201d and he said, \u201cIf your husband keeps his mouth shut.\u201d In reviewing this testimony,.we must read it in connection with the receipt set forth in the complaint, and admitted in the answer. It refers to. obtaining \u201can order of arrest,\u201d and to \"Simon Jaeger\u2019s desire to \u2022avoid the \u201cliability of arrest in said civil action,\u201d and that Koenig agrees not to .apply \u201cfor any civil arrest.\u201d The parties hereto were not lawyers, nor skilled in the distinctions between civil suits and criminal prosecutions. The only lawyer who appeared in the transaction was Derrickson. The receipt he drew -was signed by all parties, and we must presume that he drew it in a manner to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>\u2022express their intentions. At least, the defendant cannot he presumed to object to it, for it was drawn by his own attorney, and \u201capproved\u201d by him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b535-5\">No point can be made by the defendant about the money having been paid to his wife by the plaintiff, and not to him. His answer admits receiving it, and he cannot now be heard to deny the agency through which it came. Adams v. Bank, 110 N. Y. 610, 23 N. E. 7, 6 L. R. A. 491.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b535-6\">The main question is, was this money paid by the plaintiff under duress, and, if so, was it such duress as would entitle her to recover it back? \u201cWhere there is no arrest, <em>no </em>imprisonment, no actual force, and it is claimed that a .promise was obtained by duress per minas, then whether or not the promise was obtained by duress must usually be a question of fact, and the question cannot be determined as one of law.\u201d Dunham v. Griswold, 100 N. Y. 226, 3 N. E. 77. In reading the testimony, as enlightened by the admitted agreement in the complaint, we must come to the conclusion that the \u201carrest\u201d or \u201cimprisonment\u201d threatened by one party, and feared by the other, was, no matter how inartificial the language of the testimony is, a civil arrest or a civil imprisonment. There is nothing in the case which is in conflict with this. There is no testimony that Koenig threatened anything more than arrest. He made no mention of a stated imprisonment. Therefore we can immediately \u2022dismiss from consideration the question raised by the defendant, that the operation was really the compounding of a felony. It was in fact an arrangement to refrain from civil action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b535-7\">Now, as to the duress which compelled the plaintiff to make the payments, if any duress really existed. The testimony shows that, when the plaintiff first called on the defendant, he told her. that her husband had stolen fifty cents; on the next occasion, he said fifty cents and seventy-five cents; and on the third visit he claimed $1,800. Yet there was nothing to show why the defendant kept constantly increasing his demands. What may in one case amount to duress in another might not. Each must be judged by surrounding circumstances. In this case we cannot see that the payment was made otherwise than under duress. Koenig said on the first occasion that the detectives were after her husband, but, if she would pay, the matter would go no further. This was the first said about her paying; and, crying, she left the place. Throughout the whole transaction she was always apparently intent upon the purpose of shielding her husband.' Even in the final closing, her last question was, \u201cWill it be all right now?\u201d The first intimation about her paying came from Koenig, when he told her that it would go no further if she paid. The testimony is clear to our minds that the plaintiff would not have paid if the threat of the detectives locking up her husband had not been made. She did not call on Koenig to settle anything in the first place. She merely wanted to know what was the matter with her husband. It was Koenig who suggested settlement by her. And the receipt set forth in the complaint distinctly states that the settlement was to be made with \u201cher own money.\u201d The receipt clearly evidences, also, the reason for her paying, so that her husband might avoid arrest; and it shows that, if she paid a further sum of $100, Koenig would agree to refrain from making a civil arrest. Throughout the entire document the idea stands clean-cut that, if the wife paid, the husband would not be arrested. This is sufficient to bring the case within the decisions as to the payment under duress.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b535-8\">Upon what theory, then, could the case he supported if we decided that Mrs. Jaeger paid this money voluntarily? It certainly was not a gift, for her crying, and reluctance to part with the money, dispose of that. It was not in settlement of a debt, for none existed between her and the defendant. It was paid then by her, clearly, under the defendant\u2019s suggestion that the detectives were going to lock her husband up, but that, if she paid, the matter would go no further. The only reason why the defendant obtained the money was because of the threat of the detectives being after her husband. Was this sufficient duress? We think it was.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b535-9\">There are several distinctions in the lines of cases covering duress through threats of imprisonment. The cases of Smith v. Storm, 1 Wend. 37, Dunham v. Griswold, 100 N. Y. 226, 3 N. E. 76, and Day v. Manufacturing Co., 13 Misc. Rep. 320, 34 N. Y. Supp. 463, are to the effect that, where une pays money under threats that litigation or imprisonment may befall him personally, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>cannot recover it back. The case of Haynes v. Rudd, reported in 83 N. Y. 252, and in 102 N. Y. 374, 7 N. E. 287, was to the effect, apparently, that, where a father paid money voluntarily to shield his son, it could not be recovered back. In the case of Schoener v. Lissauer, 107 N. Y. 116, 13 N. E. 74.1, a mortgage was canceled because obtained from a mother under threats o\u00a3 imprisonment of her son if she did not execute it. The court-held that the case was not in conflict with Haynes v. Rudd; the distinction being, apparently, that in Haynes v. Rudd the offer to compromise was made voluntarily by the father of the boy, and in Schoener v. Lissauer the execution of the mortgage was obtained by threats of imprisoning her son. The cases of Eadiev. Slimmon, 26 N. Y. 1, and Adams v. Bank, 116 N. Y. 606, 23 N. E. 7, 6 L. R. A. 491, are cases exactly in point with this case; and the language of the-latter case, at page 611, 116 N. Y., page 8, 23 N. E., and page 494, 6 L. R. A., states: \u201cThe .rule is firmly established that, in relation to husband and wife, or-parent and child, each may avoid a contract induced or obtained by threats-of imprisonment of the other, and it is of no consequence whether the threat is of a lawful or unlawful imprisonment.\u201d There is nothing in the testimony to show that the plaintiff paid this money upon any suggestion made by her husband that he might be arrested. On the contrary, the testimony shows that he strongly protested his fearlessness of arrest. Nor was there anything to-show that she paid it only for the purpose of having her husband retain his place. In this respect the case is unlike the case of Girty v. Oil Go., 1 App. Div. 224, 37 N. Y. Supp. 369, or Day v. Manufacturing Go., supra. There is-nothing to show that the money was paid except under duress of the threat made by the defendant. It is not necessary in these cases to show any definite or precise method of duress. The question of duress is one of fact, and the referee must decide the question according to all the facte before him. I am. of the opinion, therefore, that judgment should be for the plaintiff in the sum of three hundred dollars. Adrian T.
