At the close of the case each side moved for the direction of a verdict. Plaintiff\u2019s request was denied, the court directing the jury to find in favor of the defendant upon the evidence, which was sufficient to warrant the finding that the articles in question had been attached to the freehold for temporary purpose\u00ae of trade only. By requesting the court to determine the case as one of law,, the plaintiff waived his right, if, any, to go to the jury on questions of fact, and submitted all questions involved to the determination of the court. Kirtz v. Peck, 113 N. Y. 222, 226, 21 N. E. 130. The judgment of the general term, affirming the judgment of the trial term entered upon the direction of a verdict, should therefore be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-7\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.
