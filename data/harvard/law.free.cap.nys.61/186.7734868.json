The only evidence relating to ownership consisted in the introduction in evidence of a contract between the defendants, the Consolidated Gas Company and the Logans, dated April 15, 1898, in which the gas company is denominated \u201cowner.\u201d Reference to the contract discloses that the Logans had agreed to erect \u201ca quadruple section gas holder, with steel tank and guide frame, and other appurtenances,\u201d for the gas company, and to \u201ccomplete the same within six months after the time when the foundation to be prepared by the owner for the reception of the said tank and gas holder is sufficiently advanced to allow the contractor to commence-work.\u201d There is nothing in the case to show that the work was completed. This contract provided for the erection of nothing shown to be unlawful. The alleged accident occurred on December 13, 1898. If the contractors were still in control, they were the parties to look to. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>If the work had been completed and turned over, the gas company was the party to look to, provided it was at the time the owner, or in possession and control. In this particular the contract avails nothing, because it proves nothing as to possession or control by either of the defendants at the time of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">Assuming, however, that the plaintiff did establish that the company or the contractors were, either or both, in possession and control at the time of the accident, the plaintiff still failed to establish negligence on their part. He \u201cfailed to recognize a distinction, which has been carefully guarded by the courts of this state, as well as by nearly all other jurisdictions in this country, between actions founded in negligence, where a contract relation existed between the parties, and those in which the defendant owed no other duty than to use such ordinary care and caution as the nature of his business demanded, to avoid injury to others.\u201d Cosulich v. Oil Co., 122 N. Y. 118, 126, 25 N. E. 259. He failed to give evidence of other facts from which an inference of the fact of negligence could be drawn; proof of the collapse of the tank, alone, being insufficient to raise the presumption of the fact of negligence under the doctrine of res ipso loquitur. The distinction referred to in the Cosulich Case applies to the present case, but, there being merely want of merit in the proof, the judgment should be modified by striking therefrom \u201con the merits,\u201d and as thus modified affirmed; leaving the plaintiff to take such further action, if any, as may be advised. Cod\u00e9 Civ. Proc. \u00a7 1209.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">Judgment modified accordingly, and as modified affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
