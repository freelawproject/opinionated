From a judgment for plaintiff, and from an order denying a new trial, defendant appeals. Affirmed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b750-12\">In February, 1894, the plaintiff attempted to board one of the defendant\u2019s trains at or near a station known as \u201cFail-port,\u201d upon its road. The train was a local freight, with one passenger coach, and was the only passenger train westward on the West Shore road. Its time of departure varied anywhere from 9 o\u2019clock in the morning to 12. In passing westward, it. was its custom to stop first east of the station. At that place cars were taken off and put on. There was more or less shifting, and, when the train was finally made up, the evidence is that the conductor went to the station to see if there were any passengers, and, if any were there waiting, the train pulled up to the station, and stopped. This action was tried once before, resulting in a verdict for the plaintiff. This judgment was affirmed by the general term (35 N. Y. Supp. 1109), and reversed hy the court of appeals (50 N. B. 856). The evidence of the plaintiff is to the effect that she went to the station to take this train; that she asked some one in the ticket office if that was the train, and received no answer to her question; that she went to the platform, and there saw the baggage master; that she asked him if that was the local, and he answered, \u201cYes,\u201d and asked her If she wanted to take it; that she said she did; that Johnson thereupon waved to a man in that direction, and called to him \u201cto take on this lady\u201d; that she thereupon said she thought she would go and get upon' the car when it was standing still. The car was then east of the station from 200 to 400 feet, and there was a broad gravel path alongside of the track, past the place where she finally attempted to get on the car. She got upon the car, and, as she was about to enter, the engine backed into the car with such force as to throw her, and cause the injury for which she here claims damage.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b750-13\">Argued before HARDIN, P. J., and McLENNAN, SPRING, and SMITH, J J.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b750-14\">Cassius C. Davy, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b750-15\">Elbridge L. Adams, for respondent.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b750-16\">SMITH, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AxZ\">In the prevailing opinion'of Chief Judge Parker, written upon the reversal of the former judgment, it was held that no cus\u2022tom was shown to take passengers on except at the station, and that, without evidence sufficient to authorize a finding of such a custom, the defendant did not owe the duty to use care at that point to protect any one who might be boarding the train without authority. Upon this trial, however, the plaintiff .has produced evidence from which a jury could find that such custom existed, with the acquies<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>cence, if not the encouragement, of the defendant\u2019s employ\u00e9s. The evidence was such that the question could not have been taken from the jury, and they have twice found for the plaintiff thereupon.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s contributory negligence was properly submitted to the jury. This has been once held by the general term in this department; but, apart from that authority, it cannot be said, as a matter of law, under the circumstances of this case, that the plaintiff was required to look for the approaching engine when she got upon the car. She might assume, even though the engine was approaching, that it would approach the car with such care as not to cause her injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">Nor can the verdict, as a matter of law, be said to be excessive. There was a sharp conflict in the evidence, and the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses were by the jury believed. Upon that evidence the verdict was justified in amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">The amendment to the complaint was not necessary. The variance, if such there was, was, at most, an immaterial one, and could be corrected by an amendment either before or after an objection. The case has once been tried, and the defendant had full knowledge of the issues which the plaintiff tendered. It could, not in any way have been misled.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-8\">Various exceptions are called to our attention, only one of which needs to be discussed. At folio 139 this question was asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-9\">\u201cQ. After you went home, what did you do? Did you work at all? A. I was not al)le to work. I liad to have a nurse for my daughter, and I had to hire a woman to do my work. (Defendant\u2019s counsel moved to strike out that she had a nurse for her daughter, and a woman to do her work, on the ground that the answer is not responsive and incompetent. Overruled. Exception.)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b751-10\">That the answer is not responsive is an objection th\u00e1t lies only with the examining counsel. The answer was incompetent only because it was not pleaded. She was a widow, and might have recovered such damages, if she had pleaded them. But that it was not pleaded was not made a ground of the objection, nor called to the attention of the court. The motion to strike out the answer was therefore properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-11\">The defendant can make no gomplaint of the fairness with which the issues in this case were submitted to the jury. In a very able charge, the learned judge clearly outlined the exact questions which the jury were to determine. That there was sufficient evidence to justify a finding of the jury upon the several questions presented to them we have no doubt, and no exception has been called to our attention upon which this judgment can be reversed. The judgment and order should therefore be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-12\">Judgment and order affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
