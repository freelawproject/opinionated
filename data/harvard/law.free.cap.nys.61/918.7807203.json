A reading of the documentary proofs, especially the exhibits of defendant, confirms this determination, and the oral portion of plaintiff\u2019s evidence does not disturb it. The' cases cited quite fail in establishing the principle contended for,\u2014that an attorney at law, when ordering printing in the client\u2019s case, thereby makes liable the client, without special notice or instruction; and the record before us shows that credit was given and the work was done for the attorney upon request of his clerk.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-15\">The rulings of the court below can be sustained on good ground, .and the judgment appealed from is therefore affirmed, with costs and disbursements.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
