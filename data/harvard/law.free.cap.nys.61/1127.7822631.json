FISH.</parties>\n<court data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b1155-5\">(City Court of New York, General Term.</court>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AdYQ\">December 27, 1899.)</decisiondate>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b1155-6\">Sale\u2014Warranty\u2014Language\u2014Construction.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b1155-7\">If the language used at the time of a sale, on a fair construction, is equivalent to an undertaking on the part of the owner that the property is what it is represented to be, it is sufficient to create a warranty, without the use of the word \u201cwarrant\u201d or \u201cwarranty.\u201d</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b1155-8\">Appeal from trial term.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1155-9\">Action by John P.

Goddard, for respondent.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b1155-13\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"A8th\">The appellant\u2019s point, that the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the second cause of action on the ground that there was no guaranty in the written agreement of March 1, 1893, as to the liabilities of the firm of Howden &amp; Fish, should have been granted, is not well taken. The rule of law is that, in order to constitute a warranty, it is not necessary that a vendor should use the word \u201cwarranty\u201d or \u201cwarrant.\u201d If the language used at the time of the sale, upon a fair construction, amounts or is equivalent to an undertaking on the part of the owner that the property is what it is represented to be, this is sufficient to create a warranty. Jones v. Mayer, 16 Misc. Rep. 588, 38 N. Y. Supp. 801; Udell v. Safarian, 19 Misc. Rep. 544, 43 N. Y. Supp. 1092; Canning Co. v. Metzger, 118 N. Y. 265, 23 N. E. 372.</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-14\">We do not think that there was any mistake made by the trial judge in allowing the witnesses to testify from memoranda made by them. See Howard v. McDonough, 77 N. Y. 592.</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-15\">We have examined all the various exceptions, and do not think that any one of them presents reversible error. We think that the plaintiff substantially proved his two causes of action. The defendant and his witnesses by their testimony have not created a single conflict of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-16\">Judgment and order appealed from affirmed, with costs and disbursements.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
