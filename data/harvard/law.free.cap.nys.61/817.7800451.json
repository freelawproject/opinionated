During the afternoon of Sunday there was discovered, dripping through the ceiling, water, which was from the overflow of a bathtub in the defendant\u2019s apartment, the outlet' of which was stopped, or made smaller, by a piece of cloth accidentally or purposely placed therein, and which surplus water ran off easily upon removal of the cloth. The negligence on the part of the defendant\u2019s household was apparent, and scarcely gainsaid. That damage was done by the leak greater than the sum demanded in the complaint, and for which judgment was awarded, was proven, and practically admitted. No exception taken upon the trial brings up reversible error. The judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-13\">Judgment affirmed, with costs, All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
