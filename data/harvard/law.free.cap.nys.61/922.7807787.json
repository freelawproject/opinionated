While it is true that the affidavit of Mr. Elliott does not set forth the facts so that the court may judicially determine whether due diligence. has been used to find and serve within the state an officer or director of the corporation, yet there is sufficient of material allegation in the positive averments of plaintiff\u2019s affidavit to sustain the order, without resting upon the question of due diligence to serve any other than the agent of the corporation. It does appear that Mr. Bigelow is defendant\u2019s managing agent, within the mean<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"923\">*923</page-number>ing of section 432 of the Code, and no issue is raised by allegation \u2022that any officer was, at the time of service, within the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-5\">Order affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-6\">FITZSIMOM3, C.
