The latter did business under the name <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>of the Surface Kailway Advertising Company. On July 6, 1895, the parties entered into the following contract:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-3\">\u201cThe Surface Railway Advertising- Go. is hereby authorized to insert o-ur advertisement for the term of twelve months from the average time of the same being placed in the cars (of which due notice will be given), in one space, 11x21 inches, in 150 cars of such railway lines as indicated by indorsement on the back of this contract, and for which we agree to pay the said Surface Railway Advertising Company the sum of sixty-seven \u00a1so/100 dollars per month, in monthly payments, during the term of this contract. This contract may be discontinued in three months upon payment of $7\u00a1&gt;o/100 per month additional. The contract to date from July 15, \u201995, and the Advertising Co. to furnish one set of signs. This contract is subject to the leases with, and the operations of, the railroads. Any loss of space or time to be, at the option of the Surface Rail-way Advertising Co., made good by additional space or time on any of said lines, or allowed for, pro rata, according to the price charged for the line or. lines in which such loss should occur. The rights under this contract are not assignable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">Pursuant to the contract the signs were placed in the required number of cars, and th\u00e9 defendant was duly notified. Three monthly installments were paid. At the expiration of the year this suit was brought to recover the installments for the remaining nine months. In its answer the defendant alleged that on the 2d day of November, 1895, it had notified the plaintiff that it desired to discontinue the advertisement on and after the 1st day of December, 1895, and that it had offered to pay at the contract rate for two months succeeding the 15th day of October, and $7.50 additional for each of five months, and that this offer was refused. On the trial the defendant sought to prove this defense, but was not permitted to do so. The judge, holding the contract to be clear and unambiguous, and construing its terms to mean that the option of discontinuance could be exercised only within three months after its date, excluded the written notice on the ground that it had been sent subsequent to the expiration of that period, and rejected paroi evidence of the negotiations which led up to, and resulted in, the contract. The appellant claims that these rulings were erroneous, and that the verdict directed should not be permitted to stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">It may be conceded that the instrument is ambiguous, in so far as it relates to the time when the right of discontinuance may be exercised. The language adopted by the parties is, \u201cThis contract may be discontinued in three months.\u201d This phraseology may reasonably be interpreted to mean either (1) that the contract might be terminated at any time within three months; or (2) at the expiration of three months. The several meanings of \u201cin,\u201d as a preposition relating to time, necessary to arrive at these respective constructions, find support in the definitions of the lexicographers. Thus; the Century Dictionary (volume 3, p. 3024) has the following meanings of \u201cin\u201d as a preposition of time:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-6\">\u201c(a) Of a point of time, or a period taken as a point; at. (b) Of a course or period of time; within the limits or duration of; during, (e) Of a limit of time; at the expiration of.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">If the dispute between the parties were which of these meanings the language should bear, paroi evidence would have been admis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>sible to show what sense the parties attached to the doubtful term, and of the prior negotiations which would have elucidated the intent sought to be expressed. Browne, Par. Ev. pp. 118, 179, 180) Bank v. Strever, 18 N. Y. 502, 508. It is not clear from the instrument whether the defendant could have availed itself of the privilege to end the contract at any time during the three months, or only on the last day of the three months. It is clear, however, that three months was the limit of the time, and that the right to discontinue did not extend beyond it. The difficulty with the contention of the appellant is that neither of these permissible constructions will sustain its alleged defense. To support that would unwarrantably invest \u201cin\u201d with the meaning \u201cat any time after,\u201d for the notice of discontinuance was admittedly not sent until the fourth month. The appellant, adopting\" the definition \u201cat the expiration of,\u201d unreasonably extends it by adding, in effect, the words \u201cand at all times thereafter,\u201d so as to carry the option through the remaining nine months of the contract. But \u201cat the expiration of\u201d defines a limit of time. It marks the close of a period, not its beginning. When three months had expired the .option could have been exercised. After that time the right was gone. It is obvious, therefore, that to have permitted paroi proof to validate the attempted discontinuance in the fourth month would not have fixed which of two reasonable meanings the language imported, but would have substituted a third, destructive of the other two, and would practically have reformed the contract. The judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">Judgment affirmed, with costs to respondent. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
