Spencer, 26 Misc. Rep. 803, 55 N. Y. Supp. 835. Upon the trial from the result of which comes the present appeal, the plaintiff, however, made such a statement respecting the alleged agreement as to obviate the grounds so given for reversal. Whether or not the plaintiff\u2019s second version of the transaction was to be credited despite his inconsistent statements was a matter, under the iterated rulings-of this court, resting with the trial justice. The judgment, therefore, is to he affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-15\">Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
