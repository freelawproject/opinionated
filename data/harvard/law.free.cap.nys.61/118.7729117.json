Thereupon he was awarded a judgment for the full sum of $60. This was contrary to law; for, according to the well-settled rule respecting the measure of damages in an action for a violation of an executory agreement, the party who has been wrongfully deprived of the gains and profits'may recover as an equivalent, and by way. of damages, only the difference between the contract price, the amount which he would have earned and been entitled to recover on performance, and the amount which it would have cost him to perform the contract.
