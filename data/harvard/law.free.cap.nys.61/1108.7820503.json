That was the issue submitted to the jury, and, although this issue was denied in defendant\u2019s answer, and also upon the trial, the jury believed plaintiff\u2019s version of the question in controversy, as they had a right to do. Under the circumstances, it was immaterial whether there was a custom of giving and taking two weeks\u2019 notice, if such a custom existed, and it certainly could not offset the specific contract made by the parties hereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-8\">The judgment must be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
