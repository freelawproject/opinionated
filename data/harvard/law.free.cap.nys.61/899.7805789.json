When they came to Eighth avenue, each saw a car belonging to the defendant approaching rapidly from the south,\u201430 feet below the south crossing, the' plaintiff testified; more than 100 feet south of that crossing, as the driver testified. The horses were on a slow walk, and so continued; but,, while they were attempting to cross the north-bound track, the car struck the wagon, and the plaintiff, as he says, was thrown out and injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-7\">The plaintiff in no wise appearing to have control or management, the doctrine contended for by the appellant, that if the driver was negligent his negligence was to be imputed to the plaintiff, so as to bar recovery, does not apply. Hobson v. Milk Co., 25 App. Div. 111, 49 N. Y. Supp. 209. See, also, Hoag v. Railroad. Co., 111 N. Y. 199, 18 N. E. 648. The questions for the jury to determine were, was- the plaintiff free from negligence, and was the defendant at fault. As the plaintiff was bound to establish affirmatively his own freedom from fault, and as the situation- was not one to paralyze him with fear or to provoke him to sudden mistake, he had to show affirmatively that he did what a reasonable and prudent man would have done under the circumstances to prevent the injury to himself of which he now complains. Yet when he saw himself slowly moving, or being moved, into a place of danger, before a rapidly moving car, he did not slip from the wagon, nor even ask his fellow servant to stop or alter his course, when, at the westerly side of Eighth avenue, he saw the car 30 feet below the crossing, nor when the horses were at the easterly track, and he saw the swiftly-coming car but 10 feet below that crossing. It is therefore difficult to see a basis, and basis there had to be, for the jury to find that the plaintiff was free from fault.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-8\">The court was requested to charge \u201cthat, if the jury find that both the plaintiff and the defendant were negligent, their verdict must be for the defendant\u201d; but the court said in reply, \u201cI have charged what the law is in relation to negligence, and it is for the jury to determine how much negligence there was upon the part of the plaintiff or defendant;\u201d and the defendant excepted. Such refusal was error, and may not here be disregarded; for, although the learned justice had said \u201cthat if the plaintiff, by his own negligence, contributed to any injuries he may have sustained, he cannot recover,\u201d he had omitted to state the rule as requested by the defendant, and which the defendant was entitled to have charged substantially to the jury. The language of the refusal was misleading, as introducing a possible apportionment of fault, which the law will not undertake. Again, the court was requested to charge \u201cthat, if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>plaintiff saw the car, the negligence of the defendant cannot be predicated on an alleged failure to ring the gong.\u201d This the court refused, saying, \u201cYou cannot tell what the plaintiff saw, as he was not driving the car;\u201d . and the defendant excepted. This, too, was error, because such warning was unnecessary, in view of the fact, testified to by himself, that the plaintiff saw the car approaching. Schulman v. Ferry Co., 15 Misc. Rep. 30, 36 N. Y. Supp. 439.
