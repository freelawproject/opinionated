It appeared, however, from the agreement introduced in evidence, that the plaintiffs, the landlords, had not covenanted to keep the premises in a tenantable condition, or to make repairs, and that they had carefully provided that they should not be liable for any damage or injury by water which might be sustained by the tenants, or by reason of the breakage, leakage, or obstruction of the water or soil pipes in or about the demised building. Upon this, the learned trial justice properly excluded the evidence offered by the defendants respecting such damage, and which could only have been received under some agreement which the defendants had not alleged, and directed a verdict for the plaintiffs for the amount of the rent admittedly due. The judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-12\">Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
