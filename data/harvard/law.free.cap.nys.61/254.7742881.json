J.</author>\n<p id=\"AiZ\">The action was to recover the value of a case of plate glass shipped to the plaintiff over the defendant\u2019s road from Creighton, Pa., to New York, about August 19, 1895. The glass contained in the case was found upon its arrival to be shattered and totally valueless. The evidence clearly showed that the glass was in good condition when it was placed in the defendant\u2019s charge, and that the breakage must have occurred while it was in their custody. The provision in the bill of lading that the carrier shall not be liable for any loss or breakage does not exempt the carrier from the consequences of its own negligence. Canfield v. Railroad Co., 93 N. Y. 532; Mynard v. Railroad Co., 71 N. Y. 180; Holsapple v. Railroad Co., 86 N. Y. 275. Fifteen other cases of glass formed part of the same shipment, and arrived in good order and condition. The one in suit would have so arrived unless negligently handled or controlled by the defendant. This is a presumption, at all events, and was not overcome by anything offered by the defendant. Campe v. Weir, 28 Misc. Rep. 243, 58 N. Y. Supp. 1082; Roth v. Packet Co. (Super. N. Y.) 12 N. Y. Supp. 460; Trimble v. Railroad Co., 39 App. Div. 403, 412, 57 N. Y. Supp. 437. There was certainly evidence bearing upon the question of negligence to require the submission of the case to the jury, to whom it was sent upon an impartial charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-9\">The jury found for the plaintiff, and, as the exceptions are without merit, the judgment must be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
