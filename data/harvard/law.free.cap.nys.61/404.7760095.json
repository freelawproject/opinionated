The justice holding special term, on the consent of the parties, made an order of reference to take testimony, and report the same to the court, regarding the plaintiff\u2019s residence. The tes<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>timony was taken before the referee, and finally submitted; and, he not having made his report within 60 days, the plaintiff, by virtue of section 1019 of the Code of Civil Procedure, served a notice terminating the reference. Subsequently a notice of motion to confirm the report was given, and upon the hearing the report was confirmed by the justice then sitting at the special term,\u2014the former justice, who had made the order of reference, having in the meantime retired from the bench,\u2014and it is from the order thus made that this appeal is taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">The contentions that a justice other than the one who had originally made the order of reference confirmed the report, and as to the papers to be used upon the motion to confirm the report, were correctly disposed of in the opinion of the court below, as was also the question as to the effect of the plaintiff\u2019s notice terminating the reference. This last is the only point which requires discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">The affidavit of the defendant\u2019s attorney, as well as that of the referee, shows that at the close of the testimony the counsel for the parties stipulated to allow the referee to have all the time he required to make his report. This is denied by the plaintiff\u2019s attorney,</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">' but, in view of the preponderance in favor of the conclusion reached by the court below that such an oral stipulation was made, we must take that as true. The question, therefore, presented is whether the failure to have such a stipulation in writing as required by rule 11 \u25a0of the general rules of practice is fatal. This question is not new, it having been held in Ballou v. Parsons, 55 N. Y. 673, as stated in the syllabus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-8\">\u201cWhen an oral agreement is made in open court upon trial before a referee upon final submission, extending indefinitely the time within which the report may be delivered, the reference cannot be terminated in the manner provided by section 273 of the old Code. It seems that in such case the proper practice, in order to terminate the extension, is to serve notice upon the opposite party and the referee that, unless the report is made within the specified reasonable time, the reference will be deemed ended.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-9\">This is direct authority, for the reason that section 273 in the old \u25a0Code is re-enacted in section 1019 of the present Code of Civil Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-10\">We think, therefore, that the disposition made of the motion by the court below was right, and that the order appealed from should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-11\">BARRETT, B\u00dcMSEY, and PATTERSON, JJ., concur. VAN BRUNT, P. J., concurs upon last ground.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
