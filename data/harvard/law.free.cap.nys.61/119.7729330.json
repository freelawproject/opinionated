The alleged order of the husband was said to have been given months after the defendant had taken the premises, a liquor store, under a lease for 10 years, at a monthly rental of $50, and under covenants to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>make all repairs and considerable ^alterations. The improbability of the story that an owner of property duly leased for a long term, and upon which the lessee had spent the substantial' sum of over $1,200 for improvements, would, without consideration moving to her, make betterments not to benefit herself until after the lapse of nine years, may not count for much except to emphasize the necessity of proper proof of the alleged agency, which might not be presumed from their relation of husband and wife (Willson v. Underhill, 83 Hun, 233, 31 N. Y. Supp. <em>585; </em>Valentine v. Applebee, 87 Hun, 1, 33 N. Y. Supp. 762), and as to which in the case there was practically no proof,\u2014 that the lessor had appointed her husband agent in this behalf, had manifested her will to that effect by a distinct statement for and to that purpose, or had acted so as clearly and unequivocally to recognize him as agent (McIntosh v. Battel, 68 Hun, 216, 22 N. Y. Supp. 805). All that was adduced in this respect was the testimony of the defendant, answering directly leading questions,' that at the execution of the lease both the plaintiff and her husband were present, and that before the names were signed the husband said that he represented his wife, who made no remark thereabout; and, further, that the husband collected the rents, which, as it turns out, were more frequently collected by the son, and; save twice, were paid by check drawn to the order of the plaintiff. These incidents did not evidence that the husband was the wife\u2019s agent to bargain for the improvements of the building, nor can the carelessness of counsel in failing to move for dismissal supply evidence of such authority. The judgment should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">New trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
