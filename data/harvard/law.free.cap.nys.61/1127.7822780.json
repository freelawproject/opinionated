Upon the trial the plaintiff offered no evidence whatever to show that the driver of the wagon was employed by the defendant, excepting only the statements of certain witnesses that the wagon in question had the name of S. Bernstein and an address upon it. The driver of the wagon, when called as a witness for the defendant, testified that the horses and wagon were owned by the defendant; that he was selling seltzer water at the time for himself; and then, upon being asked the question whether he was in the defendant\u2019s employ, answered, \u201cNo, sir.\u201d Upon motion of plaintiff\u2019s counsel this answer was stricken out as a conclusion, but over the ex- \u25a0 ception of the defendant. The witness was then asked, among others, the following questions, and, upon the plaintiff\u2019s objection to each, the answer was excluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1156-10\">\u201cQ. Did you do any work for S. Bernstein, the defendant in this case? Q. Were you driving this wagon for Mr. Bernstein, or in your own business? Q. Were you driving this wagon, at the time of the accident, for Mr. Bernstein? Q. For whom were you driving the wagon? Q. Will you describe your relations with the defendant, S. Bernstein, in this case?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1156-11\">The plaintiff having asserted in his complaint that the driver of the wagon was a servant of the defendant, and the defendant having denied that allegation, the driver of' the wagon should have been allowed to testify as to just what his relation with the defendant was. All the testimony objected to tended to establish the defendant\u2019s contention that the driver of the -wagon was in the pursuit of an independent calling, or that the driver was not under the control and direction of the defendant. Its exclusion was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-12\">The court charged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1156-13\">\u201cThere was a question asked about whether the driver sold seltzer water, and whether he was in business for himself, and all that sort of thing, but not for a single instance was the question asked, \u2018Did you drive these horses and wagon for Bernstein?\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1156-14\">By referring to the questions above quoted from the record, it will' be seen that the driver was asked this very question, and hence the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1129\">*1129</page-number>court fell into the error of mistaking an important fact that had occurred upon the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1157-4\">For the errors pointed out, the judgment and order appealed from must be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b1157-5\">FITZSIMONS, C. J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
