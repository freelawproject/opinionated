This condition we have already held sufficient to warrant a finding of negligence in the operation of the car, and there is nothing, so far as we are able to discover, in the circumstances of this case, which removes it from the application of the rule. Hassen v. Railroad Co., 34 App. Div. 71, 53 N. Y. Supp. 1069; Dochtermann v. Railroad Co., 32 App. Div. 13, 52 N. Y. Supp. 1051. It is fair to assume, we think, that the deceased, as he stood upon the running board of the car, was using such means as were furnished for \"security to a person standing thereon. He had ridden some distance, and maintained his position, and the language of one of the witnesses who saw him is that; as \u201cthe jerk came, * * * Hr. Brainard was knocked off.\u201d The language of the other witnesses, and the fact that a person must use a support to remain upon the running board while a car is in motion, justify the inference that it was the sudden jerk which caused the fall, and\" not any lack of making use of the supports. The car was crowded with passengers, and riding upon the running board was not per se negligence. The fact that the deceased had an opportunity to occupy the seat vacated by his wife, and voluntarily surrendered such right to another passenger, does not \u25a0charge him with contributory negligence, as matter of law. Such question is usually one of fact, and is dependent upon the cireum.stances. Lehr v. Railroad Co., 8 N. Y. St. Rep. 813; Id., 118 N. Y. 556, 23 N. E. 889; Still v. Railroad Co., 32 App. Div. 276, 52 N. Y. Supp. 975. In the present case the surrender was made to a woman, who may be presumed to have been weaker than the deceased. Custom, even at Coney Island, has not deadened all sense of courtesy; and, if it had, we should continue to think that the law of negligence has still a sufficient respect for the amenities of life as not per se to charge as negligence the surrender of a seat by a man to a woman. The judgment should be reversed, and a new trial granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-9\">Judgment reversed, and new trial granted; costs to abide the event. All \u25a0concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
