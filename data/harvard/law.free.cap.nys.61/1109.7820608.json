An action lies by a tenant on -the part of a building against his landlord, who occupies other parts, or who has the control of other parts, to recover damages for negligence in allowing injurious substances to leak through; and the principle that, as between landlord and tenant, the landlord is not bound to keep in repair without express contract, does not avail as a defense, if negligence be shown (Stapenhorst v. Manufacturing Co., 15 Abb. Prac. [N. S.] 855); and this action is the same as if one tenant was suing another, who occupied the premises above the one</p>\n<p id=\"b1138-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1110\">*1110</page-number>occupied by the plaintiffs, and therefore the proof of the overflow was sufficient evidence of negligence (Simon-Reigel Cigar Co. v. GordonBurnham Battery Co., 20 Misc. Rep: 598, 46 N. Y. Supp. 416; Greco v. Bernheimer, 17 Misc. Rep. 592, 40 N. Y. Supp. 677; Moore v. Goedel, 34 N. Y. 527). There is no evidence.in the defendants\u2019 case to explain the cause of this overflow or leakage, but it appears affirmatively in the plaintiffs\u2019 case that the accident was caused by the condition of the faucet, and the fact that the sink was stuffed up with ashes and dirt, and that the premises were in the control of the defendants, the tenant having removed therefrom some days previous to the accident. The court having dismissed the complaint, the plaintiffs are entitled to the most favorable inferences from the evidence, and all contested facts are to be treated as established in their favor. Pratt v. Insurance Co., 130 N. Y. 206, 29 N. E. 117; Higgins v. Eagleton, 155 N. Y. 466, 50 N. E. 287; Rauth v. Scheer, 20 Misc. Rep. 689, 46 N. Y. Supp. 539. The floor from which the water came was vacant at the time of the flow, and under the control and supervision of the defendants. This being so, it was error to dismiss the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1138-5\">The judgment and order appealed from must be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellants to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b1138-6\">FITZSIMONS, C.
