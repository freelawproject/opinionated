J.</author>\n<p id=\"Axd\">Heretofore, and on Friday, the 30th day of -June, 1899, summary proceedings were begun by the above-named -plaintiffs, claiming to be landlords, in the municipal court of the city -of New York, borough of Manhattan, for the Tenth judicial district, \u25a0against Andrew Henderson, since deceased, as a tenant, and Hannah R. Rockwell and others as undertenants, for a final order to remove \u25a0said tenants and undertenants from the possession of the' premises -.set forth in the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint. The day for the return of the precept was the 3d of July (the following Monday), at 10 a. m. At ffhe time fixed for the return of the said precept, the defendant Rock-well filed an answer alleging that she was the owner in fee simple of the premises mentioned and described in the precept, and that she .-and her grantors had been in undisturbed possession thereof for a period of more than 20 years last past, as owners in fee, and claiming to be such owners, and that the title to real property would neces\u2022sarily be involved in the proceeding, if tried. And, the said defendant having filed the necessary undertaking, the proceeding was discontinued, pursuant to section 2954-of the Code. The plaintiffs thereupon brought this action upon the same cause, to which the defendant Rockwell interposed an answer. One of the defendants, Henderson, \u25a0died during the pendency of the action; and an amended and supplemental complaint was thereupon issued and served by the plaintiffs, alleging the fact of his death, and bringing in his heirs at law and next of kin as parties defendant. The defendant Rockwell answered the amended complaint, including in her answer matters which the plaintiffs claim would constitute a hew defehse, and which they move ~to strike but, under section 2957 of the Code; such section providing that the defendant\u2019s answer in the new action brought according to the previous sections of the Code must set up the same defense, only, -which was made before the justice. The court denied the motion, and from the order thereupon entered this appeal is taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-11\">Upon an examination of the answer of the defendant, it seems to ms that the same defense is set up by the answer in the action in this \u25a0court that was interposed to the precept in the municipal court. The .answer in the latter court was really a pleading of the general issue, as far as title was concerned. The only part of the answer in this -court which seems to be in any way additional to that contained in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>the answer to the precept in the municipal court is the denial of the allegation that the plaintiffs are the executors of, and trustees under, the last will and testament of Morgan Jones, deceased.. The allegation in the petition to this effect was not denied in the answer in the municipal court, and consequently that issue cannot be raised in the new action brought in the supreme court.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">The order appealed from should therefore be modified by striking out that denial of the answer, and as modified affirmed, without costs to either party. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
