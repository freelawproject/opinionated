It was agreed that this case was settled by those two notes.\u201d It thus appears that the case was settled, and either party might enter a formal order of discontinuance. Actual settlement of the cause involves practically a discontinuance. An order of discontinuance is a mere incidental matter, which neither enlarges nor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1111\">*1111</page-number>diminishes the rights of either party, when the case has been actually settled. Comparing the defendant\u2019s plea with his evidence, he pleads a promised discontinuance as a consideration for the giving of the notes, and proves an actual settlement by means of the notes, as agreed between plaintiff and himself. Plaintiff was therefore entitled to recover herein, and it follows that the judgment and order appealed from must be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
