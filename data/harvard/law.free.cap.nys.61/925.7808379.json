This action is brought for legal services rendered by plaintiff to defendants. It appears that defendants had a case in their office, known as the \u2018Webster Loom Case.\u201d It was a somewhat complicated matter, and plaintiff, prior to defendants\u2019 retainer, rendered services therein to the attorney who preceded them, and now contends that on or about March 9, 1891, he was engaged by defendants to render further legal services; that, in pursuance of such engagement, services were rendered and disbursements made, for which the jury gave him a verdict for $734.04. The question litigated upon the trial was, \u2018Were the services rendered to defendants individually or as attorneys for their client?\u201d If for the latter, then, of course, defendants were not liable. That question of fact was, in our opinion, correctly submitted to the jury, and decided against them. There is certainly enough evidence to sustain that finding. The plaintiff clearly and distinctly testified that, before he consented to be retained, he said to Judge Cowen, one of the defendants, and speaking of defendants\u2019 client: \u201cI have nothing to do with these people. They are your clients, not mine; and I am not going to draw on them. I am employed by you, and I look to your firm for the money.\u201d And Judge Cowen\u2019s reply was, \u201cThat is all right; I will send you the money;\u201d and it is admitted that $200 were sent by defendants\u2019 firm to plaintiff. This testimony was contradicted by Judge Cowen, who states that plaintiff agreed, upon the occasion just mentioned, to demand pay for his services only in the event that there was a successful result in \u201cWebster matter\u201d; if unsuccessful, he was to receive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"926\">*926</page-number>nothing; that the ending was not successful, and under the agreement, of course, he was entitled to nothing. The jury chose to believe plaintiff\u2019s version of this question in dispute, as they had a right to do, and we will not interfere with their finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-5\">The entries made by defendants upon their check stubs and in their private account books, showing that the $200 advanced was a loan to plaintiff, and not on account of services about to be rendered, and not known or shown to plaintiff, were properly excluded.
