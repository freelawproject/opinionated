The \u00abevidence would have warranted the jury in finding: That the plaintiff, seated in a grocery wagon, the back and sides of which were in\u2022closed by oilcloth curtains, was driving along White Plains avenue, in the city of New York. The defendant\u2019s track was laid in the \u25a0center of the street. Each side of the street was either out of repair, or incumbered with rubbish, so that the passable part of the roadway ran so close to the defendant\u2019s track that the wheel of the plaintiff\u2019s wagon nearest the track was only about a foot from it. As he was driving in that place, a trolley car of the defendant \u25a0came up rapidly from behind, without any warning, struck the wagon in which the plaintiff was sitting, threw it over, and inflicted \u25a0serious injury upon him. . At the conclusion of the plaintiff\u2019s evidence, which tended to establish the foregoing facts, the complaint was dismissed by the trial court. This is clearly error, within the principles established in the case of Rooks v. Railroad Co., 10 App. Div. 98, 41 N. Y. Supp. 824. A few of the rulings of the court with Tegard to the admission of evidence, which were excepted to, were \u2022erroneous; but, in view of the conclusion we have reached as to the merits, it is not necessary to consider these separate rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-9\">The judgment and order must be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
