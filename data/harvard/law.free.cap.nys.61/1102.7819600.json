It appears that, after the order to show cause was signed by the special term justice, two affidavits were annexed thereto without the knowledge or consent of said justice, and were used upon the return day by plaintiff. It was therefore proper for him to deny plaintiff\u2019s application to sue as a poor person. The plaintiff may, however, renew his application upon proper papers. Order appealed from is affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
