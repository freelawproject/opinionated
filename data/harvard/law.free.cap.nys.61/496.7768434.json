Supp. 580; and kindred cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-15\">The amendment allowed was in furtherance of justice (Code, \u00a7 723), and did not substantially change the plaintiff\u2019s claim. The defendant asserted, but did not prove, surprise. Code, \u00a7 539.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-16\">The evidence in at the conclusion of the trial presented a conflict of evidence. At all events, no motion was then made to dismiss the complaint, and the defendant, by the conduct of the trial, conceded it was one for the jury. Henry Hess &amp; Co. v. Baar, 14 Misc. Rep. 286; 287, 35 N. Y. Supp. 687; Helmuth v. Apgar, 17 Misc. Rep. 623, 625, 40 N. Y. Supp. 651; Kaufman v. Canary, 21 Misc. Rep. 302, 304, 47 N. Y. Supp. 152; Pollock v. Iron-Works Co., 157 N.

All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
