The plaintiff, in his efforts to overcome the proof of her title, introduced the evidence of two witnesses, Adolph Mendel and Julius Kaufman, the original owners of the claim which was the foundation of this suit, and which the plaintiff had acquired through an intermediate assignment. On cross-examination each of those witnesses was interrogated as to his pecuniary interest in the result of the action. The evidence was excluded, and exceptions were duly taken. These rulings constituted error prejudicial to the defendants. The interest which a witness has in the subject of the controversy is always a material inquiry. 1 Greenl. Ev. \u00a7 446; In re Snelling, 136 N. Y. 515, 519, 32 N. E. 1006; Vaughn' v. Westover, 2 Hun, 43. The utility of cross-examination aimed at the credibility of a witness is seriously impaired if inquiry into his relation to the subject-matter of the litigation be restricted. The plaintiff\u2019s recovery in this action depended largely on the testimony of these two witnesses, who gave evidence of admissions adverse to the defendants\u2019 contention. Their disinterestedness, therefore, especially when considered in the light of the slight proof attacking the bona fides of the transfer, .became of material moment. The judgment must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">Judgment reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellants to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
