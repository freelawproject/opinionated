Upon the return of the summons the defendant formally insisted that he was a nonresident, and presented affidavits containing positive allegations that at that time, and for the preceding 11 years, he had been a resident of Greenville, S. C. Counter affidavits were submitted by the plaintiff, whereupon the justice found \u201cthat the defendant had a place of business in this city.\u201d This finding will not satisfy the jurisdictional requirements. \u201cResidence\u201d and \u201cplace of business\u201d are not synonymous. The respondent evidently recognized this; for, after the appeal had been argued and submitted, he presented for our consideration a letter which he had procured from the justice, a copy of which had been served on the appellant\u2019s attorneys, to the effect that the foregoing statement from the record was incomplete, and that the justice had found as a fact from the proof that the appellant was a resident of the county. This letter must be disregarded, as we cannot go behind the return or amend it in this informal manner. There is at best a grave question whether the plaintiff\u2019s affidavits, considered alone, establish residence. They contain no direct allegation of fact. These may perhaps be supplied on a rehearing, although it would probably be advisable to determine the question of jurisdiction, in disputed cases, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>on oral testimony, where opportunity for cross-examination would be afforded. For the jurisdictional defect referred to, the judgment must be reversed. Tyroler v. Gummersbach, 28 Misc. Rep. 151, 59 N. Y.
