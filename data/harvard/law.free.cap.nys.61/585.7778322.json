That the plaintiffs have an adequate remedy at law is defensive matter, and should be set up by answer. Tucker v. Railway Co., 78 Hun, 439, 29 N. Y. Supp. 202, and cases there cited. It does not affirmatively appear upon the face of the complaint that the plaintiffs have an adequate remedy at law against both defendants in a single action or against the demurring defendant. The complaint does not state that he is responsible. Moreover, he is here charged as administrator, and joined with the bank; and to say that he might have been sued alone individually, at law, is like saying that the plaintiffs might have sued somebody else. The appellants\u2019 contention that the plaintiffs have an adequate remedy at law against the bank, if it had been pleaded, would have been like an allegation that he is not liable because somebody else is. If the plaintiffs have an adequate remedy at law against the bank, and if, by virtue of any peculiar circumstances, that operates to discharge the defendant in equity, his pleading should affirmatively show it. This his demurrer does not do.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-14\">The interlocutory judgment is reversed, with costs, and judgment directed for plaintiffs upon the demurrer, with costs, with usual leave to the defendants to answer on payment of costs. All concur, except PUTNAM, J., not voting.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
