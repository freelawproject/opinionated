A renting of the premises was admitted by the defendant, who disputed the commencement without denying the duration of the term. There was thus presented a question of fact, and no reason appears for disturbing the determination of the trial justice, either as to the fact or law; the time intermediate the making of the lease and its commencement in possession beii% no part of the term, and so not within the statute. Young v. Dake, 5 N. Y. 463.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-17\">The judgment should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
