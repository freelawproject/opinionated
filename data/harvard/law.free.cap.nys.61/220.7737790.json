The appellant was arrested without a warrant during a fight Avhich occurred in his establishment, in the city of Poughkeepsie, and was charged with keeping a house \u201cfor\" the resort of prostitutes, drunkards, tipplers, gamesters, or other disorderly persons,\u201d which, under the proidsions of section 899 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, as well as of the charter of the city of Poughkeepsie (section 138), constitutes a disorderly person. The charter gives the' recorder\u2019s court jurisdiction to try cases of this character, and we ar\u00e9 of opinion that the appellant had no constitutional right to a trial by jury. People v. Dutcher, 83 N. Y. 240.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">The evidence on which the appellant was convicted was clearly sufficient for that purpose, and whether the officer who arrested him should have had a warrant does not affect the question of his conviction, after he was once within the jurisdiction of the court. \u201cThe general rule is,\u201d says Mr. Justice Cullen in People v. Eberspacher, 79 Hun, 410, 29 N. Y. Supp. 796, \u201cthat it is no defense to a criminal prosecution that the defendant was illegally or forcibly brought within the jurisdiction of the court.\u201d The appellant has his remedy, if he has been Avronged, against the \u201cofficer who has acted under void process, or who has exceeded his powers.\u201d Crock. Sher. (3d Ed.) p. 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">The judgment appealed from should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
