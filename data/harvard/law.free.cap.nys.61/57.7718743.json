This action was brought for $125, the amount of the \u201crental\u201d for the first six months. The plaintiff, as his own witness, corroborated the statements of Mr. Horan as to prior years. The defense practically rested upon contradictions given by Mr. Pratt of Mr. Horan\u2019s testimony, so that the whole contention turned upon the relative credibility of the two principal witnesses, of whom the trial justice credited the plaintiff\u2019s attorney. Th\u00e9 judgment should not be disturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-16\">Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
