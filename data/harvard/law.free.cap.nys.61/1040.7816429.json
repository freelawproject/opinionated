Not only did it appear without contradiction that they delayed to serve the amended complaint for over a year, so that it was not in the power of the defendant to proceed in the action, hut they used the pendency of this action to defeat the defendant\u2019s efforts to obtain an affirmative judgment on his counterclaim in another court. The fact that the defendant had interposed a counterclaim affords no reason for^ denying this motion. Roy v. Thompson, 1 Duer, 636.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-16\">It is quite true that upon the motion the defendant could only obtain a dismissal of the complaint, and could not recover any affirmative relief, but he was not barred from having that relief because he sought affirmative relief in the action. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-17\">It is also true that the disposition of such a motion is in the discretion of the court; but that discretion is reviewable upon appeal to this court, and, when it is evident that it has been abused, the complainant is entitled to his remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-18\">The order denying the motion is therefore reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion to dismiss the complaint is granted, with $10 costs. - All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
