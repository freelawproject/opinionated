The distinction between a motion to strike out a pleading as frivolous and the question presented on demurrer must not be lost sight of. One is a summary way of getting rid of the pleading on motion, and the other is the orderly manner \u2022 of proceeding by argument to try the issue of law. On demurrer a. pleading after argument and deliberation might be held bad, which,, on motion, should not be stricken out as frivolous. A pleading i&amp;. not frivolous unless it is indicative of bad faith in the pleader upon bare inspection. If any extended argument is needed to show its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>insufficiency, it is not frivolous. In Trumbull v. Ashley, 26 App. Div. 356, 49 27. Y. Supp. 786, it was said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-4\">\u201c \u2018It was not within the province of the court to overrule the answer upon the ground that it was frivolous. An answer can he said to be frivolous only when it is so clearly bad as to require no argument,\u2019 says Justice Rumsey in the case of Gruenstein v. Jablonsky, 1 App. Div. 680, 87 N. Y. Supp. 538, \u2018to show its character, and which would be said to tie so manifestly defective as to be indicative of bad faith upon a mere inspection. Strong v. Sproul, 53 N. Y. 497. \"Unless it appears by inspection of the pleading that it raises no issue upon any fact which the plaintiff must prove, it is not frivolous, however objectionable it may be in other respects.\u2019 \u2018An answer must be tested,\u2019 says Justice Landon In the case of Association v. Niver, 4 App. Div. 618, 39 N. Y. Supp. 414, \u2018by the complaint, and, if it puts in issue its material allegations as to the defendant, it is good enough for the purposes of the action.\u2019 \u2018We think, therefore, upon reason as well as upon the construction of the Code,\u2019 says Judge Andrews in delivering the opinion of the court in the case of Bennett v. Manufacturing Co., 110 N. Y. 150, 17 N. B. 669, \u2018a denial in a verified answer of a material allegation in the complaint upon information and belief\u2019 is good. * * * The denial of a material fact is not frivolous, * * * and the court was clearly in error in overruling the answer of the defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">See, also, Schoonmaker v. Mayor, etc., 7 N. Y. St. Rep. 430; Griffin v. Todd, 48 How. Prac. 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">And in Hill v. Warner, 39 App. Div. 425, 57 N. Y. Supp. 356, it was said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-7\">\u201cA frivolous pleading is one which on inspection is inherently bad; that is, it contains no defense. While it may be quite apparent the pleading is interposed to gain time, the court cannot say, on a bare examination of it, that this denial of. a material allegation of the complaint is made for that purpose.Issues raised in a permissible manner cannot be disposed of in that summary way.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">To determine whether the answer herein was frivolous necessitates a brief reference to the pleadings. The action was brought to recover a sum alleged to be due the plaintiff in accordance with a judgment entered August 14, 1894, awarding her dower in certain property. As -shown by the pleadings, the plaintiff is the widow of Alfred B-edlow, who died May 16, 1891, and she claims as dower a share in certain property conveyed by her husband to the defendant, in which conveyances she did not join. The complaint states that the defendant claims in this property a fee estate, and describes-it as \u201ca one-sixth undivided interest * * * in a certain lot * * * of land, * * * together with all the bulkheads, wharves, and piers, * * *. with all advantages, rents, issues, profits, and appurtenances thereunto belonging, * * * and a one-sixth undivided interest * * of the pier and dock property known as Tier 49 East River.\u2019 \u201d After alleging the judgment- giving her dower in this property, and that the defendant is in possession of it claiming to be sole owner, the complaint states that the defendant, as owner, leased the said premises on May 1, 1892, for a term of 10 years at a rental of $2,166.66, receiving since February 21, 1894,\u2014from which time, by the judgment, dower was to be computed,\u2014the sum of $10,833.40, and, over and above all expenses, up to January 30, 1899, $9,622.70, for a third of which sum, or $3,207.56,-the plaintiff claims judgment should be given her. For a first defense the answer denies that the judgment referred to adjudged that a sum equal to one-third of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>annual rental value of the property described was to be paid the plaintiff by the defendant, and alleges that the judgment fixed no sum after February 21, 1894, but did fix a sum due her up to that date, which sum has been paid her. For a second defense it is claimed that by the aforesaid judgment damages of $1,495.38 were awarded, which were paid, the judgment thereby constituting a bar to any further recovery. For a third defense the answer admits the conveyance to the defendant by the plaintiff\u2019s husband of the property mentioned, in which conveyances the plaintiff did not join, and that the defendant has leased the property as alleged, but denies all other allegations relating to these\" facts. For a fourth defense it is stated that by the judgment awarding the dower in the property it was adjudged that since May 16, 1891, the children of the plaintiff\u2019s husband were and have been the owners of the premises described, from which judgment the defendant has an appeal now pending; and for a fifth and last defense it is asserted that no leave by court has been granted to permit the bringing of this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">The appellant\u2019s argument upon this appeal is based upon the contention that the complaint, failing to allege ownership in the defendant, is fatally defective. It is pointed out that a judicial decision has been rendered, to which the plaintiff and defendant herein were parties; that the defendant was at no time during the period for which it is sought to charge her the owner of the property, but that it was owned by the children of Alfred Bedlow. As it is shown that although the defendant did, as a matter of fact, collect rents for the period mentioned, the true owner by virtue of such judgment will recover mesne profits for the entire period he has been kept out of possession. Accordingly it is urged it would be unjust to subject the defendant to the burden of paying the entire rents and profits t\u00f3 the owners of the property, and, in- addition, compel her to pay the plaintiff\u2019s dower; that she would thereby be called upon to pay twice,\u2014 once to the owners of the property, and then again to the widow. For this reason\u2014the widow having the right, under section 1614 of the Code of Civil Procedure, to collect the entire amount of her dower from the children of Alfred Bedlow\u2014it is claimed that it is essential to the maintenance of such an action as this that there should be in the complaint an express allegation of ownership on the part of the defendant for the period for which the dower is demanded, the liability under the statute being entirely dependent on ownership. The question is thus presented as to whether dower can be asserted against any one but the owner of the property. Whether or not such a contention is sound is unnecessary for us to determine on this appeal further than to say that it is not frivolous. There is the further question raised by the fifth defense that no leave has been granted by the court to bring this action pending the other appeal. This, on bare inspection, is not frivolous. The defenses denying that the plaintiff has correctly stated what the judgment awarding dower actually decreed, in the absence of the judgment itself, are not frivolous. It may be that upon demurrer these defenses will be held bad, but it cannot be said that upon bare inspection they are indicative of bad faith, or are so wanting in substance as to justify their being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>overruled on motion as frivolous. The order and judgment thereon should be reversed, with costs to the appellant to abide the event, and the motion denied, with $10 costs, but with leave to the plaintiff to -demur, or take such other action as she may be advised. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
