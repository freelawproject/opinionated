The motion was granted, and the order thereon was entered on the 10th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1104\">*1104</page-number>day of October, 1899, and a copy was served on defendant\u2019s attorneys on October 11, 1899, together with notice of entry as of October 10, 1899. The said order had been submitted by the plaintiff\u2019s attorneys, and, while the order is not dated, it is undisputed that it was entered and filed on the 10th day of October, 1899. If the order had been dated, it could not have been any later than October 10, 1899, when it was entered. Accordingly the reply was due,on October 12, 1899, two days after the entry of the said order; and, as it is conceded that the reply was not served on or before that day, the plaintiff was in default. As a matter of fact, the reply was not served until October 13, 1899, when it was sent by mail, and was not received until the 14th day of October, 1899. On the same day it was returned on the ground that the time to serve had expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b1132-5\">It follows that the order appealed from should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion denied, with $10 costs, with leave to the plaintiff to apply at special term for relief from his default. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
