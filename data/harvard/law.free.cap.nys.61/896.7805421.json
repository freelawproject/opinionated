Bent for last half of January, $10.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b925-6\">\u201cJanuary 12, 1899.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b925-7\">\u201cThis is a memorandum of verbal lease. Estate of T. Vernon,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b925-8\">\u201cH. V.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b925-9\">\u201c[Stamp.] L. Gilbert.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b925-10\">Subsequently, and on or about September <em>21, </em>1899, the landlords notified the tenant of their election to terminate the tenancy at the end of the following month of October. The tenant, admitting by not denying the agreement set forth in the petition, by verified answer alleged an oral lease of the premises from May 1, 1899, to April 80, 1900, at $800, payable monthly in advance, but offered no evidence in its support. The trial' justice seemingly regarded the letting as a yearly one; and under the doctrine stated in Douglass v. Seiferd, 18 Misc. Rep. 188, 191, 41 N. Y. Supp. 289, there might be force in such conclusion, had the parties in their agreement not used the expression \u201cmonthly lease,\u201d which words may not be disregarded or construed as needless. The entire writing evinces a special agreement for tenancy by the month, and so for a term definite, to which the statute (2 Rev. St. [9th Ed.] p. 1818, \u00a7 1) has no application. The judgment must therefore be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-11\">Judgment reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellants to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
