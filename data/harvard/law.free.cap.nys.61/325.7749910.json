It is a well-settled rule that when one, being in default for failure to serve a pleading, moves for leave to open the default, a copy of the pleadings must be annexed to the motion papers. Stern v. Knapp, 52 N. Y. Super. Ct. 14; Powers v. Trenor, 3 Hun, 3. Not only did the plaintiff neglect to serve a copy of his proposed reply, but it is impracticable <em>to-</em>ascertain from his affidavit what the nature of that reply is. The motion, therefore, for leave to serve a reply, should have been denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-18\">From an examination of the counterclaim in the answer, it is not possible to divine any reason why the discovery and inspection of the defendant\u2019s books was necessary to enable the plaintiff to serve his reply. If the facts set up in Ms affidavit entitled the plaintiff to the discovery and inspection at all, it is for the purpose of enabling him to prepare for the trial, and such relief will not be given Mm for such a purpose until the case is at issue. In the most favorable view that can be taken for the plaintiff, his application was premature. That motion should have also been denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>The order at special term must therefore be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion denied, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
