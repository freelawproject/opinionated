J.</author>\n<p id=\"A0C\">The defendant is the owner of the steam towboat Syracuse, which, on May 25, 1890, took in tow the canal boat M. F. Hamm, with a cargo of ice belonging to the plaintiffs, intending to tow said canal boat from Van Wier or Lockworth\u2019s landing, on the\u2019 Hudson, to the city of Yew York. There were 50 or 60 other vessels-in tow, arranged in tiers of ,4 each. While coming down the river,' the Syracuse evidently ran the tow out of the channel, some of the-hawsers broke, and the boats on the starboard side, including the one belonging to the plaintiffs, drifted back, and were cut on a bank in the river. The plaintiff\u2019s boat got on this bank about 2:30 a. m\u201e, and lay in such a position that her bow pointed to the east in deep water while her stern was aground on the bank. About 4:30 p. m\u201e, the same day, the tug Harry, employed by the defendant, having attempted unsuccessfully to beach the plaintiff\u2019s boat, towed the same-to Athens stern first, and then brought her towards Bondout, on- \u2022 which last-named journey the boat, with its cargo, sank, becoming a total loss. In all these things, acts of mismanagement and negligence on the part of the defendant were charged, and the case, on the-evidence, was one clearly for the jury. It is the duty of a vessel which undertakes to tow other boats to see that the tow is properly made up, and that the lines are strong, and securely fastened. The-Quickstep, 9 Wall. 665, 19 L. Ed. 767. A steam tug, which engages-to tow a vessel into a port, although not a common carrier, nor an insurer, is bound to exercise reasonable skill and care in everything relating to the work until it is accomplished, and she is liable for the-want of either to the extent of the damage sustained. The A. R. Wetmore, 5 Ben. 147, Fed. Cas. Yo. 569. Whether the defendant discharged these duties was, on the evidence, clearly a question of fact,. properly submitted to the jury, and they found, upon evidence which satisfactorily sustains their finding, that the loss of the plaintiff\u2019s-boat and its cargo was because of the negligence of the defendant, and the plaintiffs were free from any imputation of contributing to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>the injury. The case was carefully submitted to the jury, and the damages awarded find ample support in the proofs; the exceptions are without merit; and, as we find no error, the judgment and order appealed from must be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
