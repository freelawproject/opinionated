The appellant is, therefore, restricted on this appeal to a single question of whether the verdict was against the weight of evidence. An examination of the evidence discloses a sharp conflict between the parties,\u2014the plaintiff contending that the defendant wrongfully and without knowledge or consent of the plaintiff attached a one-inch pipe to the two-inch pipe which was connected with the boiler of the plaintiff, and took more steam than he was entitled to under his agreement; and the defendant insisting that what he did, and the steam he used, was with the consent of the plaintiff. Upon this conflict the jury have found a verdict in favor of the defendant, and we are not prepared to say that the finding is against the weight and preponderance of the evidence. In this case two juries have found for the defendant, and the trial court twice denied the plaintiff\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-18\">The judgment and order appealed from should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
