In his complaint, Plaintiff asserted claims under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ( Section 1983 ) for alleged violation of his rights under the Fourth, Fifth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution based on defendant Wetzel's signing of a Notice of Execution on December 2, 2015 scheduling Plaintiff's execution for January 19, 2016 and DOC's failure to remove him from \"Phase 2\" awaiting-execution status until Monday, December 7, 2015, after a stay of execution was ordered by\n   the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania on Friday, December 4, 2015. (Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 1-2, 8-9, 11-12, 20.) Plaintiff's complaint pleaded claims against defendants Wetzel and Gilmore in both their official and personal capacity and sought as relief only monetary damages. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1, 7 \u00b6\u00b6 23 &amp; 25, 8.) On March 30, 2017, the trial court dismissed Plaintiff's complaint\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. Plaintiff timely filed the instant appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Before this Court, Plaintiff argues that 1) his complaint stated a valid Section 1983 claim against Defendants for violation of his federal constitutional rights; and 2) that if it did not, he should have been granted leave to amend the complaint. Neither of these arguments is meritorious.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Section 6602(e) of the PLRA provides that \"the court shall dismiss prison conditions litigation at any time, including prior to service on the defendant, if the court determines [that] ... (2) [t]he prison conditions litigation is frivolous or malicious or fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted or the defendant is entitled to assert a valid affirmative defense, including immunity, which, if asserted, would preclude the relief.\" 42 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 6602(e)(2). Plaintiff's complaint constitutes \"prison conditions litigation\" under the PLRA, as it seeks damages for the actions of government parties that affected him as a prison inmate. 42 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 6601 (defining \"prison conditions litigation\" to include any \"civil proceeding ... with respect to the conditions of confinement or the effects of actions by a government party on the life of an individual confined in prison\").\n   <em>\n    Sua sponte\n   </em>\n   dismissal of Plaintiff's complaint was therefore proper if Plaintiff's complaint failed to state a cause of action or the action was otherwise barred as a matter of law.\n   <em>\n    Shore v.

(Complaint at 1 (stating that action is filed against defendants \"in their official and individual capacity\").) A cause of action for damages under Section 1983 can be asserted against a state official in his personal capacity, even though the acts on which liability is based were in the course of his official duties.\n   <em>\n    Hafer v.

Cmwlth. 1998). We therefore must examine whether the complaint stated a claim against these two individual defendants for violation of Plaintiff's federal constitutional rights. We conclude that it did not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiff's complaint alleged that defendant Wetzel's signing of the Notice of Execution on December 2, 2015 violated his constitutional rights because it was issued in violation of a February 2005 federal stay of execution order. (Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 3, 13 &amp; Exs. 9 &amp; 13.) It is clear, however, from the February 2005 stay order and the December 2015 stay motion that the February 2005 stay order was not in effect in 2015.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The February 2005 stay order stayed Plaintiff's execution, scheduled for March 29, 2005, pending adjudication of a habeas corpus petition filed by Plaintiff in 2005. (2/28/05 Stay Order, attached to Appellant's Br.) That 2005 habeas corpus petition was dismissed by the federal court without prejudice later in 2005. (2015 Stay Motion \u00b6 1, attached to Plaintiff's Complaint\n   as Ex. 3.) There is therefore no basis for Plaintiff's claim that Notice of Execution was unconstitutional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The other act that Plaintiff alleges violated his constitutional rights was DOC's failure to remove him from awaiting-execution status for three days after a stay of execution was granted. This claim does not state a cause of action against defendant Wetzel or defendant Gilmore because Plaintiff does not allege that either of these individual defendants himself delayed transmission of the December 4, 2015 stay order or failed to remove Plaintiff from awaiting-execution status after learning that the stay had been issued. Rather, he alleges that DOC intentionally disregarded the December 4, 2015 stay order until December 7, 2015 and seeks to impose vicarious liability for that conduct on defendants Wetzel and Gilmore based on the positions that they hold at DOC and SCI-Greene. (Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 8-9, 11-12, 17-18, 23, 25 &amp; Exs. 9 &amp; 11;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Appellant's Br. at 5 (characterizing the basis of this claim as \"staff's Intentional and deliberate malfeasance [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ]\").) Claims for money damages for violation of constitutional rights cannot be based on vicarious liability or\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior\n   </em>\n   ; to state such a cause of action against a government official under Section 1983, the plaintiff must allege that the individual defendant was personally involved in the alleged wrongs.\n   <em>\n    Ashcroft v.
