Papantoniou, appeals from the judgment of conviction, rendered following a jury trial, of felony murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54c, burglary in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-101 (a) (1), and criminal possession of a firearm in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-217 (a) (1). On appeal, the defendant claims that the state (1) violated his rights to be present at trial and to confront the witnesses against him under article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   when the prosecutor made a \"generic tailoring\" argument during closing remarks, and (2) violated his constitutional rights to due process and a fair trial by committing prosecutorial improprieties. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following facts, which the jury reasonably could have found, and procedural history are relevant to this\n   appeal. At approximately 12:30 p.m. on October 19, 2014, William Coutermash\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   drove to 397 Circular Avenue in Hamden; the defendant accompanied him. Larry Dildy, the victim, lived in the second floor apartment of a multifamily house located at 397 Circular Avenue with his wife, Vivian Dildy (Vivian), and their daughter, Ashante Dildy (Ashante). The victim was a known drug dealer, and according to Coutermash, he and the defendant went to the victim's apartment with the intent to rob him.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   More specifically, Coutermash said the plan was to \"flash a gun in the [victim's] face\" in an attempt to \"get either drugs or money\" from him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   When Coutermash and the defendant arrived, Coutermash parked his vehicle-a black Jeep with New York license plates-near the victim's driveway and handed the defendant gloves and a handgun. According to Coutermash, the defendant then exited the vehicle \"to get drugs or money\" and also was armed with a knife.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendant, who was wearing a gray sweatshirt, a tan hat, and sunglasses, then proceeded to the back door of the victim's apartment. Coutermash testified that he stayed in his Jeep.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Vivian was home at the time, and according to her, one \"intruder\" entered the apartment through the\n   apartment's locked back door after the force of his knocking opened it. She described the intruder as wearing a grey \"sweat jacket\" and a yellow or beige hat. Shortly thereafter, Vivian saw the lone intruder pointing a gun at the victim, heard him say something that \"sounded like give it up,\" and called 911 at her husband's request. Ashante, who was hiding in her room when the intruder entered the apartment, also heard a single, \"raspy\" male voice say that \"he needed the $400 and the pill,\" and over-heard her father respond that \"[he] didn't have it.\" After the victim and the intruder argued for a period of time, a physical fight ensued, and the two men struggled over the intruder's gun. During the struggle, the victim pulled off the intruder's sweatshirt, and Vivian struck the intruder over the head with a broom handle before she ran to a separate room. Vivian then heard two gunshots,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the intruder quickly fled the apartment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Minutes after the defendant had exited the Jeep, Coutermash observed emergency personnel arriving and decided to drive away from the area. As he did so, he encountered the defendant on a nearby street, picked him up, and the two left the scene. The victim had been shot, cut, and stabbed multiple times during the altercation; he was taken to a hospital and died from his injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   During the ensuing police investigation, investigators recovered various items located on the floor near the victim's body, including a grey hooded sweatshirt, a tan hat, sunglasses, and a knife. Subsequent scientific testing revealed that DNA\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   evidence taken from the grey sweatshirt matched the defendant's DNA profile, which\n   was contained in a national database of DNA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   That same testing eliminated\n   Coutermash as a source of the DNA found on the grey sweatshirt. Scientific testing of the tan hat also revealed the presence of both the defendant's and the victim's DNA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Finally, surveillance cameras near the victim's apartment captured the defendant discarding gloves and a handgun shortly after the shooting.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   By way of an amended long form information, the state charged the defendant with felony murder, burglary in the first degree, and criminal possession of a firearm.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Following the jury's verdict of guilty on all counts, the trial court rendered judgment and sentenced the defendant to a term of imprisonment of forty-five years on the felony murder conviction, a concurrent sentence of twenty years imprisonment on the burglary conviction, and a concurrent sentence of ten years imprisonment on the criminal possession of a firearm conviction, for a total effective sentence of forty-five years imprisonment. This appeal followed. Additional facts and procedural history will be set forth as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   We first address the defendant's claim that the state violated his rights to be present at trial and to confront the witnesses against him. He argues that the state violated these\n   <em>\n    specific\n   </em>\n   constitutional rights when the prosecutor made a \"generic tailoring\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   argument during closing remarks to the jury. He concedes that the state is permitted to make such an argument under the federal constitution,\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   but according to him, the state may not do so in accordance with article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   He did not assert this claim at trial and therefore raises it under the familiar rubric of\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"566558\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/213/233/#p239\">\n    213 Conn. 233\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 239-40,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=567%20A.2d%20823\">\n    567 A.2d 823\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1989), as modified by\n   <em>\n    In re Yasiel R.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=317%20Conn.%20773\">\n    317 Conn. 773\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 781,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=120%20A.3d%201188\">\n    120 A.3d 1188\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015). In response, the state contends that the defendant's unpreserved constitutional claim fails to satisfy both the third and fourth prongs of\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   . Because we conclude that the alleged constitutional violation, if any, was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, we agree that the defendant's claim fails to satisfy\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   's fourth prong.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   The following additional facts and procedural history are relevant to this claim. The defendant testified at trial and was the final witness called by the defense. His testimony, in certain respects, conflicted with Coutermash's testimony. According to Coutermash, the victim did not owe him money, and he remained in his Jeep when the defendant went to the victim's apartment. The defendant testified that, on October 19, 2014, Coutermash told him that he needed to \"collect some money\" from someone. See footnote 3 of this opinion. In contrast to Coutermash, the defendant claimed that when he and Coutermash arrived at 397 Circular Avenue, both of them entered the victim's apartment, and Coutermash demanded $400 from the victim. The defendant testified that he entered the victim's apartment only after Coutermash and the victim began fighting and when things were \"getting out of control ....\" Upon entering the apartment, the defendant told the victim: \"[L]isten, just give [Coutermash] his money-you\n   know-let me get the hell out of here, just give him what you owe him, it's gone far enough, it's out of control, just give him his money, you know.\" The defendant further testified that, immediately after he told the victim to give Coutermash money, Coutermash fled the apartment. At that point, the defendant claimed that the victim charged at him, the two began to struggle over the gun in his hand, and the gun \"went off\" twice during the struggle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   During closing argument, counsel for the defendant began by stating that \"this case ... comes down to two witnesses, really, [the defendant] and [Coutermash]. They told two divergent stories, and the state told you that they're relying on ... Coutermash.\" Counsel for the defendant also argued in relevant part: \"Now, we talked a little about this a little while ago, that is, that the state goes second. I have to do my best to anticipate their arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The state is very creative; I'm sure I will not think of everything they're going to think of. So, here's some food for thought. They may argue that [the defendant] is trying to save himself by concocting this story. My response to that is, refer back to the undisputed evidence. Which version is a concoction, and which one is closer to reality, based on the evidence?\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The prosecutor then opened her rebuttal argument by stating in relevant part: \"So, the defendant wants you to believe-or disbelieve every single thing you heard, except the defendant. Disbelieve all of it, and certainly ignore the actual eyewitness to this because her version doesn't fit what we're trying to do here. Her version doesn't fit what we're trying to tell you.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Keep in mind, the defendant has had access to all of the evidence, all of the testimony, all of the photographs, every single piece of information that was\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    presented to you,\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   ]\n   <em>\n    the defendant was able to sit there and listen to and come up with his version\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \"The defense attorney asked all of you on voir dire, and he just asked you again, whether you believe that someone can lie to gain a benefit. Do you? You all said yes. Who has the biggest benefit to gain here at this moment? Don't you find it very convenient that the defendant's story is that he was just a mere bystander in all of this? He was forced to come up by [Coutermash], his friend, who just wanted him to have his back, so he did....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \"He attempts to create a story that fits all of the evidence, and his attempts at that you can't deny is flawed. He gets an A for effort, but it's not going to work because the evidence shows you that this version makes zero sense.\" (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The defendant contends that the prosecutor's remarks during rebuttal amounted to a \"generic tailoring\" argument that violated his state constitutional rights. He seeks review of his unpreserved state constitutional claim under\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"566558\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/213/233/#p239\">\n    213 Conn. at 233\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=567%20A.2d%20823\">\n    567 A.2d 823\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"[A] defendant can prevail on a claim of constitutional error not preserved at trial only if\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   the following conditions are met: (1) the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; (2) the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; (3) the alleged constitutional violation ... exists and ... deprived the defendant of a fair trial; and (4) if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt. In the absence of any one of these conditions, the defendant's claim will fail. The appellate tribunal is free, therefore, to respond to the defendant's claim by focusing on whichever condition is most relevant in the particular\n   circumstances.\" (Emphasis in original; footnote omitted.)

The state presented an overwhelming case against the defendant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   The DNA evidence and\n   testimony from\n   both Coutermash and the defendant demonstrate that the defendant was involved in the victim's death. In fact, the defendant concedes on appeal that \"[t]he evidence supports a conclusion that [he] was in the apartment and held the pistol while struggling with [the victim] when it fired twice.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   According to Coutermash, on October 19, 2014, the two men intended to rob the victim of either drugs or money by flashing a gun in his face. The defendant also testified that he \"was looking to get a few bucks\" when he traveled with Coutermash to the victim's apartment. See footnote 3 of this opinion. The defendant's testimony regarding what occurred on October 19, 2014, differed from Coutermash's account, as the defendant said that\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   he and Coutermash entered the victim's apartment. Nevertheless, the defendant testified that he told the victim to \"just give [Coutermash] his money ... just give him what you owe him ....\" after the defendant had entered the victim's apartment with a gun in his hand. Under either version of events-the defendant's or Coutermash's-the jury reasonably could have concluded that the defendant entered the victim's apartment with the intent to commit a forceful taking; see General Statutes \u00a7 53a-133 ; and that the victim was shot during the ensuing struggle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Additionally, Vivian and Ashante both testified that a lone intruder demanded money and pills from the victim before struggling with and shooting him. According to Vivian, the intruder wore a grey \"sweat\n   jacket\" and a yellow or beige hat. DNA evidence found on the grey sweatshirt and tan hat found next to the victim's body directly connected the defendant to the shooting, and he even testified at trial that the gun discharged while he struggled with the victim. Vivian also testified that the lone intruder entered through the locked back door after he forcefully banged on it, and that she heard him say something that \"sounded like give it up,\" and attacked him with a broom handle and called 911. All of this is compelling evidence that the defendant was armed with a gun when he unlawfully entered the victim's apartment with the intent to rob the victim and that the victim died as a result of the incident. The state therefore presented a very strong case against the defendant. See footnote 16 of this opinion. Moreover, Vivian and Ashante corroborated Coutermash's testimony that the defendant entered the victim's apartment alone with the intent to take either drugs or money from the victim at gunpoint.

Accordingly, the defendant's claim fails under the fourth prong of\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The defendant's second claim is that the state violated his rights to due process and a fair trial when the prosecutor committed three separate improprieties during\n   her closing remarks to the jury.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   He argues that the prosecutor asserted facts not in evidence, misstated the evidence that was actually introduced, and improperly undermined his credibility. He contends that his credibility was \"the central issue in this case,\" and that such improprieties were harmful because they undermined his credibility and suggested that he possessed a guilty conscience. The state, on the other hand, argues that the arguments by the prosecutor were not improper and, even if they were improper, they did not deprive the defendant of his rights to due process and a fair trial. We conclude that, even if we were to assume, without deciding, that the challenged comments were improper, the defendant failed to prove that they deprived him of his rights to due process and a fair trial.\n   The following additional procedural history is relevant to this claim. During the state's rebuttal argument, the prosecutor made three sets of comments that the defendant claims amounted to prosecutorial impropriety. The first set of comments relates to the prosecutor's characterization of the testimony from Douglas Fox, a firearms expert who testified on behalf of the state, and how the defendant must have chambered two rounds in the gun in his possession before intentionally pulling the trigger. During her rebuttal, the prosecutor argued in relevant part: \"[Fox] ... explained to you how [the handgun used to shoot the victim] works, which is\n   extremely important. You will determine that his testimony is important because he told you that firing that weapon takes a purposeful, physical action to make that weapon able to be fired. If you recall, he showed you that weapon, he showed you that you have to pull that slide back.\n   <em>\n    That doesn't happen by accident. Those are not accidental movements, and it's certainly not accidental twice\n   </em>\n   .\" (Emphasis added.) She also argued: \"[While the victim] is attacking [the defendant] ... and struggling, struggling, struggling, and by accident the gun goes off-twice. [The defendant claims he] [d]idn't pull the trigger intentionally, certainly didn't pull the slide back intentionally, all accidental. Ask yourselves, ladies and gentlemen, does this story make any sense whatsoever?\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The second set of comments relates to the prosecutor's characterization of the defendant's conduct immediately after the victim was shot. During her rebuttal, the prosecutor argued in relevant part: \"[The defendant claimed] he was so concerned about all of the injuries, on how bad [the victim] was hurt, and the blood and he felt horrible.

With respect to the first set of remarks, the defendant argues that the prosecutor improperly suggested that the firearm in his possession could not have fired accidentally twice during his struggle with the victim. According to the defendant, the prosecutor improperly \"implie[d] that the defendant had to pull the slide [of the gun] back before each shot, and had to pull the trigger intentionally twice.\" As to the second set of remarks, the defendant contends that the state improperly argued that, instead of calling 911 immediately after the shooting, he chose to call his lawyer. His argument for this set of remarks is twofold. First, he maintains that the state \"implie[d] that [he] had the means to call 911 at or\n   shortly after leaving [the victim's] house, a fact not in evidence,\" and second, that \"[i]t also implie[d] that [he] called his lawyer as soon as he left.\" According to him, the state's remarks \"both misstated the evidence and implied that only guilty people call their lawyers.\" Finally, as an alternative to his claim presented in part I of this opinion, the defendant reframes the prosecutor's \"generic tailoring\" remarks as a\n   <em>\n    general\n   </em>\n   prosecutorial impropriety claim. Even if we assume, without deciding, that these remarks were improper, on the basis of our evaluation of the\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   factors, we conclude that the defendant has failed to prove that he was deprived of his rights to due process and a fair trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   First and Second Sets of Remarks\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   With respect to the first and second set of remarks, we initially note that trial counsel for the defendant did not invite either set of remarks by the prosecutor. The first\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   factor therefore favors the defendant. At the same time, however, the remarks were not severe enough to influence the jury improperly. Defense counsel did not object to either set of remarks at trial, and \"it [is] highly significant that defense counsel failed to object to any of the improper remarks, request curative instructions, or move for a mistrial.\"\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Thompson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2636117\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/266/440/#p479\">\n    266 Conn. 440\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 479,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=832%20A.2d%20626\">\n    832 A.2d 626\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2003) ; see also\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Payne\n   </em>\n   , supra, 303 Conn. at 568,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20A.3d%20370\">\n    34 A.3d 370\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[w]hen no objection is raised at trial, we infer that defense counsel did not regard the remarks as 'seriously prejudicial' at the time\n   the statements were made\"). The second\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   factor favors the state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The allegedly improper remarks were also isolated. The prosecutor's remarks regarding the firearm occurred twice during a lengthy rebuttal argument. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Ross\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=151%20Conn.%20App.%20687\">\n    151 Conn.

As for the remarks on the defendant's call to his lawyer, the prosecutor, during cross-examination, asked a\n   <em>\n    single, follow up\n   </em>\n   question regarding the defendant's statement that he called his lawyer after he shot the victim;\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   at the end of her closing, the prosecutor made a passing reference to that call. Cf.\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Angel T.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4145535\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/292/262/#p290\">\n    292 Conn. 262\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 290-91,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=973%20A.2d%201207\">\n    973 A.2d 1207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009) (state improperly addressed defendant's decision to seek aid of counsel prior to arrest by eliciting evidence through two witnesses and \"then discussed the evidence at length during both its opening and rebuttal summations\"). Nor do we view any of these remarks as egregious under the circumstances. See\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Thompson\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2636117\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/266/440/#p479\">\n    266 Conn. at 480\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=832%20A.2d%20626\">\n    832 A.2d 626\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[g]iven the defendant's failure to object, only instances of grossly egregious [impropriety] will be severe enough to mandate reversal\"). The third\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   factor weighs in favor of the state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   It is also significant that neither set of alleged improprieties went to critical issues in the case. Because the defendant was charged with felony murder, his\n   <em>\n    intent\n   </em>\n   to shoot or murder the victim was not at issue. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12484831\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/138/1108/#p269\">\n    165 Conn.

The prosecutor's remarks about whether chambering a round in the defendant's handgun or firing it was \"accidental\" therefore did not go to a critical issue in the case. Nor did the state's case require that it prove that the defendant possessed a guilty conscience. See\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Montoya\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4058794\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/110/97/#p109\">\n    110 Conn.

Moreover, contrary to the defendant's claim on appeal, the state's case against the defendant did not hinge on a credibility contest between him and Coutermash. Cf.\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Angel T.\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4145535\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/292/262/#p290\">\n    292 Conn. at 290\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=973%20A.2d%201207\">\n    973 A.2d 1207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (state's case \"turned largely\" on credibility contest between defendant and victim \"and the impropriety gave the clear impression that the defendant, who was not speaking to the police and had retained an attorney in connection with the investigation, had something to hide\").

The evidence of guilt was overwhelming. This factor, standing alone, is sufficient to demonstrate that the remarks of the prosecutor, even if we assume for the sake of analysis that they were improper, were not so serious as to deprive the defendant of his rights to due process and a fair trial.

In other words, he focuses his argument on what the state needed to prove with respect to the burglary charge by contending that he did not enter or remain in the victim's apartment with\n    <em>\n     an intent\n    </em>\n    to commit a crime.
