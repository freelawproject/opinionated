We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following facts, which the jury reasonably could have found, and procedural history are relevant to the defendant's appeal. On November 30, 2012, the defendant went to El Milenio, a nightclub in Danbury, with his brother, Eliezer, and his friends, Raymond Martinez and Eiliana Martinez. A group of women, Dumilka Adames, Samantha Medina, Petra Mendez, Carina Amaro, and Rita Santos, also attended the nightclub. At approximately 2 a.m. on December 1, 2012, the nightclub closed and the group of women walked to their cars, which were parked in the adjacent C-Town grocery store parking lot. Kenneth Tucker, who had attended a different nightclub, was waiting in the parking lot to meet up with the group of women. The defendant and his associates also walked to the C-Town grocery store parking lot. Adames got into Santos' car with Tucker. Medina and Mendez got into Amaro's car.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   At some point, the defendant and Eliezer approached Amaro's car. Eliezer and Mendez exchanged words.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Medina, the defendant's former girlfriend, got out of the car and argued with him. The defendant then punched Medina in the face and put her in a headlock. Other people in the parking lot, including Tucker and Luis Rodriguez, another bystander, saw the defendant put Medina in a headlock. Medina yelled at the defendant to let her go. Tucker punched the defendant, and the defendant released Medina from the headlock. Tucker, the defendant and Eliezer then immediately began to fight with their fists. Rodriguez also entered the fray after he saw the defendant hit Medina. At some point during the fight, the defendant and Eliezer went to their car to arm themselves; Eliezer obtained a knife for himself from the car and handed a knife to the defendant. Tucker and Rodriguez were unarmed. Throughout the course of the fight in the parking lot, the defendant and Eliezer stabbed Tucker multiple times. The defendant also stabbed Rodriguez two or three times. When the defendant and Eliezer walked away, Rodriguez said something to the brothers. In response, the defendant and Eliezer ran after Rodriguez, and Eliezer stabbed Rodriguez in the back. After Eliezer stabbed him, Rodriguez tumbled down a portion of grass between the parking lot and the sidewalk. The defendant then approached Rodriguez, who was in the street unable to move as a result of his injuries, stabbed him in the left side of the chest and said: \"This is for hitting my brother.\" The defendant and Eliezer thereafter fled the scene together in a vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Two off-duty police officers witnessed a portion of the fight and rendered medical assistance to Rodriguez after he was stabbed. Rodriguez sustained five stab wounds and Tucker sustained three stab wounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The defendant was arrested later that night. The police took the defendant's statement in which the defendant admitted that he \"stabbed a person in self-defense ....\" The state charged the defendant with\n   two counts of assault in the first degree as a principal in violation of \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (1), two counts of assault in the first degree as an accessory in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 53a-59 (a) (1) and 53a-8, two counts of attempted murder in violation of \u00a7 53a-54, and two counts of conspiracy to commit first degree assault in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 53a-59 (a) (1) and 53a-48. At trial, the state presented eyewitness testimony, including that of Mendez, Adames, Tucker, Rodriguez, Liybin Fernandez, Officer Kristin Lindstrom, and Officer David Dubord. Following a jury trial, the defendant was found guilty on all counts except for one count of attempted murder (count five), and the jury's guilty verdict on one count of conspiracy to commit assault in the first degree (count eight) was vacated at sentencing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The defendant first claims that his conviction of assault in the first degree as a principal pursuant to counts two and six of the information, and assault in the first degree as an accessory pursuant to counts three and seven of the information, violates his fifth and fourteenth amendment right against double jeopardy. Accordingly, he contends that his conviction of the two counts of assault as an accessory should be vacated. The state argues that because the defendant's conviction of the four counts was based on different acts, his double jeopardy rights were not violated. We agree with the state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The following additional facts are relevant to our resolution of the defendant's claim. The information in the present case charged the defendant with four\n   separate counts of first degree assault. In relevant part, the information contained one count each of assault in the first degree as a principal and assault in the first degree as an accessory with respect to the stabbing injuries suffered by Rodriguez,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and separate counts of assault in the first degree as a principal and assault in the first degree as an accessory with respect to the stabbing injuries sustained by Tucker.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The\n   defendant never sought a bill of particulars.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In discussing the nature of the charges in its closing argument, the state argued that there were many possible combinations whenever there are at least two persons stabbing two victims and that multiple counts were appropriate in this case \"to accommodate all those situations.\" The state argued that there was evidence that both the defendant and his brother, Eliezer, armed\n   themselves with knives during the conflict and that both victims were stabbed multiple times. According to the prosecutor, the jury had the obligation of sorting out the conflicting evidence presented and to determine whether the defendant himself had stabbed both victims or had helped his brother stab the victims \"just by being there with the knife himself.\" The state did not expressly rule out that some combination was also possible. In fact, at no time did the state suggest to the jury that it was proceeding on a theory of alternative liability or that the jury was limited to finding the defendant guilty either solely as a principal or solely as an accessory with respect to the two victims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In her closing argument, defense counsel also noted the conflicting evidence that existed with respect to who had stabbed each of the victims and argued that it was the jury's duty to reach a determination on the basis of the evidence before it. The defense theory was that it was Eliezer who stabbed the victims, not the defendant, but that if the jury found otherwise, it should still find the defendant not guilty because he had acted in self-defense or in defense of others. At no point did the defense argue to the jury that if it found the defendant guilty of assaulting the victims as a principal, it could not also find him guilty of acting as an accessory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In its instructions to the jury regarding the charges against the defendant, the court told the jury that the defendant was \"entitled to and must be given by you a separate and independent determination of whether he's guilty or not guilty as to each of the counts\" charged, and that \"[e]ach of the counts charged is a separate crime.\" The defendant did not object to the instruction given by the court or ask for clarification about whether he potentially could be found guilty on all counts or whether certain counts were pleaded only in the alternative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   With that background in mind, we address the reviewability of the defendant's claim. The defendant acknowledges that he failed to raise any double jeopardy claim before the trial court and, thus, seeks review of his claim pursuant to\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"566558\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/213/233/\">\n    213 Conn. 233\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=567%20A.2d%20823\">\n    567 A.2d 823\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1989).\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   provides that \"[a] defendant can prevail on a claim of constitutional error not preserved at trial only if all of the following conditions are met: (1) the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; (2) the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; (3) the alleged constitutional violation ... exists and ... deprived the defendant of a fair trial; and (4) if\n   subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt. In the absence of any one of these conditions, the defendant's claim will fail.\" (Emphasis omitted; footnote omitted.)

We conclude that the first two prongs of the\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   test have been met because the record before us is adequate to review the defendant's claim and a double jeopardy claim raises an issue of constitutional magnitude.

We, thus, direct our attention to the third prong and whether the defendant's claimed double jeopardy violation exists.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Before turning to our discussion of the law relative to the defendant's double jeopardy claim, it is important to emphasize what the defendant is not claiming. He is not claiming that there was insufficient evidence from which the jury could find him guilty, either as a principal or as an accessory, of assaulting the two victims with the intent to cause serious bodily injury. In other words, he has not argued that there was insufficient evidence from which the jury could conclude that he stabbed\n   the two victims\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   that he engaged in conduct with the intent to aid Eliezer in Eliezer's assault of each of the victims. The claim he makes on appeal is simply that it is constitutionally impermissible under the facts of this case to allow his conviction of multiple counts of assault as to each victim to stand because, in his view, doing so would result in his being punished twice for the same act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \"A defendant's double jeopardy claim presents a question of law, over which our review is plenary.... The double jeopardy clause of the fifth amendment to the United States constitution provides: [N]or shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb. The double jeopardy clause [applies] to the states through the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment. ...

The defendant then shot the victim in the head and went through the victim's pockets, which the court viewed as constituting a separate and distinct act of robbery. Thus, the court concluded that in the course of the single criminal conspiracy, the defendant had participated in two separate and severable crimes that happened close together in both time and physical proximity-an attempted robbery as an accessory and a robbery acting as the principal.

Although accessorial liability for an assault cannot be based solely on a person's presence at the scene, if there is evidence that the person was not merely a witness but also participated in the assault, a reasonable inference may be drawn that the participation aided the principal assailant by, for example, preventing the victim from more easily escaping the fight or by making the victim more vulnerable to the principal assailant's assault.

If, for example, a jury reasonably could find on the basis of the evidence presented that each charged offense was the result of a distinct act of independent legal significance-one committed as a principal and another as an accessory-double jeopardy is not implicated. Because the defendant in the present case was convicted on separate counts of assaulting each of the victims both as a principal and as an accessory, we look to the evidence and the state's theory of the case to determine whether the jury could have reasonably concluded that separate acts underlie each conviction or whether the defendant is being twice punished for the same act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   We first consider whether, with respect to the convictions arising out of the stabbing injuries to Rodriguez, the defendant has demonstrated that the jury could not reasonably have concluded that two distinct acts of criminal conduct were committed that would support its findings of guilt on separate counts alleging first degree assault as a principal and first degree assault as an accessory. We conclude that the defendant has failed to meet this burden.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The evidence at trial reasonably can be construed as establishing at least three separate stabbing incidents involving Rodriguez. First, during the fracas that ensued after Rodriguez intervened to stop the altercation between the defendant and Medina, the defendant stabbed Rodriguez. Second, Eliezer, who also was armed with a knife, then stabbed Rodriguez in the back. Third, after Rodriguez tried to leave the initial skirmish, the defendant pursued Rodriguez into the street and stabbed him again.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The jury, thus, reasonably could have predicated its finding that the defendant committed assault in the first degree as a principal either on the basis of the first or third of these stabbing incidents, each of which was completed by the defendant himself. Even if the defendant were able to convince us that the relatively simultaneous stabbings of Rodriguez by the defendant and Eliezer during the initial outbreak of violence should be treated a single act for purposes of double jeopardy, an argument that we reject for reasons we discuss in addressing the injuries to Tucker, there is no doubt that the subsequent stabbing of Rodriguez by the defendant that occurred after Rodriguez left the initial brawl was a criminal act distinct and separate from the stabbings initially inflicted on Rodriguez by the defendant and his brother.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Furthermore, the jury's finding that the defendant engaged in an assault in the first degree as an accessory could have been predicated on his having aided Eliezer in the second act of stabbing Rodriguez. The jury reasonably could have concluded that the defendant aided and encouraged Eliezer's assault of Rodriguez in any number of ways, including by helping Eliezer to arm himself with a knife and through his own participation in the fight, making it easier for Eliezer to wound Rodriguez.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   See\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12491513,12491514\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/173/952/\">\n    id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (defendant's participation in fight evinces intent to aid perpetrator in assault and supports jury's finding of accessorial liability).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Moreover, as we previously stated, we consider the state's theory of the case in our analysis of whether the\n   alleged transaction logically can encompass separate acts. See\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Porter\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12495122\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/182/625/#p654\">\n    328 Conn. at 661\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12495122\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/182/625/#p654\">\n    182 A.3d 625\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . To the extent that the defendant contends that the state presented the two charges of assault in the first degree as a principal and an accessory as alternative theories of liability, we reject that claim. The state argued that both victims were stabbed multiple times and presented evidence of both assailants stabbing each victim. The state also argued that the evidence supported a finding that the defendant acted as an accessory \"just by being there with the knife himself.\" From the very beginning of trial, the information contained four separate and distinct counts for each charge. At no time did the state suggest to the jury that the charges were alternative theories of liability. Furthermore, the court's jury instruction regarding the four charges reiterated that each charge was separate and distinct, rather than charges in the alternative. Although the trial court did not specifically articulate that the jury could deliver a guilty verdict as to each of the charges, it did not preclude the jury from making such a finding. See\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    King\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=321%20Conn.%20135\">\n    321 Conn. 135\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 154,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=136%20A.3d%201210\">\n    136 A.3d 1210\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016) (\"[a]lthough ... the trial court never explicitly informed the jury that it could deliver a guilty verdict on both charges, it also never instructed the jury that it could find the defendant guilty only on one charge but not the other\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In sum, we conclude with respect to the injuries inflicted on Rodriguez that the acts of stabbing were susceptible of separation into distinct criminal acts for which the defendant could be punished without offending principles of double jeopardy. See\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4344689\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/299/640/#p652\">\n    299 Conn. at 654\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20A.3d%20663\">\n    11 A.3d 663\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Furthermore, such theory comports with the state's theory presented at trial. The defendant has presented no legal precedent that would compel an opposite conclusion. Accordingly, we reject the defendant's claim that his conviction of assault in\n   the first degree as an accessory, as charged in count three of the information, should have been vacated by the trial court because it violated double jeopardy principles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   We turn next to the evidence pertaining to the stabbing injuries inflicted on Tucker, which we acknowledge presents a closer case from a double jeopardy perspective than the assault on Rodriguez because, unlike Rodriguez, all three stabs inflicted on Tucker occurred closer in both proximity and time. Nevertheless, on the basis of our review of the available evidence, we conclude that the jury reasonably could have determined that the defendant was guilty both as a principal actor for the stab or stabs that he personally inflicted on Tucker and as an accessorial actor for intentionally aiding the nearly simultaneous stab or stabs that Eliezer directly inflicted on Tucker.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The defendant argues that if he had acted alone, he could not have been convicted of separate counts of assault on Tucker on the basis of each individual stab that he inflicted during the short duration of the fight, and that the same rationale\n   should bar his conviction for multiple stabs that were inflicted by himself and by an accomplice. In making this argument, the defendant relies on this court's decision in\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Nixon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3408925\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/92/586/#p597\">\n    92 Conn.

We conclude that\n   <em>\n    Nixon\n   </em>\n   is not applicable to the scenario presented in the present case.\n   The defendant argues that\n   <em>\n    Nixon\n   </em>\n   is still controlling despite the fact that it involved only one criminal perpetrator. He does so by relying on the notion that courts generally make no legal distinction between accessorial liability and liability as a principal. See\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Gamble\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4059757\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/119/287/#p297\">\n    119 Conn.

From that doctrinal basis, he asserts that the presence of multiple assailants should have no effect on the application of\n   <em>\n    Nixon\n   </em>\n   . This argument, however, fails to recognize that multiple convictions for the same crime are permitted if they are based on distinct acts that may be performed by more than one person rather than the type of rapid succession of multiple blows by a single perpetrator, on which\n   <em>\n    Nixon\n   </em>\n   was decided.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   It is particularly noteworthy that the defendant does not argue that double jeopardy bars his conviction as a principal for the stabbing of Tucker and as an accessory to the stabbing of Rodriguez, despite those stabbings also having quickly occurred within the context of the same melee. The defendant thus seems tacitly to acknowledge that he properly may be held criminally liable for the actions of his accomplice against a separate victim. It would be illogical to conclude that he would not be liable to the same degree simply on the happenstance that his accomplice targets the same victim that he himself has just assaulted or is simultaneously assaulting. In short, we find the defendant's argument, which is based on his interpretation and conflation of\n   <em>\n    Nixon\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Gamble\n   </em>\n   , unpersuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   This court having resolved that argument, the evidence before the jury was that Tucker was stabbed multiple times during the initial fray. There was evidence that both the defendant and Eliezer were armed with knives. The jury was free to resolve conflicting evidence by concluding that Tucker's injuries were not\n   inflicted by a single assailant, and that both the defendant and Eliezer stabbed Tucker. Under such a scenario, the jury reasonably could have found the defendant liable for assault in the first degree on the basis of his own stabbing of Tucker. Moreover, as it did with Rodriguez, the jury also could have found the defendant liable as an accessory for Eliezer's stabbing of Tucker, a contemporaneous yet separate assault with independent legal significance because the defendant engaged in conduct with the intent to aid Eliezer's assault.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   In sum, because the defendant's multiple punishments for assault as to each victim were premised not on a single criminal act but distinct repetitions of the same crime, the court was not constitutionally required to vacate his conviction of two counts of assault in the first degree as an accessory. Because the defendant has not demonstrated that a double jeopardy violation\n   exists, he cannot prevail under the third prong of\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The defendant next claims that the court improperly instructed the jury on attempted murder and consequently deprived him of a fair trial. The defendant contends that the court's instructions on attempted murder improperly permitted the jury to find him guilty if it found that he had the general intent to fight with a knife without also finding that he had the specific intent to cause death. Specifically, the defendant argues that the court misled the jury by utilizing the phrase \"engaged in anything\" in three instances, reading the full statutory definition of general and specific intent, and failing to adequately define the substantial step element.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The defendant acknowledges that he did not file a request to charge on attempted murder. Furthermore,\n   the defendant did not take exception to the trial court's instructions as given. Nevertheless, the defendant argues that the unpreserved claim of instructional error is reviewable under\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   because it implicates his constitutional right to have the jury properly instructed on all elements of an offense and the record is adequate for review. See part I of this opinion. The state does not dispute that the first two prongs of\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   have been satisfied with respect to this claim, and the state did not assert a waiver pursuant to\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4343690\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/299/447/#p482\">\n    299 Conn. 447\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 482-83,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20A.3d%20942\">\n    10 A.3d 942\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2011). We agree because the record is adequate for review, and, when intent is an element of a crime, a trial court's failure to instruct the jury properly with respect to intent implicates the due process rights of the accused. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    DeJesus\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"831914\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/260/466/#p472\">\n    260 Conn. 466\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 472-73,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=797%20A.2d%201101\">\n    797 A.2d 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2002).

The court instructed the jury as\n   follows: \"The defendant is charged with two counts of attempt to commit murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \"The mental state required for the commission of the crime of murder is that the defendant specifically intended to cause the death of another person.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \"The statute defining attempt reads in pertinent part as follows: A person is\n   guilty of an attempt to commit a crime if, acting with the mental state required for the commission of the crime, he intentionally\n   <em>\n    engaged in anything\n   </em>\n   , which, under the circumstances, as he believed them to be, was an act constituting a substantial step in a course of conduct planned to culminate in his commission of the crime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \"For you to find the defendant guilty of this charge, the state must prove the following elements beyond a reasonable doubt: Element number one, intent ... the first element is that the defendant had the kind of mental intent required for the commission of the crime of murder. The mental state required for the commission of murder is that the defendant specifically intended to cause the death of another person. There is no particular length of time necessary for the defendant to have formed the specific intent to kill. And, a person acts intentionally with respect to a result, when his conscious objective is to cause such a result.\" (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   In defining the second element of attempt, the court instructed the jury using the contested language as follows: \"Element number two ... the second element is that the defendant intentionally\n   <em>\n    engaged in anything\n   </em>\n   , which, under the circumstances, as he believed them to be, was an act constituting a substantial step in a course of conduct planned to culminate in his commission of the crime. In other words, the state must prove both intent and conduct beyond a reasonable doubt to obtain a conviction.\" (Emphasis added.) Finally, the\n   court summarized the elements utilizing the \"engaged in\" phrase as follows: \"So, to sum up, the charge of attempt to commit murder, the state has to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant had the necessary ... intent to commit the crime and that he intentionally\n   <em>\n    engaged in anything\n   </em>\n   which constituted a substantial step in the course of conduct planned to culminate in his commission of the crime under the circumstances, as he believed them to be.\" (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   On appeal, the defendant claims that the court improperly comingled the language from both sections of the attempt statute by utilizing the phrase \"engaged in\" and not the phrase \"did or omitted doing\" from the other subsection of the attempt statute. In the challenged jury instruction, the court utilized the \"engaged in anything\" language, which the defendant claims is related to the impermissible definition of general intent found in \u00a7 53a-3 (11). In addition, the defendant claims that the trial court's recitation of the full definition of intent in \u00a7 53a-3 (11) misled the jury. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \"It is axiomatic that the definition of intent as provided in \u00a7 53a-3 (11)\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   embraces both the specific intent to cause a result and the general intent to engage in proscribed conduct. It has become axiomatic, through decisional law, that it is improper for a court to refer in its instruction to the entire definitional language of \u00a7 53a-3 (11), including the intent to engage in conduct, when the charge relates to a crime requiring only the intent to cause a specific result.\" (Footnote added.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Sivak\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3946796\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/84/105/#p110\">\n    84 Conn.

The state argues that the model jury instruction language was not necessary in guiding the jury, and that the instructions that the court gave properly required it to find that the defendant intended to cause death and whether he intentionally engaged in conduct that constituted a substantial step planned to culminate in his commission of murder. We agree with the state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   After reviewing the instructions in their entirety, we are persuaded that the instructions adequately conveyed to the jury that to find the defendant guilty of attempted murder, the jury must find that he had the specific intent to cause death. Although the court gave the full definition of intent as provided in \u00a7 53a-3 (11) and used the phrase, \"engage in anything,\" at three points in the charge, our review of the entire instruction reveals that it is not reasonably possible that the instructions misled the jury. The words, \"engaged in anything,\" as used by the trial court in the charge on attempt to commit murder did not affect the specific intent requirement; rather, the language referred to conduct constituting a substantial step toward the commission of the crime.

Accordingly, the defendant's claim fails to satisfy the third prong of\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   , as he has not established the existence of a constitutional violation that deprived him of a fair trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The defendant also claims that the court misled the jury by instructing the jurors on the defenses of self-defense and defense of others, as well as on the lesser\n   included offenses of assault in the second degree and assault in the third degree. More specifically, the defendant claims that the court committed reversible error because its instructions on self-defense permitted the jury to consider lesser included offenses if the state failed to disprove self-defense beyond a reasonable doubt. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The defendant failed to preserve this claim at trial and now seeks\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   review. See part I of this opinion. Unlike the prior claim of instructional error, however, the state argues that the defendant waived this claim, pursuant to\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   , supra, 299 Conn. at 482-83,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20A.3d%20942\">\n    10 A.3d 942\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and, thus, is not entitled to review under\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   . We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The following facts are necessary for the resolution of this claim. The trial court provided a thirty-one page draft of the proposed jury instructions to the defendant and the state prior to the charging conference on July 29, 2015. Although the record does not identify the exact date that the parties received the draft, the record is clear that the parties had the draft overnight from July 29 to July 30, 2015. During the charging conference the court discussed with counsel how to guide the jury regarding the consideration of the numerous charges and the lesser included offenses. The court's proposed instructions included explaining to the jury that it is the jury's choice as to what order it deliberates the charges, except for the lesser included offenses, and the court, during the charging conference, specifically stated to the parties, \"I am going to ask you to\n   review that, particularly.\" The court also discussed with counsel the instructions on defense of others and self-defense. The court stated that \"[t]he self-defense and defense of others, the draft ... proposed by [the state] ... is tracked by the recommendation of the proposed charges filed by the defense.\" The discussion included a suggestion about whether the court should\n   utilize \"and/or,\" or, \"or,\" or, \"and,\" in its instruction. The defense suggested \"and/or\" and did not raise any exceptions to the charge as proposed. At the end of the charging conference, the court specifically addressed the self-defense charge and inquired as to whether the evidence indicated that the defendant attacked in defense of another person.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The record indicates that the following morning, the trial court gave a revised copy of the charge to counsel and stated that \"counsel and I had a charging conference here in this courtroom, and I had promised that I would give to each attorney a copy of a revised charge, following our discussions .... While the charges remain very much the same in ... substance, as the ones that I previously presented to defense counsel and the state, there have been some amendments and alterations, and, obviously I will give you, each of you, more time to consider the charges that I've proposed to the jury, if you wish to do that. I anticipate that you will take most of the morning to do the arguments; however, you will have the luncheon recess and as much time thereafter as you wish to review the charges.\" The court then reviewed the proposed changes with counsel on the record. The court reviewed how to guide the jury to consider the numerous charges and the lesser included offenses. stating: \"I've suggested effectively that they should start on ... count five, go through that, consider whether the elements are ... proven; if they find that is the case, consider whether the defense [of] self-defense applies and then continue. In relation to the ... other charges, I've added that they must consider or can consider lesser included offenses. So, I would appreciate it if ... you let me know if you need any time on that.\" The jury was subsequently brought into the court, and the parties conducted closing arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   After the jury was dismissed for the luncheon recess, the defense expressed an issue with one of the state's comments in the closing argument and requested a curative instruction. After the luncheon recess, the parties confirmed that they had no other concerns regarding the revised instructions, and the court discussed the curative instruction requested by defense counsel. The jury was summoned into the courtroom, and the court read the instructions to the jury. The court specifically asked if the parties had any exceptions to the charge, and defense counsel specifically stated, \"I don't have any exceptions.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   \"It is well established in Connecticut that unpreserved claims of improper jury instructions are reviewable under\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   unless they have been induced or implicitly waived.... The mechanism by which a right may be waived ... varies according to the right at stake.... For certain fundamental rights, the defendant must personally make an informed waiver.... For other rights, however, waiver may be affected by action of counsel ... [including] the right of a defendant to proper jury instructions.... Connecticut courts have consistently held that when a party fails to raise in the trial court the constitutional claim presented on appeal and affirmatively acquiesces to the trial court's order, that party waives any such claim [under\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   ].... [W]hen the trial court provides counsel with a copy of the proposed jury instructions, allows a\n   meaningful opportunity for their review, solicits comments from counsel regarding changes or modifications and counsel affirmatively accepts the instructions proposed or given, the defendant may be deemed to have knowledge of any potential flaws therein and to have waived implicitly the constitutional right to challenge the instructions on direct appeal.... [C]ounsel's discussion of unrelated parts of the jury charge at an on-the-record charge conference ...\n   demonstrate[s] that counsel was sufficiently familiar with the instructions to identify those portions of the instructions with which [she] disagreed.

After you've considered all of the evidence in this case, if you find that the state has proven beyond a reasonable doubt each element of the crime, you must go on to consider whether or not the defendant acted in self-defense or defense of others. In this case, you must consider self-defense or defense of others in connection with-with each count of the information and the lesser included offenses you may consider.\" Later in the charge, the court repeated the instructions as to self-defense and suggested a way for the jury to consider the charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Following the repetition of the self-defense and defense of others instruction, the court instructed: \"If ... you ... find that the state has not ... disproved beyond a reasonable doubt at least one of the elements of the defense or has not proven one of the statutory disqualifications, then on the strength of that defense alone, you must find the defendant not guilty, despite the fact that you have found the elements of the crime proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\" The court continued to summarize an example for how to consider the lesser charges: \"In other words, you consider, for\n   example, assault in the first degree, only if you acquit the defendant of that charge, either because you do not find the state has proven the elements of that charge beyond a reasonable doubt or you find the state has failed to ... disprove ... the defenses of self-defense and/or defense of others, and so that you acquit the defendant on that charge, then you may consider assault in the second degree; you're going to go through the same analysis for that lesser included offense, if you acquit the defendant of that charge ... you then shall consider the charge of assault in the third degree.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The next day, the court reinstructed the jury about how to deliberate and stated that \"while I anticipate that [your] findings in relation to self-defense and/or the defense of others, will probably be the same in both the substantive and the lesser included offenses, you must include ... that issue in your consideration of each charge, if appropriate.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   \"An appellate court addressing a claim of plain error first must determine if the error is indeed plain in the sense that it is patent [or] readily [discernible] on the face of a factually adequate record, [and] also ... obvious in the sense of not debatable.... This determination clearly requires a review of the plain error claim presented in light of the record. Although a complete record and an obvious error are prerequisites for plain error review, they are not, of themselves, sufficient for its application.... [T]he plain error doctrine is reserved for truly extraordinary situations [in which] the existence of the error is so obvious that it affects the fairness and integrity of and public confidence in the judicial proceedings.... [I]n addition to examining the patent nature of the error, the reviewing court must examine that error for the grievousness of its consequences in order to determine whether reversal under the plain error doctrine is appropriate. A party\n   cannot prevail under plain error unless it has demonstrated that the failure to grant relief will result in manifest injustice.... [Previously], we described the two-pronged nature of the plain error doctrine: [An appellant] cannot prevail under [the plain error doctrine] ... unless he demonstrates that the claimed error is both so clear and so harmful that a failure to reverse the judgment would result in manifest injustice....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   \"It is axiomatic that, [t]he plain error doctrine ... is not ... a rule of reviewability.

Specifically, the prosecutor argued: \"[Mendez]: Eliezer started giving her a hard time. A lot of the women that were in that group say it was Eliezer that started first to be aggressive, verbally. [The defendant] mushed her in the face and had her in a headlock. [The defendant] struck [Medina] and she was two feet away. She signed three statements that night, indicating that [the defendant] stabbed [Tucker]. She can confirm\n   that [the defendant] stabbed [Tucker]. You can listen to the testimony of witnesses; her testimony was short, give a listen to her testimony if you so desire. It was very crisp and, sort of, very confidently stated about what she knows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   \"[Adames]: It started with Eliezer and [Mendez]. She was present at the scene. She knows [Tucker] and [the defendant], signed three statements that very night identifying [the defendant] as the person who ... stabbed [Tucker], that very night....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   \"In court, she said she did not see the stabbing; however, she's right there. She would know what occurred. These girls know what occurred here.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Additionally, on rebuttal, the prosecutor read from Adames' testimony and stated: \"So, there is some evidence, in which you can infer that [the defendant] stabbed [Tucker].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   The defendant argues that this argument was improper because there was no evidence in the record about the content of Mendez' three signed statements and no evidence that Mendez saw the defendant stab Tucker. Further, the defendant argues that the prosecutor improperly argued that Adames knew what happened, when she explicitly denied seeing anything. In response, the state argues that the prosecutor properly summarized the testimony of each witness. The state further argues that the prosecutor presented fair inferences that could be drawn from Adames and Mendez' testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   We look to the testimony to determine whether the prosecutor properly referred to facts in evidence. At trial, Mendez testified that she provided three signed statements to the police in which she described what she observed on the night of the altercation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mendez also provided the following testimony about what she saw when the defendant and Tucker interacted during\n   the fight: \"I saw quick contact, I'm not able to say that I saw the knife in [the defendant's] hand, but I did see, like, because we were, like, two feet away from each other, and then [Tucker] picked up his pants to, like, square up to fight, and [the defendant] came quick (demonstrating), boom, but I didn't see anything in his hand because it was so fast.... I don't think he really felt it, until afterward and that's when he said, sis, I think, he's stabbing me, and then I picked up his sweater and then I saw the blood ....\" When asked if she saw the defendant with a knife, Mendez responded, \"I didn't see him with it in his hand, but I can confirm that it was for sure him that stabbed [Tucker] because I was two feet away from him and when I saw this fast movement, that's approximately two minutes later, [Tucker] told me that he got stabbed.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Adames also testified that she had given three statements to the police. Adames acknowledged that in all three of her statements she indicated that the defendant stabbed Tucker. On cross-examination, Adames testified that she did not see the\n   defendant stab Tucker.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   When the prosecutor inquired on redirect if it was still her position that the defendant stabbed Tucker, she replied, \"[y]eah.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   A review of the record plainly shows that the prosecutor did not comment on, or suggest an inference from, facts not in evidence, or present matters that the jury had no right to consider. Accordingly, the defendant has failed to establish that the prosecutor's comments were improper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   2\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   The defendant contends that the prosecutor argued facts not in evidence when he stated: \"Junito's brother\n   is Joesenier.\" The state argues that the comment was made in the context of making an inference drawn from other evidence. We agree with the state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   The prosecutor argued in closing argument: \"Liybin Fernandez, Liybin's a tricky witness .... Both brothers had knives. Knives were retrieved from the motor vehicle. There's the Junito issue. Listen to the testimony again from Liybin, if you so desire, and ask yourself: did he just get the name inverted? ... Eliezer, Junito, remember, three of the girls say Eliezer was arguing, they all say Eliezer started the verbal argument. Well, if Eliezer is Junito, it would be accurate for Liybin to say, well, yeah, Eliezer was arguing with the girls. Who stabbed the black individual, he was asked that question, he said, Junito's brother. Junito's brother stabbed the black individual, Junito's brother is Joesenier.... So, you may want to relisten to his testimony again.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   On the basis of our review of the record, there is evidence that could give rise to a reasonable inference that Junito's brother is Joesenier. During Fernandez' testimony, he was asked if Junito was in the courtroom. In response, Fernandez stated, \"[t]hat guy looks like him,\" and identified the defendant. Fernandez also testified, after refreshing his recollection with his prior statement, that \"Junito's brother\" stabbed Tucker.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Although there is conflicting evidence that Eliezer was also nicknamed Junito,\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   because there is sufficient evidence in the record that could give rise to a reasonable inference that Junito is Eliezer and that, therefore, Junito's brother is the defendant, the prosecutor's statement in his closing argument was proper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   3\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   The defendant last argues that the prosecutor referred to facts not in evidence when discussing the\n   testimony of two police officers who witnessed the fight and called 911. During rebuttal, the prosecutor stated, \"[y]ou know, the indication was that we can rely on the testimony of the trained police officers that saw it. I would argue to you that those trained police officers did not believe that this was a self-defense situation.\" The defense objected to this portion of the state's closing argument, and the court issued a curative instruction. The state does not contest that the statement was improper, but argues that there is no prejudice from this comment because the defense objected to this portion of the state's closing argument and, after consulting with both parties, the trial court issued a curative instruction.\n   Even if we assume arguendo that the prosecutor's argument was improper, it is the defendant's burden to establish that the impropriety violated his due process right to a fair trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   See\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=320%20Conn.%2022\">\n    320 Conn. 22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 37,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=128%20A.3d%20431\">\n    128 A.3d 431\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015) (\"when a defendant raises on appeal a claim that improper remarks by the prosecutor deprived [him] of his constitutional right to a fair trial, the burden is on the defendant to show, not only that the remarks were improper, but also that, considered in light of the whole trial, the improprieties were so egregious that they amounted to a denial of due process\" [internal quotation marks omitted] ).
