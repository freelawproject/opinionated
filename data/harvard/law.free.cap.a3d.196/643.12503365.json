This Court previously explained that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   [i]n his Complaint, Guntrum alleged that Citicorp did not honor a credit disability insurance policy (hereinafter \"the insurance policy\"). According to Guntrum, he purchased the insurance policy from Citicorp at the same time he secured a mortgage from Citicorp in January of 2003. The mortgage, in the amount of $47,478.80, was secured by Guntrum's [former] residence, located in New Bethlehem (hereinafter \"the Property\"). Guntrum used the mortgage funds to make improvements to the Property. After the improvements, [according to Guntrum,] the Property was appraised at $115,000. The insurance policy was meant to provide a temporary waiver of Guntrum's required mortgage payments if he became disabled. Guntrum alleged in his Complaint that Citicorp did not honor the insurance policy when he became disabled in November of 2005 .... As a result of Citicorp's refusal to honor the insurance policy, the Property was foreclosed upon, and Guntrum therefore lost all of his equity in the Property. Citicorp subsequently purchased the Property at a sheriff's sale. In his Complaint, Guntrum claimed relief for[,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   ,] breach of contract ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Guntrum v.

The trial court scheduled a non-jury trial, solely on the issue of damages, for February 5, 2010 (hereinafter \"the damages trial\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Importantly to this appeal, neither Citicorp nor its counsel attended the damages trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Citicorp also did not file any pre-trial documents. At the damages trial, Guntrum testified to the value of the Property and the amount of his damages. There was no additional evidence or expert testimony presented at the damages trial to establish the value of the Property. However, Guntrum testified that an unidentified appraiser had, at some point, assessed the value of the Property at $115,000.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   N.T., 2/5/10, at 8;\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 5 (wherein Guntrum's counsel represented to the trial court that \"Citicorp appraised [the Property] when they foreclosed on it[ ] ... at or about [$115,000]\"; however, this appraisal was not disclosed in discovery or made part of the record).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   By an Opinion and Order entered on March 12, 2010, the trial court awarded Guntrum damages in the amount of $125,558, and thoroughly explained its reasons for the amount of the award. In sum, the court credited Guntrum's position that, after he had made substantial improvements to the Property, its value was $115,000,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Opinion and Order, 3/12/10, at 3, and concluded that he was entitled to both general and consequential damages.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 5-7.

Therefore, [Guntrum] lost the entire value of the [Property], not simply the equity, as a consequence of [Citicorp's] breach of contract.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 7. The trial court also found that, as of the date of the damages trial, Guntrum had incurred approximately $10,500 in rent payments and residential storage fees.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 6. However, the trial court declined to award Guntrum requested punitive damages, treble damages, and attorneys' fees, finding that he had failed to present sufficient evidence to support these damages.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 7-10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Ten days after the March 12, 2010 Opinion and Order, Citicorp's counsel filed a Petition to Open the default judgment. The trial court granted this Petition on May 21, 2010, and thereafter vacated the default judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial court eventually entered\n   summary judgment in favor of Citicorp. Following Guntrum's appeal of this ruling in 2015, we held, in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Guntrum I\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , that the trial court had abused its discretion in granting Citicorp's Petition to Open and entering summary judgment in its favor.

Two days later, Citicorp filed a \"Motion for Post-Trial Relief and/or Remittur\" (hereinafter the \"Post-Trial Motion\"). Therein, Citicorp argued that it was entitled to a new trial on damages because the trial court's damages award was not supported by competent evidence, and was based on speculation. On September 27, 2017, the trial court denied the Post-Trial Motion. Citicorp then timely filed a Notice of Appeal, followed by a court-ordered Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b) Concise Statement of errors complained of on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Citicorp presents the following issues for our review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   1. Whether the trial court's award of $125,558 in damages to [Guntrum] should be vacated because said award was unsupported by any competent, credible, or admissible evidence, was manifestly excessive under the circumstances, and bore no reasonable relation to the injuries allegedly suffered by [Guntrum?]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   2. Whether the trial court abused its discretion in denying [Citicorp's] [ ] Post-Trial [Motion] ... because - in light of the trial court's erroneous ruling awarding damages in the amount of $125,558 to [Guntrum] - [Citicorp] was entitled to a new trial on damages[?]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   3. Whether the trial court committed an error of law in ruling that it lacked the ability to modify the damages award pursuant to [Citicorp's] [ ] Post-Trial [Motion] ...[?]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Brief for Appellant at 5. We will address these issues simultaneously, as Citicorp does in its brief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   After trial, and upon the written motion for post-trial relief filed by any party, a trial court may order a new trial as to all or any of the issues.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Pa.R.C.P. 227.1(a). When considering a challenge to the denial of a motion for a new trial, we apply the following standard of review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   We will reverse a trial court's decision to deny a motion for a new trial only if the trial court abused its discretion. We must review the court's alleged mistake and determine whether the court erred and, if so, whether the error resulted in prejudice necessitating a new trial. If the alleged mistake concerned an error of law, we will scrutinize for legal error. Once we determine whether an error occurred, we must then determine whether the trial court abused its discretion in ruling on the request for a new trial. An abuse of discretion exists when the trial court has rendered a judgment that is manifestly unreasonable, arbitrary, or capricious, has failed to apply the law, or was motivated by partiality, prejudice, bias, or ill will.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Vetter v.
