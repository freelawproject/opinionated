The gravamen of the petitioner's claim is that Harrigan previously represented Levin in an unrelated criminal matter prior to the petitioner's trial. According to the petitioner, this representation resulted in an actual conflict of interest, which, had the petitioner known, he would not have waived, but instead would have sought to avoid by requesting the appointment of different counsel. Due to this alleged conflict, the petitioner claims that (1) Harrigan failed to impeach Levin with his pending criminal charges during cross-examination and (2) because he was not advised that Harrigan would not impeach Levin with his pending criminal charges on cross-examination, the petitioner did not knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waive the conflict of interest despite having been canvassed by the court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \"Our Supreme Court has established the proof requirements where a habeas corpus petitioner claims ineffective assistance of counsel because of a claimed conflict of interest. Where ... the defendant claims that his counsel was burdened by an actual conflict of interest ... the defendant need not establish actual prejudice.... Where there is an actual conflict of interest, prejudice is presumed because counsel [has] breach[ed] the duty of loyalty, perhaps the most basic of counsel's duties. Moreover, it is difficult to measure the precise effect on the defense of representation corrupted by conflicting interests.... In a case of a claimed conflict of interest, therefore, in order to establish a violation of the sixth amendment the defendant\n   has a two-pronged task. He must establish (1) that counsel actively represented conflicting interests and (2) that an actual conflict of interest adversely affected his lawyer's performance....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \"The [United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit] has honed this test further. Once a [petitioner] has established that there is an actual conflict, he must show that a lapse of representation ... resulted from the conflict.... To prove a lapse of representation, a [petitioner] must demonstrate that some plausible alternative defense strategy or tactic might have been pursued but was not and that the alternative defense was inherently in conflict with or not undertaken due to the attorney's other loyalties or interests....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \"An actual conflict of interest is more than a theoretical conflict. The United States Supreme Court has cautioned that the possibility of conflict is insufficient to impugn a criminal conviction.... A conflict is merely a\n   <em>\n    potential\n   </em>\n   conflict of interest if the interests of the defendant may place the attorney under inconsistent duties at some time in the future.... To demonstrate an actual conflict of interest, the petitioner must be able to point to\n   <em>\n    specific instances\n   </em>\n   in the record which suggest impairment or compromise of his interests for the benefit of another party.... A mere theoretical division of loyalties is not enough.... If a petitioner fails to meet that standard, for example, where only a potential conflict of interest has been established, prejudice will not be presumed, and the familiar\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   prongs will apply.\" (Citations omitted; emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Burgos-Torres\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Correction\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12416220\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/142/627/#p634\">\n    142 Conn.

On October 18, 2007, Harrigan filed an appearance in the petitioner's criminal case for the burglary and assault at 103 Waterville Street, and on February 28, 2008, was appointed as counsel in his criminal case for the burglary at 29 Waterville Street. Approximately nine months later, on November 26, 2008, Harrigan filed an appearance for Levin in three unrelated criminal cases.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Less than four months later, thereafter, on March 6, 2009, he filed a motion to withdraw as counsel in Levin's cases, which the court granted on March 20, 2009. Levin testified as an eyewitness in the petitioner's trial on November 17, 2009. In sum, Harrigan's representation of\n   the petitioner and Levin overlapped for approximately four months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   At the petitioner's criminal trial on November 17, 2009, Levin, an eyewitness to the assault, testified that he saw a young Hispanic male, carrying a baseball bat, chasing an older black male, whom he later identified in a photographic array as the petitioner, as they ran past his driveway. Levin stated that as the Hispanic male got close to the petitioner, the petitioner hit\n   the Hispanic male once with a tire iron causing him to fall to the ground. Levin testified that he did not see the Hispanic male hit the petitioner with the baseball bat or swing the bat.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Marshall\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4070862\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/132/718/#p721\">\n    132 Conn.

Our review of the record reveals that Levin's testimony at the petitioner's November 17, 2009 criminal trial is substantially similar to the statement that he gave to the police shortly after witnessing the assault on July 26, 2007. We note that his police statement was given prior to his arrest on his own criminal charges in May, 2008. See footnote 3 of this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   At the habeas trial, in response to the respondent Commissioner of Correction's question as to whether Harrigan felt that there was a conflict at the time of the petitioner's trial due to his past representation of Levin, Harrigan testified: \"No.... I think I represented Mr. Levin probably three months. The case that\n   ... I had was basically paired to his other cases that [another public defender] had. We were kind of tagging along. So there really wasn't a lot of things going on with the case while I represented him other than getting pretrials and [the other public defender] trying to work out his situation. When I realized that he was a witness in [the petitioner's] case, I made the motion to withdraw. So I really didn't have a lot of contact with Mr. Levin.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Nevertheless, the petitioner claims that Harrigan's conflict of interest adversely affected his representation of the petitioner because he failed to introduce evidence of Levin's pending criminal charges during cross-examination. The petitioner argues that \"[b]y not impeaching Levin with his pending charges, trial counsel allowed a crippling blow to the claim of self-defense that could have been countered.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   It is important to note that the petitioner's claim of ineffective assistance is premised on his trial counsel's failure to impeach Levin with his pending criminal charges on cross-examination because of an actual conflict of interest. The petitioner is not claiming a violation of the confrontation clause under the sixth amendment to the United States constitution or a\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   violation.

For example, the petitioner has not provided any evidence, at all, that Harrigan received confidential information during his representation of Levin, a former client, which would have affected the petitioner's defense or limited Harrigan's ability to effectively cross-examine Levin. We reiterate that a mere theoretical division of loyalties is not enough.

In addition, even if Harrigan had confidential information, maintaining Levin's confidences did not adversely affect Harrigan's performance because the information necessary to cross-examine Levin, as the petitioner suggests, was otherwise available to Harrigan. Generally, pending criminal charges are a matter of public record, and thus Harrigan was not precluded from questioning Levin about his pending charges during cross-examination because that information had become generally known. See General Statutes \u00a7 1-215 ; Rules of Professional Conduct 1.9 ; see also\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Public Safety\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Freedom of Information Commission\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=312%20Conn.%20513\">\n    312 Conn. 513\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=93%20A.3d%201142\">\n    93 A.3d 1142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Furthermore, we reiterate that Levin's testimony at the petitioner's criminal trial was substantially similar to the statement that he gave to the police shortly after witnessing the assault on July 26, 2007, meaning that there was a sound tactical reason, apart from the alleged conflict, for Harrigan not to cross-examine Levin with the pending charges.

The clothing that [the petitioner] was wearing when he got\n   arrested a few hours later was totally different than what was described by [Lourdes] Hernandez.\" He additionally stated that, although the petitioner's criminal acts at 103 Waterville Street were violent, it was also \"part of the reason why we decided to go with a court trial rather than a jury [trial].\" Harrigan further opined that \"given the facts of what [the petitioner] was wearing at the time he was arrested just a few hours later ...
