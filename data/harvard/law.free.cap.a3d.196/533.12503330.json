The rate of pay, however, was incorrectly calculated, as it failed to recognize Mr. Gang's status as a \"public safety officer,\" which entitled him to higher compensation. Four years later he filed a \"Request for Document Correction,\" whereupon the Commission issued an amended award that retroactively increased his rate of pay. On judicial review, the Circuit Court for Montgomery\n   County affirmed the Commission's decision. Montgomery County timely appealed and presents us with the following question, which we have rephrased\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-10\">\n   Did the Commission err in retroactively modifying appellee's award of workers' compensation?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   For the reasons stated below, we shall reverse the judgment of the circuit court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Appellee Peter Gang was a correctional officer employed by Montgomery County,\n   appellant. On September 17, 2011, Gang was accidentally injured at a facility and thereafter filed a workers' compensation claim. Following a hearing on April 26, 2012, the Workers' Compensation Commission issued a decision on May 2, 2012, which found Gang suffered a permanent partial disability and awarded him compensation at the rate of $157 a week, for 70 weeks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The order, however, failed to recognize his status as a \"public safety officer,\" under \u00a7 9-628 of the Labor and Employment Article, which entitled him to a higher rate of pay. Both parties agree the May 2, 2012 Order was error and that Gang initially received compensation at the incorrect rate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Neither party filed a motion for rehearing\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   or appeal to the circuit court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Almost four years later, on March 22, 2016, a \"Request for Document Correction\" was filed by Gang's counsel regarding the 2012 case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The request alleged that Gang was paid at an incorrect rate. The Commission, on March 25, 2016, issued an amended award, retroactively modifying his compensation to $314 a week. Appellant objected to the Commission's actions because it had not been notified and filed a \"Request for Rehearing\" on April 6, 2016. Appellee then filed a request, on April 13, asking that the Commission \"withdraw the Document Correction filed on 3/22/16, strike the Order issued on 3/25/16 and set this case in for hearing on the issue of the correct weekly permanent partial disability rate in the 5/2/12 Order.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Commission denied the County's \"Request for Rehearing.\" The County then filed a second \"Request for Rehearing\" on April 21, 2016, and argued that in light of appellee's withdrawal of his initial Document Correction, the Commission should \"rescind the order dated 3/25/16 that implemented that document correction and the denial of the rehearing request dated April 19, 2016.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Following a hearing on June 27, 2016, the Commission issued an order that affirmed the March 25, 2016 Order, finding it was a proper use of the Commission's \"continuing jurisdiction\" under Labor and Employment Section 9-736(b) of the Maryland Code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Appellant filed a petition for an on the record judicial review in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, on July 26, 2016,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   and appellee filed a cross-appeal for a\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review on August 9. Appellee also filed a Motion to Dismiss the Petition\n   for Judicial Review on October 18, 2016, which was opposed by appellant and denied by the court at a hearing on December 13, 2016. An on the record review of the Commission's\n   findings was held on April 19, 2017, where counsel presented argument. The circuit court affirmed the decision of the Commission, memorialized in an order entered May 25, 2017. Appellant then brought this timely appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   With an \"appeal on the record of the Commission...no new evidence is taken nor is any fresh fact-finding engaged in.

No language in \u00a7 9-736 expressly authorizes such a change or readjustment of an award already paid. Nevertheless, appellee contends the Commission's actions under \u00a7 9-736(b) are not restricted by \u00a7 9-736(a). We disagree, as such an interpretation would render \u00a7 9-736(a), which limits rate adjustments to future application only and requires a change of condition, meaningless. As stated by the Court in\n   <em>\n    Sealy\n   </em>\n   , the Commission's revisory power is \"not unlimited.\" In light of longstanding principles of statutory interpretation and the lack of plain language, we decline to\n   infer a legislative intent not specified in the statute and, thus, hold the Commission erred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   We disagree with appellee's characterization of the Commission's actions as merely \"correcting a clerical error.\" The record does not substantiate this assertion and further, the Commission's action in 2012 constituted a final award. No action was taken by appellee to appeal or have the Commission reconsider its decision. Thus, under the circumstances of this case, four years after the final award, the Commission's authority was limited to readjustment of a future rate of compensation upon a worsening or diminution of condition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Appellant argues that appellee's filing of a \"Request for Document Correction\" was improper because that form \"can only be used when the parties agree that a Commission form needs to be corrected\" and the County was not notified about the filing in the present case. Thus, they did not consent. Appellee admits he failed to adhere to COMAR 14.09.03.13(a), which states \"[a] party seeking modification of a prior finding or order shall file the form captioned Motion for Modification and simultaneously file an Issues form identifying the issue to be resolved.\" He concedes that he did not file a \"Motion for Modification\" form and the County did not give its consent. He argues that \"[w]hen justice so requires, the Commission may waive strict compliance with these regulations.\" COMAR 14.09.01.06. The record in this case, however, is devoid of any indication that the Commission waived strict compliance. We hold that even if it did waive strict compliance, the Commission did not have the statutory authority to modify or readjust the award retroactively.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Finally, appellant argues the Commission's ruling was erroneous because \"it extended the statute of limitations for another five years.\" Appellee avers the Commission \"did not circumvent the statute of limitations\" because he filed for a modification within five years of his last payment. We agree with appellant. The Commission's actions impermissibly extended the five-year time limit, and thus, exceeded its statutory\n   authority.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Seal v.
