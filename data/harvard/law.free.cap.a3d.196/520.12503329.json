Moylan, Jr. (Senior Judge, Specially Assigned), JJ.\n </judges>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <author id=\"p-8\">\n   Moylan, J.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   A revocation of probation can be ordered because of triggering misbehavior that occurs not only during a period of active probation (the far more common case) but also because of misbehavior occurring before the active probationary period has even begun (the rarer case). Because the overwhelming majority of revocation cases, however, are based on violations occurring while on active probation, there has resulted the inevitable linguistic slippage of the name for that most common instance of the phenomenon being casually misused to denote the larger phenomenon itself, of which it is but a part. \"Violation of probation\" is thus being used as casual shorthand for \"revocation of probation.\" The specific usurps the generic. It is an easy overgeneralization to lapse into, akin to referring to all refrigerators as Frigidaires, to all tissue as Kleenex, or to all soda pop as Coke. Such slack usage, fortunately, is aggravating but seldom fatal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In this case, we are dealing with a revocation of probation that was not based on a violation of active probation. Because \"violation of probation\" is a more chronologically restrictive term than \"revocation of probation,\" we must steel ourselves against using so potentially confusing and anachronistic a term. Revocation is our subject and our only subject. The behavior that triggers revocation, as happened here, may occur in jail as well as on the street.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A Pattern Of Recurring Domestic Violence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On November 18, 2011, the appellant, Derek McKinney, entered guilty pleas to one count of first-degree assault and one count of using a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence before Judge Robert A. Greenberg in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County. Pursuant to a\n   plea agreement,\n   Judge Greenberg sentenced the appellant to a term of 25 years' imprisonment on the assault conviction with all but 10 years suspended, to be followed by a period of probation for three years. For the handgun conviction, the sentence was a concurrent one of 20 years, five years without the possibility of parole, and with all but 10 years suspended. From the initial statement of facts offered in support of the guilty plea and from the subsequent sentencing procedure, it was evident that a heavy concern of both Judge Greenberg and the State was the future safety of the assault victim, Lily Mona Hakemian.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Ms. Hakemian's vehicle had been stopped in rural Montgomery County at 1:30 on the morning of May 17, 2011, for a minor traffic infraction. The appellant was the front-seat passenger and Ms. Hakemian was driving. When asked for identification, the appellant had none and gave his name as Steve Johnson. A computer check informed the stopping officer that Ms. Hakemian had an outstanding protective order against the appellant. Ms. Hakemian, moreover, appeared to be upset and to have been crying. The appellant was arrested for having violated the protective order. He had a strong odor of alcohol on his person and had watery bloodshot eyes. From the passenger floorboard where the appellant had been sitting, the police recovered a loaded .357 Magnum Taurus revolver. The revolver was registered to Ms. Hakemian. Ms. Hakemian informed the court that she had purchased the gun for the appellant at his request because he was prohibited from doing so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The police learned from Ms. Hakemian that she had earlier gone to the appellant's residence in Bethesda that evening. The statement in support of the guilty plea recounted:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   They went into the home. They went into his bedroom.\n   <em>\n    The defendant had possession of the 357 Magnum. He told her to lie face down on the bed, placed the gun to her head and pulled the trigger, cycling the cylinder in the revolver.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    He\n   </em>\n   then ordered her to do his laundry, and in the laundry room, pointed the gun at her and\n   <em>\n    instructed her to place the barrel of the gun in her mouth.\n   </em>\n   The State would have\n   presented in evidence that she believes she observed several live rounds of ammunition in the cylinder.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   A short time later, he and she both left the Southport Drive residence together and went to the (unintelligible) Shed Ale House (phonetic sp.) where they consumed alcohol and had some food, and to Quincy's (phonetic sp.) where the defendant consumed additional alcohol.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    They\n   </em>\n   then left the, left Quincy's and\n   <em>\n    went to the McDonald's restaurant in Gaithersburg\n   </em>\n   at Montgomery County. When they pulled into the parking lot, to the rear of McDonald's, in the Vicinity of the Sport Authority,\n   <em>\n    he told her to get out of the vehicle. She did, and he fired a round from the revolver into the air.\n   </em>\n   They got back in the car, went through the drive-through, and while in the drive-through,\n   <em>\n    while ordering food, he pointed the gun at her and again directed her to place the barrel of the gun in her open mouth.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   (Emphasis supplied).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   When Judge Greenberg asked if Ms. Hakemian did so, the prosecutor responded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   [THE PROSECUTOR]: Yes, sir. The weapon was placed in her mouth on both occasions, making contact with her person.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   The State would have - and from the McDonald's restaurant, then, the vehicle\n   went on to Route 355 north, where it was, Sergeant Lubson observed it at that intersection, Your Honor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Judge Greenberg then accepted the guilty plea. As the court then turned to the actual sentencing, Judge Greenberg set out in meticulous detail every aspect of the sentence in all regards. His final words to the appellant were unequivocally clear:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    \"You are to have no contact with Lily Hakemian.\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Even before that pronouncement, Ms. Hakemian had informed the court that she had visited the appellant while the charges were pending on a weekly basis and had spoken to\n   him by telephone on numerous occasions. It was precisely to curtail such contacts that the prosecutor had requested of the jail authorities that the appellant be placed on administrative segregation for a period of 60 days. There was, moreover, a significant exchange between Judge Greenberg and Ms. Hakemian as to whether she wished to be permitted to have contact with the appellant while he was in jail. It was clear that pre-probationary contact between the appellant and Ms. Hakemian was a subject of serious consideration. Indeed, even before announcing an absolute prohibition on any contact with Ms. Hakemian, Judge Greenberg had engaged in a lengthy dialogue with the appellant about that very subject.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   THE COURT: Let me first say that these cases pose particular difficulties to the Court because we have two people who obviously had some degree of affection for one another, and it sounds like still do. But I've come to learn, both from hearing these cases and from some training judges get about this problem that we call domestic abuse, and this is the kind of case, frankly, that bears all the earmarks of an extremely volatile situation. When you love someone, you don't ask them to put a loaded handgun in their mouth, nor do you put one in your own mouth in their presence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   So, I'm, with all respect to Ms. Hakemian, I'm not really so concerned with whether she wants to see you or talk to you or not, because I wasn't born yesterday, you know,\n   <em>\n    I didn't just fall off the turnip truck\n   </em>\n   , as they say; I'll be very surprised if Ms. Hakemian doesn't make some effort to contact you, but\n   <em>\n    it isn't going to happen on my watch\n   </em>\n   , if you know what I mean. You two have a relationship that is going to result in severe injury or death of one or both of you.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   I can't tell Ms. Hakemian what she should do with her life. Those are choices that she needs to make, and to some extent, they're choices that you're going to need to make;\n   <em>\n    but to suggest that it would be appropriate for me to pass a probationary order here that allows\n   </em>\n   her to contact you, and more significantly, allows\n   <em>\n    you to contact her, is something I'm just not going to do.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   THE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   THE COURT: I think Mr. Helfand does have a good point with regard to the probation and the condition and the terms of it, and we'll get to that in a second.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   But this is a very frightening case from a number of standpoints. And as I said, if Ms. Hakemian decides that she wants to contact you in prohibition of this Court's order, that's something that I would encourage her not to do, but she's not the subject of the probation order; you are. So, I just want to tell you that\n   <em>\n    I'm going to\n   </em>\n   prohibit her,\n   <em>\n    prohibit you from having contact with her.\n   </em>\n   But understand that even in spite of her misguided intentions,\n   <em>\n    if she calls you\n   </em>\n   , even though she's the one that did it, like she's the one that wrote the letters, and I have no doubt she did, she is the one\n   that comes to see you, I have no doubt she did,\n   <em>\n    she's getting you in trouble.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   THE DEFENDANT: Uh-huh.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   THE COURT: So, if someone finds out about it, frankly,\n   <em>\n    I'm not going to really care too much whether she called you or not. If she tries to get hold of you or whatever, you need to tell her, \"No.\" I'm sorry to break up the relationship you have, but that happened back in May of 2011.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   (Emphasis supplied).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    Petition For The Revocation Of Probation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The appellant failed, however, to heed Judge Greenberg's order and to discontinue any contact with Ms. Hakemian. It was four years later, on September 20, 2015, that the State filed its Motion to Prevent Intimidation of Victim/Witness Pursuant to Section 9-304 of the Criminal Law Article. A hearing date on the motion was set for November 4, 2015. On that date, the appellant appeared without counsel. Judge Greenberg postponed the case so that the appellant could obtain the services of the Office of the Public Defender. On February 3, 2016, the State filed, pursuant to Maryland Rule 4-347, a Petition for Revocation of Probation. A joint motion by the State and the appellant requested that both motions be\n   considered at the same hearing. There were then numerous postponements of the hearing date on what became entitled as the State's Motion for Appropriate Relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On May 27, 2016, the appellant's Consent Motion to Continue represented that he needed time to listen to all of the telephone recordings that the State had provided him in discovery. The recordings were of threatening phone calls the appellant had made to Ms. Hakemian from jail. By letter on December 29, 2016, Judge Greenberg requested updated information on the possible parole/early release date of the appellant. The judge rescheduled the postponed hearing for February 21, 2017, and expressed his concern \"for the victim's safety at the present time should [the appellant] be released before the February hearing.\" From Judge Greenberg's expression of concern for Ms. Hakemian's safety, it was clear that he did not want the appellant's probation even to begin. He was obviously looking for a way to secure Ms. Hakemian's safety against any risk posed by the appellant's even being on the street. It was clear that probation had not yet even begun.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   For the appellant now to claim, therefore, that he had no idea that Judge Greenberg's final order at the sentencing hearing that he was to have \"no contact with Lily Hakemian\" had any applicability at any time before his probation actually began is disingenuous. At the aborted hearing on November 4, 2015, when the appellant showed up without counsel, the State explained to the appellant that it had filed its motion to prevent him from intimidating Ms. Hakemian. It also explained that the appellant could be subject to the revocation of his probation if it were found that he had committed a criminal offense even before his probation began. Judge Greenberg, moreover, stressed the importance for the appellant to retain counsel and he cautioned the appellant not to say anything at that time. He further warned the appellant that he would be at risk if he had contact with Ms. Hakemian. This was pre-probationary behavior that was being discussed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The ultimate hearing on the State's motion to revoke probation took place on February 21, 2017. The State produced\n   evidence of five collect phone calls that the appellant had made from jail to Ms. Hakemian. In the course of those calls, the appellant blamed Ms. Hakemian for ruining\n   his life by \"snitching\" to the police about his putting the gun in her mouth. The appellant blamed her for his incarceration. He threatened, \"If you want me to kill [you], keep running your mouth.\" The appellant characterized himself as \"a sociopath\" and threatened to make her \"pay for the 10 years [she] put him in jail.\" He cautioned her to enjoy the next couple of years because they were going to be her last. He threatened to \"murder\" her, to \"burn [her] ass up until [her] fucking heart stops,\" and to dump her body \"in the river.\" The appellant ordered Ms. Hakemian to answer his phone calls and he told her, \"I'm going to wind up beating your fucking brains in, when I get home I will take care of your ass. I'm not only abusive, I'm going to murder you.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Judge Greenberg found that the calls placed by the appellant were not simply threatening in nature to the assault victim with whom the appellant had been cautioned and admonished by the court to discontinue contact, but were also literal violations of two criminal statutes. One was Section 32-19 of the Montgomery County Code of Ordinances, dealing with \"Obscene, indecent or threatening language over telephone.\" That ordinance provides in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   If any person\n   <em>\n    shall use obscene or indecent language or shall threaten any person with physical harm\n   </em>\n   or shall make indecent proposals to any person by means of the telephone he shall be subject to punishment for a class A violation as set forth in section 1-19 of chapter 1 of the County Code.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   (Emphasis supplied).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The other violation was of a Maryland statute, Criminal Law Article, Sect. 3-804, which provides in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   (a) A person may not use telephone facilities or equipment to make:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   (2) repeated calls with the intent to annoy, abuse, torment, harass, or embarrass another[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The appellant was, moreover, in violation of two earlier protective orders. Judge Greenberg then reimposed the original sentences of November 18, 2011, with no portion of the sentences being suspended and with no probationary period to follow.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    The Contentions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Having been granted leave to appeal the revocation of probation on January 10, 2018,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   the appellant now contends:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   I. THE LOWER COURT LACKED THE AUTHORITY TO FIND THAT MR. MCKINNEY VIOLATED PROBATION BEFORE IT COMMENCED.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   II. HOLDING A VIOLATION OF PROBATION HEARING UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THIS CASE VIOLATED MR. MCKINNEY'S RIGHT TO DUE PROCESS.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   III. THE LOWER COURT IMPOSED AN ILLEGAL SENTENCE.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    Probation May Be Revoked At Any Time\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The appellant's key contention is simplistic. He asserts that no one, certainly not he himself, can be guilty of \"violat[ing] probation before it commenced.\" If he means, as he clearly seems to say, that one cannot commit an act (the act that is the violation) at a time that has not yet come to pass, he is simply stating a truism. A tautology! Such a statement is self-evidently\n   true. We cannot defy Newtonian physics. We cannot defy Aristotelian logic. We may not move at will in and out of a time warp. We may not manipulate the fourth dimension. That would, indeed, be jumping the gun.\n   Fortunately, no such anachronism occurred in this case. Ordinarily, a violation of probation is something that takes place outside the prison gates after a term of active probation has begun and the probationer is on the street. Not only did no such thing happen in this case, but no one remotely suggested that any such thing happened. The critical event, the timing of which must be closely examined, was not a violation of active street probation but the antecedent revocation of an award of probation that had not yet begun.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The indisputably controlling law is the opinion of Judge McAuliffe for the Court of Appeals in\n   <em>\n    Matthews v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2057589\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/304/281/\">\n    304 Md. 281\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2057589\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/304/281/\">\n    498 A.2d 655\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1985). In\n   <em>\n    Matthews\n   </em>\n   the new criminal offense, violation of the controlled dangerous substance laws, that triggered the revocation of probation occurred, as here, before the period of active probation had actually begun and while Matthews was still serving his prison sentence (albeit on work release). At the very outset of the opinion,\n   <em>\n    Matthews\n   </em>\n   announced what would be its ultimate holding:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   We here decide that ... Appellant's probation was properly revoked upon proof of\n   <em>\n    criminal activity occurring between the grant of probation and its formal commencement.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2057589\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/304/281/\">\n    304 Md. at 283\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2057589\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/304/281/\">\n    498 A.2d 655\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis supplied).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Matthews's new criminal offense had occurred at a time before his probation had actually begun but that did not in any way inhibit the authority of the court to revoke that probation before it had begun.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   Having determined that Appellant's probation could not lawfully begin until his actual release from imprisonment, we turn to\n   <em>\n    the question of whether his right to probation may be revoked for criminal acts committed after sentencing but before commencement of probation\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   Article 27, \u00a7 641A(b) provides that \"[t]he court may revoke or modify any condition of probation or may reduce the period of probation.\"\n   <em>\n    This broad grant of authority\n   </em>\n   to revoke probation\n   <em>\n    does not contain any limitation as to when the power may be exercised\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    we therefore find no\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    statutory bar to the revocation of probation before it has begun.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2057589\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/304/281/\">\n    304 Md. at 288-89\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2057589\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/304/281/\">\n    498 A.2d 655\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis supplied).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Judge McAuliffe's opinion quoted with approval, at\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2057589\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/304/281/\">\n    304 Md. at 290\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2057589\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/304/281/\">\n    498 A.2d 655\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , from\n   <em>\n    Martin v.

The appellant asserts that \"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <em>\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Donaldson\n   </em>\n   ... made clear that the authority granted by Sect. 641A(b) to 'revoke or modify any condition of probation'\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   applies when the probationer has\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   violated his probation.\" (Emphasis in appellant's brief).

We find nothing remotely to suggest that the holding of\n   <em>\n    Matthews\n   </em>\n   before us in this case has been eclipsed or otherwise diminished in any regard by judicial opinion or rule of\n   court or statute.

That Which We Call A Rose By Any Other Name Would Smell As Sweet\"\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   In this case, to be sure, all parties consistently referred to a \"violation of probation\" rather than to a \"revocation of probation.\" All parties, however, were reading off the same page and no one was for a moment confused. The revocation hearing took place on February 21, 2017, well before the period of actual on-the-street probation was to begin. No word of protest or objection was uttered by the appellant about an ostensibly surrealistic chronology. Appellant, appellant's attorney, prosecuting attorney, and trial judge all knew precisely what the issue was before the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The violations in question, the collective basis for the revocation, were five specific telephone calls made on May 2, 2014; on May 5, 2014 (two calls); on October 4, 2014; and on March 7, 2015, from the appellant to Ms. Hakemian. All of those calls were made from the jail and were recorded by the jail authorities. They were all made before any period of active\n   probation had begun. The substance of those calls was heard in full by Judge Greenberg and was the basis for his decision to revoke probation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   It was not the labeling of the procedure but the undergirding significance of the appellant's conduct that dictated the result and that confirms the correctness of the result. That undergirding reality inheres in the fundamental purpose of the phenomenon called probation. When a sentencing judge awards a present or future grant of probation in place of some or all of a prison sentence, the judge's discretionary decision in that regard is based on the judge's assessment that the probationer is a good risk for such more lenient treatment. If, however, the judge is subsequently persuaded, generally by the subject's conduct, pre-release or post-release, that the subject is actually a bad risk in terms of future behavior, the judge may revoke the probation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   If the probationer is already serving on probation, the probation will be terminated. If the probationary period has not yet begun, the award of probation will be revoked in advance of its beginning. The judge's assessment of risk is precisely the same whether made pre-release or post-release. Judge McAuliffe well stated the rationale of the revocation process in\n   <em>\n    Matthews\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2057589\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/304/281/\">\n    304 Md. at 293\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2057589\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/304/281/\">\n    498 A.2d 655\n   </extracted-citation>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   <em>\n    The commission of a new crime\n   </em>\n   during the interval between the imposition of sentence and the effective date of probation\n   <em>\n    may furnish proof that a defendant cannot conduct himself in conformity with societal standards and he may rightfully forfeit his freedom as a result.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   (Emphasis supplied).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The mere labels of \"pre-release\" or \"post-release\" should not be permitted to obscure the undergirding unity of what is decided. We must not get tripped up by the labeling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    An Alternative Conceptualization\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The apparent paradox of one's violating probation at a time when one is not yet on probation has a certain simplistic allure. The paradox fades, however, on closer examination. We\n   can easily avoid the riddle with an alternative conceptualization of the legal status we are dealing with.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   \"Probation\" is a broad enough concept to embrace within it more than one connotation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   When a sentencing judge pronounces an award of probation, probation in its larger sense has begun, regardless of whether probation connotes the immediate status of the defendant (probation\n   <em>\n    in esse\n   </em>\n   ) or is simply the promise or expectation of a future probation (probation\n   <em>\n    in potentia\n   </em>\n   ) once the active part of the prison sentence has been served. If the judge subsequently learns that the probation is actually not a good risk, it is of no consequence whether that revelation comes while the probation is still\n   <em>\n    in potentia\n   </em>\n   or whether it is already\n   <em>\n    in esse\n   </em>\n   . In either event, it will be revoked. To say, therefore, carefully and precisely, that probation in its larger sense may be revoked even before it has become probation\n   <em>\n    in esse\n   </em>\n   is no paradox at all. We must, however, beware of shifting connotations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <strong>\n    Notice Of February 21, 2017, Hearing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   The hearing at which Judge Greenberg listened to the five recorded telephone calls the appellant had made from jail to Ms. Hakemian and at which Judge Greenberg revoked the appellant's probation took place on February 21, 2017. The appellant's second contention is that he was denied due process because his counsel was not given adequate notice of that February 21, 2017, hearing to decide whether this probation should be revoked.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   This contention is based entirely on the appellant's misreading of the trial record, including the docket entries, and was not pursued by the appellant at oral argument. It was based on appellant's mistaken belief that the State's Petition for Violation of Probation was not filed until February 3, 2017, a mere three weeks before the revocation hearing. That mistaken reading is reflected in Footnote 8 and Footnote 9, both on page 19, of the appellant's appellate brief. The Petition for Violation of Probation, however, was actually filed one year earlier, on February 3, 2016. The appellant was represented by Theresa Chernosky of the Public Defender's Office as of\n   December 22, 2016, a full 14 months before the hearing in question. The State's petition was, to be sure, styled as a \"State's Notice for Appropriate Relief,\" but there was no mistaking its contents, its purpose, and its allegations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Under the circumstances, it is pointless to recite the numerous motions to continue the hearing, including Consent Motions, Joint Motions, and motions by the appellant alone so that he would have time to listen to all of the recorded telephone calls that the State had provided him in discovery. The contention is palpably without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   The appellant's companion contention that \"he was denied an impartial arbiter\" has not been preserved for appellate review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   <strong>\n    The Legality Of The Sentence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   On March 16, 2017, the appellant filed a Motion to Correct an Illegal Sentence pursuant to Maryland Rule of Procedure 4-345(a). On March 29, 2017, Judge Greenberg denied that motion without a hearing. On April 18, 2017, the appellant appealed from that denial. It is that appeal which is now before us as the appellant's third contention. Maryland Rule 4-345(a) provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n   (a)\n   <em>\n    Illegal Sentence\n   </em>\n   .

Did The Sentence Honor The Plea Agreement?\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   The appellant specified that the court ultimately imposed an illegal sentence\n   on him in two regards. The first is a claim that the sentence excluded the terms of the binding plea agreement. When Judge Greenberg on February 21, 2017, revoked the appellant's probation, that revocation reinstated the terms of the sentences as originally pronounced on November 18, 2011. Because of the revocation of probation, the original sentences were to be served in full, with no portion of them being suspended. When Judge Greenberg pronounced the appellant's sentence originally on November 18, 2011, he did so in the following terms:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-114\">\n   THE COURT: So, this is my sentence in this case. On Count 1, first degree assault,\n   <em>\n    I'm going to sentence you to 25 years\n   </em>\n   in the Division of Correction. I'm going to suspend all but 10 years, which will commence on May 17th, 2011. I'm assuming you've been incarcerated since this happened?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-115\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-116\">\n   On Count 3,\n   <em>\n    I'm going to sentence you to 20 years\n   </em>\n   in the Maryland Division of Corrections. Suspend all but five years, commencing on May 17th, 2011.\n   <em>\n    That sentence will run concurrently to Count 1.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-117\">\n   After your release, you will be on three years of supervised probation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   (Emphasis supplied).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   It was everyone's understanding that the sentences then imposed accurately reflected the plea bargain. It is our holding, moreover, that those sentences did indeed accurately reflect the plea bargain.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   There was no murmur of objection or protest by anyone.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   It was a logical and symmetrical sentence that made eminently good sense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   When on February 21, 2017, following the revocation of the appellant's probation, Judge Greenberg formally re-announced the full and unsuspended sentences, he did so in terms essentially verbatim with his original sentencing of November 18, 2011, absent the suspension and imposition of probation:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-121\">\n   THE COURT: So, I'm going to impose the following sentence. I'm going to\n   <em>\n    on Count 1, sentence you to 25 years\n   </em>\n   at the Department of Corrections, commencing on May 17, 2011. And\n   <em>\n    as to Count 3, 20 years\n   </em>\n   , commencing on the same date, which is\n   <em>\n    concurrent to Count 1\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   (Emphasis supplied).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   We hold that the appellant was not subjected to any illegal sentence pursuant to Rule 4-345(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Back To The Future\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   As his second subcontention under his third contention, the appellant harkens back to an earlier contention. He now claims that his sentence, to wit, the revocation of probation (assuming,\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   , without deciding whether that would qualify as a sentence for Rule 4-345(a) purposes), would be inherently illegal if it were based upon an ostensible violation that would have been impossible to commit\n   in real time, to wit, his earlier complaint about a violation of probation before probation had commenced. His argument is based clearly on the apparent time paradox.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-126\">\n   This statute permits\n   <em>\n    a charge of violation of probation to be brought only if the violation occurred \"during the period of probation.\"\n   </em>\n   Thus,\n   <em>\n    the lower court had no authority to revoke Mr. McKinney's probation because no violation occurred during the period of probation.\n   </em>\n   Even assuming,\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   , that a court has the authority to revoke probation before it commences, ...\n   <em>\n    the court could not revoke probation before it commenced as this constituted a breach of the plea agreement.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   (Emphasis supplied).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   That argument seems to be that the sentence (the revocation of probation) would be illegal because the State's evidence was not sufficient (the violation did not occur at the right time) to support the conviction. Even assuming,\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   , every word of that proposition to be true, it would classically, under well-established Rule 4-345(a) principles, be a mere procedural illegality that would not be an inherent illegality in the sentence itself. It would not, therefore, support the appellant's third contention.
