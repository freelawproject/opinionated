Duffy, appeals from a final judgment of the Superior Court granting the defendants's motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 41(b)(2) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. This matter came before this Court on November 8, 2018, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised should not be summarily decided. After considering the arguments set forth in the parties's memoranda and at oral argument, we are convinced that cause has not been shown. Thus, further argument or briefing is not required to decide this matter. For the reasons outlined below, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    Facts and Travel\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The pertinent facts of this case are as follows. Sometime between December 2007 and June 2008,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   plaintiff was arrested, and allegedly assaulted, by uniformed officers of the West Warwick Police Department. Subsequently, on January 8, 2010, plaintiff, through his then-attorney, filed the instant action in Kent County Superior Court against Michael J. Nye and Stephen J. Blais-two officers of the West Warwick Police Department-and the Town of West Warwick. Service, however, was not completed at that time. More than five years elapsed before plaintiff retained a new attorney in January 2015; and, on February 24, 2015, plaintiff had copies of the complaint and summonses served upon defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In response, on March 5, 2015, defendants, in lieu of filing an answer, and in accordance with Rule 41(b), filed a motion to dismiss based on lack of prosecution and failure to serve process upon defendants within the time required in Rule 4(l) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. In their memorandum in support of that motion, defendants argued that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   \"Plaintiff effectuated personal service of the [d]efendants more than five (5) years after the complaint was filed in the Superior Court and close to seven (7) years\n   after the alleged incident. As such, pursuant to Rule 4 ( [l] ), this matter should be dismissed for failure to obtain service.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The defendants went on to state: \"In addition, under Rule 41(b)(1), the [p]laintiff has failed to prosecute this action for over five (5) years.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   A hearing on the motion was held on April 27, 2015, at which defendants reiterated the arguments that they had advanced in their memorandum. In response, plaintiff highlighted his previous attorney's failure to serve process within the preceding five years. He further noted that the complaint had been served immediately after plaintiff retained new counsel. The plaintiff admitted, however, that both the hiring of new counsel and service of the complaint were accomplished after the five-year period set forth in Rule 41(b)(1) had elapsed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Despite the lapse of time, plaintiff argued that the \"savings section in the statute\" allowed the motion justice to reinstate the case, \"upon a showing of preventing injustice.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Finally, plaintiff averred that this case fit the factual scenario required for the action to proceed, because he had served process and was ready to engage in discovery. The motion justice inquired into the reason for the delay in service, to which plaintiff's new attorney replied: \"[I]t's through no fault of Mr. Duffy himself, but his previous counsel who-.\" The motion justice cut short this argument, stating: \"Mr. Duffy acts through his attorney. If Mr. Duffy has a problem, he gets into a problem because of the neglect of his attorney * * *.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In the end, the motion justice dismissed the action, with prejudice, under Rule 41(b). He based his ruling on the length of time that the case had lain dormant, noting that \"both parties at some point in time after an incident occurred and after suit is filed have a right to think that, you know, things should have been settled.\" The court cited to our opinion in the case of\n   <em>\n    Norcliffe v.

On May 4, 2015, an order entered granting defendants' motion to dismiss with prejudice; and, on May 12, 2015, plaintiff timely appealed to this Court. However, we remanded the case for entry of final judgment; and, on September 8, 2016, final judgment entered.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff then submitted an amended notice of appeal on March 9, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \"It is well settled that abuse of discretion is 'the applicable standard to be used by [this Court] when reviewing a [motion] justice's dismissal of a civil action for lack of prosecution,' pursuant to Rule 41(b).\"\n   <em>\n    Cotter v.

We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Rule 41(b)(2) states: \"On motion of the defendant the court may, in its discretion, dismiss any action for failure of the plaintiff to comply with these rules or any order of court,\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   for lack of prosecution as provided in paragraph (1) of [Rule 41(b) ].\" (Emphasis added.) Involuntary dismissal for any reason under Rule 41(b), \"other than a dismissal for lack of jurisdiction or for improper venue or for lack of an indispensable party, operates as an adjudication upon the merits[,]\" and, thus, is a dismissal with prejudice. Super.R.Civ.P. 41(b)(3). Accordingly, Rule 41(b)(2) clearly grants discretion to a motion justice to dismiss a case with prejudice in one of two manners, which have differing requirements under our caselaw.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   First, \"[i]n considering a dismissal motion [under Rule 41(b)(2) for lack of prosecution], a trial justice must weigh the equities between the parties.\"\n   <em>\n    Cotter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6823692\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/130/164/#p168\">\n    130 A.3d at 168\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Coates\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7281850\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/18/554/#p558\">\n    18 A.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   560 ). \"On the one hand is the court's need to manage its docket, the public interest in the expeditious resolution of litigation, and the risk of prejudice to the defendants from delay, and [o]n the other hand, there is the desire to dispose of cases on their merits.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7281850\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/18/554/#p558\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Coates\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7281850\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/18/554/#p558\">\n    18 A.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   560 ). \"When weighing the equities, the court 'need not view the evidence in a light most favorable to the plaintiffs.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7281850\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/18/554/#p558\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Bergeron v.
