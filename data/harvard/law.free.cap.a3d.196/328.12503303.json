The defendant claims that, in rendering summary judgment as to liability in the plaintiff's favor with respect to the plaintiff's foreclosure complaint, the court erred in concluding that a genuine issue of material fact did not exist with respect to her special defenses of equitable estoppel, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, promissory estoppel, unclean hands, and breach of contract, all of which pertain to the conduct of the plaintiff's loan servicer, Chase Home Finance, LLC (Chase), in denying the defendant's application for a loan modification under the federal Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Additionally,\n   the defendant claims that the\n   court improperly rendered summary judgment in the plaintiff's favor on her counterclaim sounding in breach of contract.

The defendant filed a substitute answer and special defenses. The defendant alleged in her special defenses that (1) the plaintiff is equitably estopped from proceeding with the foreclosure action because the plaintiff instructed her to default on her note and mortgage obligations, resulting in her credit rating being negatively impacted; (2) the plaintiff breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing by instructing her to default on her note and mortgage obligations without\n   informing her that a default would result in adverse consequences such as acceleration of the debt; (3) the plaintiff is precluded by promissory estoppel from pursuing a foreclosure action because the plaintiff induced the defendant to default and promised her the offer of a loan modification if she made three trial period payments,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the defendant relied on that promise to her detriment because she never received the promised offer; (4) the plaintiff is guilty of unclean hands because, although she qualified for a loan modification upon completion of her trial period payments, the plaintiff did not offer her a loan modification, but instead, placed her in a forbearance program without her consent; and (5) the plaintiff breached a contract between the parties by failing to offer the defendant a loan modification after she performed her part of the bargain by making the three agreed upon trial period payments.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In her substitute counterclaim, the defendant alleged that the plaintiff breached a contract between the parties when it failed to offer her a loan modification after the defendant performed her obligations under the contract by making her three trial period payments and continued to meet all program eligibility requirements during the trial period. The plaintiff filed an answer to the defendant's counterclaim on September 29, 2015, in which it posited that the alleged contract did not comply with the statute of frauds, and that the counterclaim is legally insufficient and barred by the doctrines\n   of waiver and estoppel. On November 12, 2015, the plaintiff moved for summary judgment as to liability on its complaint, claiming that the defendant's special defenses are insufficient because they are not supported by any evidence and cannot defeat the plaintiff's prima facie showing that it is entitled to foreclose on the subject property. The plaintiff also argued that the defendant's counterclaim is barred by the statute of frauds and has no factual basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In support of its motion for summary judgment, the plaintiff provided the court with the affidavit of Michael Piz, a document control officer with the plaintiff's subsequent loan servicer, Select Portfolio Servicing, Inc.,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   the contents of which are summarized as follows. On December 15, 2006, the defendant executed an adjustable rate note to pay Washington Mutual Bank, FA (Washington Mutual), the principal sum of $480,000, payable with interest, including late charges, costs, and expenses. The indebtedness evidenced by the note was secured by a mortgage, which also is dated December 15, 2006, on the defendant's property at 630 Cook Hill Road in Cheshire. Washington Mutual endorsed the note in blank and on or about September 9, 2009, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, as receiver of Washington Mutual, executed an assignment of the mortgage to the plaintiff. The assignment later was corrected due to a clerical error in the name of the plaintiff in the original assignment. Copies of the note, mortgage, assignment, and corrected assignment were annexed to the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment as exhibits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 2009, the defendant defaulted pursuant to the terms of the note and mortgage, and the plaintiff notified her of the default. The notice of default advised\n   that if the amount required to cure the default was not received within sixty days, immediate acceleration of all moneys due under the note and mortgage could be declared without further notice or demand. Piz further avers that the defendant failed to cure her default and, as a result, the plaintiff elected to accelerate the total amount of the indebtedness due and owing by commencing this action. No part of the outstanding indebtedness has been paid by the defendant. Subsequently, the defendant received multiple notices of her default, including notices on November 30, 2009, January 21, 2010, and May 10, 2010.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Piz further alleges that the plaintiff is in physical possession of the original loan documents, including, without limitation, the original note endorsed in blank, and was in possession of the same at the time this action was commenced.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Piz also addresses in his affidavit what transpired regarding the defendant's application for a HAMP loan modification. On July 15, 2010, the plaintiff sent the defendant a letter offering her a trial period plan (TPP). A copy of this letter is annexed to the motion for summary judgment. It reads, in pertinent part: \"You are approved to enter into a [TPP] under [HAMP]. This is the first step toward qualifying for more affordable mortgage payments.... To accept this offer, you must make new monthly 'trial period payments' in place of your normal monthly mortgage payment.... After all trial period payments are timely made and you continue to meet all program eligibility requirements, your mortgage would then be permanently modified. You\n   will be required to execute a permanent mortgage modification agreement that we will send you before your modification becomes effective. Until then, your existing loan and loan requirements remain in effect and unchanged during the trial period. If each trial payment is not received by us in the month in which [it] is due, this offer will end and your loan will not be modified under [HAMP].\" (Emphasis omitted.) The letter also includes answers to \"frequently asked questions,\" one of which advised the borrower that \"[y]our credit score may be affected by accepting a [TPP] or modification.\" In response to a question, \"[w]hen will I know if my loan can be modified permanently and how will the modified loan balance be determined?\" the letter provided, \"[o]nce we confirm you are still eligible for [HAMP] and you make all of your trial period payments on time, we will send you a modification agreement detailing the terms of the modified loan.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Piz further avers in his affidavit that in or about May and June, 2011, the defendant sent the plaintiff evidence of her combined income with her then \"spouse,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   and that, on the basis of the defendant's profit and loss statement and pay stubs, the plaintiff calculated that the defendant and her \"spouse\" had a combined monthly income of $13,826.35 and a total housing expense of $3423.94. Thus, the defendant's \"housing ratio,\" or housing expense as a percentage of household income, was 24.76 percent. Under the then applicable HAMP guidelines, the borrower's current monthly mortgage payment could not be less than 31 percent of the borrower's\n   household monthly gross income to qualify for a loan modification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Consequently, the plaintiff concluded that \"[b]orrower [h]ousing [r]atio exceeds the maximum for our lending program.\" In addition, the plaintiff submitted a handbook for the HAMP program, version 3.2, which indicated that one of the requirements under the program was that \"verified income documentation must confirm that the borrower's monthly mortgage payment ratio prior to the modification is greater than 31 percent.\" On July 15, 2011, the plaintiff sent the defendant a letter explaining that the defendant had been\n   denied a permanent modification because her \"housing ratio\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   exceeds the maximum allowed for the modification program.\" The plaintiff sent another letter to the defendant on July 28, 2011, explaining in greater detail why the defendant's housing ratio made her ineligible for a loan modification under HAMP. Although the reference in the July 15, 2011 letter to a \"housing ratio that exceeds the maximum allowed\" is confusing, the July 28, 2011 letter clearly explains why the defendant's housing expense was not a large enough percentage of her household income to qualify for a loan modification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The defendant filed her objection to the motion for summary judgment on January 11, 2016, essentially asserting that the evidence relevant to her special defenses and counterclaim, which involve the plaintiff's course of conduct in considering and ultimately denying her loan modification application, creates a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the plaintiff should be permitted to proceed to foreclosure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The defendant attached her own affidavit to her objection to the motion for summary judgment, summarized as follows. She faithfully submitted her mortgage payments in a timely fashion and without incident until late 2009. In the beginning of 2009, she was laid off from her job and forced to use her cash reserves and savings to make her payments. She became concerned about her continued ability to make her payments. In the fall of 2009, she contacted her loan servicer, Chase, to discuss mortgage assistance options and was told by a representative that Chase would not speak to her unless or until she stopped making her payments. As a result of her reliance on this information, she stopped making any payments commencing on October 1, 2009. The plaintiff did not follow through with its promise to help her with mortgage assistance, and she had to retain a law firm to help her. Starting in March, 2010, and continuing until July, 2010, she supplied the plaintiff with all of the financial information it requested of her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The defendant attached additional documentation to her objection to the plaintiff's summary judgment motion, focusing on her participation in the TPP and the plaintiff's denial of her application for a loan modification. After the defendant retained counsel, the plaintiff finally sent the defendant a letter dated July 15, 2010, congratulating her and stating that she was \"approved to enter into a [TPP] under the [HAMP] (program),\" and explaining that \"[t]his is the first step toward qualifying for more affordable mortgage payments.... After all trial period payments are timely made and you continue to meet all program eligibility requirements, your mortgage would then be permanently modified. You will be required to execute a permanent mortgage modification agreement that we will send you before your modification becomes effective. Until then, your existing loan and loan requirements remain in effect and unchanged during the trial period.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Under the plan, the defendant was to make three consecutive monthly payments of $3373.86 on August 1, September 1, and October 1, 2010.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In her affidavit, the defendant avers that she timely made all three payments under the TPP and some additional trial payments\n   into 2011.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiff continued to send her letters on different letterhead and from different locations, asking her for the same financial information and thanking her for her interest in a HAMP modification. According to the defendant, to be safe, she kept resending the requested information to the plaintiff. She also avers that she received two notices that her request for unemployment forbearance had been received even though she had never made any such request. Finally, the defendant avers that the plaintiff, approximately nine months after the TPP had ended, sent her a letter dated July 15, 2011, which stated that \"[w]e received your request for a permanent loan modification .... We are unable to offer you a modification through the federal [program] .... This decision was confirmed through a second level of review.... We are unable to offer you a modification because your housing ratio exceeds the maximum allowed for the modification program.\" The letter also recommended other possible options for the defendant to avoid foreclosure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   As part of her objection to the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment, the defendant also submitted internal documents of the plaintiff and a number of other letters sent to her by the plaintiff. The plaintiff does not dispute the existence or accuracy of these documents or letters, which reveal the following. In or about June and July, 2010, the defendant submitted to the plaintiff\n   a loan modification application with supporting documents. The plaintiff reviewed these submissions, which included bank statements from the defendant's business from February through May, 2010, and a contribution letter and pay stubs from the defendant's fianc\u00e9 from May and June, 2010.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   The analysis, called an \"MOD Summary Report,\" revealed that the defendant's housing ratio was 37.892 percent, which was within HAMP's limits for approval of a loan modification. As a result, the plaintiff forwarded the defendant a letter offering her a TPP. In August, 2010, the plaintiff sent the defendant a letter requesting a packet of financial information regarding her loan modification request. In September, 2010, the plaintiff sent the defendant another letter stating that it was still waiting for the requested package of information to be returned. In and about February and March, 2011, according to an updated MOD Summary Report, the plaintiff again reviewed the defendant's application, determined that her housing ratio was 31.208 percent, which was still within HAMP limits, and, the defendant claims, approved her pending application for a loan modification. On March 10, 2011, the plaintiff entered the following messages into its Loss Mitigation Tracking Steps system: \"Final Review Complete,\" \"Order/Prepare Mod Docs,\" and \"QA Final Approved,\" which corresponded to a charge of $2838.92 to the defendant's bank account. There is no dispute that the plaintiff never sent the defendant any permanent loan modification documents. The Loss Mitigation Tracking Steps later reflect that on July 11, 2011, the defendant was found ineligible for a loan modification.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   In its reply to the defendant's opposition to the motion for summary judgment, the plaintiff claimed that despite the defendant's allegations of the plaintiff's internal generation of alleged final loan modification documents, the defendant admits she never received or accepted the final loan modification documents. The plaintiff also argued that the defendant's special defenses do not relate to the making, validity or enforcement of the note, and that her counterclaim does not have a sufficient connection to the making, validity or enforcement of the note and mortgage to satisfy the \"transaction test\" in Practice Book \u00a7 10-10.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On May 23, 2016, the court held a hearing on the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment. After oral argument, the defendant filed a supplemental brief in opposition to the motion for summary judgment on May 23, 2016. Following the hearing, the court summarily granted the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment. On July 8, 2016, the defendant filed a motion for clarification of whether the court's order granting the summary judgment motion pertained to her counterclaim. The court issued an order on September 8, 2016, stating that its ruling included rendering summary judgment on the defendant's counterclaim. On September 12, 2016, the court rendered judgment of strict foreclosure with a law day of December 5, 2016. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Thereafter, on October 27, 2016, the defendant filed a motion for articulation of the court's granting of the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment. The defendant requested that the court articulate its \"findings of fact and conclusions of law upon which the trial court relied\n   in granting the motion for summary judgment as to the special defenses and counterclaim of the defendant ....\" (Emphasis omitted.) On February 15, 2017, the court issued an articulation. In its articulation, the court determined that \"the plaintiff has established the absence of a genuine issue of material fact regarding the prima facie case for foreclosure,\" and that none of the defendant's special defenses raised a genuine issue of material fact that might defeat the plaintiff's cause of action. The court also concluded that summary judgment was appropriate on the defendant's breach of contract counterclaim. The court determined that the undisputed facts show that the parties did not enter into a new contract and that the defendant's counterclaim regarding the denial of her application for a loan modification did not present an issue that satisfied the transaction test in Practice Book \u00a7 10-10. Finally, the court ruled that even if the transaction test were satisfied, the counterclaim was barred by the statute of frauds, General Statutes \u00a7 52-550, because the amount due on the note was $480,000, which exceeds the threshold amount of $50,000 for loan agreements in the statute, and thus any contract for a modification needed to be in writing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   We first set forth the applicable standard of review. \"In seeking summary judgment, it is the movant who has the burden of showing the nonexistence of any issue of fact.... Although the party seeking summary judgment has the burden of showing the nonexistence of any material fact ... a party opposing summary judgment must substantiate its adverse claim by showing that there is a genuine issue of material fact together with the evidence disclosing\n   the existence of such an issue.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Rosenfield\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    I.

We agree with the defendant that her special defense of unclean hands raises a genuine issue of material fact, and therefore, summary judgment in favor of the plaintiff should not have been rendered. We disagree, however, that the remainder of the defendant's special defenses precluded summary judgment in the plaintiff's favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The defendant claims in her fifth special defense that the plaintiff violated the doctrine of unclean hands and should be precluded from proceeding with the foreclosure action because the plaintiff did not offer her a permanent loan modification under the program despite the fact that, pursuant to regulations published by the United States Department of the Treasury, she was entitled to a permanent modification upon the completion of her three trial payments. She argues that instead, the plaintiff placed her into a mortgage forbearance program for which she did not apply. She contends that the plaintiff's internal records indicate that it approved her for a loan modification under the program in March, 2011, months before it mailed her the denial letter. She argues that a number of documents in evidence suggest that the plaintiff approved the defendant for a loan modification in March, 2011, when she had a housing ratio of 31.2 percent. She notes that the plaintiff only appended evidence to its motion for summary judgment that supported its version of the narrative while failing to make any argument or even reference to its own internal processes, evidence of which raises more questions than answers. We agree with the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Because an action to foreclose a mortgage is an equitable proceeding, the doctrine of unclean hands may\n   be applicable. \"It is a fundamental principle of equity jurisprudence that for a complainant to show that he is entitled to the benefit of equity he must establish that he comes into court with clean hands.... The clean hands doctrine is applied not for the protection of the parties but for the protection of the court.... It is applied not by way of punishment but on considerations that make for the advancement of right and justice.... The doctrine of unclean hands expresses the principle that where a plaintiff seeks equitable relief, he must show that his conduct has been fair, equitable and honest as to the particular controversy in issue....

It raises a question as to why the plaintiff failed to send the defendant a permanent loan modification agreement if she was approved for a loan modification in March, 2011. The court rejected the defendant's special defense of unclean hands and characterized it as another \"inducement to default\" special defense, similar to the defendant's equitable estoppel special defense. We, however, conclude that the nature of the allegations in this special defense are distinguishable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The defendant submitted as evidence a copy of a supplemental directive issued on January 28, 2010, by the Treasury Department to provide guidance to loan servicers in making HAMP eligibility determinations for borrowers currently participating in a TTP. This directive notes a change from a prior directive issued in 2009, which gave loan servicers the option of placing a borrower into a TPP on the basis of verbal financial information obtained from the borrower, subject to later verification during the TPP. Effective on or after June 1, 2010, a loan servicer was instructed to evaluate a borrower for HAMP only after the servicer received an initial package that included a request for modification and an \"affidavit (RMA) form,\" an Internal Revenue Service form 4506-T or 4506T-EZ to request transcripts of tax returns, and documentation of income that may not be more than ninety days old as of the date the initial package is received by the servicer. If the loan servicer received an incomplete initial package or needed additional documentation to verify the borrower's eligibility and income, the servicer had to send the borrower an \"Incomplete Information Notice\" that lists the additional required verification documentation. Loan servicers were required to use a two step process for HAMP modifications. In referencing conversion from trial to permanent modification, the directive stated: \"Following underwriting and a determination\n   that the borrower qualifies for a HAMP trial modification, servicers will place qualified borrowers in a trial period plan by preparing and sending a [TPP] [n]otice to the borrower describing the terms of the trial modification and the payment due dates. Borrowers who make all trial period payments timely and who satisfy all other trial period requirements will be offered a permanent HAMP modification.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In this case, the plaintiff produced no evidence that it made a determination as to the defendant's eligibility for a HAMP modification at the end of her TPP, which was at the end of the month in which she made her third payment, October, 2010. Furthermore, there is evidence in the defendant's submissions that the defendant's application was approved by the plaintiff in March, 2011, and the plaintiff has produced no evidence to explain why it failed, at that time, to complete the process and forward to the defendant an offer of a permanent loan modification. In addition, there is no evidence that the plaintiff ever sent the defendant the required \"Incomplete Information Notice\" that her documentation\n   was incomplete, as required by the directive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The plaintiff's failure to establish that it adhered to the Treasury Department's directives, which appear to encourage that final determinations on whether to offer the borrower a loan modification be made before the end of the TPP, and the plaintiff's failure to provide an explanation as to its apparent internal approval of the loan modification in March, 2011, which was not communicated to the defendant, create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the defendant can prevail on her special defense of unclean hands. When viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the defendant, the unexplained length of time it took the plaintiff to deny the defendant an offer of a permanent modification, almost twenty months, commencing with the date\n   it told her that the only way to explore modification of her loan was to stop paying in November, 2009, and ending with the date it denied her a modification, July 15, 2011, raises the question of whether the plaintiff treated the defendant in a fair, equitable and honest manner knowing that prolonged delay would place the defendant in an untenable financial situation, such that she could not possibly extricate herself to prevent foreclosure. We have no evidentiary basis to determine if wilful misconduct or simple negligence occurred in the plaintiff's handling of her application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   We, therefore, conclude that the court erred in determining that there was no genuine issue of material fact as to whether the defendant can prevail on her special defense of unclean hands.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Having concluded that there is a genuine issue of material fact raised in the allegations in the defendant's unclean hands special defense, we next address the plaintiff's argument that this special defense is invalid because it does not relate to the making, validity, or enforcement of the note and mortgage.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court did not expressly address or rely on this rationale, but we address it because it presents a question of law that is subject to plenary review.

Thus, we are not persuaded by the plaintiff's argument that the defendant's unclean hands defense is invalid because it does not relate to the making, validity, or enforcement of the note. First, the defense of unclean hands, as our Supreme Court recognized, does not necessarily need to relate to the making, enforcement, or validity of the loan. Second, if the plaintiff did engage in fraudulent conduct by deliberately failing to communicate its internal approval of the loan modification, then that raises questions as to whether, but for this conduct, the plaintiff would have had the legal authority to bring this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   We conclude that the allegations in the defendant's special defense of unclean hands raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether deceitful or unfair practices on the part of the plaintiff led to the filing of a foreclosure action that could have been avoided by the timely processing of the defendant's application for a permanent loan modification in accordance with the\n   HAMP guidelines. The plaintiff's submissions do not satisfactorily defeat the evidence set forth in the defendant's objection that HAMP's required procedures may not have been followed during the TPP process.

The defendant claims that the court erred in concluding that her equitable estoppel special defense failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the plaintiff induced her default. In this special defense, the defendant alleges that the plaintiff advised her that she had to stop making her mortgage payments, as this was the only way to explore a modification. She claims that the plaintiff should be equitably estopped from foreclosing on her mortgage because \"the event of default was contrived by [the plaintiff],\" who \"reported the default to various credit reporting agencies ... which substantially interfered with her ability to ... pursue refinancing options with other financial institutions.\" We are not persuaded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \"The doctrine of equitable estoppel is well established.

Our Supreme Court ... stated, in the context of an equitable estoppel claim, that [t]here are two essential elements to an estoppel: the party must do or say\n   something which is intended or calculated to induce another to believe in the existence of certain facts and to act upon that belief; and the other party, influenced thereby, must actually change his position or do something to his injury which he otherwise would not have done.

She claims, for the first time on appeal, that this was a misleading statement by the plaintiff because, under the HAMP program standards, she only needed to be at imminent risk of default and did not have to be in default in order to be considered for a modification. She also claims that her default, contrived by the plaintiff, negatively impacted her credit score, and thus her ability to pursue refinancing with other financial institutions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   A major problem with the defendant's claim that the plaintiff\n   <em>\n    misled\n   </em>\n   her by telling her she first had to stop making payments to be considered for a loan modification, rather than merely be at imminent risk of default, is that she raises this argument for the first time on appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"Our appellate courts, as a general practice, will not review claims made for the first time on appeal.

In the present case, the argument that the defendant made in her opposition to summary judgment was that the plaintiff's servicer had a widespread practice of instructing mortgagors to stop making mortgage payments under the false pretense that doing so would not hurt their credit scores. In the portion of her memorandum of law in opposition to the motion for summary judgment where she discusses her equitable estoppel special defense, the defendant never directs the court's attention to any authority that supports her appellate contention that the plaintiff knew or should have known that telling her she had to stop payments as a requirement to be considered for a loan modification was misleading. Accordingly, the claim as framed on appeal is unpreserved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Assuming, arguendo, that the defendant had preserved her equitable estoppel claim, we would conclude that she cannot prevail on the merits of the defense as currently pleaded and argued. The following additional facts pertaining to the defendant's decision to default are relevant to this claim. In her affidavit, the defendant states that after she was laid off from her job, she used cash reserves and savings to make her mortgage payments, but soon became concerned about her ability to continue making the payments. In her affidavit, the defendant avers that the plaintiff's loan servicer did not direct her to default, but rather informed her that it could not speak with her regarding loan assistance until she was in default. Thereafter, the defendant elected to default and was not coerced or forced to do so by the plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   This special defense fails to allege that the plaintiff promised her that her credit score would be unaffected by her default, and the only detriment she alleges was the negative impact on her credit score. In her equitable estoppel special defense, the defendant also does not claim that the plaintiff promised her a loan modification\n   when it instructed her that the only way to explore modifying her payment was for her to default.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   After the defendant defaulted, the plaintiff followed through on its promise to discuss mortgage assistance with the defendant, and engaged in documented communications, internal calculations and correspondence with the defendant in an effort to conclude a mortgage modification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Because the allegations in this special defense in no way set forth a claimed promise from the plaintiff that her credit score would be unaffected or that a future loan modification would take place if she defaulted and there is no evidence of any such promises, the defendant cannot claim that she relied to her detriment on promises she fails to allege or prove existed. At the time the defendant elected to default, the maintenance of a favorable credit score or a loan modification were never certainties, and she chose to default at her own peril. The defendant has failed to plead or present evidence of a promise or reasonable reliance on any promise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <em>\n    Carlson\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Bank of America, N.A.\n   </em>\n   , United States District Court, Civ. No. 12-1440 (DSD/AJB),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%205519733\">\n    2012 WL 5519733\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D. Minn. November 14, 2012), is factually analogous and provides further justification for why the defendant's \"induced to default\" special defense is insufficient for lack of proof\n   of detrimental reliance on her part. The court in\n   <em>\n    Carlson\n   </em>\n   stated: \"The homeowners argue that Bank of America fail[ed] to properly communicate with plaintiffs and encourag[ed] plaintiffs to default on their loan.... Absent from the verified complaint, however, is any allegation that Bank of America hindered performance by refusing payment.... In other words, the homeowners never alleged that the lender's actions prevented them from performing their responsibilities under the mortgage\n   agreement.... For this reason, the homeowners' claim fails....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \"Here, the homeowners did not plead plausible factual allegations indicating that they would have been able to pay the mortgage absent their reliance on the instructions to default.... The homeowners allege that they would have continued to make payments had they not been instructed to default on the loan; however, they also allege financial concerns beginning in fall 2009 and do not allege an ability to pay.\" (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., at *2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <em>\n    Carlson\n   </em>\n   is instructive. In rejecting the defendant's \"instruction to default\" defense therein, the court found that the defendant's own admitted financial problems were the undisputed overriding impetus for the defendant's decision to default on the note and mortgage. Similarly, the defendant in the present case has not presented evidence that she could have or would have remained current on the mortgage had she not been instructed to default to take advantage of the opportunity for a modification. The fact that she claims she was current on certain other financial obligations while she was in default does not equate to an ability to pay her mortgage. As the plaintiff points out, the defendant's argument is \"self-contradictory and illogical.\" On the one hand, the defendant claims that she defaulted only because she was wrongfully induced to default by the plaintiff and would not have defaulted but for plaintiff's supposedly inequitable conduct. On the other hand, she claims she should have been considered for a modification before defaulting, but the HAMP guidelines only permit predefault modification consideration if the borrower's default is imminent. If, in 2009, the defendant was about to default in the near future, how can she argue that the plaintiff's actions were the wrongful cause of her default? If she was able to continue to afford her mortgage payments and only was induced\n   by the plaintiff to default, then her default was not imminent, and presumably she could have afforded the existing terms of her mortgage and would not have been eligible for HAMP.

These letters advised the defendant of the consequences of her default, as required by the terms of the note and mortgage. The note and mortgage, however, do not require the plaintiff to notify her that her credit rating may be affected were she to be in default. Once the defendant defaulted, the plaintiff discussed mortgage assistance and gave the defendant a TPP, as promised. Although the defendant makes the sweeping generalization that many mortgage servicers are motivated to induce defaults for greater fees, there is no evidence that any employee of Chase, acting on behalf of the plaintiff, was so motivated in this case. Moreover, neither the note nor the mortgage contemplate addressing a situation where the defendant might need relief from the payment provisions, nor does either of these documents promise to offer the defendant a loan modification. Accordingly, a failure to provide the defendant with an offer for a loan modification under the program cannot be a violation of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing under the note or mortgage agreements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   F\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The defendant also claims that the court erred in determining that there was no genuine issue of material fact regarding her promissory estoppel special defense.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   She contends that submissions\n   presented to\n   the court show that the plaintiff promised to offer to permanently modify her loan if she made three trial period payments and met the eligibility requirements of the TPP, but that the plaintiff did not fulfill its promise to modify her mortgage after she made the payments and met the requirements. We are not persuaded because the allegations in this special defense, which state that the defendant was promised a permanent modification of her mortgage so long as she made three consecutive trial payments in a specified amount, are contradicted by the undisputed evidence. In reviewing the language of this particular special defense, it is not asserted that the defendant met all the terms of the purported offer she submitted as evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   \"[U]nder the doctrine of promissory estoppel [a] promise which the promisor should reasonably expect to induce action or forbearance on the part of the promisee or a third person and which does induce such action or forbearance is binding if injustice can be avoided only by enforcement of the promise.... A fundamental element of promissory estoppel, therefore, is the existence of a clear and definite promise which a promisor could reasonably have expected to induce reliance. Thus, a promisor is not liable to a promisee who has relied on a promise if, judged by an objective standard, he had no reason to expect any reliance at all....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   \"Additionally, the promise must reflect a present intent to commit as distinguished from a mere statement of intent to contract in the future....

It is undisputed that the defendant made all of the trial period payments on time.

We agree with the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   In her counterclaim, the defendant alleged that the plaintiff breached its contract with her when it failed to offer her a permanent loan modification within a reasonable period of time after she made the trial period payments and continued to meet all HAMP program\n   eligibility requirements.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court concluded: \"[T]he undisputed facts show that the plaintiff and [the] defendant did not enter into a new contract or agreement,\" ruling that \"[t]he defendant was obligated to make payments on her mortgage as demonstrated by the note, and therefore, the undisputed facts show that the defendant would be obligated to pay the monthly trial plan amount at a minimum.... Therefore, the offer of a trial modification, even with a promise of a future alteration to the original mortgage, did not form a new contract.\" (Citation omitted.) The court further concluded that the purported contract would be unenforceable due to its noncompliance with the statute of frauds, and that the counterclaim, which alleged the failure to execute a loan modification agreement, did not meet the transaction test set forth in Practice Book \u00a7 10-10 because it did not satisfy the same transaction standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Initially, we discuss whether the court erred in determining that the defendant's counterclaim failed to satisfy the transaction test set forth in\n   Practice Book \u00a7 10-10.

The defendant's counterclaim alleges the formation and breach of a contractual agreement, prior to the commencement of this action, intended to lead to an offer from the plaintiff for a permanent modification of the defendant's note and mortgage, which, if accepted, would avoid a foreclosure. In her prayer for relief, the defendant is seeking specific performance of that\n   agreement, or other equitable relief, which is directly and inseparably connected to the relief sought in the plaintiff's complaint because, were the defendant to prevail, the result may be a modification of her obligations under the note and mortgage sought to be enforced in the foreclosure action. \"[B]ecause a mortgage foreclosure action is an equitable proceeding, the trial court may consider all relevant circumstances to ensure that complete justice is done.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    TD Bank, N.A.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    M.J.

The connection between the note, the mortgage and the TPP involves the same lender, the same borrower and the same property.

We address whether there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the parties formed a contract. An essential issue for this analysis on which the parties differ is whether, under the HAMP guidelines, the plaintiff was permitted to continue to require additional documentation to verify the defendant's eligibility for a loan modification months after the conclusion of the TPP, or whether the defendant, who made all her trial period payments and remained eligible during the TPP, should\n   have been tendered a permanent modification offer after she successfully completed the trial period. The defendant makes it clear that she is not claiming that the TPP was itself a contract for a permanent loan modification. Rather, a contract governed the terms of the TPP that, if fully performed, required the plaintiff to tender her offer to permanently modify her loan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The defendant claims that on July 15, 2010, the plaintiff made a definite offer to enter into a contractual relationship that, when accepted by the defendant, created a\n   contract binding on both parties.\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   See\n   <em>\n    Auto Glass Express, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Hanover Ins.

The defendant argues that her acceptance of the contract was evidenced through her performance of the two conditions precedent in the offer: timely payment of all amounts due during the trial period, a fact which is not disputed, and her continued eligibility, a primary source\n   of contention in this case. She maintains that these conditions precedent were solely in her control and did not hinge on the \"whims of the plaintiff.\" She notes that the plaintiff concedes that the terms of the TPP were supplemented by the HAMP guidelines issued by the Treasury Department and that the HAMP guidelines in effect at the time she received the offer from the plaintiff, effective June 1, 2010, namely, HAMP Supplemental Directive 10-01, dated January 28, 2010, required \"full verification of borrower eligibility prior to offering a trial period plan.\" She claims that the record supports her assertion that she submitted extensive income documentation to the plaintiff at its request prior to receiving the TPP offer, and that the plaintiff's underwriting department reviewed her income documentation, verified she was eligible for HAMP and then determined her modified loan terms on July 8, 2010, prior to offering her the July 15, 2010 TPP. She further claims that she submitted more information to the plaintiff at its request during the trial period to verify her continuing eligibility. She maintains that her compliance with these two conditions precedent constituted acceptance of the plaintiff's definite offer, and consideration to induce and bargain for the plaintiff's promise to tender her an offer of a permanent HAMP loan modification, as the acts she promised to perform under the TPP encompassed acts that were not preexisting legal duties. See\n   <em>\n    Turbeville\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    JPMorgan Chase Bank\n   </em>\n   , United States District Court, Docket No. SA CV 10-01464 DOC (JCG),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%207163111\">\n    2011 WL 7163111\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , *4 (C.D.

While she participated in the TPP, her\n   original obligations on the note and mortgage remained unchanged and in effect, and continued to accrue. By delaying in making her full monthly payments, the defendant committed herself to paying a greater amount in the long run because during the months she made reduced payments, interest accrued on a larger sum of principal than it otherwise would have. Thus, it is unfair to categorize the defendant's promise to pay reduced monthly payments solely as a preexisting duty, as she actually suffered some detriment by agreeing to pay less than the full amount she owed. See\n   <em>\n    Henderson\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Wells Fargo Bank, NA\n   </em>\n   , United States District Court, Civ.

The plaintiff asks this court to reject the defendant's argument that the HAMP guidelines forbid a loan servicer from requesting additional documents to confirm a borrower's continuing eligibility under the program, as HAMP Supplemental Directive 10-01 specifically states that \"[b]orrowers who make all trial period payments timely and who satisfy all other trial period requirements will be offered a permanent HAMP modification.\" Moreover, HAMP guidelines state that when\n   \"evaluating a borrower's eligibility for HAMP, servicers should use good business judgment consistent with the judgment employed when modifying mortgage loans held in their own portfolio.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Our review of the HAMP guidelines leads us to conclude that there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the plaintiff was permitted to continue to review the defendant's financial eligibility for the HAMP program after the end of her trial period. The plaintiff's own contention, which is that HAMP Supplemental Directive 10-01 specifically states that \"[b]orrowers who make all trial period payments timely and who satisfy all other\n   <em>\n    trial period\n   </em>\n   requirements will be offered a permanent HAMP modification\"; (emphasis added); may be interpreted as indicating that all other requirements have to be met only during the trial period, suggesting an intention not to leave the borrower without notice of a final determination for months afterward, as took place in this case. Although the HAMP handbook may contemplate a prolonged TPP, lasting more than three months, there is no definite indication in the record before us that the plaintiff and the defendant ever agreed to a prolonged TPP.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   The plaintiff also claims that the trial court correctly held that the defendant provided no consideration to the plaintiff because she paid less than she already was obligated to pay under the terms of the existing note and mortgage. \"Consideration consists of a benefit to the party promising, or a loss or detriment to the party to whom the promise is made....

The July 15, 2010 letter from the plaintiff that offered the defendant a TPP informed her that in addition to making monthly trial period payments in place of her normal monthly mortgage payments, she had to continue to meet all program eligibility requirements. Attached to this letter was a list of frequently asked questions, which informed the defendant that her credit score may be affected, she may be required to attend credit counseling, that she would be required to have an escrow account for payment of property taxes, insurance premiums and other required charges, and that she was required to provide income and expenses documentation. By not making her full monthly mortgage payments, the plaintiff committed herself to paying a greater amount in the long run, as during the months she made reduced payments, interest accrued on a larger sum of principal than it otherwise would have. In addition, the defendant's account was assessed a charge of $2838.92 when her loan modification was \"approved.\" It is unquestionable that the defendant suffered some detriment additional to any preexisting duties she owed to the plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   The documents submitted by the defendant and her arguments lead us to conclude that there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether a contract was formed when she accepted the TPP and complied with its conditions, including remaining financially eligible for the HAMP program throughout the trial time period. There also is a genuine issue of fact as to whether the plaintiff failed to meet its obligations under the TPP,\n   particularly as to the timing of when it made its relevant determinations. Thus, on the existing record, there is a genuine issue as to whether a contract was formed and whether there was a breach by the plaintiff.

Because the TPP was not an agreement for the sale of real property or any interest in or concerning real property, and, arguably was supposed to be performed within one year, and because it was not an agreement for a loan in an amount that exceeded $50,000, it was not a purported contract that falls within the statute of frauds.

In support of its conclusion that the defendant raised a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the plaintiff engaged in wilful misconduct, the majority relies on (1) the \"plaintiff's failure to establish that it adhered to the [United States] Treasury Department's directives, which appear to encourage that final determinations on whether to offer the borrower a loan modification be made before the end of the [trial period plan (TPP) ]\" and (2) an unexplained notation in the plaintiff's records that would appear to show that the defendant's loan modification was internally approved. The evidence submitted, however, is devoid of any basis from which a fact finder could infer that the plaintiff engaged in\n   intentional conduct designed to injure the defendant. I do not believe that the identification of an inconsistent notation of the status of the defendant's application is sufficient to demonstrate a genuine issue of material fact as to wilful misconduct, particularly where wilful misconduct requires that the action producing the injury and the resulting injury be intentional. I would therefore conclude that the trial court properly rejected the defendant's unclean hands special defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   I further disagree with the majority that the defendant's breach of contract special\n   defense is legally insufficient. The majority rests this conclusion on its determination that the defendant failed to allege that she maintained her financial eligibility for a loan modification under the federal Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP). Thus, according to the majority, the defendant failed to allege full performance, rendering the special defense legally insufficient. I begin by noting that I do not believe this court should analyze the sufficiency of the defendant's pleading for the first time on appeal because the parties have not briefed the sufficiency of the pleadings, but instead argue only as to whether a genuine issue of material fact exists. I would decide the defendant's appellate claim as briefed by the parties and would conclude that the defendant has raised a genuine issue of material fact as to her breach of contract special defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   A review of the record reveals that the plaintiff was fully apprised of the issues implicated by the defendant's breach of contract special defense, including the defendant's continued eligibility for HAMP. \"The fundamental purpose of a special defense, like other pleadings, is to apprise the court and opposing counsel of the issues to be tried, so that basic issues are not concealed ....\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   <em>\n    Noonan\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Noonan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5766951\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/122/184/#p190\">\n    122 Conn.

We expressly reject that finding in part II of the majority opinion. In its appellate brief, the plaintiff argues, as it did before the trial court, that the defendant's failure to maintain her eligibility for HAMP \"resulted in the nonissuance of a permanent modification.\" The plaintiff's arguments before this court and the trial court demonstrate that it was apprised that the defendant's continued eligibility for HAMP was an issue raised by the defendant's breach of contract special defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Moreover, the plaintiff, briefing the breach of contract special defense together with the breach of contract counterclaim, does not argue that the special defense is legally insufficient in contrast to the counterclaim. The majority sua sponte conducts an independent review of the sufficiency of the allegations contained in her special defense and finds such allegations legally insufficient due to a failure to allege \"full\n   performance ....\" I would address, instead, the issue as briefed, i.e., whether the defendant has carried her burden of demonstrating a genuine issue of material fact as to whether she continued to meet HAMP eligibility requirements. I would reach the conclusion that we ultimately reach in part II of the majority opinion, which is that she has demonstrated such a genuine issue of material fact.\n   For these reasons, I respectfully concur in part and dissent in part.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-121\">\n    The complaint also named as defendants American Fuel Corporation and the town of Cheshire.
