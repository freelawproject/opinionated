In that appeal, Objectors raised a substantive validity challenge to Zoning Ordinance 01-2010,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   which supplemented the Township's Zoning Ordinance\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   to allow oil and gas well operations in all zoning districts so long as they satisfy enumerated standards designed to protect the public health, safety and welfare. Pursuant to Zoning Ordinance 01-2010, the Township issued a permit to CNX Gas Company (CNX) to develop an unconventional gas well on property located in the Township's R-2 Agricultural/Residential Zoning District (R-2 Zoning District). Objectors assert that Zoning Ordinance 01-2010 improperly instituted illegal spot zoning in violation of substantive due process; does not comport with the Environmental Rights Amendment in Article I, Section 27 of the Pennsylvania Constitution ; and contravenes several provisions of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code (MPC).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Consequently, Objectors contend,\n   the CNX permit was improperly issued. After review, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    Zoning Ordinance 01-2010\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On December 13, 2010, the Township enacted Zoning Ordinance 01-2010, entitled \"Providing for the Zoning of Oil and Gas Drilling Operations.\" Reproduced Record at 203a-12a (R.R. __). Zoning Ordinance 01-2010 makes oil and gas development \"a permitted use by right in all Zoning Districts[,]\" subject to numerous standards, or conditions. Section 3 of Zoning Ordinance 01-2010; R.R. 205a. These standards,\n   <em>\n    inter alia,\n   </em>\n   relate to road safety; the clearing of brush and trees; emergency planning; dust, noise and lighting controls; and security measures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   More specifically, Zoning Ordinance 01-2010 requires gas well operators to give residents within 1,000 feet of the well: a copy of the survey plat; a description of the planned operations; contact information for the operator; and the opportunity to meet with the operator. It requires the installation of a chain link fence and warning signs at the well site and the posting of a security guard whenever a drilling rig is present. It limits the hours for site preparation and construction as well as the ambient noise levels. It requires the operator to maintain a copy of the material safety data sheets for all chemicals used in drilling operations on-site and to provide a copy to the Township's manager. It prohibits the on-site disposal of refuse or burning of brush during clearing of the site. It requires operators to mitigate any problems they cause, including the disruption of telephone, cell phone, and other signals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Zoning Ordinance 01-2010 requires gas well operators to comply with all federal and state permitting requirements. Operators must produce these permits 10 days before construction. Notably, a permit from the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) requires compliance with the setbacks of gas and oil wells from water wells and buildings set forth in the statute known as \"Act 13.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   58 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 3215(a). Notwithstanding the decision of our Supreme Court holding that certain provisions of Act 13 were unconstitutional, these setbacks remain in effect.\n   <em>\n    Robinson Township v. Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12279903\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/637/239/\">\n    637 Pa. 239\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12193070,12279903\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/147/536/\">\n    147 A.3d 536\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 542 n.3 (2016) (\n   <em>\n    Robinson Township IV\n   </em>\n   ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Operators must also obtain permits from the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Zoning Ordinance 01-2010 establishes civil penalties for violations of its terms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On October 6, 2014, the Township issued a \"zoning compliance permit\" to CNX to develop an unconventional gas well on property located in the R-2 Zoning District. The property is owned by Northmoreland Farms, LP, which has three members, John H. Slike, his wife, Anne E. Slike and their son, Neil Slike. CNX's gas well is known as the Porter Pad project.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Objectors, who live near the Slike property, filed a substantive validity challenge to Zoning Ordinance 01-2010, arguing that an unconventional gas well is not a use compatible with an agricultural-residential use. Objectors also appealed the permit issued to CNX. The Zoning Board held public hearings on Objectors' filings on January 7, 2015; January 28, 2015; February 11, 2015; and March 5, 2015.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Objectors presented the testimony of Dr. John Stoltz, Professor of Biology at Duquesne University and Director of the Center for Research and Education.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Stoltz testified about his general understanding of drilling and the hydraulic fracturing process. Dr. Stoltz stated that CNX's drilling would impact water wells; however, he conceded that he had no knowledge of the location of wells or public water sources in the Township and had not realized that the Porter Pad project would not use water from streams but, rather, public water sources. Dr. Stoltz testified that onsite burial of waste is problematic; he was unaware that CNX did not plan to bury waste at the Porter Pad site. Finally, Dr. Stoltz opined that truck traffic would increase at the site because CNX will need to drain the condensate tanks. Dr. Stoltz did not know how much condensate would be generated or what type of gas would be extracted at the Porter Pad; he agreed that \"dry gas\" does not present condensation issues. Notes of Testimony (N.T.), 1/7/2015, at 88; R.R. 331a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Objectors also presented the testimony of Steven Victor, who was qualified to testify as an expert in land use planning and landscape architecture. Victor testified that 85 percent of the Township lies in the R-2 Zoning District. Victor opined that oil and gas drilling could be compatible with other uses in the R-2 Zoning District, but he believed that \"stronger standards and regulations\" were needed in Zoning Ordinance 01-2010. N.T., 1/28/2015, at 75; R.R. 537a. Victor opined that Zoning Ordinance 01-2010 did not adequately protect the local water supply; limit noise; or reduce light pollution. Victor was unsure what protections would be adequate. He did not know whether numerous environmental protection laws, such as those enforced by DEP, would address his listed concerns.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Objectors also testified. Beverly Taylor stated that she chose her residence for its quiet, rural setting. Her property lies approximately 1,000 feet away from the well and 700 feet from the perimeter of the site. Taylor testified that CNX used heavy machinery from approximately 6:30 a.m. until dusk seven days per week to prepare the site by removing trees, clearing ground, and constructing roadways. Eventually the work was reduced to six days per week.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Objector Dolores Frederick testified that she lives approximately 900 feet from the Porter Pad project. She also complained about the noise during the clearing process, as well as the traffic inconvenience caused by the trucks, which left mud and dirt on the roads.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Objector Patricia Hagaman's home is located approximately 1,200 feet away from the Porter Pad site. She cannot see the site from her house, but can hear the \"beeps [of the trucks because she lives] in a valley.\" N.T., 1/28/2015, at 117; R.R. 579a. She expressed concern that a stream flowing across her property would be polluted. Hagaman testified that if development continues, she will try to sell her property because it will be \"too dangerous\" to stay. N.T., 1/28/2015, at 121; R.R. 583a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Kevin Zigler,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   who lives approximately 625 yards from the Porter Pad, testified\n   that two people, one a realtor, advised him that the Porter Pad project will reduce his property's value. Zigler believed the devaluation would be substantial. He complained about the noise from trucks and the mud they tracked onto the roads. Zigler acknowledged that in 2014, he signed a lease with another gas company, Huntley and Huntley, for the drilling of a horizontal line under his property to extract gas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   CNX presented the testimony of Kyle Stefanick, a senior land agent with Consol Energy,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   who is responsible for leasing land for well pads, pipelines and rights-of-way for gas exploration. Stefanick stated that the Township encompasses approximately 20,000 acres of land, of which 12,500 acres have been leased to \"various\" natural gas exploration companies. N.T., 2/11/2015, at 59; R.R. 741a. Seventy-five percent of the land in the R-2 Zoning District has been leased for natural gas drilling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Stefanick testified that there are approximately 242 gas wells in the Township, all of which are conventional.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Porter Pad will be the first unconventional well in the Township. However, it will not be the first gas well in the Township to be opened by hydraulic fracturing because conventional well developers, including some in the Township, also employ hydraulic fracturing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Stefanick testified that six wells are proposed for the Porter Pad. He noted that the Slikes' farm already has three gas wells that are plainly visible to persons driving by the property. During drilling, the only apparatus that will be visible from the Taylor property, which is closest to the well site, is the derrick. Once drilling is complete, the derrick will be removed, and nothing will be visible. Stefanick testified that there is an existing gas well 320 feet from the Taylor property that was drilled in 1947 and another 842 feet away that was drilled in 1996. Stefanick observed that there is an existing well 509 feet from the Hagaman residence that was drilled in 1960.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Ted Szalewicz, a land agent and consultant for Western Pennsylvania Gas Leasing Consultants, testified for CNX. He testified that his search of the Westmoreland County Recorder of Deeds Office revealed that \"approximately 400 leases\" were recorded in the county in 2014, encompassing \"approximately 4,000 acres of land[.]\" N.T., 2/11/2015, at 116; R.R. 798a. The rental payments on the leases filed in 2014 totaled \"about $12 million [dollars].\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12193070,12279903\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/147/536/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   CNX offered the testimony of Ross H. Pifer, J.D., LL.M. a professor at Penn State Law School who teaches agricultural law and oil and gas law. He also supervises a law school clinic focused on rural communities. He has written extensively on the impact of gas extraction on agricultural development. The Zoning Board qualified Professor Pifer as an expert \"regarding [the] interplay between the oil and gas industry and agricultural and rural communities in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.\" N.T., 1/28/2015, at 148-49, 152; R.R. 610a-11a, 614a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Professor Pifer testified that shale gas extraction is taking place in 39 of Pennsylvania's 67 counties. There are approximately 250 shallow gas wells located in the Township, and 102 are active. Professor Pifer testified that there is a long history\n   of safe coexistence between the oil and gas industry and Pennsylvania's rural communities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Professor Pifer further testified that as of September 30, 2014, there were 261 unconventional shale gas wells in Westmoreland County that used hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling. He explained that this type of unconventional drilling has allowed a single multi-well pad to extract the gas reserves from a 20 to 40-acre tract of land. In the past, extracting the same amount of gas would have required 30 to 60 conventional well pads. Thus, unconventional drilling leaves more land for farming while providing economic stability for the farmers leasing their land.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Daniel Bitz, the General Manager of Gas Permitting for Consol Energy, also testified for CNX. He testified that CNX was required to obtain permits from several state agencies in connection with the Porter Pad project. These include a well permit from DEP, which required,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , a water management plan and an excavation permit. PennDOT required a driveway connection permit as well as a road maintenance agreement, a road bond, and a posted highway permit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Bitz explained that after CNX identifies a well site, it must complete a geotechnical sub-surface and hydrologic investigation, along with a wetland stream review. CNX must prepare both an erosion and sediment control plan and a stormwater management plan for DEP. DEP also requires that CNX prepare and maintain a construction \"Preparedness, Prevention and Contingency Plan.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   It must do a mineral study of the well layout and the mineral tract boundaries and complete pre-drill and post-drill water surveys on all water sources within 2,500 feet of the well bores. CNX must send notices to all water purveyors within 3,000 feet of the well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   John H. Slike testified. He is a member of Northmoreland Farms, LP, which owns the 330-acre farm where the Porter Pad project is located. Slike testified that there were active conventional gas wells on the farm when he purchased it in 1976. Since then, four additional conventional gas wells have been drilled. The wells do not affect his ability to farm. To the contrary, Slike testified that the income he receives from the CNX lease has enabled his family to continue farming the land, as opposed to developing a 235-unit residential subdivision on it, a purpose for which the farm has been found suitable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Zoning Board allowed the Township residents present at the hearing to testify about the Porter Pad project. Some residents expressed concerns that the drilling will pollute the land or spoil their scenic views. Others echoed Slike's testimony that the mineral lease payments will allow farmers to continue farming. Keith Alter, a local farmer, explained that his family loves their farm but struggles financially. He confirmed that gas development has allowed him and others to keep their land in farming rather than sell it to residential developers. Alter observed that if land is sold to real estate developers, then the pristine areas in the Township will, over time, disappear.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    Zoning Board Decision\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The Zoning Board rejected as not credible the testimony of Objectors' primary witnesses, Dr. John Stoltz and Steven Victor, citing their lack of relevant training. It also cited their lack of knowledge about\n   the oil and gas permitting process, the Township's geography, and the specifications of CNX's Porter Pad project. The Zoning Board rejected Objectors' testimony about decreasing property values because it was speculative and unsupported by probative evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The Zoning Board credited Professor Pifer's testimony, including his expert opinion that Zoning Ordinance 01-2010's authorization for \"oil and gas operations within the Township's agricultural zoned areas, is proper and compatible within a rural agricultural zone and can safely coexist therein.\" Zoning Board Decision, 3/5/2015, at 30 (Board Decision at ___); Finding of Fact No. 47. The Zoning Board also credited Daniel Bitz's testimony about the thorough and extensive environmental protection reviews CNX must undergo to obtain permits from the Commonwealth. Finally, the Zoning Board credited Kyle Stefanick's testimony about the prevalence of drilling activity in the Township.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Based upon the evidence of record, including the above testimony, the Zoning Board made the following pertinent findings of fact:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   59. Approximately 12,000 of the 20,000 total acres in the Township are leased to oil and gas operators. This represents more than 60 [percent] of the land mass of the Township.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   60. In the R-2 District, approximately 75 [percent] of the land mass is leased to oil and gas operators.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   64. In addition to considering where an operator holds leases, factors such as topography, adjacent land uses, and required buffers around existing buildings and water wells limit the placement of oil and gas operations in the Township. [ ] [T]he 500 foot buffer from wellbore to existing building mandated by Section 3215(a) of the Oil and Gas Act, 58 [Pa. C.S.] \u00a7 3215, alone eliminates more than 50% of the Township's land mass from possible unconventional gas well development, without taking into account the other factors noted above.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   69. The only temporary feature of the Porter Pad that will be visible to [Objectors] from their homes is the drilling rig. No permanent feature of the Porter Pad will be visible to [Objectors] from their homes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   74. The traffic for the Porter Pad will not go past the homes of [Objectors].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   84. [Slike] testified that existing gas wells have not affected his ability to actively farm his property.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   85. [Slike] testified that in the event he was unable to receive royalties from the gas well sites and the proposed Porter Pad, he would suffer financial hardship and substantial financial loss. He further testified that in the event he is not able to receive royalties from the proposed Porter Pad, he would not have enough money to actively farm the property ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   95. Leasing already has brought in excess of $12,000,000 in lease rentals to landowners of the Township in 2014.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   96. Drilling and production of the newly leased properties alone will add an estimated additional $60 - 90 million in income.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   97. Once drilling operations cease, the affected land can be returned to its existing use.[ ]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Board Decision at 36-40; Findings of Fact Nos. 59-60, 64, 69, 74, 84-85, 95-97 (internal citations to the record omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The Zoning Board rejected Objectors' challenge to the substantive validity of Zoning Ordinance 01-2010. It rejected Objectors' challenge to the permit issued to CNX for the Porter Pad project because their appeal was based solely on the rejected premise that Zoning Ordinance 01-2010 was invalid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The Zoning Board concluded that Zoning Ordinance 01-2010 was neither arbitrary nor unreasonable in violation of substantive due process but, rather, promoted the public health, safety, and welfare of the Township. Further, the Township \"acted within its constitutional police power in enacting [Zoning Ordinance 01-2010] to further the general welfare of its citizens by permitting them to benefit economically from oil and gas resources and royalties, in order to help their livelihood and way of life.\" Board Decision at 46; Conclusion of Law No. 21. The Zoning Board emphasized that Zoning Ordinance 01-2010 requires gas drilling to comply \"with rigorous state and federal permitting requirements[ ],\" which includes substantial buffers or setbacks, and supplements \"those requirements with additional standards and criteria aimed at mitigating local impact.\" Board Decision at 47; Conclusion of Law No. 25. The Zoning Board further observed that Pennsylvania law has never provided that land zoned for agriculture must be used exclusively for agricultural purposes. To invalidate Zoning Ordinance 01-2010 could result in an \"unconstitutional taking and [a] violation of the prohibition against ex post facto laws.\" Board Decision at 54; Conclusion of Law No. 43.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The Zoning Board found that Objectors did not present credible, substantial evidence that the Porter Pad would have an adverse effect on public health, safety, welfare or the environment. The Board explained that \"Pennsylvania appellate courts have long held that generalized, speculative complaints about traffic, environmental impacts and devaluation of property fail to demonstrate an 'adverse' effect or 'an interest beyond the common interest of all citizens that the law be obeyed,' and are insufficient to sustain a zoning appeal.\" Board Decision at 49-50; Conclusion of Law No. 32 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Nernberg v.

In\n   <em>\n    Robinson Township II\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court addressed an amendment to the Pennsylvania Oil and Gas Act,\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   known as Act 13, and held that it unconstitutionally deprived municipalities of the ability to make zoning decisions about oil and gas extraction. The Supreme Court did not address the case at hand,\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   where the municipality has exercised its power to decide where oil and gas extraction can take place. Indeed, the Zoning Board noted that the\n   <em>\n    Robinson Township II\n   </em>\n   plurality stated that protection of the\n   environment is a \"quintessential[ly] local issue that must be tailored to local conditions.\" Board Decision at 51; Conclusion of Law No. 37 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Robinson II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4344715,7264422\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/83/901/\">\n    83 A.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   979 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The Zoning Board rejected Objectors' claim that Zoning Ordinance 01-2010 instituted a scheme of impermissible \"spot zoning.\" Because the ordinance allows oil and gas development by right in all districts, there is no \"spot\" being singled out for special treatment. Board Decision at 45-46; Conclusion of Law No. 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   For all the above-stated reasons, the Zoning Board rejected Objectors' substantive validity challenge and their appeal of the permit issued to CNX.

Objectors' Brief at 51-52. Objectors contend that Zoning Ordinance 01-2010 violates Section 604 of the MPC because permitting unconventional gas well development in all zoning districts will, as Dr. Stoltz testified, place \"water sources and other environmental assets at risk[.]\" Objectors' Brief at 52.

Focusing on this feature of section 3304, the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Robinson Township\n   </em>\n   noted that the statute's \"primary [ ] purpose is not to effectuate the constitutional obligation to protect and preserve Pennsylvania's natural environment,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 975, and said that \"permitting industrial uses as a matter of right in every type of [ ] zoning district is incapable of conserving or maintaining the constitutionally-protected aspects of the public environment and of a certain quality of life.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 979.

However, there is nothing in the record or Ordinance to positively and substantively indicate that the Township made any kind of exclusionary choice or engaged in any meaningful and individualized assessment of its districts' particular characteristics.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   To the contrary, the \"requirements\" for a zoning compliance permit apply uniformly to all the districts. Significantly, some of these obligations do not appear to be mandatory and are instead left to the discretion of the oil and gas operator;\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , \"\n   <em>\n    [o]perator shall strive to consider location of its temporary and permanent operations, where prudent and possible, so as to minimize interference with Township residents' enjoyment of their property\n   </em>\n   \"; and \"\n   <em>\n    [o]perator shall take steps, to the extent practicable to direct lighting downward and inward\n   </em>\n   .\" (R.R. at 206a) (emphasis added). Further, an oil and gas operator is mandated to install a chain link fence and warning signs, secure the presence of a security guard when the location of the well is within 1,000 feet of a \"Protected Structure,\" such as an occupied residence, commercial business, or school, and provide courtesy information to residents located within 1,000 feet of the well. (R.R. at 204a, 206a-08a.) However, the Ordinance does not contain a setback requirement and entrusts this determination to state agencies and/or the shifting sands of the legislation of our General Assembly, as evidenced by what was formerly the Oil and Gas Act\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   and is now known as Act 13.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   F.F.

Notably, the Oil and Gas Act was in effect when the Ordinance was passed but was later repealed and replaced by Act 13; and, even assuming the Ordinance could incorporate the setback distances contained in future legislation, the distance requirements in Act 13 have been declared unconstitutional or non-severable from the portions of Act 13 that are unconstitutional.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    So, as it now stands, the Ordinance technically does not have any minimal setback distance requirements at all. None.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   Hence, with respect to potential environmental concerns, it appears that the Ordinance delegates (or rather, punts) any consideration of these matters to the Department of Environmental Protection and other state agencies during the permitting process. (F.F. Nos. 9, 24; R.R. at 207a.) In fact, the Ordinance is so devoid and wanting, as explained herein, it does not even have any setback distance requirements\n   and essentially defers to the oil and gas company's choice of location. The Township's failure to consider the environment in an adequate fashion renders the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Robinson Township\n   </em>\n   on par with the facts and circumstances of this case. Because the Township must \"reasonably account for the environmental features of the affected locale,\"\n   <em>\n    Robinson Township\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4344715,7264422\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/83/901/\">\n    83 A.3d at 953\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and the record is insufficient to prove that it has, the Township, as a threshold matter, should have to demonstrate with competent evidence that oil and gas operations are compatible in\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   of its zoning districts given the districts' unique characteristics and permitted uses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ,\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   Second, assuming the Township can satisfy the above standard, the Township should further demonstrate that it is indispensably necessary for\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   of its zoning districts to be open to oil and gas development to attain the economic well-being of\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   its citizenry.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    PEDF\n   </em>\n   , 161 A.3d at 932. This is especially warranted in view of the fact that \"farms\" are a permitted use in only the Agricultural/Residential District, and the Township, as trustee, has a duty to maintain impartiality and to treat all beneficiaries equally and without favoritism.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Estate of Weiss\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"579904\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/454/114/\">\n    454 Pa. 114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=309%20A.2d%20793\">\n    309 A.2d 793\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 799 (1973). In more precise terms, if the Township relies on the financial benefit the Ordinance confers upon the farmers as its stated objective for-and compelling interest to support-the Ordinance, the Township should provide adequate justification for the differential treatment among its citizens and prove that oil and gas operations in the districts other than the Residential/Agricultural District will substantially further the business interest of the farmers. Otherwise, if the Township asserts that its objective for and compelling interest in the Ordinance resides in the financial benefit the law bestows upon the citizenry as a whole, the Township should have to prove that inclusion of commercial districts actually furthers or has the potential to further that interest. The Township has not satisfied these criteria, and hence, the Ordinance cannot be deemed to be the least restrictive means and fails strict scrutiny.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   Third, and irrespective of the above, the facts of this case create cause for grave concern for the Agricultural/Residential District in particular, which now must be\n   close to being fully occupied by oil and gas producers. Under trust law, a trustee possesses a duty to the beneficiaries to keep an accurate account of the affairs of the trust and its corpus,\n   <em>\n    In re Estate of Nesbitt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"684488\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa-super/368/185/\">\n    368 Pa.Super. 185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"684488,1808567\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/533/1015/\">\n    533 A.2d 1015\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1021 (1987), and a \"beneficiary may by a proper proceeding compel the trustee to render to the proper court an account of the administration of the trust.\" Restatement (Second) Trusts, \u00a7 172,\n   <em>\n    cmt. c.\n   </em>\n   (Am.

When coal was \"King,\" there was no Environmental Rights Amendment to constrain exploitation of the resource, to\n   protect the people and the environment, or to impose the sort of specific duty as trustee upon the Commonwealth as is found in the Amendment. Pennsylvania's very real and mixed past is visible today to anyone travelling across Pennsylvania's spectacular, rolling, varied terrain. The forests may not be primordial, but they have returned and are beautiful nonetheless; the mountains and valleys remain; the riverways remain, too, not as pure as when William Penn first laid eyes upon his colonial charter, but cleaner and better than they were in a relatively recent past, when the citizenry was less attuned to the environmental effects of the exploitation of subsurface natural resources.

How [can the] Township carry[ ] out its trustee duty to act affirmatively\n   to protect the environment, via legislative action, given [that Zoning Ordinance 01-2010] permit[s] this environmentally intensive use everywhere [throughout the Township]?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-204\">\n   Appellants' Brief at 47-48 (quotation marks omitted).

Furthermore, it is silent regarding when or for how long drilling may take place (theoretically allowing round-the-clock activities in perpetuity once construction has been completed), offers no mechanism by which Township residents or other interested parties might offer their input during the permitting process, and is completely devoid of language addressing the long-term primary, secondary, or tertiary effects of such development. Given this state of affairs, it is simply impossible for the Township, when considering an Oil and Gas Development permit request, to appropriately weigh the interests of the property owner and of the broader Township community, or those of present Township residents and of generations-to-come, or protect the environment and preserve public interest-implicating natural resources over both the short term and the long haul.

A facial challenge is theoretically possible. A zoning ordinance might, for example, require that unconventional gas drilling take place only in districts zoned for hospitals and schools and require operators to burn their refuse on site. In almost every other case, including this one, there will have to be a record made to determine whether the law in question \"unreasonably impairs\" the people's \"right to clean air, pure water, and to the preservation of the natural, scenic, historic and esthetic values of the environment.\" Pa.

Objectors tried to establish this point with their witness, Steven Victor, who opined that the ordinance conditions did not protect local water supply or adequately address noise and light pollution. He had little knowledge of the Township's water sources and could not offer alternative standards for regulating noise and light pollution. The Zoning Board found him not credible.
