KEVIN BROBSON, Judge\n   Berks County Fraternal Order of Police, Lodge # 71 (FOP) appeals from an order of the Court of Common Pleas of Berks County (trial court), which vacated an arbitration award (award) ordering the reinstatement of Charles Hobart (Hobart) to his position of municipal police officer with the Northern Berks Regional Police Department (Department). For the reasons discussed below, we vacate the trial court's order and remand the matter to the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Northern Berks Regional Police Commission (Commission) provides police services to certain parts of Berks County. The Commission is a party to a collective bargaining agreement (CBA) with the FOP. Hobart worked as a police officer for the Commission and was a member of the bargaining unit represented by the FOP. While employed by the Commission, Hobart worked at the Department, which is comprised of fourteen officers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In September 2016, the Commission terminated Hobart's employment due to misconduct. Specifically, the Department learned that Hobart kept a file folder in his desk containing (1) explicit pictures of females in different stages of undress, (2) photographs printed from a police information system, and (3) directions printed from MapQuest. In investigating the matter, the Commission discovered that Hobart used these pictures for personal sexual gratification. Further, the Commission discovered that Hobart exceeded his authorization of official-use operating systems. These operating systems included the Pennsylvania Justice Network\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (JNET) and the Commonwealth Law Enforcement Assistance Network\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (CLEAN). Because of these violations, Hobart's access to JNET, CLEAN, and an information system maintained by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) was permanently revoked.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The FOP filed a grievance on Hobart's behalf, arguing that the Commission did not have just cause to terminate his employment. The grievance was denied. The matter then proceeded to binding arbitration under what is referred to as Act 111.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The issue before the arbitrator was whether the Commission had just cause to remove Hobart and, if it did not, what was the remedy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Following a hearing, the arbitrator issued his decision and award, in which he concluded that the Commission did not have just cause to terminate Hobart's employment. The award detailed the testimony of then-Chief of Police Scott Eaken (Chief Eaken), who testified to the circumstances surrounding Hobart's termination. According to the award, Chief Eaken testified that the contents within Hobart's file folder could be divided into three categories: (1) JNET violations; (2) MapQuest inquiries; and (3) pictures of women in different stages of undress. (R.R. at 568a.) With respect to the JNET violations, Chief Eaken testified that Hobart used JNET to search and print out driver's license photographs of women. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 569a.) Chief Eaken conceded that, if not for the JNET violations, the Department probably would not have terminated Hobart's employment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Further, the award noted that Chief Eaken compared Hobart's actions to that of another officer who received punishment for exceeding his JNET access. In the previous situation, the officer improperly used JNET over a three-year period to access thousands of records unrelated to official police business. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 571a.) That officer received a four-day suspension. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The arbitrator determined that Hobart's discipline appeared disproportional when compared to that of the other officer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 566a.) Further, the arbitrator concluded that, although the record did not support a penalty of terminating Hobart's employment, his conduct nonetheless merited a severe punishment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 576a.) As such, the arbitrator converted the termination into an unpaid suspension with time served and ordered Hobart's reinstatement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Commission filed a petition with the trial court, seeking to vacate the award. The Commission asserted that the arbitrator exceeded his powers in ordering Hobart's reinstatement, as restoring Hobart to his position would compel the Commission to violate the law. Specifically, the Commission averred that a police officer's duties require that the officer have access to CLEAN and JNET. As Hobart's access to these systems had been permanently revoked-a revocation which the Commission cannot override-restoring Hobart to his position would expose him to information that he is not authorized to access in violation of laws prohibiting unauthorized access. The trial court issued a rule, directing the FOP to show cause why the Commission is not entitled to the relief requested. The FOP responded, essentially denying the Commission's assertions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The trial court held an evidentiary hearing, at which it received testimony regarding the revocation of Hobart's access to CLEAN, JNET, and the PennDOT system. Further, the trial court received testimony regarding how Hobart's reinstatement would compel the Commission to violate the law. As its first witness, the Commission called the Department's patrol sergeant and head of criminal investigations, Robert Wood, Jr. (Sergeant Wood). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 372a.) Sergeant Wood testified that using JNET and other information systems is critical to an officer's core function, and he provided examples of how an officer uses these systems throughout the course of a day. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 401a-16a.) Sergeant Wood further testified that a police officer would be unable to perform many routine tasks without access to these systems. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 417a.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On cross-examination, Sergeant Wood testified that, in order to become a municipal police officer in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, an individual must receive certification through the Municipal Police Officers' Education and Training Commission (MPOETC). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 427a.) To that point, Sergeant Wood conceded that access to JNET, CLEAN, or PennDOT's system is not required for certification as a municipal police officer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 430a.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Next, the Commission called the Department's Chief of Police, Brian Horner (Chief Horner). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 448a.) Chief Horner testified that, after the award ordered Hobart's reinstatement, Chief Horner forwarded letters to JNET, CLEAN, and PennDOT to appeal the revocation of Hobart's access. These appeals were denied. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 450a.) Chief Horner asserted that Hobart is unable to perform his duties for the Department without access to JNET, CLEAN, and PennDOT's system, as officers' duties regularly necessitate their use. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 457a, 462a.) Although Chief Horner agreed that certification through MPOETC is all that is required to perform duties as a municipal police officer, he rejected the notion that Hobart would be able to work at the Department in a capacity that did not involve using JNET, CLEAN, or PennDOT's system. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 459a.) Chief Horner attributed this to the small size of the Department, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-19\">\n   With our department, you have to have PennDOT, JNET, and CLEAN access. You have to do all full duties of a police officer in order to work for [the Department]. We are a smaller department compared to big cities. We don't have any true specialized fields other than, like, a criminal investigator's position, detective's position.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-20\">\n   So you still have to have all of the PennDOT, JNET, and CLEAN access in order to work at [the Department]. If any of the officers would not have PennDOT, JNET, or CLEAN [access], they would not be working for our police department.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Chief Horner went on to testify that Hobart is not permitted in the Department's barracks because he would be exposed to criminal and PennDOT records. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 460a.) Although Chief Horner asserted that the Department does not allow individuals within its facility who do not have access to JNET or CLEAN, he conceded that there is no written policy regarding such circumstances. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On cross-examination, Chief Horner agreed that it is lawful for an individual with MPOETC certification to work as a municipal police officer without access to JNET, CLEAN, or PennDOT's system. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 463a.) Chief Horner went on to opine that the Department would violate the law if Hobart returned to work at the Department. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 467a-68a.) Again, Chief Horner attributed this to the small size of the Department. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 468a.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Next, the Commission called PennDOT's Director of Risk Management, Brent Lawson (Lawson). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 475a.) Lawson testified that his group is responsible for,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , auditing access to PennDOT data. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 476a.) Lawson testified that PennDOT would reverse its decision to revoke someone's access permanently only if it learned that the data misuses were attributable to legitimate government functions or legitimate law enforcement reasons. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 480a.) On cross-examination, Lawson conceded that he was not aware of any law that prohibited Hobart from being a municipal police officer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 485a.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Commission then called Joseph R. McCunney (Corporal McCunney), a corporal with the Department and the audit investigation unit supervisor of the CLEAN administrative unit. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 489a.) Corporal McCunney testified that the revocation\n   of Hobart's CLEAN access means that he cannot have direct or indirect access to secure areas where information is stored, such as police departments. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 494a-95a.) Further, Corporal McCunney testified that Hobart is unable to sit in a police vehicle that has a computer due to the potential exposure to unauthorized information. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 497a.) On cross-examination, Corporal McCunney conceded that CLEAN access is not required for MPOETC certification. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 499a.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Next, the Commission entered into evidence the deposition testimony of Eric Webb (Webb), Executive Director of JNET. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 184a.) Webb testified that a police department cannot compel JNET to reverse a revocation of a police officer's access. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 214a.) Further, even if JNET were to lift a ban on an officer's access, JNET has no control over whether PennDOT or CLEAN would do the same. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 215a.) With respect to the appeal Chief Horner forwarded to JNET, Webb testified that he informed Chief Horner that, in order to be meritorious, there would have to be a substantial change in the facts of the misuse investigation or any circumstances of the misuse that had been clarified or changed since the initial investigation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 217a.) Without such a change, Webb testified that there would be no reason for an appeal. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Over an objection, Webb testified that he did not see any possibility that Hobart's appeal would result in JNET reinstating Hobart's access. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 217a-18a.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The FOP called Hobart as its only witness. Hobart testified that he has a valid MPOETC certification that permits him to work as a municipal police officer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 506a.) Although Hobart testified that he could still perform certain duties as a police officer without access to JNET, CLEAN, or PennDOT's system, he conceded that the performance of his duties would require other officers' involvement due to his lack of access. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 506a, 512a.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Following the hearing, the trial court issued a decision, vacating the award. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 693a-701a.) In so doing, the trial court concluded that the arbitrator exceeded his powers by ordering the Commission to do something it could not voluntarily do-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , violate laws relating to unauthorized access to protected information. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 699a-700a.) Specifically, the trial court concluded that returning Hobart to his position would expose Hobart to JNET and CLEAN records, which are protected from unauthorized disclosure pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201030\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1030\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , relating to fraud and related activity with computers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 700a.) Further, the trial court concluded that Hobart's reinstatement could cause the Department to violate 18 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 7611(a), which criminalizes the unlawful use of a computer when a person exceeds his authority to access a computer database. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) With respect to the FOP's assertion that MPOETC certification is all that is required to work as a police officer, the trial court opined:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-28\">\n   [FOP] argues that all Mr. Hobart needs is [MPOETC certification]. In order to perform the duties of a police officer, an officer must have more than the [MPOETC] certification. This certification represents the minimum requirements. It is analogous to a lawyer receiving a juris doctorate [sic] after graduating from law school; however, in order to practice law, the graduate also needs to pass the state bar examination and be licensed to practice law in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Mr. Hobart may have passed his certification training, but he cannot access any information required for the performance of his job. Thus, he cannot be a police officer in the [Department].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 701a.) Further, with respect to the FOP's assertion that Hobart could maintain his employment in a capacity without access to JNET, CLEAN, and PennDOT's system, the trial court opined:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-30\">\n   There is a myriad of laws that [the Commission] would potentially break in retaining Mr. Hobart as a police officer. [The FOP] suggests that accommodations could be made for Mr. Hobart that would circumvent these laws and Mr. Hobart's lack of privileges to the databases. This argument is ridiculous. It is not possible for Mr. Hobart to continue working in a police department composed of fourteen officers.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-31\">\n   The only way [the Commission] could have Mr. Hobart as a police officer is by providing him with a special room with no computer access to JNET. [The Commission] would then have to pay Mr. Hobart a police officer's salary for not performing his work and another officer for doing his own job and completing Mr. Hobart's work. This scenario would be a farce. Both [the Commission] and its citizens would be inconvenienced and overtaxed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The FOP subsequently filed the instant appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    II. ISSUES ON APPEAL\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On appeal, the FOP advances four claims of error by the trial court. First, the FOP argues that the trial court erred in concluding that the arbitrator exceeded his powers by ordering the Commission to do something that it could not voluntarily do. Second, the FOP argues that the trial court erred by exceeding its narrow scope of review by considering matters such as the convenience to the Commission, the financial impact on the Department and its taxpayers, and the underlying facts of the arbitration. Third, the FOP argues that the trial court erred by basing its decision on an incorrect factual finding. Fourth, the FOP argues that the trial court erred by substituting its judgment for that of the arbitrator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   It is well-settled that a judicial review of a grievance arbitration award arising under Act 111 is in the nature of narrow certiorari.\n   <em>\n    Town of McCandless v.

DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Illegality of Award\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   We begin by addressing the FOP's argument that the trial court erred by concluding that returning Hobart to work would compel the Commission to perform an illegal act. The FOP argues that because MPOETC certification is all that is required to serve as a municipal police officer, Hobart can still perform police functions without access to JNET, CLEAN, and PennDOT's system. Given that Hobart\n   possesses MPOETC certification, the FOP maintains that reinstating him does not compel the Commission to perform an illegal act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In response, the Commission argues that, although MPOETC certification permits Hobart to work as a municipal police officer, the award still compels the Commission to violate the law. Specifically, the Commission argues that it is impossible for Hobart to work in the Department in a capacity that avoids direct or indirect exposure to information he cannot access. As such, if the Commission were to reinstate Hobart, it would be forced to violate numerous state and federal laws related to unauthorized access of information.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The issue before us is relatively straightforward, that being whether the award compels the Commission to commit an illegal act. If the award does not compel the Commission to do so, then we must conclude that the trial court erred in holding that the arbitrator exceeded his power.

(R.R. at 701a.) The trial court found that the small size of the Department effectively prevented Hobart from being able to perform his duties without access to JNET, CLEAN, and PennDOT's system. To that point, the trial court opined:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-44\">\n   Department is a small police department. The whole department is a secured area for JNET access. Most importantly, Department would violate laws by allowing Mr. Hobart into the facility unaccompanied. There are only two officers on a shift. Department cannot have half of a shift not fully completing its police duties. Nor can the Department afford to require the other member of the shift to provide continuous monitoring of Mr. Hobart to prevent him from receiving data to which he is not entitled. If Mr. Hobart violates the access prohibitions imposed, it could lead to suspension of Department's JNET privileges or, worse, Department's violation of federal and state criminal statutes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 699a-700a.) While the FOP is correct in asserting that a valid MPOETC certification permits an individual to work as a municipal police officer, it does not lend support to a conclusion that the trial\n   court erred. The award did not reinstate Hobart to a generalized police officer position. Rather, the award reinstated Hobart to a police officer position\n   <em>\n    within the Department\n   </em>\n   . According to the unrebutted testimony of Chief Horner and Sergeant Wood, the Department's structure and makeup demand that all of its police officers have access to JNET, CLEAN, and PennDOT's system, because officers for the Department use them on a near-daily basis. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 401a-16a, 459a.) It is undisputed that, at present, Hobart cannot lawfully, directly or indirectly, have access to those systems.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , 75 Pa.

Hobart, therefore, is currently unable to perform the duties of the position to which the award reinstated him without placing himself and the Department in a position to violate these laws. Accordingly, the trial court did not err insomuch as it held that implementing the arbitrator's award without reinstating access to these systems would compel the Commission to commit an illegal act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Notwithstanding this conclusion, we will vacate the trial court's order. Although we find no fault with the trial court's determination that Hobart cannot currently return to the Department as a police officer, as the award provides, it is not at all clear to us that the award can never be implemented. What is currently before us is a dispute over implementation of an arbitrator's award, not the facial illegality of the award itself. The record created before the trial court reveals that Hobart\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   have available administrative remedies before the state agencies administering the systems in question to regain access and thus be able to fulfill the duties of a police officer within the Department.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   For instance, Webb, the Executive Director of JNET, testified that in order for OA to reconsider the suspension of an agency employee's access, the agency sponsor would have to request that it be reconsidered. (R.R. at 198a.) He further testified that an officer may file an individual appeal with his agency sponsor, and the agency sponsor has the option of whether or not to pursue the appeal with the JNET office on behalf of the individual. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 199a-200a.) In this instance, Hobart's agency sponsor is a member of the Department, although the record does not indicate precisely whom. If the agency sponsor wishes to pursue the appeal, he must request that JNET reconsider its decision and reinstate the individual's access. Webb testified that, as of the date of his deposition (August 15, 2017), OA had not received an official request to appeal Hobart's suspension. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 200a-201a.) Thus, although Chief Horner testified that he sent a letter to Webb, Lawson, and Nicholas Reich, security administrator of JNET, at least one of the recipients did not treat the letter as an official appeal. The record before the trial court, therefore, suggests that the Department may not have taken all the steps necessary to seek restoration of Hobart's access to the various information systems. Furthermore, the Court takes judicial notice that Hobart has filed an action in this Court's original jurisdiction against OA, PSP, and PennDOT, asserting violations of due process with regard to the termination of his access. Through that action, Hobart seeks a declaration as to his rights to challenge termination of his access and/or to reinstate access.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Although we cannot predict whether any efforts by the Department or Hobart to\n   reinstate Hobart's access to JNET, CLEAN, and PennDOT's system will prove successful, we similarly will not predict their failure. By vacating the trial court's order and allowing the Department and Hobart a reasonable period of time to seek reinstatement of his access to these systems, we account for the possibility that the current legal impediment to implementation of the arbitrator's award might be removed. To be clear, we are not requiring the Department (or its agency sponsor) to advocate on Hobart's behalf or press the merits of Hobart's appeal. Rather, we are ordering the Department to perform any ministerial obligation it has to advance the proceedings. This outcome is consistent with our decision in\n   <em>\n    City of Beaver Falls v.

As a result, Perretta's employer terminated his employment for conduct unbecoming an officer. Perretta, through his union, filed a grievance, and the matter proceeded to arbitration. By an award issued in 2009, the arbitrator converted the termination into a one-year disciplinary suspension without pay and directed that the employer reinstate Perretta. The arbitrator also retained jurisdiction over the matter to settle any disputes related to the award. The employer filed a petition to vacate with a trial court, which the trial court denied. Complying with the award, the employer informed Perretta of its intention to reinstate him via a letter sent in 2010. The employer, however, conditioned Perretta's reinstatement on (1) Perretta receiving recertification from MPOETC, and (2) Perretta undergoing a medical and psychological evaluation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The psychological evaluation revealed that Perretta was not psychologically fit or capable of exercising appropriate judgment in the line of duty. Based upon this, MPOETC informed the employer that it would not be taking any formal action regarding recertifying Perretta, as the results of his psychological evaluation rendered him ineligible for certification. In turn, the employer opted to take no further action regarding Perretta's reinstatement. Thereafter, the arbitrator held a compliance hearing, after which he issued a supplemental award. The arbitrator determined that Perretta's MPOETC certification lapsed due to the employer's delay in implementing the original award and ordered the employer to pay Perretta back pay until the employer reinstated him. Further, the arbitrator directed the employer to act in good faith to meet any certification requirements that were necessary for purposes of recertifying Perretta. The employer filed with a trial court a petition to vacate the supplemental award, and the trial court denied the petition. The employer appealed to this Court, arguing that the supplemental award compelled the employer to commit an illegal act by reinstating a police officer who does not have MPOETC certification. The employer asserted that Perretta would not be able to receive recertification. On this issue, we opined:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-51\">\n   With regard to the matter of reinstatement, the [employer] asserts that the Arbitrator's award directs the [employer] to perform an illegal act, because it directs that [Perretta] be reinstated despite the [MPOETC's] determination that [Perretta] is ineligible to be recertified as a police officer based on his psychological evaluation. We disagree. The Arbitrator found that the [employer] failed to comply with the 2009 award, because the 2010 offer of reinstatement did not \"amount to a clear, unequivocal and unconditional offer of current employment\" and thus was not a \"valid and\n   sufficient offer.\" As the trial court aptly observed, [MPOETC] did not make a ruling on this issue, but, at best, merely rendered an informal advisory opinion. Indeed, in its letter to the [employer], [MPOETC] acknowledged that \"since [Perretta] is neither currently certified nor had a pending application for certification, [MPOETC] will not be taking any formal action at this time.\" Furthermore, it is undisputed that the [employer] failed to apply to have [Perretta] recertified, thereby depriving [MPOETC] of the opportunity to issue a formal ruling. We, therefore, cannot conclude that [Perretta] was ineligible to be recertified as a police officer. As such, we cannot further conclude that the Arbitrator's award directs the [employer] to perform an illegal act. Until such time as [MPOETC] acts on an application for certification of [Perretta], this issue is premature.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <em>\n    Beaver Falls\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7302396\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/77/75/\">\n    77 A.3d at 82\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Here, just as in\n   <em>\n    Beaver Falls\n   </em>\n   , it is premature to decide whether the award compels the Commission to perform an illegal act, such that it should be vacated by a court. This is a matter of award implementation. Until such a time that Hobart and the Department have exhausted all avenues of relief to regain Hobart's access to JNET, CLEAN, and PennDOT's system, the question of whether the award can be implemented without violation of law cannot be decided finally. We, therefore, will vacate the trial court's order and remand the matter to the trial court with instruction to stay the matter. Once Hobart and the Department have exhausted all avenues to reinstate Hobart's access to these systems, the trial court may then consider the question of whether the Commission can implement the award without violating the law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Trial Court's Scope of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Next, we address the FOP's argument that the trial court exceeded its narrow scope of review by considering matters such as the convenience to the Commission, the financial impact on the Department and its taxpayers, and the underlying facts of the arbitration. In its opinion, the trial court dismissed any notion that Hobart would be able to work in a capacity that does not expose him to restricted information, calling such a solution \"ridiculous.\" (R.R. at 700a.) In so doing, the trial court opined:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-56\">\n   The only way [the Commission] could have Mr. Hobart as a police officer is by providing him with a special room with no computer access to JNET. [The Commission] would then have to pay Mr. Hobart a police officer's salary for not performing his work and another officer for doing his own job and completing Mr. Hobart's work. This scenario would be a farce. Both [the Commission] and its citizens would be inconvenienced and overtaxed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-123\">\n    JNET is the Commonwealth's primary public safety and criminal justice computer information system.

The FOP argues that these considerations are beyond the trial court's scope of review.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    As previously mentioned, the trial court's scope of review is one of narrow certiorari. This narrow review precludes the use of public policy considerations to vacate an arbitration award.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Pa. State Police v. Pa.

In rejecting the application of public policy considerations, our Supreme Court opined:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n    We are unable to accept this position. Broadening the narrow certiorari scope of review to include a provision which\n    would allow the courts to interfere with an arbitrator's award whenever that award could be deemed to be violative of \"public policy\"-however that nebulous concept may be defined by a particular appellate court-would greatly expand the scope of review in these matters. If we were to adopt the ... recommendation to include this ill-defined term within the narrow certiorari scope of review, we would markedly increase the judiciary's role in Act 111 arbitration awards. This would undercut the legislature's intent of preventing protracted litigation in this arena.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11658168,837181\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/741/1248/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    While we agree that the convenience to the Commission, the financial impact on the Department and its taxpayers, and the underlying facts of the arbitration are matters beyond the scope of the trial court's review, we do not conclude that these considerations are reversible error. The crux of the trial court's decision centered on the fact that the award compelled the Department to commit an illegal act. The discussion regarding the burden to the Department and the taxpayers is auxiliary to that main holding, independent of the trial court's conclusion.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    <strong>\n     C. Error in Factfinding\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    In the same vein, we also dispose of the FOP's third argument-that the trial court erred by basing its decision on an incorrect factual finding. Specifically, the FOP takes issue with the trial court finding that Hobart \"sexually stalk[ed] victims, including a fellow officer,\" and that reinstating Hobart would compel the Commission to force a victim to work with Hobart. (R.R. at 699a.) Although the parties agree that this finding is unsupported by record evidence, we determine that it played no significant part in the trial court's conclusion that reinstating Hobart would compel the Commission to commit an illegal act.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    <strong>\n     D. Substituting Judgment\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    Finally, the FOP argues that the trial court erred by substituting its judgment for that of the arbitrator. Specifically, the FOP argues that the trial court \"felt the arbitrator should have considered the results and impact of his decision.\" (Appellant's Br. at 17.) By analyzing the results and impact of the award-including the burden to the Department and the taxpayers-the FOP argues that the trial court replaced the arbitrator's judgment with its own.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    It is well-settled that a court may not substitute its own judgment for that of an arbitrator.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Sch.

Here, we conclude that did not happen. Rather, the trial court evaluated ramifications of award implementation not contemplated by the arbitrator. The trial court sought to answer if the award compelled the Commission to commit an illegal act. The arbitrator provided no judgment with respect to this question. While the trial court unnecessarily explored other ramifications of the award-\n    <em>\n     e.g.\n    </em>\n    , the burden to the Department and the taxpayers-these considerations were peripheral to the central conclusion. The trial court, therefore, did not substitute its judgment for that of the arbitrator.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    <strong>\n     IV. CONCLUSION\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    For the reasons set forth above, we reject the majority of the FOP's contentions on appeal. Nonetheless, because implementation of the arbitrator's award in this case is possible if Hobart's access to JNET, CLEAN, and PennDOT's system is restored, we will vacate the trial court's award and remand with direction that the\n    trial court stay the matter to allow the Department and Hobart to pursue with the appropriate agencies restoration of Hobart's access to those systems.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      ORDER\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    AND NOW, this 31\n    <sup>\n     st\n    </sup>\n    day of October, 2018, the order of the Court of Common Pleas of Berks County (trial court) is VACATED, and the matter is REMANDED to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with the accompanying opinion.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    Jurisdiction relinquished.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    DISSENTING OPINION BY SENIOR JUDGE PELLEGRINI\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    The Court of Common Pleas of Berks County's (trial court) decision reversing the arbitration is cogent and well-reasoned. I wish I could affirm that decision. The majority opinion amending the arbitrator's decision in an attempt to make it more palatable is imaginative but impermissible. Yet I still wish I could join. However, because I am obligated to do so, I would reverse the trial court and reinstate the arbitrator's award. Let me explain.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    <strong>\n     I.\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    The underlying facts are not in dispute. Charles Hobart (Hobart) was a police officer for the Northern Berks Regional Police Commission (Commission). Hobart had a file at work containing approximately 80 pages of documents that included photographs of women in lingerie, bathing suits and other revealing attire. Several of the photographs showed women with exposed breast and vaginal areas and some showed women in bondage. Included within the file were several pages from the Pennsylvania Justice Network (JNET) system\n    <footnotemark>\n     1\n    </footnotemark>\n    containing photographs and information of five civilians and a fellow female police officer in the department. There is no dispute that Hobart used these photographs for masturbation in the Department's men's room.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    There is also no dispute that because of his misuse of the JNET system, Hobart's access to the Department of Transportation (PennDOT), JNET and the Commonwealth Law Enforcement Assistance Network (CLEAN)\n    <footnotemark>\n     2\n    </footnotemark>\n    portals, which all police officers need to perform their jobs, was permanently revoked.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    Notwithstanding all this, the arbitrator found there was not just cause for Hobart's termination, even though his access to the portals was permanently revoked and he may never be able to use those systems to apprehend criminals, which essentially means that he cannot give full value of his services for the salary that is paid to him by taxpayers.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    If this were the outcome of a jury trial, I would reverse the jury's verdict because no reasonable person could find that Hobart's conduct in gathering pictures from official sources - including those of a fellow female police officer - so that he could masturbate in the Department's men's room, causing him to be permanently banned from access to the PennDOT, JNET and CLEAN portals necessary for\n    an officer to perform his job, is not just cause for dismissal.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    Even though I would hold that no reasonable person would agree with the arbitrator's outcome, I cannot do what any reasonable person would do and reverse the arbitrator because this Court is forced to apply the narrow certiorari test rather than the judgment notwithstanding the verdict (nov)/error of law standard that the General Assembly provided to be used in reviewing public employee grievance arbitration, including grievance arbitration involving police officers.

Section 7302(b) of the UAA provides the standard of review for grievance arbitrations arising out of a public collective bargaining agreement. Quoted in full, it provides:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n    (a) General rule.-An agreement to arbitrate a controversy on a nonjudicial basis shall be conclusively presumed to be an agreement to arbitrate pursuant to Subchapter B (relating to common law arbitration) unless the agreement to arbitrate is in writing and expressly provides for arbitration pursuant to this subchapter or any other similar statute, in which case the arbitration shall be governed by this subchapter.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n    (b)\n    <strong>\n     Collective bargaining agreements.-This subchapter shall apply to a collective bargaining agreement to arbitrate controversies between employers and employees or their respective representatives only where the arbitration pursuant to this subchapter is consistent with any statute regulating labor and management relations.\n    </strong>\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n    (c) Government contracts.-This subchapter shall apply to any written contract to which a government unit of this Commonwealth is a party to the same extent as if the government unit were a private person, except that where a contract to which the Commonwealth government is a party provides for arbitration of controversies but does not provide for arbitration pursuant to any specified statutory provision, the arbitration shall be governed by this subchapter.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n    (d) Special application.-\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n    (1) Paragraph (2) shall be applicable where:\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n    (i) The Commonwealth government submits a controversy to arbitration.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n    (ii)\n    <strong>\n     A political subdivision submits a controversy with an employee or a representative of employees to arbitration.\n    </strong>\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n    (iii) Any person has been required by law to submit or to agree to submit a controversy to arbitration pursuant to this subchapter.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n    (2) Where this paragraph is applicable a court in reviewing an arbitration award pursuant to this subchapter shall,\n    <strong>\n     notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, modify or correct the award where the award is contrary to law and is such that had it been a verdict of a jury the court would have entered a different judgment or a judgment notwithstanding the verdict.\n    </strong>\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 7302 (emphases added).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    The reason I cannot apply the judgment nov/error of law standard that governs\n    grievance arbitrations, including those involving police officers, is because our Supreme Court has issued several decisions that preclude applying the legislatively prescribed mandate.

Shortly after Act 111 was enacted, our Supreme Court in\n    <em>\n     City of Washington v. Police Department of Washington (Washington Arbitration)\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1926078\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/436/168/\">\n     436 Pa. 168\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=259%20A.2d%20437\">\n     259 A.2d 437\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 441 (1969), held that the narrow certiorari\n    scope of review applied to an appeal of an Act 111 interest arbitration award.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-103\">\n    At that time, the narrow certiorari test was common. There were many categories of administrative decisions where the General Assembly had stated there should be no right of appeal to a court from that administrative determination. Other statutes were silent as to whether a party had the right to appeal the administrative decision. Even though the statute prohibited any appeal or did not authorize an appeal, our Supreme Court dealt with this matter by adopting rules that addressed each of those situations. It provided for a narrow certiorari scope of review for appeals brought when the statute said there would be no appeal from an agency decision. However, where the statute was silent on the right to appeal, our Supreme Court adopted a broad certiorari standard, similar to the administrative agency scope of review. No matter which standard of review applied, an appeal was by petition for allowance of appeal and not by right. This is why the narrow certiorari test was applied to review police and firefighter arbitration awards.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-104\">\n    After Article V, Section 9 of the Pennsylvania Constitution\n    <footnotemark>\n     12\n    </footnotemark>\n    was adopted in 1968, providing for the right of appeal of all common pleas and administrative agency decisions, the narrow and broad certiorari standards of review were abandoned as no longer necessary and the rules that created those standards are no longer extant. All other appeals previously not permitted were now allowed under the statutory standard of review, such as that in the Administrative Agency Law.\n    <footnotemark>\n     13\n    </footnotemark>\n    The only appeals for which the vestigial court-created narrow certiorari standard still apply are appeals from police and firefighter arbitration awards.\n    <footnotemark>\n     14\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-105\">\n    <strong>\n     B.\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-106\">\n    The issue of whether police grievance arbitration awards as opposed to interest arbitration awards were governed by narrow certiorari was not decided until almost 30 years after the enactment of Act 111. In\n    <em>\n     Betancourt\n    </em>\n    , our Supreme Court, while acknowledging that Act 111 provided detailed procedures for interest arbitration and how it was to be conducted, provided no such direction for grievance arbitration. The Court decided that since Act 111 purportedly authorized grievance arbitration for police and firefighter personnel, it was the intent of the General Assembly in Act 111 to impose a restraint on judicial activism in order to ensure swift resolution of disputes involving police and firefighters that made the narrow certiorari standard applicable, not the judgment nov/error of law/essence test. It stated:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-107\">\n    We are not persuaded that the legislature intended\n    <em>\n     grievance\n    </em>\n    arbitration awards to be subject to broader judicial review than are\n    <em>\n     interest\n    </em>\n    arbitration awards. There is no indication, either in the Act itself or in the history of the Act, that the legislature intended appeals from grievance arbitration awards to be\n    subject to greater judicial involvement than interest arbitration awards. We will not now allow a scope of review [essence test] which is markedly broader than narrow certiorari for Act 111 grievance arbitration. To do so would allow the courts to interfere impermissibly with the legislative scheme as the courts would be able to alter Act 111 arbitration awards by means of an unauthorized expansion of the proper scope of review. Such a result would run counter to the legislature's intent. Thus, we hold that the proper scope of review is narrow certiorari.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-108\">\n    <em>\n     Betancourt\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7864289,472201,7864395,472165\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/656/83/\">\n     656 A.2d at 89\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (emphasis in original).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-109\">\n    As a result of\n    <em>\n     Betancourt,\n    </em>\n    the application of the narrow certiorari test means that courts could not review arbitrator decisions that reinstate police officers who engage in illegal conduct.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Pennsylvania State Police v.

For example, in\n    <em>\n     Bensalem Township v. Bensalem Township Police Benevolent Association\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11447491\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/803/239/\">\n     803 A.2d 239\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (Pa. Cmwlth. 2002), we held that we could not review an arbitrator's award that clearly violated the provisions of the collective bargaining agreement. In that case, the township discharged a police officer who was subsequently reinstated by an arbitrator. The collective bargaining agreement prohibited an arbitrator from awarding monetary relief in excess of one year. The narrow certiorari test prevented the Court from examining an arbitrator's award that not only reinstated the police officer, but awarded him 21 months' back pay and benefits - nine months more than the parties authorized under the collective bargaining agreement.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-111\">\n    <strong>\n     C.\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-112\">\n    I respectfully urge our Supreme Court to reexamine its holding in\n    <em>\n     Betancourt.\n    </em>\n    Making any attempt to divine the intent from Act 111 as to what standard of review should apply is unwarranted. This is especially so when the General Assembly has provided in the UAA, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 7302, in plain and mandatory language, that the judgment nov/error of law standard should be used to review all collective bargaining grievance arbitrations. This was not an accident. When adopting the National Uniform Arbitration Act, the General Assembly inserted 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 7302 into that act to set the judgment nov/error of law standard. It could not be clearer.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-113\">\n    Because the UAA is clear as to the standard of review in grievance arbitration cases, it is not necessary to discuss the factors relied on in\n    <em>\n     Betancourt\n    </em>\n    to justify its adoption of the narrow certiorari test. However, a short discussion of the factors\n    relied on in\n    <em>\n     Betancourt\n    </em>\n    to find that the narrow certiorari test applied are in order. One factor mentioned in\n    <em>\n     Betancourt\n    </em>\n    is that courts would impermissibly interfere with police and firefighter arbitration awards and those appeals would get bogged down in the courts if the judgment nov/error of law/essence test applied. That fear is simply not warranted. Even though the judgment nov/error of law standard allows slightly more judicial oversight than the essence test, it is not an intrusive scope of review. This test was formulated so courts would be deferential to arbitration awards and intervene only where an arbitrator clearly did not satisfy his obligation to interpret the collective bargaining agreement or acted in a way that no reasonable person could accept the outcome. Moreover, the same judicial procedures essentially are followed regardless of whether the arbitration award is reviewed under the narrow certiorari scope of review or the essence test, and the essence test is not mired in protracted litigation.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-114\">\n    Finally, applying the narrow certiorari test does not serve the public interest because it does not allow courts to review arbitration awards to determine whether an award sanctions a police officer's conduct that harms the public, breaches the public trust or brings discredit on the ability of the police department to carry out its functions. If the judgment nov/error of law test applies, courts could review the decision of the arbitrator, a private party, to determine if his decision was against public policy.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Philadelphia Housing Authority v.

The trial court also found that because Hobart would be in the area where the computers were located, he could potentially see data that he was not entitled to see, risking the Commission's continued access to those portals. The trial court found that Hobart sexually stalked a female coworker and that the award would force Hobart's victim to continue working with him.\n    <footnotemark>\n     15\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-118\">\n    The majority, while substantially agreeing with the trial court, nonetheless vacated the order because it found it was premature to decide whether the award putting Hobart back to work compels the Commission to be at risk for losing access to PennDOT, JNET and CLEAN's systems, as well as potential criminal liability if Hobart happens to see any protected data generated by those systems. It then modified the trial court's order finding just cause to dismiss by ordering that until such a time that Hobart and the Department have exhausted all avenues of relief to regain Hobart's access to PennDOT, JNET and CLEAN's systems, the\n    question of whether the award can be implemented without violation of law cannot be decided finally. It then vacated the trial court's order and remanded the matter to the trial court with instruction to stay the matter until Hobart and the Department have exhausted all avenues to reinstate Hobart's access to these systems, at which time the trial court may then consider the question of whether the Commission can implement the award without violating the law. The net effect is that if Hobart does not get his permanent revocations to PennDOT, JNET and CLEAN's systems reversed, then the arbitrator's decision will be reversed.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-119\">\n    I disagree with the majority because nothing that the arbitrator ordered would cause the Commission to commit an illegal act.\n    <footnotemark>\n     16\n    </footnotemark>\n    Nothing in the arbitrator's award requires that the Commission give Hobart access to those portals, only that it continue to employ him as a police officer. Under the award, it is up to the Commission to fashion a position in which Hobart would not have access to that information. While not having access to those portals would limit his usefulness and cause expense and difficulty within the Commission, to fashion such an award does not require the Commission to perform an illegal act. Unfortunately, under the narrow certiorari test, added expense and inconvenience does not justify a reversal of the arbitrator's award.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-120\">\n    While the arbitrator's award is unreasonable, under the narrow certiorari standard, because the arbitrator had the right to determine whether there was just cause for termination, the award did not order the Commission to do anything illegal and there was no deprivation of anyone's constitutional rights, I would reinstate the arbitrator's award and reverse the trial court.
