The respondent filed a motion to dismiss, and the habeas court dismissed the petition, concluding that the petitioner had failed\n   to establish an ex post facto violation because, inter alia, the risk that the petitioner will suffer increased punishment, that is, a longer period of incarceration, as a result of the 2013 amendment is too remote in light of the discretionary nature of risk reduction credit and the fact that such credit, once earned, may be revoked at any time by the respondent for cause. On appeal,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   the petitioner renews his claim of an ex post facto violation. We agree with the petitioner that the ex post facto clause bars the respondent from applying the 2013 amendment to the petitioner, and, accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the habeas court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following undisputed facts and procedural history are relevant to our resolution of the petitioner's appeal. On October 27, 2011, the petitioner violated a restraining order, to which he later pleaded guilty. On December 29, 2011, the petitioner committed several additional offenses for which he was charged with two counts of assault in the first degree, one count of assault in the second degree, and one count of larceny in the third degree. On March 21, 2013, pursuant to a plea agreement, the petitioner entered a plea of nolo contendere to the assault and larceny charges, and, on August 22, 2013, he was sentenced to a total effective term of imprisonment of twenty years followed by five years of special parole. The petitioner also received a sentence of thirty months imprisonment for the restraining order violation, which term was imposed to run concurrently with the first sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In 2011, before the petitioner committed his offenses, the legislature passed No. 11-51 of the 2011 Public Acts (P.A. 11-51), \u00a7 22, codified at General Statutes \u00a7 18-98e. Section 18-98e (a) provides that certain inmates who\n   were convicted of crimes committed on or after October 1, 1994, \"may be eligible to earn risk reduction credit toward a reduction of such person's sentence, in an amount not to exceed five days per month, at the discretion of the Commissioner of Correction ....\" In addition, in 2011, General Statutes (Rev. to 2011) \u00a7 54-125a (b) provided that a person convicted of a violent crime was ineligible for parole until such person served at least 85 percent of the definite sentence imposed. The legislature amended that provision in 2011 to allow the application of \"any risk reduction credit earned under the provisions of [ \u00a7 18-98e ]\"; P.A. 11-51, \u00a7 25; to accelerate the date on which a violent offender would become eligible for parole. Accordingly, when the petitioner\n   committed the offenses for which he is imprisoned, earned risk reduction credit was to be applied by the respondent both to reduce the length of a violent offender's sentence and to advance his or her initial parole eligibility date. See\n   <em>\n    Perez\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Correction\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489956\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/163/597/#p364\">\n    326 Conn. 357\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 364,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489956\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/163/597/#p364\">\n    163 A.3d 597\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017) (\"under the 2011 amendments, earned risk reduction credit was to be applied to an inmate's definite sentence to advance the inmate's end of sentence date, and the parole eligibility date calculated as a percentage of the sentence would advance in similar measure\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In 2013, after the petitioner was sentenced, the legislature again amended \u00a7 54-125a (b) (2), this time by removing the phrase \"less any risk reduction credit earned under the provisions of [\u00a7] 18-98e.\" P.A. 13-3, \u00a7 59. Thus, under the 2013 amendment, violent offenders are still eligible to earn risk reduction credit to reduce their definite sentence, but that credit is no longer applied to advance their initial parole eligibility date. Consequently, when P.A. 13-3, \u00a7 59, became effective on July 1, 2013, inmates convicted of a violent offense thereafter were required to complete 85 percent of their definite sentence before they became eligible\n   for parole. See\n   <em>\n    Perez\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Correction\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489956\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/163/597/#p364\">\n    326 Conn. at 365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489956\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/163/597/#p364\">\n    163 A.3d 597\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 2016, the petitioner filed an amended petition for a writ of habeas corpus, claiming that the 2013 amendment to \u00a7 54-125a (b) (2), as applied to him, violates the ex post facto clause because that amendment retroactively increased the amount of time he would be required to serve before becoming eligible for parole. At his habeas trial, the petitioner presented the testimony of Michelle Deveau, a records specialist with the Department of Correction (department), who testified that the petitioner at that time was eligible for risk reduction credit and that, as of the date of the habeas trial, had earned 158 such credits, the maximum number he could have earned at that point in his sentence. Deveau further testified that, although discretionary, risk reduction credit is awarded by the respondent routinely and that, each month, the department's computer system automatically posts it to the timesheets of eligible inmates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The petitioner also adduced testimony from Heidi Palliardi, a supervisor with the department's Sentence Calculation and Interstate Management Unit, concerning the risk reduction credit program. She testified that risk reduction credit is governed by department administrative directive 4.2A and that, to remain eligible to receive such credit, inmates must follow all institutional rules, remain free of any disciplinary reports and comply with their individual \"offender accountability plan,\" which is provided to every inmate after sentencing. Palliardi further explained that risk reduction credit is subject to forfeiture, after notice and a hearing, for failure to comply with any of the aforementioned program requirements. Finally, the petitioner presented the testimony of Richard Sparaco, the executive director of the Board of Pardons and Paroles (board), who explained that, under the 2013 amendment to \u00a7 54-125a\n   (b) (2), \"the [d]epartment ... no longer could apply risk reduction earned credits to [advance] the parole eligibility date for anyone [who] the board has designated ... a violent offender.\" Sparaco also stated that parole is granted at the initial parole hearing in approximately 55 percent of all cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Following the habeas trial, the court issued a memorandum of decision and dismissed the petition. The court concluded that the petitioner had failed to establish an ex post facto violation because, inter alia, the risk that the petitioner would suffer increased punishment as a result of\n   the 2013 amendment to \u00a7 54-125a (b) (2) was entirely speculative due to the fact that the award of risk reduction credit is discretionary and the fact that such credit may be revoked by the respondent for cause at any time. We agree with the petitioner that, contrary to the determination of the habeas court, the prohibition of the ex post facto clause bars the retroactive application of the 2013 amendment to \u00a7 54-125a (b) (2) to him.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Before addressing the merits of the petitioner's claim, we set forth the governing legal principles. The ex post facto clause of the United States constitution prohibits retroactive application of a law that \"inflicts a greater punishment, than the law annexed to the crime, when committed.\" (Emphasis omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Calder\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Bull\n   </em>\n   , 3 U.S. (3 Dall.) 386, 390,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11738091\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/3/386/\">\n    1 L.Ed. 648\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1798). In other words, the clause \"forbids the application of any new punitive measure to a crime already consummated, to the detriment or material disadvantage of the wrongdoer.\"\n   <em>\n    Lindsey\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Washington\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"547734\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/301/397/#p401\">\n    301 U.S. 397\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 401,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"547734\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/301/397/#p401\">\n    57 S.Ct. 797\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"547734\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/301/397/#p401\">\n    81 L.Ed. 1182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1937). Although a defendant claiming an ex post facto violation need not establish with certainty that retroactive application of a new law will result in greater or more onerous punishment, the United States Supreme Court has \"made it clear that mere speculation or conjecture that a change in law will retrospectively increase the punishment for a crime will not suffice to establish a violation of the [e]x [p]ost [f]acto [c]lause.

As we previously discussed, the habeas court concluded that that risk was too speculative and attenuated to warrant relief under the ex post facto clause because the granting of risk reduction credit is discretionary and the respondent can revoke those credits at any time for cause. In considering whether the habeas court was correct in its analysis, it is instructive to examine cases in which changes to parole eligibility rules were determined\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   to have violated the ex post facto clause on the ground that the risk of increased punishment was deemed too\n   speculative and attenuated.

It clearly does so by eliminating risk reduction credit from that calculation. Indeed, the petitioner has consistently earned the maximum number of risk reduction credits that were available to him, and the respondent has provided no reason to believe either that the petitioner will be denied risk reduction\n   credit in the future or that any credit that he earns or already has earned is likely to be revoked.

Furthermore, the respondent's assertions cannot be squared with the controlling case law previously discussed, which makes eminently clear that the rules governing parole eligibility are part of the law annexed to the crime for purposes of the ex post facto clause.

As we previously explained, however, the undisputed testimony adduced at the petitioner's habeas trial belies this contention. That evidence established that, although discretionary and subject to revocation for cause, risk reduction credits are awarded by the respondent routinely and are revoked only for acts of institutional misconduct; moreover, the petitioner has earned all such credits for which he was eligible, and, to date, he has not forfeited any of those credits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Notably, the respondent has failed to identify a single case in which a court has concluded that eliminating good time credits from the calculation of an offender's\n   initial parole eligibility dates did not violate the ex post facto clause merely because the credits at issue were discretionary rather than mandatory, and our independent research has not revealed any such case. This is not surprising for the reasons set forth by the Maryland Court of Appeals in\n   <em>\n    Secretary, Dept. of Public Safety &amp; Correctional Services\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Demby\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"976439\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/390/580/\">\n    390 Md. 580\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"976439\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/390/580/\">\n    890 A.2d 310\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2006). In that case, the court stated in relevant part: \"The nature of the special project credits ... is irrelevant for the purposes of [the] ex post facto analysis. The focus of [the] analysis is not on whether these credits were mandatory or discretionary but, rather, whether the amendments to the regulations [that provide] these credits [have] the effect of lengthening [the] respondents' sentences and [are] more 'onerous' than the prior law.... [T]he sentences of those individuals ... whose qualifying crimes have been changed to disqualifying crimes by the amendments, have clearly been lengthened.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \"[The court does] not find the increased punishment caused by the amendments ... to be 'speculative and attenuated.' ... [T]he case from which that language originates,\n   <em>\n    Morales\n   </em>\n   ... is factually distinguishable from the present case. In\n   <em>\n    Morales\n   </em>\n   , the statutory change affected the frequency of parole eligibility hearings for inmates by giving parole officials the ability, after meeting several procedural safeguards, to postpone an inmate's yearly evaluation by up to three years when potential safety issues, among other things, [are] a concern, and parole officials [believe] the inmate would not be eligible for parole during the extended period regardless. [Morales'] ex post facto claims were rejected as the chances of an increased punishment were 'speculative and attenuated.' [In this case, the] respondents will clearly serve a longer period of time as a result of the amendments, and the determination of that increase is far easier than in\n   <em>\n    Morales\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \"Moreover ... the language included in the regulation providing that, 'this section may not be interpreted ... to mean that an inmate who is eligible to receive the credits described in this section has a right to these credits or ... will continue\n   to receive these credits in the future,' does not provide sufficient notice to inmates for the purposes of the ex post facto prohibition....

Id., at 66. The court gave two reasons for its decision, one of which was the discretionary nature of the credits. Specifically, the court stated: The petitioner's \"argument that the [d]irective increased his punishment by restricting his eligibility to earn good time credit assumes that before the [d]irective [ General Statutes \u00a7] 18-7a (c) automatically entitled all inmates to be eligible to earn good time credit. That assumption is erroneous. Unlike the statutes at issue in both\n   <em>\n    Weaver\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Lynce\n   </em>\n   , [\u00a7] 18-7a (c) does not automatically confer the right to earn good time credit on all inmates. Rather, the statute [provides] only that inmates 'may' earn good time credit ... thereby rendering good time credit a discretionary matter....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \"In addition, and again unlike\n   <em>\n    Lynce\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Weaver\n   </em>\n   , the [d]irective was not applied retroactively to [the petitioner]. No good time credit earned by [the petitioner] prior to the [d]irective was forfeited, and [the petitioner]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   was not classified as a [gang member] until after the [d]irective was in effect. By its terms, the [d]irective concerned ongoing and future-not past-conduct.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Citation omitted.) Id.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The present case is distinguishable from\n   <em>\n    Abed\n   </em>\n   in two crucial respects. First, it is undisputed that the 2013 amendment is being applied to the petitioner retroactively, not punishing him for acts committed while he was in prison, as was the case in\n   <em>\n    Abed\n   </em>\n   . Second, in contrast to the petitioner in\n   <em>\n    Abed\n   </em>\n   , the petitioner in the present case is not claiming a right to earn risk reduction credits. Indeed, he acknowledges that the award of such credits is discretionary with the respondent and, further, that, ultimately, his opportunity to continue to earn them is a matter of legislative grace. He claims only that the risk reduction credits that he does accumulate over the years-however few or many that may be-must be applied to reduce his definite sentence\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   to advance his initial parole eligibility date in accordance with the law in existence at the time of his\n   offense, which law did not give the respondent discretion to refuse to include those credits in calculating his initial parole eligibility date. In other words, the\n   petitioner is claiming a right only to the more beneficial formula for calculating his parole eligibility date, not to the credits on which that formula is predicated.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Our conclusion that the 2013 amendment to \u00a7 54-125a (b) (2), as applied to the petitioner, violates the ex post facto clause is reinforced by the legislative history surrounding the enactment. As the habeas court noted, many legislators who supported the 2013 amendment did so out of concern that the prior version of \u00a7 54-125a was too lenient, at least with respect to violent offenders. Those legislators wanted to eliminate risk reduction credit from the calculation of the initial parole eligibility date for violent offenders to ensure that they could not be paroled prior to completing 85 percent of their definite sentences. This legislative purpose bears consideration in the present case for the same reason that the court in\n   <em>\n    Lynce\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Mathis\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11595864\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/519/433/#p442\">\n    519 U.S. at 433\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11595864\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/519/433/#p442\">\n    117 S.Ct. 891\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , reviewed similar legislative history in discussing its decision in\n   <em>\n    Morales\n   </em>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Lynce\n   </em>\n   , the court considered\n   it relevant that the retroactive change to the parole eligibility rules at issue in\n   <em>\n    Morales\n   </em>\n   was not intended to prevent the early release of prisoners. Specifically, the court in\n   <em>\n    Lynce\n   </em>\n   stated: \"[The court] concluded [in\n   <em>\n    Morales\n   </em>\n   that] the change at issue had neither the purpose nor the effect of increasing the quantum of punishment. Whether such a purpose alone would be a sufficient basis for concluding that a law violated the [e]x [p]ost [f]acto [c]lause when it actually had no such effect is a question the [c]ourt has never addressed. Moreover, in\n   <em>\n    Morales\n   </em>\n   , [the court's] statements regarding purpose did not refer to the purpose behind the creation of the original sentencing scheme; they referred instead to the question whether, in changing that sentencing scheme, the legislature intended to lengthen the inmate's sentence.\n   <em>\n    To the extent that any purpose might be relevant in this case, it would only be the purpose behind the\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    new statute\n   </em>\n   ].\n   <em>\n    Here, unlike in Morales, there is no evidence that the legislature's change in the sentencing scheme was merely to save time or money. Rather, it is quite obvious that the retrospective change was intended to prevent the early release of prisoners convicted of\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    murder related\n   </em>\n   ]\n   <em>\n    offenses who had accumulated overcrowding credits\n   </em>\n   .\" (Emphasis added.)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11595864\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/519/433/#p442\">\n    Id., at 444-45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11595864\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/519/433/#p442\">\n    117 S.Ct. 891\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It is similarly\n   clear that the 2013 amendment to \u00a7 54-125a (b) (2) was intended to prevent the early release of certain offenders and not to conserve time or resources.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   It is true, of course, that only a relatively small percentage of inmates-namely, those inmates who, like the petitioner, are incarcerated for committing a violent crime between 2011 and 2013-will be affected by our holding today. Moreover, the only relief to which those inmates are entitled is parole\n   <em>\n    consideration\n   </em>\n   prior to completion of 85 percent of their sentence; whether to\n   <em>\n    grant\n   </em>\n   parole at that time is a decision that remains solely within the broad discretion of the board.

With respect to the court's first reason, the 2011 amendment to General Statutes (Rev. to 2011) \u00a7 54a-125a (b) (2) clearly treated earned risk reduction credit as an exception to the requirement that a violent offender must serve 85 percent of his or her sentence before becoming eligible for parole consideration.

With respect to the habeas court's second reason for rejecting the petitioner's claim, although department officials necessarily have broad leeway in determining how best to administer this state's prisons, it is axiomatic that that discretion does not extend to violating the constitutional rights of sentenced prisoners, including, of course, the rights granted to such prisoners under the ex post facto clause.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    Other courts similarly have concluded that a statute that disqualified an inmate from earning good time credits on the basis of his or her membership in a prison gang did not violate the ex post facto clause because the statute did not increase the punishment for the original offense but, rather, constituted punishment for conduct occurring after the inmate entered prison.

We reject this claim. In applying the ex post facto clause, our concern is not with what the petitioner may have been told at the time of his plea or sentencing but, rather, with the law applicable at the time he committed his offenses. As the Appellate Court has stated, \"for a law to violate the prohibition [of the ex post facto clause], it must feature some change from the terms of a law in existence at the time of the criminal act. That feature is entirely sensible, as a core purpose in prohibiting ex post facto laws is to ensure fair notice to a person of the consequences of criminal behavior. As ... the United States Supreme Court [has explained], laws that impose a greater punishment after the commission of a crime than annexed to the crime\n    <em>\n     at the time of its commission\n    </em>\n    run afoul of the ex post facto prohibition because such laws implicate the central concerns of the ex post facto clause: the lack of fair notice and governmental restraint when the legislature increases punishment beyond what was prescribed\n    <em>\n     when the crime was consummated\n    </em>\n    .\n    <em>\n     Weaver\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Graham\n    </em>\n    , [supra,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6181086\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/450/24/#p29\">\n     450 U.S. at 30\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6181086\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/450/24/#p29\">\n     101 S.Ct. 960\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ].\" (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n    <em>\n     Petaway\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Commissioner of Correction\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=160%20Conn.%20App.%20727\">\n     160 Conn.
