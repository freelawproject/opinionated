The defendants, Daniel Botoff and Laura Botoff, appeal from the trial court's judgment rendered in favor of the plaintiff, Michael Errichetti, entering an injunction pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-480,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   which required the defendants to remove\n   the fence that they had constructed on their property and to restore the surrounding area. On appeal, the defendants claim that the court erred by (1) finding the second and third elements of \u00a7 52-480 satisfied, namely, a malicious erection of the structure and the intention to injure the\n   enjoyment of the adjacent landowner's property, and (2) ordering the defendants to restore the area in which the fence was erected to its previous condition. We disagree, and, accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The trial court found the following facts that are relevant to this appeal. To aid the reader, we include from a trial exhibit (plaintiff's exhibit 5) a diagram of the properties at issue. \"B\" identifies the defendants' property; \"E\" identifies the plaintiff's property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Since 1993, the plaintiff and his wife have owned and resided at a property located at 86 Rockwood Lane in Greenwich. In 2011, the defendants purchased, and have since resided at, a property located at 5 Dogwood Lane in Greenwich. Both properties are located in a two acre zoning district. Part of the defendants' backyard abuts part of the plaintiff's yard that lies to the north of his house. The defendants' property is bounded\n   to the northeast by property belonging to the Betters, to the west by property belonging to the Zorthians, and to the south by both the plaintiff's property and property belonging to the plaintiff's neighbor to the west, the Mickleys. The parties share a common boundary of 160 feet. In 2014, the defendants built a wooden stockade style fence along a 103 foot portion of this 160 foot boundary.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   At trial, the plaintiff described the area surrounding his home. The trial court found that to the northwest of the plaintiff's house is a \"natural wooded area, most of which is wetlands,\" that covers part of the plaintiff's, the defendants', the Zorthians', and the Mickleys' properties. The wooded area creates a forty to sixty foot buffer between the parties' properties. A stream flows through this area on its way to Long Island Sound, and an old farmer's wall runs along the parties' shared boundary. The parties' properties each slope up from the stream to their respective homes. In 2004, the plaintiff and his wife renovated their house so that several main rooms offered views of the wooded area. According to the plaintiff, prior to the erection of the fence, he had \"felt that his yard was very tranquil and beautiful\" and \"that he would not have purchased [his] property if the fence had been there already.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   After purchasing the property in 2011, the defendants immediately began renovating the house. According to Laura Botoff's testimony, when she and her husband bought the property, they discussed erecting a fence and potentially installing a pool but decided to complete the work in phases for financial reasons. In 2012, after completing the renovations to the house, they began a landscaping project \"to make sure that [the backyard] was safe for their young sons.\" When the defendants\n   began the landscaping project, they had the property staked for a fence. Laura Botoff testified that she and her husband believed that a fence would provide them with privacy and security, but they did not erect the fence for another two years after having it staked. During this period, the relationship between the parties deteriorated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   At trial, the parties testified about a few interactions they had concerning their shared boundary. According to the plaintiff, in the spring of 2012, he saw the defendants' landscaping project expanding into the wooded area between his and the defendants' homes. Assuming that the defendants had not received the proper approvals from the Greenwich Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Agency (agency), the plaintiff walked over to the defendants' house, introduced himself to Laura Botoff, and explained that she should contact the agency before proceeding with the project. Laura Botoff's recounting of the interaction differs. She testified that he approached her, without first identifying himself, to question her about the nonexistence of wetlands flags.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The next notable incident occurred in 2014, when the plaintiff noticed Laura Botoff walking along their shared boundary with a man who appeared to be measuring for a fence. The plaintiff testified that he went outside to ask Laura Botoff whether they were measuring for a fence and that, when she responded that they were, he reminded her that she needed approval from the agency before building anything in the wetlands. According to the plaintiff, Laura Botoff became agitated, at which point the plaintiff left and called the agency to report the defendants' plans for a fence. Again, Laura Botoff's recollection differs. According to her testimony, she calmly explained that she understood that she could build the fence as long as she received the proper permits, and, after the plaintiff returned to his house, she called the Greenwich Police\n   Department to file a complaint. Shortly after this incident, the defendants applied to the agency for a permit to build the fence. The agency issued the permit over the plaintiff's opposition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In June, 2014, the plaintiff commenced the underlying action, seeking injunctive relief pursuant to \u00a7 52-480. In August, 2014, the defendants installed the fence. In February, 2017, following a two day bench trial, at which all parties and their respective expert appraisers testified, the court rendered judgment in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendants. In its memorandum of decision, the court found that the plaintiff had met his burden of proof with respect to his claim under \u00a7 52-480 and, as injunctive relief, ordered the defendants to remove the fence and to restore the surrounding area to its previous condition. This appeal followed. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On appeal, the defendants first claim that the court erroneously determined that the plaintiff was entitled to an injunction pursuant to \u00a7 52-480. Specifically, they argue that the court, in determining that the defendants had erected the fence maliciously and with the intent to injure the plaintiff's enjoyment of his land, relied on clearly erroneous subordinate findings, namely, that the fence is useless, impairs the plaintiff's enjoyment of his property, and is out of character with the neighborhood. The plaintiff argues, to the contrary, that the evidence adequately supports the court's findings. We agree with the plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   We begin by setting forth the standard of review and relevant law. \"When the factual basis of a trial court's decision ... is challenged, our function is to determine whether, in light of the pleadings and evidence in the whole record, these findings of fact are clearly erroneous.... A finding of fact is clearly erroneous when there is no evidence in the record to support it ... or when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.... In making this determination, every reasonable presumption must be given in favor of the trial court's ruling.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Chase &amp; Chase, LLC\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Waterbury Realty, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6778764\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/138/289/#p296\">\n    138 Conn.

The court began its analysis by stating that, with respect to the first element, \"it is undisputed that the fence is a 'structure' that was erected on the [defendants'] property.\" The court then noted that the remaining\n   <em>\n    Whitlock\n   </em>\n   elements were \"interrelated to a large extent, with the court's findings on the last three [elements] serving to inform the court's analysis on the issues of malice and intent\" and, accordingly, analyzed those three elements first. After concluding that \"the fence has impaired the value of the [plaintiff's] property; the fence is useless to the [defendants]; and the fence has impaired the enjoyment of the [plaintiff's] property,\" the court turned to the remaining two elements. In determining that the plaintiff demonstrated that the defendants had maliciously erected the fence, the court relied on the following facts: \"[T]he [defendants] have erected a stockade style fence along 103 feet of the boundary between their property and the [plaintiff's] property. They did not install a fence anywhere else on their property. The fence was installed across a previously unspoiled wooded area and wetlands. It blocks [the plaintiff's] view of the natural surroundings and intrudes upon his enjoyment of his own property. The fence is out of character for the neighborhood. It does not provide privacy, safety or security to the [defendants]. Accordingly, the court finds that the fence was maliciously erected.\" Similarly, the court based its finding that \"the [defendants] intended to injure the enjoyment of the [plaintiff's] property when they erected the fence\" on the following: \"As\n   the court has found, the fence impairs the value of the [plaintiff's] property and [the plaintiff's] enjoyment of the property. The fence is unsightly and out of character in the parties' residential neighborhood. The fence is useless to the [defendants].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On appeal, the defendants do not directly challenge the court's conclusion that the plaintiff satisfied the last three\n   <em>\n    Whitlock\n   </em>\n   elements. Instead, the defendants challenge the court's \"subordinate findings\" of uselessness, impairment of the plaintiff's enjoyment of his property, and the fence being out of character with the neighborhood, to the extent that those findings support the court's conclusions that the fence was erected maliciously and with the intent to injure the plaintiff's enjoyment of his land. We address these \"subordinate findings\" in turn.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Initially, we note that when determining whether the plaintiff has met his burden with respect to the second and third elements of the\n   <em>\n    Whitlock\n   </em>\n   test, the court does not \"journey deep into the defendant's heart.\"\n   <em>\n    Geiger\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Carey\n   </em>\n   , Superior Court, judicial district of Litchfield, Docket No. CV-11-5007327-S,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%201283233\">\n    2015 WL 1283233\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (February 25, 2015) (reprinted at\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489081\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/154/1093/#p487\">\n    170 Conn.

In determining that the fence \"does not provide privacy, safety or security\" to the defendants and is, instead, useless, the court relied on the findings of fact that it had recited when concluding that the plaintiff had satisfied the fifth\n   <em>\n    Whitlock\n   </em>\n   element, i.e., uselessness of the structure.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The defendants rely primarily on Laura Botoff's testimony as support for their argument that the court's finding of uselessness was clearly erroneous.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   As an initial matter, the defendants seem to suggest that uselessness of a structure cannot be found if the owner of the structure merely articulates an ostensibly useful purpose. We reject this argument. Uselessness under \u00a7 52-480 focuses on whether the structure serves an actual use, not whether the defendants can merely assert a purpose for erecting the structure.

For instance,\n   she stated that the fence \"deters other people from coming into the yard and it allows for the children to feel more secure because we do have privacy ....\" Further, she testified that the fence in question, combined with the deer fence erected on the Betters' property and the wetlands separating their property from that of the plaintiff and the Zorthians, prevents the defendants' children from leaving their property. On cross-examination, however, Laura Botoff admitted that, because the fence only ties into the Betters' deer fence on one end and does not connect to any other fencing at the other end, the children could leave their property by crossing the wetlands and going\n   around the end of the fence onto the plaintiff's property. Likewise, she conceded that the way the fence exists now someone on the plaintiff's side of the property could walk around it and get to the defendants' side of the property, and the fence does not prevent someone standing in the defendants' yard from viewing the plaintiff's property. This portion of her testimony was consistent with the plaintiff's testimony that anyone could walk around the ends of the fence to enter his property from the defendants' property and that, because the parties' properties slope downward toward the fence, \"when you stand on the sloping topography that is [his] yard and [his] lawn at that point, you can clearly see right over the fence into the [defendants'] backyard.\" Likewise, the court's description of the fence is consistent with these portions of Laura Botoff's and the plaintiff's testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In its memorandum of decision, the court noted that, although the defendants erected the fence for privacy and safety, \"[t]he fence as installed does not extend along the entire boundary between the [plaintiff's] property and the [defendants'] property. There is a narrow space between the end of the fence and the Betters' mesh deer fence on the eastern side of the [defendants']\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   property. The opening at the other end, near the Zorthian[s'] property, is approximately fifty-seven feet wide....

Similar to the court's finding of uselessness in the context of its determination of malice and intent to injure, the court did\n   not recite independent facts when it found that the fence \"intrudes upon [the plaintiff's] enjoyment of his property\" and, therefore, was erected maliciously with an intent to injure the plaintiff. Instead, the court relied on the findings that it had recited when concluding that the plaintiff had satisfied the sixth\n   <em>\n    Whitlock\n   </em>\n   element, i.e., impairment of the plaintiff's enjoyment of his land.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   In challenging this finding, the\n   defendants primarily argue that the plaintiff has not suffered any objective harm, such as an interference with the flow of light or air across, or the increased risk of damage from rain or snow to, his property.

Although the court stated that this \"fence itself may not be ugly as far as stockade fences are concerned,\" it nevertheless credited the plaintiff's testimony and found that the fence impairs his enjoyment of his property. The plaintiff testified extensively about the aesthetics of the wooded area and wetlands surrounding his home prior to the defendants' erection of the fence. He submitted several photographs of the area into evidence, including photographs depicting the dense woods separating the parties' properties and of the fence running along the border between their yards and cutting across the wetlands and stream. As the plaintiff and his expert testified, the plaintiff had designed several rooms of his house to afford views of these wetlands. The fence, therefore, is clearly visible from these rooms, as well as from his yard and when pulling up to the front of the house. The plaintiff testified that he had purchased this property because of the \"natural wooded surroundings\" and that if he \"had seen ... a stockade fence ...

According to the plaintiff, \"on average, the homes [in this neighborhood] are worth anywhere between ... four and seven million dollars,\" and his property \"would achieve at least five million dollars in\n   the market.\" Although the defendants' expert testified that fences are \"not uncommon in Connecticut, in Greenwich\" and that the property across the street from the plaintiff has a stockade fence, the plaintiff's expert testified that stockade fences \"are rare in property values such as this neighborhood.\" In discussing the testimony of the parties' respective experts regarding the impact of the fence on property values, the court explicitly credited the testimony of the plaintiff's expert. The court stated \"that the fence caused the [plaintiff's] property to lose a beneficial wooded view, which reduced the value of the [plaintiff's] property by 1 to 5 percent.\" Laura Botoff testified that the Betters and Mickleys had installed fences on their properties, which conflicted with the plaintiff's testimony that he had not seen fences like this elsewhere in his neighborhood of Rockwood Lane. When questioned about the fence across the street from his house, the plaintiff described it as an old, approximately four foot tall pool fence that, for the most part, is not visible from the street and would be removed as soon as the owners remove the pool that it encloses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Although the court received evidence of other fences in the neighborhood, \"[w]e cannot second-guess the trial court's assessment of the credibility of the witnesses ....

While the fence itself may not be ugly as far as stockade fences are concerned-it is new and apparently well-constructed-it is unsightly as installed across 103 feet of woodland and wetlands on the boundary between two residential properties in the Greenwich RA 2 zoning district.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    In addition to arguing that the evidentiary basis for the court's finding was insufficient, the defendants argue that this finding was clearly erroneous because the statute and relevant case law do not provide a landowner with the right to a view of a neighbor's property. Similarly, the defendants argue that the court erroneously construed the statute broadly by ordering the defendants to remove the fence based on its interference with the plaintiff's interest in a view onto their property. See, e.g.,\n    <em>\n     Willoughby\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     New Haven\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1550348\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/123/446/#p454\">\n     123 Conn. 446\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 454,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=197%20A.%2085\">\n     197 A. 85\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1937) (\"operation of a statute in derogation of the common law is to be limited to matters clearly brought within its scope\"). The defendants premise this argument on the fact that their \"[r]esearch has not revealed a case where ... \u00a7 52-480 was successfully invoked on the grounds that a structure obstructed an adjoining property owner's view onto her neighbor's property itself.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    These arguments misconstrue the court's memorandum of decision. The court considered the fence's effect on the plaintiff's view of the surrounding woods and wetlands, some of which is situated on the defendants' property, when finding that the fence impairs the plaintiff's enjoyment and value of his property. Contrary to the defendants' arguments, the court did not find that the plaintiff has a right to a view of their land. Additionally, as our Supreme Court has noted, \"[i]t is only incidental that the plaintiff, having established the elements necessary for relief under the [statute], might acquire in the process a ... view\" of the defendants' land.\n    <em>\n     DeCecco\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Beach\n    </em>\n    , supra,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"672590\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/174/29/#p32\">\n     174 Conn. at 34\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=381%20A.2d%20543\">\n     381 A.2d 543\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (rejecting defendant's argument that judgment in favor of plaintiff created unlawful visual easement across defendant's land where portion of fence that obstructed plaintiff's view of river was spite fence). Accordingly, these arguments fail.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    The plaintiff argues that this claim is unreviewable because the defendants failed to seek an articulation of the court's basis for this portion of the order. Although Practice Book \u00a7 61-10 places the burden on \"the appellant to provide an adequate record for review,\" that section provides in relevant part that \"[t]he failure of any party on appeal to seek articulation pursuant to Section 66-5 shall not be the sole ground upon which the court declines to review any issue or claim on appeal.\" We therefore reject this argument.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
