Code Ann., Crim. Law (2002, 2012 Repl. Vol.) (\"CR\") \u00a7 1-202, which states: \"The punishment of a person who is convicted of conspiracy may not exceed the maximum punishment for the crime that the person conspired to commit.\" Nichols's counsel contended that, under CR \u00a7 1-202, given that Nichols's sentence for false imprisonment could not exceed thirty years, neither could his sentence for conspiracy to commit false imprisonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The circuit court reasoned, however, that it lacked the authority to resentence Nichols for conspiracy to commit false imprisonment, as the Court of Special Appeals had remanded for resentencing only as to false imprisonment. The circuit court resentenced Nichols to thirty years of imprisonment for false imprisonment, consecutive to the existing fifty-year sentence for conspiracy to commit false imprisonment. Nichols's new aggregate sentence was eighty years of imprisonment. Nichols's counsel argued that, by making Nichols's new sentence for false imprisonment consecutive to the existing sentence for conspiracy to commit false imprisonment, the circuit court had impermissibly increased his aggregate sentence above the original aggregate sentence of life imprisonment with all but fifty years suspended. The circuit court was unpersuaded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   For comparison of Nichols's original sentences to the status of his sentences after the resentencing proceeding, we set forth the following table:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-19\"><strong><em>Crime:</em></strong> <strong><em>Original Sentence:</em></strong> <strong><em>Status After Resentencing</em></strong> <strong><em>Proceeding:</em></strong> First-degree Life imprisonment, with all but N/A (conviction vacated) felony murder fifty years suspended False Life imprisonment, with all but Thirty consecutive years of imprisonment fifty concurrent years suspended imprisonment Conspiracy to Fifty concurrent years of Fifty years of imprisonment commit false imprisonment imprisonment Extortion Five concurrent years of Remained the same imprisonment Conspiracy to Five concurrent years of N/A (conviction vacated) commit extortion imprisonment Life imprisonment, with all but <strong><em>Aggregate</em></strong> fifty years suspended, followed by Eighty years of imprisonment <strong><em>sentence:</em></strong> five years of supervised probation</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Nichols appealed again. The Court of Special Appeals determined that the law of the case doctrine barred the circuit court from considering Nichols's second challenge to his sentence for conspiracy to commit false imprisonment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Darryl Nichols v.

App. Dec. 19, 2017). But, the Court of Special Appeals agreed with Nichols that, under Md. Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. (1974, 2013 Repl. Vol.) (\"CJ\") \u00a7 12-702(b) -which states that, generally, on remand, a trial court \"may not impose a sentence more severe than the sentence previously imposed for the offense\"-the\n   circuit court had impermissibly increased his aggregate sentence by making his new sentence for false imprisonment consecutive to his existing sentence for conspiracy to commit false imprisonment for a total of eighty years of active incarceration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nichols\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%206492681\">\n    2017 WL 6492681\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6. The Court of Special Appeals vacated Nichols's sentence for false imprisonment, affirmed in all other respects, and remanded with instructions to impose a new sentence for false imprisonment that would not\n   result in a new aggregate sentence of more than fifty years of active incarceration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%206492681\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Before us, Nichols contends that the Court of Special Appeals erred in concluding that the law of the case doctrine barred the circuit court from considering at the resentencing proceeding his second challenge to his sentence for conspiracy to commit false imprisonment. Nichols argues that his fifty-year sentence for conspiracy to commit false imprisonment violates CR \u00a7 1-202 because it exceeds the thirty-year maximum sentence that he received for false imprisonment. The State disagrees with Nichols, and asserts that the Court of Special Appeals erred in determining that the circuit court had impermissibly increased Nichols's sentence by imposing a new aggregate sentence of eighty years of imprisonment where Nichols had been originally sentenced to life imprisonment with all but fifty years suspended.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Below, in Part I, consistent with existing case law, we hold that the law of the case doctrine does not bar a trial court from considering under Maryland Rule 4-345(a) an issue as to a sentence's legality that an appellate court has not resolved. Here, the Court of Special Appeals erred in concluding that the law of the case doctrine barred the circuit court from considering Nichols's second challenge to his sentence for conspiracy to commit false imprisonment, as the Court of Special Appeals did not resolve that challenge in the first appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In Part II, addressing the merits of that challenge, we hold that, under CR \u00a7 1-202, where a defendant is convicted of both a crime and conspiracy to commit that crime, a trial court cannot impose for the conspiracy a sentence that exceeds the maximum sentence that the trial court imposed for the crime that the person conspired to commit. The plain language of CR \u00a7 1-202 requires this result. And, although there is no ambiguity as to CR \u00a7 1-202's language, its legislative history confirms the General Assembly's intent that a defendant's punishment for conspiracy to commit a crime not exceed the punishment that the defendant received for the crime that the\n   defendant conspired to commit. Here, given that the circuit court sentenced Nichols to thirty years of imprisonment for false imprisonment, the circuit court could not impose a sentence of more than thirty years of imprisonment for conspiracy to commit false imprisonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In Part III, we hold that, under CJ \u00a7 12-702(b), an aggregate sentence of a certain number of years of imprisonment is more severe than a sentence of life imprisonment, with all but a lower number of years suspended. Here, given that Nichols's original aggregate sentence was life imprisonment with all but fifty years suspended, followed by five years of supervised probation, the circuit court impermissibly increased his aggregate sentence at the resentencing proceeding by imposing a thirty-year sentence for false imprisonment consecutive to the fifty-year sentence for conspiracy to commit false imprisonment, for a new aggregate sentence of eighty years of imprisonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In Part IV, we grant the State's request to vacate all of Nichols's sentences, and to remand for resentencing as to the remaining convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    Charges and Underlying Events\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In the circuit court, the State charged Nichols with first-degree murder, kidnapping, false imprisonment, extortion, and conspiracy to commit each of these crimes. The indictments identified Nichols's co-conspirators as Donta Vaughn and Sherelle Ferguson, and identified the victim as Eric Pendergrass.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   At trial, as a witness for the State, Wayne Price testified that, in late January 2009, he, Vaughn, Ferguson, and a friend whom he knew as \"Ty,\" met and discussed ways to try to make $50,000. Subsequently, Price, Ty, Vaughn, Ferguson, and Nichols met. At that meeting, Vaughn proposed a plan \"to grab\" an acquaintance of his, obtain money from the acquaintance's \"girl[,]\" and then kill the acquaintance. Price said that he wanted no part of the plan and left.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   As a witness for the State, Tiara Felder testified that Pendergrass had been her boyfriend and roommate. On February 1, 2009, between 12 a.m. and 1 a.m., Pendergrass telephoned Felder and told her to go to a closet, get a bag, and take it to his mother's house. Felder got the bag, looked inside, and saw cash, which she estimated to be $15,000. After Felder arrived at Pendergrass's mother's house, someone knocked on the door. Pendergrass's cousin answered the door, and Felder saw a woman outside. The woman said that she was there for Pendergrass. Felder gave the bag of cash to the woman. On February 1 or 2, 2009, Felder received a text message from a phone number that she did not recognize. For approximately two or three days, Felder exchanged text messages with the unknown number. As a result of the text messages, Felder took another bag, containing between $25,000 and $30,000 in cash, to a certain location. Afterward, Felder learned that Pendergrass had been killed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    Verdicts, Original Sentences, and First Appeal\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   A jury found Nichols guilty of first-degree felony murder, false imprisonment, conspiracy to commit false imprisonment, extortion, and conspiracy to commit extortion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The circuit court sentenced Nichols to: life imprisonment, with all but fifty years suspended, for first-degree felony murder; life imprisonment, with all but fifty concurrent years suspended, for false imprisonment; fifty concurrent years of imprisonment for conspiracy to commit false imprisonment; five concurrent years of imprisonment for extortion; five concurrent years of imprisonment for conspiracy to commit extortion; followed by five years of supervised probation. Nichols's original aggregate sentence was life imprisonment, with all but fifty years suspended, followed by five years of supervised probation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Nichols appealed.

App. Oct. 13, 2015). The Court of Special Appeals held that the circuit court erred in sentencing Nichols to life imprisonment, with all but fifty years suspended, for false imprisonment, as, under this case's circumstances, the maximum sentence for false imprisonment was thirty years of imprisonment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at *5-6.

The Court of Special Appeals rejected this contention, as each crime includes an element that the other does not.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Specifically, one element of kidnapping is that the defendant transports the victim to another place, while conspiracy to commit false imprisonment does not include this element.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   One element of conspiracy to commit false imprisonment is that the defendant agreed with at least one other person to commit the crime of false imprisonment, while kidnapping lacks this element.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Nichols moved for reconsideration. On February 4, 2016, the Court of Special Appeals issued a superseding opinion that was identical to the original one, except that, in the new opinion: two footnotes were added to address the motion for reconsideration; typographical errors were fixed; and the\n   Court vacated not only Nichols's sentence, but also his conviction, for conspiracy to commit extortion.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nichols\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%205944381\">\n    2015 WL 5944381\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nichols\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201622079\">\n    2016 WL 1622079\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 n.4, *5 n.5, *6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    Resentencing Proceeding\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On August 18, 2016, the circuit court conducted a resentencing proceeding. At the proceeding, Nichols's counsel asked the circuit court \"to consider [an issue] that the Court of Special Appeals [had] not consider[ed.]\" Nichols's counsel advised that CR \u00a7 1-202 states: \"The punishment of a person who is convicted of conspiracy may not exceed the maximum punishment for the crime that the person conspired to commit.\" Nichols's counsel pointed out that the Court of Special Appeals had held that, under this case's circumstances, the maximum sentence for false imprisonment was thirty years of imprisonment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nichols\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201622079\">\n    2016 WL 1622079\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4-5. Nichols's counsel contended that, accordingly, the sentence for conspiracy to commit false imprisonment could not exceed thirty years of imprisonment.

The circuit court observed that the Court of Special Appeals had remanded only for resentencing as to certain of Nichols's convictions, which did not include his\n   conviction for conspiracy to commit false imprisonment. The circuit court stated that the only issues that were before it were the ones\n   that the Court of Special Appeals had addressed.

The State contends that the argument that Nichols pursued in the first appeal was the same as the argument that he pursued at the resentencing proceeding-namely, that his sentence for conspiracy to commit false imprisonment is an illegal sentence because it was subject to the thirty-year maximum sentence for false imprisonment. The State argues that, at the resentencing proceeding, Nichols did not raise a new issue, and instead simply relied on CR \u00a7 1-202 as additional support for the argument that he had made in the first appeal. The State asserts that, although a defendant may raise the issue of a sentence's legality at any time under Maryland Rule 4-345(a), that does not mean that the defendant may re-raise an issue as to a sentence that an appellate court has resolved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   An appellate court reviews without deference a lower court's conclusion as to whether the law of the case doctrine applies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Balt.

The law of the case doctrine does not, however, bar a trial court from considering under Maryland Rule 4-345(a) an issue as to the legality of a sentence that an appellate court has not resolved.

In other words, we must determine whether, at the resentencing proceeding, Nichols raised a new issue by contending that his sentence for conspiracy to commit false imprisonment was an illegal sentence because it violated CR \u00a7 1-202. If, as Nichols argues, he raised a new issue, then the Court of Special Appeals did not decide the issue in the first appeal, and the law of the case doctrine did not bar the circuit court from considering the issue at the resentencing proceeding. But, if, as the State asserts, Nichols did not raise a new issue-and instead simply provided new support (namely, CR \u00a7 1-202) as to an issue that he had already raised in the first appeal-then the Court of Special Appeals decided the issue in the first appeal, and the law of the case doctrine barred the circuit court from considering the new support as to the issue at the resentencing proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   To resolve the question of whether Nichols raised at the resentencing proceeding an issue that he had not raised in the first appeal, we review his contentions in the first appeal and at the resentencing proceeding.

Nichols's counsel pointed out that CR \u00a7 1-202 states: \"The punishment of a person who is convicted of conspiracy may not exceed the maximum punishment for the crime that the person conspired to commit.\" Nichols's counsel noted that the Court of Special Appeals had held that, under this case's circumstances, the maximum sentence for false imprisonment was thirty years of imprisonment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nichols\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201622079\">\n    2016 WL 1622079\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4-5. Nichols's counsel contended that, accordingly, his sentence for conspiracy to commit false imprisonment could not exceed thirty years of imprisonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   We agree with Nichols that he raised a new issue at the resentencing proceeding. In the first appeal, Nichols contended that his fifty-year sentence for conspiracy to commit false imprisonment was illegal because it exceeded the thirty-year maximum sentence for conspiracy to commit kidnapping, of which he was acquitted, and he argued that conspiracy to commit false imprisonment was a lesser-included offense of conspiracy to commit kidnapping. By contrast, at the resentencing proceeding, Nichols argued that his fifty-year sentence for conspiracy to commit false imprisonment was illegal because it exceeded the thirty-year maximum sentence for false imprisonment, and thus violated CR \u00a7 1-202. Nichols's arguments clearly raised different issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   We reject the State's contention that, at the resentencing proceeding, Nichols simply provided new support-namely, CR \u00a7 1-202-as to an issue that he had already raised in the first appeal. The State reasons that, both in the first appeal and at the resentencing proceeding, Nichols contended that his sentence for conspiracy to commit false imprisonment \"was illegal because it was subject to the [thirty]-year cap [ ] on his sentence for false imprisonment.\" The State is mistaken. In the first appeal, Nichols argued that his sentence for conspiracy to commit false imprisonment could not exceed the maximum sentence for conspiracy to commit kidnapping-not that it could not exceed the maximum sentence for false imprisonment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Brief of Appellant,\n   <em>\n    Nichols\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%207717632\">\n    2014 WL 7717632\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *17-18 ;\n   <em>\n    Nichols\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201622079\">\n    2016 WL 1622079\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 n.5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   At oral argument, the State contended that the law of the case doctrine bars Nichols's argument as to CR \u00a7 1-202 because, according to the State, Nichols could have raised the argument in the first appeal but failed to do so. We note that this position contradicts the State's earlier contention that Nichols should be barred from raising CR \u00a7 1-202 because he argued a similar point during the first appeal by advocating for a sentence of no more than thirty years of imprisonment for conspiracy to commit false imprisonment. Despite the variance in the State's position, we are of the view that, notwithstanding the law of the case doctrine, under\n   Maryland Rule 4-345(a), a trial court may consider\n   an issue as to a sentence's legality that a defendant could have raised, but failed to raise, in a prior appeal.

Nichols points out that he was charged with false imprisonment (a lesser-included offense) and kidnapping (a greater offense) based on the same conduct. Nichols notes that, where a defendant is charged with a lesser-included offense and a greater offense based on the same conduct, and is convicted only of the lesser-included offense, the trial court cannot impose a sentence that exceeds the maximum sentence for the greater offense. Nichols argues that, because the maximum sentence for kidnapping is thirty years of imprisonment,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   CR \u00a7 3-502(b), the circuit court could not sentence him to more than thirty years of imprisonment for false\n   imprisonment. Nichols advises that CR \u00a7 1-202 states: \"The punishment of a person who is convicted of conspiracy may not exceed the maximum punishment for the crime that the person conspired to commit.\" Nichols asserts that, based on CR \u00a7 1-202, his sentence for conspiracy to commit false imprisonment could not exceed his thirty-year sentence for false imprisonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The State responds that Nichols's sentence for conspiracy to commit false imprisonment is a legal sentence and that it did not exceed the maximum sentence for false imprisonment. The State argues that false imprisonment is a common law crime for which no statute prescribes a maximum sentence. The State asserts that, generally, a trial court may impose any sentence for false imprisonment that is not cruel and unusual. The State contends that, accordingly, a fifty-year sentence for conspiracy to commit false imprisonment does not exceed the maximum sentence for false imprisonment, and does not violate CR \u00a7 1-202. The State maintains that, as used in CR \u00a7 1-202, the term \"maximum punishment\" means the highest possible sentence for a crime, not the sentence that a trial court imposed in a particular case. In other words, the State asserts that CR \u00a7 1-202 permits a sentence for a conspiracy to be up to the statutory maximum sentence, if any, for the crime that the defendant conspired to commit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   An appellate court reviews without deference the issue of whether a sentence is illegal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

CR \u00a7 1-202's plain language states: \"The punishment of a person who is convicted of conspiracy may not exceed the maximum punishment for the crime that the person conspired to commit.\" A plain language analysis of CR \u00a7 1-202 warrants the stance that we reach. And, although CR \u00a7 1-202's language is unambiguous, we observe, as a confirmatory matter, that CR \u00a7 1-202's legislative history requires the same outcome. In other words, in enacting CR \u00a7 1-202, the General Assembly's purpose was to ensure that, in any given case, a defendant's sentence for conspiracy to commit a crime would not exceed the sentence that the defendant received for the crime that the defendant conspired to commit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   The State does not identify any case, and we know of none, after the 1961 amendment to Art. 27, \u00a7 38 in which a defendant was convicted of both a crime and conspiracy to commit that crime, and an appellate court held that it was proper for the sentence for conspiracy to exceed the sentence for the crime that the defendant conspired to commit. Indeed, at oral argument, the Assistant Attorney General acknowledged that she was unaware of the existence of such a case. Neither CR \u00a7 1-202 nor any other Maryland authority supports the proposition that a sentence for conspiracy to commit a crime may exceed the sentence for the crime that the defendant conspired to commit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Under the State's position, where a defendant is convicted of conspiracy to commit a common law crime, such as false imprisonment, CR \u00a7 1-202 does not apply, and thus would not set a cap on the sentence. Simply put, adopting the State's position would lead to unacceptable results, as this case's circumstances demonstrate. After the resentencing proceeding, Nichols's sentence for false imprisonment was thirty years of imprisonment, whereas his sentence for conspiracy to commit false imprisonment was fifty years of imprisonment. If we adopted the State's position, it would be permissible for Nichols to have a fifty-year sentence for conspiracy, which is twenty years more than his thirty-year sentence for actually committing the crime in question. This circumstance would be inconsistent with the plain language of CR \u00a7 1-202 and would indicate that Nichols was more culpable for agreeing to falsely imprison Pendergrass than for actually falsely imprisoning him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   We do not discern any ambiguity in the plain language of CR \u00a7 1-202. The statute's plain language requires the outcome that we reach. CR \u00a7 1-202 plainly states that the punishment for a person who is convicted of conspiracy may not exceed the maximum punishment for the crime that the person conspired to commit. CR \u00a7 1-202 uses the word \"punishment\" rather than \"sentence,\" which is a strong indicator that CR \u00a7 1-202 refers to the imprisonment or punishment that is actually imposed on a defendant. Additionally, CR \u00a7 1-202's legislative\n   history supports our conclusion. CR \u00a7 1-202's predecessor, Art. 27, \u00a7 38, was amended after this Court's holding in\n   <em>\n    Scarlett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2233822\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/201/310/#p320\">\n    201 Md. at 320-21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=93%20A.2d%20753\">\n    93 A.2d at 757-58\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which permitted a defendant's sentence for conspiracy to exceed the punishment for the underlying crime.\n   In amending Art. 27, \u00a7 38, the General Assembly would necessarily have been aware of\n   <em>\n    Scarlett\n   </em>\n   and purposely amended a statute to abrogate it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Even if we perceived ambiguity in CR \u00a7 1-202's language, and the legislative history were not dispositive, the result would be the same. Where a statute is ambiguous, and where the means of statutory interpretation fail to resolve the ambiguity, the rule of lenity compels a court to resolve the ambiguity in the defendant's favor. As this Court explained in\n   <em>\n    Oglesby v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4024904\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/441/673/#p681\">\n    441 Md. 673\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 681,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4024904\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/441/673/#p681\">\n    109 A.3d 1147\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1151-52 (2015) :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   The \"rule of lenity\" is not a rule in the usual sense, but an aid for dealing with ambiguity in a criminal statute. Under the rule of lenity, a court [that is] confronted with an otherwise unresolvable ambiguity in a criminal statute that allows for two possible interpretations of the statute will opt for the construction that favors the defendant. For a court [that is] construing a statute, the rule of lenity is not a means for determining-or defeating-legislative intent. Rather, it is a tie-goes-to-the-runner device that the court may turn to when it despairs of fathoming how the General Assembly intended that the statute be applied in the particular circumstances. It is a tool of last resort, to be rarely deployed and applied only when all other tools of statutory construction fail to resolve an ambiguity. This follows from the fact that our goal in construing statutes is always to ascertain and carry out the legislative purpose of the statute and not to seek out an interpretation that necessarily favors one party or the other.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   (Cleaned up).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   The State relies on two cases for the proposition that CR \u00a7 1-202 makes a sentencing cap inapplicable to a sentence for conspiracy.

And, in\n   <em>\n    DeLeon v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4424398\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/102/58/#p71\">\n    102 Md.

The State observes that Nichols's original aggregate sentence was life imprisonment, with all but fifty years suspended, followed by five years of supervised probation. By contrast, after the resentencing proceeding, his aggregate sentence was eighty years of imprisonment, with no sentence of life imprisonment. The State points out that, if Nichols's original aggregate sentence had remained intact, the circuit court could have imposed a sentence of life imprisonment for a violation of probation. The State argues that a sentence that includes a sentence of life imprisonment, regardless of how much, if any, of the sentence has been suspended, is more severe than a sentence that does not include a sentence of life imprisonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Nichols responds that the circuit court impermissibly increased his sentence by imposing a new aggregate sentence that included thirty more unsuspended years of imprisonment than his original aggregate sentence. Nichols points out that, in the first appeal, the Court of Special Appeals vacated his conviction and life sentence for first-degree felony murder and vacated his life sentence for false imprisonment. Nichols contends that the existence of the two original sentences of life imprisonment does not justify an increase in the unsuspended portion of his sentence, as the circuit court lacked the authority to impose his two original sentences of life imprisonment in the first place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   <strong>\n    CJ \u00a7 12-702(b)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   CJ \u00a7 12-702(b) states, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-110\">\n   If an appellate court remands a criminal case to a lower court in order that the lower court may pronounce the proper ... sentence, ... the lower court may impose any sentence authorized by law to be imposed as punishment for the offense.

Where a trial court imposes an aggregate sentence of a certain number of years of imprisonment, the defendant is essentially guaranteed to serve that term of imprisonment, barring a circumstance such as the grant of parole. By contrast, where a trial court imposes a sentence of life imprisonment, with all but\n   a certain number of years suspended, it is impossible to know in advance whether the defendant will serve only that term of years, or whether the defendant will serve a life sentence based on a potential violation of probation. If the defendant finishes the term of probation without violating any condition thereof, then the defendant will no longer be subject to a sentence of life imprisonment. And, even if the defendant violates a condition of probation, the defendant will not necessarily become subject to a sentence of life imprisonment. A trial court may not \"impose any sentence that might have originally been imposed for the crime of which the probationer or defendant was convicted\" unless the violation of a condition of probation is the defendant's \"fourth or subsequent technical violation or a violation that is not a technical violation[.]\" Md. Code Ann., Crim. Proc. (2001, 2008 Repl. Vol., 2018 Supp.) (\"CP\") \u00a7 6-223(d)(2)(ii). And, where the defendant commits such a violation of probation, it is within the trial court's discretion whether to impose the full suspended portion of the sentence; CP \u00a7 6-223(d)(2)(ii) states that the trial court \"may\" do so, not that the trial court \"shall\" do so.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   In short, where a trial court imposes a sentence of life imprisonment, with all but a certain number of years suspended, the defendant will not necessarily serve a sentence of life imprisonment. Thus, it cannot be said that a sentence of life imprisonment, with all but a certain number of years suspended, is more severe than\n   an aggregate sentence of a greater number of years of imprisonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   In sum, we conclude that, under CJ \u00a7 12-702(b), Nichols's original aggregate sentence-life imprisonment, with all but fifty years suspended, followed by five years of supervised probation-was less severe than his new eighty-year aggregate active sentence. Accordingly, the circuit court increased Nichols's aggregate sentence by imposing a new aggregate sentence of eighty years of imprisonment where he had previously been subject to a sentence of life imprisonment, with all but fifty years suspended.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

Nichols's convictions and sentences arose from the same conduct involving the same victim. Vacating all sentences will permit the circuit court to consider all of the relevant facts and circumstances of the case. And, Nichols has not expressly asked that we refrain from doing so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   On remand, consistent with our holding that the sentence of life imprisonment with all but fifty years suspended is less severe than the sentence of eighty years of imprisonment, the circuit court must impose an aggregate sentence that does not exceed fifty years of imprisonment.
