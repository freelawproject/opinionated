After hearing the arguments of counsel and examining the memoranda filed on behalf of the parties, we are of the opinion that cause has not been shown, and we proceed to decide the appeal at this time without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we vacate the judgment of the Superior Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    Facts and Travel\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In 1998, a justice of the Superior Court sentenced Hernandez to sixty-three years to serve at the Adult Correctional Institutions after a jury found him guilty, in three consolidated criminal cases, of first degree sexual assault, two counts of second degree sexual assault, assault with intent to commit murder, assault with intent to commit robbery, unlawful possession of a firearm by a felon, and assault with a device similar to a firearm. He appealed to this Court, and we affirmed the conviction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ten years later, in January 2008, Hernandez filed an application for postconviction relief, in accordance with G.L. 1956 chapter 9.1 of title 10. A justice of the Superior Court appointed counsel to represent Hernandez. After a thorough examination of Hernandez's claims, postconviction relief counsel opined that the issues that had been raised in Hernandez's application were \"wholly frivolous, without merit, and neither supported by existing law, nor by a good faith argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law.\" Counsel further determined that \"no other non-frivolous issues or arguments exist which might arguably support plaintiff's Petition[,]\" and that \"trial counsel's performance was neither deficient, prejudicial, nor ineffective.\" Consequently, and in accordance with the mandate set forth in\n   <em>\n    Shatney v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11200839\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/755/130/\">\n    755 A.2d 130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (R.I. 2000), counsel moved to withdraw from the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   A hearing was held on postconviction relief counsel's motion to withdraw on April 23, 2010. After counsel explained to the hearing justice his basis for concluding that Hernandez's claims for postconviction relief lacked merit, the hearing justice granted his motion. The hearing justice\n   then reviewed Hernandez's claims and said that he agreed with counsel that the claims lacked merit. He informed Hernandez that, if he still wished to pursue his postconviction relief claims, he would have to do so without court-appointed counsel. After the hearing justice asked Hernandez what he wished to do, Hernandez replied that he continued to believe that he had the right to an attorney to represent him, and that he should not have been charged with attempted murder for using a BB gun during one of the assaults. The hearing justice responded that Hernandez's argument was \"wholly and totally without merit[,]\" was a matter \"set forth to the finders of fact[,]\" and was never raised. He denied Hernandez's application for postconviction relief. Final judgment was entered on that same day, and Hernandez timely appealed to this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Pursuant to \u00a7 10-9.1-1, postconviction relief is a remedy available to \"any person who has been convicted of a crime and who thereafter alleges either that the conviction violated the applicant's constitutional rights or that the existence of newly discovered material facts requires vacation of the conviction in the interest of justice.\"\n   <em>\n    Duvere v.

He also contends that the hearing justice erred when he denied the application without providing Hernandez with notice of his intent to dismiss the action or granting a continuance to allow Hernandez to respond to the proposed dismissal.

Specifically, Hernandez maintains that the attorney who had been appointed to represent him misconstrued, in his memorandum in support of his motion to withdraw, his role as counsel to conduct an \"independent examination\" of the merits of the applicant's claim. According to Hernandez, this is contrary to the mandate of \u00a7 10-9.1-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   At the outset, we note that we have held that the right to counsel in a postconviction relief proceeding \"is a matter of legislative grace, not constitutional right.\"\n   <em>\n    Reyes v.

I feel that I still have a case for post conviction. And, Judge, I feel that I was-you know, the lawyer did not do a good job in investigating my case. The fact that I was charged with attempted murder with a BB gun should have been anything-should have been something of assault with a dangerous weapon instead of attempted murder. I have never heard of a case where a person died as a result of a person getting shot by a BB gun. That's ludicrous within itself.
