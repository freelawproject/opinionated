The merits briefs do not mention defendant Jenny Craig, Inc., but plaintiff's brief refers to defendant \"JC USA, INC.\" as \"Jenny Craig.\" Our reference to \"defendant\" throughout this opinion is to JC USA, INC., and by \"parties,\" we mean plaintiff and JC USA, INC.\n  </p>\n </footnote>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <author id=\"p-9\">\n   FASCIALE, J.A.D.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This appeal requires us to decide whether to invalidate an arbitration agreement because the parties failed to identify any arbitration forum and any process for conducting the arbitration. In general, a forum is the mechanism - or setting - that parties use to arbitrate their dispute. They could have designated an arbitral institution (like the American Arbitration Association (AAA) or the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services (JAMS) ), or they could have communicated a general method for selecting a different arbitration setting. The mechanism or setting for the proceeding is important because the rights associated with arbitration forums may differ depending on which forum the parties choose, or on how they define the arbitral process. Here, the agreement ignored the subject altogether.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   We hold that the parties lacked a \"meeting of the minds\" because they did not understand the rights under the arbitration agreement that ostensibly foreclosed\n   plaintiff's right to a jury trial. We therefore reverse the order compelling arbitration for lack of mutual assent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   At the time of her termination, plaintiff was eighty-two years old. She had worked for defendant - a weight loss, weight\n   management, and nutrition company - for twenty-six years. During that time, plaintiff provided weight loss counseling. Defendant gradually reduced plaintiff's full-time hours to only three hours per week. The substantial reduction in hours led to her termination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff filed her complaint alleging (1) age discrimination and harassment in violation of the New Jersey Law Against Discrimination (NJLAD), N.J.S.A. 10:5-1 to -49; (2) discriminatory discharge and/or constructive termination in violation of the NJLAD; and (3) aider and abettor liability under the NJLAD. Defendant then filed its motion to compel arbitration relying on the parties' arbitration agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff has no recollection of signing the document that contained the arbitration agreement, which the parties did not execute when defendant hired her. Rather, in 2011, twenty years after she was hired, defendant presented plaintiff with the document, which she signed to maintain her employment. In pertinent part, the agreement provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Arbitration Agreement\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Any and all claims or controversies arising out of or relating to [plaintiff's] employment, the termination thereof, or otherwise arising between [plaintiff] and [defendant] shall, in lieu of a jury or other civil trial, be settled by final and binding arbitration. This agreement to arbitrate includes all claims whether arising in tort or contract and whether arising under statute or common law including, but not limited to, any claim of breach of contract, discrimination or harassment of any kind.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   ... [Plaintiff] will pay the then-current\n   <em>\n    Superior Court of California\n   </em>\n   filing fee towards the costs of the arbitration (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , filing fees, administration fees, and arbitrator fees) ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   [ (Emphasis added).]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   If enforceable, plaintiff gave up her right to a jury trial by executing the agreement. That is not an issue. The agreement, however, said nothing about what forum generally replaced that right (although it confusingly referred to California court filing fees). The judge recognized this important omission when he suggested that \"the choice of which arbitral body would conduct the arbitration would be turned over to the [p]laintiff.\" In other\n   words, the judge - not the parties - decided who would pick the forum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On appeal, plaintiff primarily argues that the arbitration agreement lacked mutual assent and is therefore invalid as a matter of contract law. She maintains that the parties did not reach a \"meeting of the minds\" as to the rights that replaced her right to a jury trial. She also argues that the arbitration agreement is unconscionable.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Appellate courts exercise de novo review of a judge's decision on the enforceability of contracts, such as an arbitration clause.\n   <em>\n    Morgan v.

This is not a situation where on the one hand, the parties generally addressed in some fashion the process that foreclosed plaintiff's right to a jury trial, but on the other hand, simply failed to identify a specific method for selecting an arbitrator. If that were the case, either party arguably could have filed a motion under N.J.S.A. 2A:23B-11(a), entitled \"Appointment of arbitrator; conflict of interest,\" asking the judge to appoint the arbitrator. That statute provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   If the parties to an agreement to arbitrate agree on a method for appointing an arbitrator, that method shall be followed, unless the method fails.

In other words, if they agree that a dispute would be arbitrated by an arbitral institution, or an arbitrator or arbitrators, then that is the agreed upon forum. And after that, if they remain unable to actually select the arbitrator - under such a hypothetical agreement - then the parties could arguably apply to the court under N.J.S.A. 2A:23B-11(a) and ask the judge to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Like our case, in the aftermath of\n   <em>\n    Atalese\n   </em>\n   , the panel in\n   <em>\n    Kleine\n   </em>\n   focused on the lack of mutual assent as to the arbitral\n   <em>\n    forum\n   </em>\n   - the rights that replaced the right to a jury trial - rather than the parties failing to reference a \"method for appointing an arbitrator.\" (Emphasis added.) Resort to N.J.S.A. 2A:23B-11(a) potentially comes into play only if the arbitration agreement reflects a meeting of the minds about what rights the parties gave up and what rights they received. The failure to reference in the agreement an actual method for selecting an arbitrator does not in-and-of-itself invalidate this agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Rather, it is the lack of meeting of the minds as to the arbitral forum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Nevertheless, here, neither party made a N.J.S.A. 2A:23B-11(a) application to the judge.

The parties did not reach any agreement at all. This became painstakingly evident by defendant's continued improvised negotiations during oral argument before the motion judge. The parties here failed to appreciate fully the ramifications of the supposed arbitration agreement, as required by\n   <em>\n    Atalese\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   We emphasize that the issue in this case is whether to invalidate an arbitration agreement because the parties failed to identify any arbitration forum and any process for conducting the arbitration. The agreement must first reflect a meeting of the minds about what rights ostensibly replaced plaintiff's right to a jury trial. If the parties had done that, but remained unable to choose a particular arbitrator, then they could have arguably petitioned the court to make such a selection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   We now address the important consequences of failing to identify in some fashion\n   the process for selecting an arbitration forum, such as by otherwise designating in the contract any arbitral institution or by identifying any general method for selecting an arbitration forum. Undertaking this endeavor highlights the importance of addressing - in some fashion - the rights that replaced\n   judicial adjudication of the underlying dispute. And as\n   <em>\n    Atalese\n   </em>\n   instructs, and as\n   <em>\n    Kleine\n   </em>\n   applied, had this been done, the parties then would fully understand both the rights that have been waived and the rights that have taken their place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Selecting an arbitral institution informs the parties, at a minimum, about that institution's general arbitration rules and procedures. Without knowing this basic information, parties to an arbitration agreement will be unfamiliar with the rights that replaced judicial adjudication. That is, the parties will not reach a \"meeting of the minds.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   We do not mean to imply that the parties must detail in the arbitration agreement the exact manner in which the arbitration proceeding will proceed.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , N.J.S.A. 2A:23B-15(a) (giving the arbitrator such discretion). But to understand the ramifications of a waiver of a jury trial, the parties must generally address in some fashion what rights replace those that have been waived. Without limitation, the parties might generally indicate in their agreement that one or more individuals will arbitrate the case, or they could identify an arbitral institution. Doing so addresses the rights that replaced the right to judicial adjudication.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   For example, AAA uses certain procedures for arbitrating employment disputes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   AAA adheres to due process safeguards, which at a minimum meet the standards outlined in the National Rules for the Resolution of Employment Disputes. Ordinarily, when parties select AAA, they make AAA's rules part of their arbitration agreement. Such rules address, but are not limited to, notification requirements, the initiation of the proceedings, management conferences, discovery, the location of the hearing(s), the\n   number of arbitrators, communications with the arbitrator(s), attendance at the hearings, dispositive motions, evidence, modification of awards, applications to court, fees, expenses, and costs. Picking AAA, for example, helps the parties reach a \"meeting of the minds\" as to the rights that replace the right to a jury trial in court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Similarly, JAMS provides its own set of arbitration rules and procedures applicable to its alternative dispute resolution (ADR) services, such as JAMS' employment arbitration rules and procedures.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   We need not detail those rules here. The point is that selection of JAMS as an arbitral institution -\n   <em>\n    or any other ADR forum\n   </em>\n   - informs parties about the rights that replace those that they waived in the arbitration agreement. We are not talking about insignificant aspects of the arbitration process. The associated rights connected with the selection of an arbitral forum generally establish the substantive and procedural setting for the entire arbitration process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Take, for example, the relevant part of the arbitration agreement reached by the parties in\n   <em>\n    Atalese\n   </em>\n   , in which they\n   identified AAA, JAMS, and the applicable rules. The agreement stated in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   [T]he claim or dispute shall be submitted to binding arbitration ....\n   <em>\n    The parties shall agree on a single arbitrator\n   </em>\n   to resolve the dispute.\n   <em>\n    The matter may be arbitrated either by [JAMS] or [AAA]\n   </em>\n   ....\n   <em>\n    The conduct of the arbitration shall be subject to the then current rules of the arbitration service\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   [\n   <em>\n    Atalese\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4191590\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/219/430/#p441\">\n    219 N.J. at 437\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4191590\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/219/430/#p441\">\n    99 A.3d 306\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   We do not mean to imply that there must be certain \"talismanic words\" in the agreement as to the rights that replace the right to judicial adjudication. Imposing such a requirement would upset the \"equal footing\" that arbitration contracts enjoy with all other contracts. But, as explained by\n   <em>\n    Atalese\n   </em>\n   , it is important that the arbitration agreement reflect a \"clear mutual understanding of the ramifications\" of the parties' mutual assent to waive adjudication\n   by a court of law.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4191590\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/219/430/#p441\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4191590\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/219/430/#p441\">\n    at 443\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4191590\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/219/430/#p441\">\n    99 A.3d 306\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In the absence thereof, or if the agreed method fails or for any reason cannot be followed, or if an arbitrator who has been appointed fails or is unable to act and his successor has not been duly appointed, the court,\n    <em>\n     on application\n    </em>\n    of a party to such agreement or provision, shall appoint one or more arbitrators. An arbitrator so appointed shall have the same powers as if he had been named or provided for in the agreement or provision.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n    [ (Emphasis added).]\n   </blockquote>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    In\n    <em>\n     Oasis Health\n    </em>\n    , the plaintiff contended that if state law invalidated an agreement, because the parties' failed to select or provide a method for selecting an arbitrator or arbitrators, or because there existed a lapse in the naming of an arbitrator or arbitrators, then federal law (Section 5 of the FAA) provided the operative substantive law regarding an arbitration forum. But the court did not consider this contention because it concluded state law was not inconsistent with federal law.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
