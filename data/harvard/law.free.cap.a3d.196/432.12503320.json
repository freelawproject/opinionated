Hastey was indicted for aggravated criminal OUI (Class B), 29-A M.R.S. \u00a7 2411(1-A)(D)(2) (2017).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The enhancing factor alleged in the indictment is Hastey's 1991 manslaughter conviction that the State alleges \"involve[ed] or result[ed] from the operation of a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or drugs.\" 29-A M.R.S. \u00a7 2411(1-A)(D)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   [\u00b6 3] The State appeals from an order of the Unified Criminal Docket (Aroostook County,\n   <em>\n    Stewart, J.\n   </em>\n   ) granting Hastey's motion in limine to exclude evidence of his alleged intoxication at the time he committed the manslaughter offense. The State argues that the trial court erred when it ruled that the State's proof regarding Hastey's prior conviction is limited to the face of the 1990 indictment and 1991 judgment and commitment, which do not establish that Hastey was operating while under the influence at the time of the homicide. We agree, and we vacate the court's order granting Hastey's motion in limine and remand for the entry of an order denying the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   I. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   [\u00b6 4] On March 8, 1990, Hastey was indicted for (1) one count of manslaughter\n   for \"reckless and criminally negligent operation of a motor vehicle\" causing the death of another person (Class B),\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   17-A M.R.S.A. \u00a7 203 (Supp. 1989), and (2) one count of OUI (Class D), 29 M.R.S.A. \u00a7 1312-B (Supp. 1989).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   On May 23, 1991, Hastey pleaded guilty to the manslaughter offense and was sentenced. The OUI charge was dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   [\u00b6 5] On December 12, 2015, Hastey was arrested for allegedly operating a motor vehicle under the influence of intoxicants. He was later indicted for aggravated criminal OUI (Class B), 29-A M.R.S. \u00a7 2411(1-A)(D)(2). The indictment alleged that Hastey \"had a prior conviction for a prior criminal homicide involving or resulting from the operation of a motor vehicle while under the influence.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   [\u00b6 6] On April 26, 2016, Hastey moved to dismiss the indictment, arguing that because the 1990 OUI charge had been dismissed and there were no findings of fact regarding the 1991 manslaughter conviction, he had not been convicted of a criminal homicide involving or resulting from operation under the influence as required to trigger the enhanced charge and sentencing pursuant to section 2411(1-A)(D)(2). Hastey also argued that if the State is allowed to present evidence that he was intoxicated when he committed the manslaughter offense, then \"the State would have to, in effect, re-prosecute the 1990 charges\" which would violate the \"Double Jeopardy Clause's protection against a second prosecution for the same offense.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.S. Const. amend. V ; Me. Const. art. I, \u00a7 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   [\u00b6 7] On July 1, 2016, the court denied Hastey's motion to dismiss. Citing the \"categorical approach\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   established by federal courts to determine whether certain prior state convictions qualify as predicate offenses under certain federal laws,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Taylor v.

The State indicated its intention to present at trial testimonial evidence, certified records from the Bureau of Motor Vehicles, and \"properly sworn test results from the blood test administered to [Hastey] in 1990.\" The court granted Hastey's motion. The State filed a \"motion for reconsideration and further conclusions of law,\" which the court denied on October 27, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   [\u00b6 9] On November 10, 2016, after obtaining the written approval of the Attorney General, the State timely appealed the court's order granting Hastey's motion in limine and the order denying the motion for reconsideration and further conclusions of law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   15 M.R.S. \u00a7 2115-A(1) (2017) ; M.R.

Interlocutory Appeal\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   [\u00b6 10] As a preliminary matter, Hastey argues that the State's appeal of the in-limine order is interlocutory and not ripe for appeal because the ruling is subject to reconsideration by the trial court and is not final until the challenged evidence is offered by the State at trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   M.R.U. Crim. P. 12(c) ;\n   <em>\n    State v. Brackett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11209916\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/754/337/\">\n    2000 ME 54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 6,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11209916\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/754/337/\">\n    754 A.2d 337\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   [\u00b6 11] The State may appeal an interlocutory \"order of the court prior to trial which, either under the particular circumstances of the case or generally for the type of order in question, has a reasonable likelihood of causing either serious impairment to or termination of the prosecution.\" 15 M.R.S. \u00a7 2115-A(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   [\u00b6 12] In our assessment of whether the State's appeal meets the requirements of section 2115-A(1), we first consider whether there is \"any reasonable likelihood that the State will be handicapped in trying the defendant.\"\n   <em>\n    Brackett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11209916\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/754/337/\">\n    2000 ME 54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 5,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11209916\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/754/337/\">\n    754 A.2d 337\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation marks omitted). Without question, the State will be handicapped. Contrary to Hastey's contention, it is hard to imagine that the court's in-limine order would not impede the State's ability to proceed in the trial of the case. In the absence of evidence outside of the 1990 indictment and the 1991 judgment and commitment, the State will not be able to prove beyond a reasonable\n   doubt that Hastey was intoxicated at the time he committed the predicate manslaughter offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   [\u00b6 13] We next consider \"whether entertaining the appeal is consistent with the strong public policy against piecemeal appeals and the impossibility of this [C]ourt's serving as an advisory board to trial lawyers and judges.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6 (quotation marks omitted). In\n   <em>\n    Brackett\n   </em>\n   , we dismissed as interlocutory the appeal of a motion in limine argued on the grounds that the evidence was inadmissible under Maine Rule of Evidence 412.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 2, 7. We noted that we are hesitant to entertain appeals from in-limine rulings involving relevancy, probative value, and the prejudicial effect of evidence because \"the theoretical facts presented in the motion in limine may differ from the actual facts presented at trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7 (discussing M.R. Evid. 403 ). In contrast, in\n   <em>\n    State v. Patterson\n   </em>\n   , we determined that the appeal of a motion in limine was not premature because the justice who granted the motion was to preside at the trial the following week and clearly stated his intention to exclude the contested evidence.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12256257\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/651/362/#p366\">\n    651 A.2d 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 366 (Me. 1994).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   [\u00b6 14] As in\n   <em>\n    Patterson,\n   </em>\n   it is appropriate for us to entertain this appeal because it is not premature. Although it is possible that the justice who granted Hastey's motion may not preside at the eventual trial, the in limine ruling was stated with finality. The court clearly excluded any extrinsic evidence that Hastey was intoxicated at the time of the 1990 manslaughter offense, thus creating a reasonable likelihood that the prosecution would be terminated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   B. Order on Motion in Limine\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   [\u00b6 15] In line with Hastey's argument to us on appeal, the court announced in its in-limine order that it \"will follow the categorical approach to determine whether the required elements of the predicate offense [in section 2411(1-A)(D)(2) ] are established.\" Applying that analytical framework, the court granted Hastey's motion and concluded that the State's proof of the enhancing factor would be limited to the 1990 indictment and the 1991 judgment and commitment because, although those documents\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   establish [Hastey] was convicted of manslaughter, which was the result of criminally negligent operation of a motor vehicle[,] ... [the State] cannot establish the element \"while under the influence\" without relying on extrinsic evidence outside from the 1990 indictment and 1991 judgment. To establish the predicate element of \"while under the influence,\" evidence of [Hastey's] intoxication at the time of the 1990 offense would have to be offered and admitted. This would surely be a factfinding endeavor, which would unfairly require [Hastey] to defend very old and stale allegations. It is the [c]ourt's belief that is the type of unfairness and potential prejudice that the\n   <em>\n    categorical approach\n   </em>\n   is meant to avoid.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   [\u00b6 16] The State argues that the court erred by depriving the State of the opportunity to present extrinsic evidence at trial of Hastey's alleged intoxication because the statutory phrase \"involving or resulting from\" introduces a specific enhancing element separate and distinct from the homicide conviction that requires proof of the circumstances underlying the commission of the manslaughter offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   [\u00b6 17] We begin with a brief discussion of the categorical approach to provide a context for our assessment of the trial court's reasoning and decision. We then examine section 2411(1-A)(D)(2) to determine whether the court erred when it excluded evidence of the circumstances of\n   Hastey's prior criminal homicide conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   1. The Categorical Approach\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   [\u00b6 18] In 1990, the United States Supreme Court first applied an analytical process that came to be known as the \"categorical approach\" to determine the meaning of the word \"burglary\" in a sentence-enhancing provision of the federal Armed Career Criminal Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"634101\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/575/#p601\">\n    495 U.S. at 602\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"634101\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/575/#p601\">\n    110 S.Ct. 2143\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Act imposed an enhanced sentence \"upon certain firearm-law offenders who also have three prior convictions for 'a violent felony,' \" and defined \"violent felony\" to include \"burglary.\"\n   <em>\n    Nijhawan v.

DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   [\u00b6 32] Sentence enhancers generally come in two categories-(1) prior convictions and (2) facts associated with the commission of the crime presently charged, usually called \"aggravating factors.\" For example, 17-A M.R.S. \u00a7 1252(4-B)(A) (2017) enhances the penalty of \"repeat sexual assault offenders\" who have been previously convicted of certain offenses, while 17-A M.R.S. \u00a7 210(1)(B) (2017) increases a terrorizing offense from Class D to Class C when it causes the evacuation of a building. The former requires proof of a past conviction (usually for the same or similar conduct), while the latter requires proof of specific facts associated with the present crime charged. The Court references such enhancers in its opinion, but fails to make a distinction between those based on aggravating factors and those based on prior convictions. Court's Opinion \u00b6 24 n. 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   [\u00b6 33] The Court takes the position that the sentence enhancer in section 2411 is\n   based on aggravating factors associated with a prior conviction. Court's Opinion \u00b6 24. In its view, the language \"involving or resulting from\" does not modify the prior criminal homicide conviction, but rather is a separate and distinct element to be proved in addition to the prior conviction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   Court's Opinion \u00b6 24. I disagree with the Court's assertion that a plain reading of the statute supports its holding. At best, the language is ambiguous, and a reasonable interpretation is that the language \"involving or resulting from\" modifies the term \"criminal homicide\n   <em>\n    conviction\n   </em>\n   \" rather than being a separate and distinct element.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   [\u00b6 34] The legislative history behind section 2411 strongly supports the proposition that it contains a sentence enhancement predicated on the prior conviction. In 2003, the Legislature undertook a comprehensive revamp of criminal and civil violations, seeking to create a one-to-one relationship between each offense and the corresponding statutory cite. L.D. 1567, Summary (121st Legis. 2003). In the summary of the bill, the Legislature stated \"[t]he enhancers that this bill includes are for prior convictions.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12318130\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/157/775/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This could not be any clearer-the sentence enhancer is for the\n   <em>\n    prior conviction\n   </em>\n   , not for\n   <em>\n    facts\n   </em>\n   associated with that conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   [\u00b6 35] The Nevada Supreme Court has recently dealt with an almost identical issue. In\n   <em>\n    Redeker v. Eighth Judicial District Court\n   </em>\n   , the Nevada court was faced with the interpreting of a statute enhancing the penalty of defendants who had been \"convicted of a felony\n   <em>\n    involving\n   </em>\n   the use or threat of violence to the person of another.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8202591\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nev/122/164/\">\n    122 Nev. 164\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8202591\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nev/122/164/\">\n    127 P.3d 520\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 522 (2006) (emphasis added). There, the Nevada court refused to allow the state to treat the facts of the prior conviction as a separate element and to present evidence of the underlying facts of the prior case; the court limited the evidence to proof of the prior conviction.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   The language of [the statute] ... does not restrict the determination of the character of a felony simply to consideration of its statutory elements. On the other hand, the statute does not indicate that no limits should be placed on the sort of evidence that can be considered\n   in making that determination. We believe that the approach in\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Shepard\n   </em>\n   answers the concerns about due process ... as well as the practical difficulties and potential unfairness of a factual approach recognized by the United States Supreme Court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 525-26. Succinctly, the Nevada court concluded that \"[t]he statutory language indicates that the felony itself must involve the use or threat of violence, not that the defendant made threats of violence and also committed a felony.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 528.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   [\u00b6 36] Here, the Court's holding in this case does just that-it creates a sentence enhancer not based on the fact of a prior conviction, but on a prior conviction plus facts occurring during the prior conviction. This creates an element beyond the fact of a prior conviction. This added element is not supported by the legislative history or apparent intent of section 2411.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   [\u00b6 37] The approach adopted by the Court will allow the State to produce extrinsic evidence that Hastey was operating under the influence at the time of his manslaughter conviction, even though there is the possibility that the\n   <em>\n    conviction\n   </em>\n   did not \"involve or result from\" the operation of a motor vehicle while under the influence. The Court's approach will necessarily result in a retrial of the factual circumstance surrounding a twenty-six-year-old manslaughter case. There are potential unintended consequences of such an approach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   [\u00b6 38] In the long run, the Court's holding will make it more difficult for the State to prove the existence of an enhancer pursuant to section 2411. In this case, the transcript for the Rule 11 hearing was not available, but in future cases the categorical approach adopted by the federal courts and other state courts would more readily establish a connection between the prior criminal homicide conviction and operating under the influence than having to prove that the defendant operated under the influence during the prior conviction. The defendant would have another bite at the apple, and could convince a jury that even though the court documents could establish that the prior conviction for criminal homicide involved or resulted from operating under the influence, they were not operating under the influence during the prior conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   [\u00b6 39] Besides the practical problems confronting the State in proving a twenty-six-year-old incident of operating under the influence, it is fundamentally unfair to Hastey to undo the terms of his plea to manslaughter. After twenty-six years, Hastey now faces having to defend against the charge of operating under the influence that was dismissed as part of his plea agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Descamps v.
