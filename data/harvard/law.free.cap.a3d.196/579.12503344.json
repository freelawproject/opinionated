The agency did not violate \"clearly established\" equal protection and due process rights by\n   pursuing a regulatory enforcement action against plaintiff, and by directing that communications between plaintiff and the agency be channeled through their respective attorneys while the contentious administrative litigation was ongoing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Briefly stated, the backdrop of this matter is as follows.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   RDI is a New Jersey corporation and is the largest radon measurement business in the State. RDI has been certified periodically by the DEP to provide radon services pursuant to the Radiation Protection Act, N.J.S.A. 26:2D-1 to -89, and associated regulations, N.J.A.C. 7:28-27.1 to - 27.35. The regulatory program is administered through the DEP's Radon Section.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Between August 2009 and June 2010, the DEP issued six Administrative Orders and Notices of Prosecution (\"AO/NOP\") to RDI. RDI requested adjudicatory hearings for each of the six AO/NOPs. The matters were transmitted to the Office of Administrative Law (\"OAL\") and consolidated. On March 14, 2013, an Administrative Law Judge (\"the first ALJ\") issued a partial summary decision on the six AO/NOPs. The first ALJ found in favor of the DEP on all but two of the violations in the AO/NOPs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The DEP then issued three additional AO/NOPs against RDI in February 2011, June 2013, and December 2014. RDI requested an administrative hearing before the OAL on these additional claimed violations. The matter was tried on intermittent days before a second Administrative Law Judge (\"the second ALJ\") between October 2015 and February 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Ultimately, on June 28, 2017, the second ALJ issued a lengthy decision finding the DEP had proven a majority of the violations. RDI filed exceptions to those findings with the DEP Commissioner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On November 1, 2017, the Commissioner issued a final agency decision adopting the decision of both ALJs, with slight modification. RDI's appeal in A-1777-17 ensued. Given the pendency of that appeal, the\n   DEP has yet to bring a penalty enforcement action against RDI based on the violations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Meanwhile, in September 2016, RDI filed the present civil action in the Law Division against the DEP and various DEP officials.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In general, the lawsuit alleges defendants retaliated against RDI after the company contested the AO/NOPs issued by the agency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   More specifically, RDI alleges that defendants engaged in a \"pattern of harassing, intimidating, discriminatory, and threating conduct.\" RDI contends this retaliation began in September 2015, approximately one month before the OAL hearing before the second ALJ, and continued through the trial. The alleged misconduct includes: refusing to respond to RDI's telephone calls and emails regarding business and compliance matters because of the pending OAL hearing; and prohibiting RDI from hand-delivering a license renewal form to the DEP's offices. In addition, RDI contends DEP officials made several threatening remarks to or about RDI, refused to meet with an RDI representative, and that one DEP official uttered an anti-Semitic slur about the President of RDI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   As amended, RDI's complaint asserts claims of equal protection, procedural due process, and substantive due process violations of the New Jersey Constitution, the Law Against Discrimination (\"LAD\"), N.J.S.A. 10:5-1 to -49; and tortious interference with prospective economic advantage. Although it is not expressly pled in its complaint, RDI also relies on the New Jersey Civil Rights Act, N.J.S.A. 10:6-1 to -2 (\"NJCRA\"). Only the constitutionally-based and NJCRA claims are presently at stake in this interlocutory appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Shortly after the filing of RDI's lawsuit, a trial judge denied RDI's\n   <em>\n    ex\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    parte\n   </em>\n   motion for temporary restraints. Thereafter, the judge conducted a hearing and issued a preliminary injunction that partially granted relief to RDI. The judge found that RDI had failed to demonstrate a sufficient nexus between defendants' alleged misconduct and any irreparable harm to RDI. However, the preliminary injunction requires defendants to accept email communications from RDI and respond within one business day if the email is not marked \"urgent,\" or respond within one hour if the email is so marked and is transmitted within business hours. The injunction also requires RDI to submit documents to DEP by regular, certified, or overnight mail during the pendency of the litigation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Defendants moved to dismiss various claims asserted in the complaint. Most pertinent to the present appeal, defendants invoked principles of qualified immunity and argued that RDI's constitutional and NJCRA claims must be dismissed because defendants violated no \"clearly established\" laws in their alleged interactions with RDI and its representatives.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   A second trial judge heard oral argument on defendants' motions. Following that argument, the second judge allowed the LAD claim and the tortious interference claim to continue against the DEP and the remaining individual defendants in their official capacities. The judge also allowed RDI's constitutional claims of equal protection and substantive due process violations and the related NJCRA claims to proceed against three individual defendants in their unofficial capacities. The judge found that RDI's claims \"implicate clearly established constitutional or statutory right[s] and [as] such [present] an issue that the court will consider when,\n   and if, summary judgment motions based on [same] are filed.\" The judge denied defendants' ensuing motion for reconsideration.\n   Thereafter, defendants moved for leave to appeal solely the judge's denial of its dismissal motion based on qualified immunity. Defendants have not sought review of the continuation of the LAD and tortious interference counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Our review of a ruling on a motion to dismiss a complaint for failure to state a cause of action is de novo. As such, \"we apply a plenary standard of review ... [and] owe no deference to the trial court's conclusions.\"\n   <em>\n    Rezem Family Assocs., LP v.

Given the contentious adversarial context, it was not discriminatory or unreasonable for the DEP to take protective steps to have the adverse parties communicate through their attorneys while the acrimonious regulatory case was pending. No other company has been identified that was embroiled in an equivalent adversarial proceeding with the DEP Radon Section. The requirement of \"similarly-situated\" parties is simply not met.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Turning to the second prong of whether the agency had a reasonable basis for undertaking certain stringent actions with respect to RDI, we concur with the DEP that such a basis is present here. The administrative case involved numerous charges of regulatory violations by RDI, most of which were sustained by the two ALJs who served as independent fact-finders, and many of which we have upheld today in our partial affirmance of the Commissioner's final agency decision. The history of RDI's regulatory non-compliance, and the adversarial context existing while the\n   administrative case was pending, justified the DEP in taking reasonable steps to protect its litigation interests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Indeed, the mutual adversarial intensity appears to have become progressively worse as the administrative hearings went forward. The record reflects that at one point the DEP threatened to get the police involved. The DEP asserts that it began limiting and channeling RDI's contacts with staff in the Radon Section out of a concern that RDI might use such contacts to generate possible statements against interest that could be used against the DEP in the administrative litigation. For instance, as the second ALJ noted in her findings, during the eighteen months while the OAL case was pending, the DEP received about 250 phone calls and emails from RDI, compared to about 300 phone calls and emails it received from the other twenty-nine radiation mitigation businesses combined. That statistic bolsters both our determination that RDI was not similarly situated to other radon companies, and also that the DEP had at least colorable reasons for treating its communications with RDI's representatives differently.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The DEP's decision to channel communications between the adverse parties through counsel, rather than through staff, also is consistent with the public policies underlying Rule of Professional Conduct (\"RPC\") 4.2. In pertinent part, RPC 4.2 states: \"In representing a client, a lawyer shall not communicate about the subject of the representation with a person the lawyer knows, or by the exercise of reasonable diligence should know, to be represented\n   by another lawyer in the matter ....\" RPC 4.2. The rule contains certain exceptions, including situations where the communication is \"authorized by law.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1084543\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/331/529/#p539\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   We recognize the literal terms of RPC 4.2 do not apply here, because there is no claim that RDI's counsel was attempting to communicate directly with staff in the DEP's Radon Section while the DEP was being represented by its own counsel in the ongoing administrative case. Even so, the DEP had a legitimate interest in channeling communications through the parties' respective counsel to assure that further staff-to-staff communications did not become\n   evidential fodder in the administrative litigation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Stated differently, RDI had no \"clearly established right\" to dictate how this particular government agency was to communicate with RDI while the hotly-contested litigation was ongoing. Government must retain the discretion to respond to private parties in a manner it finds most efficient and effective. The fact that the DEP's website for the radon program generically advises the public to contact the Radon Section directly with questions\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   is immaterial, given the distinctive setting of ongoing litigation between the DEP and an entity it regulates. So long as the DEP responds to an adversary's inquiries within a reasonable time and in a reasonable manner, no \"clearly established\" right of access to government has been infringed. Although we recognize the DEP could have been more courteous and cooperative when it declined to accept a hand-delivery of RDI's license renewal material from RDI's President, that isolated incident does not suffice to defeat defendants' assertion of qualified immunity, particularly since there was still ample time for the renewal application to be received and processed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   In short, RDI's claims of an equal protection violation - even viewing the facts alleged in the complaint in a light most favorable to the company - fall short of presenting a viable cause of action under constitutional principles. Defendants are entitled as a matter of law to qualified immunity dismissing those claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The same analysis and legal conclusion essentially extend to RDI's claims of a constitutional deprivation of due process. It is well established that the right to engage in common occupations of life \"free from unreasonable governmental interference comes within both the 'liberty' and 'property' concepts of the\n   ...

The conduct alleged by RDI did not infringe upon any \"clearly established\" constitutional rights of RDI. The DEP's decisions to pursue regulatory violations against RDI and to channel communications through counsel as\n   the administrative case became increasingly contentious do not \"shock the conscience.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Lastly, we reject RDI's argument that defendants' actions violated a clearly established statutory right under the NJCRA or otherwise. The only statutory right that properly remains in the case is the LAD claim of alleged religious or ethnic discrimination. That pending claim is unaffected by the present interlocutory appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   These substantive points aside, we add that we discern no need to withhold immunity-based dismissal, pending discovery. As we have noted, qualified immunity is not simply immunity from a final judgment, but is immunity from suit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mitchell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1512327\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/472/511/#p526\">\n    472 U.S. at 526\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1512327\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/472/511/#p526\">\n    105 S.Ct. 2806\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding qualified immunity is intended to avoid \"subject[ing] government officials either to the costs of trial or to the burdens of broad-reaching discovery.\"). The claims of constitutional deprivation are ripe in this case for dismissal on immunity grounds. There is no need for discovery on those claims. Discovery on the remaining LAD and tortious interference claims, however, is left to the trial court's pre-trial case management and discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The trial court's orders are therefore reversed with respect to defendants' assertion of qualified immunity. The matter is remanded for the trial court to adjudicate solely the open LAD and tortious interference claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Reversed and remanded.
