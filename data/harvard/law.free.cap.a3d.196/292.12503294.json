On October 14, 2016, this Court granted Mr. Ricci's petition for a writ of certiorari.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Mr. Ricci contends before this Court that the hearing justice erred in granting the motion for summary judgment for the following reasons: (1) \"ineffective assistance of counsel is a material fact;\" (2) \"claims of ineffective assistance of counsel cannot be barred by\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   ;\" (3) the hearing justice did not hold an evidentiary hearing, which Mr. Ricci contends he was entitled to given the severity of his sentence; (4) the hearing justice \"utilized the 'farce and mockery' standard which was abolished by this Court;\" (5) the hearing justice \"utilized a higher standard of proof than the statute requires;\" (6) \"[t]he interest of justice requires that [Mr. Ricci] be permitted to assert the tardiness of the habitual offender notice as grounds for relief;\" and (7) \"[t]he interest of justice requires that [Mr. Ricci] be permitted to assert the lack of consent to the amendment of the criminal indictment as grounds for relief.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this case should not be summarily decided. After a close review of the record and careful consideration of the parties' arguments (both written and oral), we are satisfied that cause has not been shown and that this case may be decided at this time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    Facts and Travel\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On December 18, 2009, Mr. Ricci entered Francis Quinn's home. Mr. Ricci knocked Mr. Quinn to the floor and put his hands around Mr. Quinn's throat before taking approximately forty dollars from him and fleeing. Mr. Quinn recognized the assailant's voice and identified him to the police as Mr. Ricci. On September 30, 2010, Mr. Ricci was found guilty by a jury on the following three counts: burglary, in violation of G.L. 1956 \u00a7 11-8-1 ; robbery in the first degree, in violation of G.L. 1956 \u00a7 11-39-1(a)(3) ; and assault on a person over the age of sixty, in violation of G.L. 1956 \u00a7 11-5-10. Mr. Ricci was sentenced as follows: (1) on the first count, thirty years with twenty years to serve and ten years suspended with probation; (2) on the second count, thirty years with twenty years to serve and ten years suspended with probation; and (3) on the third count, ten years to serve. All sentences were to run concurrently. Additionally, at sentencing, Mr. Ricci was declared an habitual offender and was sentenced to fifteen years with at least ten years to serve before becoming eligible for parole, to run consecutively.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Mr. Ricci appealed to this Court and contended on appeal that the trial justice committed reversible error in failing to adequately instruct the jury as to how to assess credibility, in failing to instruct the jury that a history of drug abuse could weaken credibility, and in denying Mr. Ricci's motion for a new trial. This Court affirmed Mr. Ricci's conviction in\n   <em>\n    State v. Ricci\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7312024\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/54/965/\">\n    54 A.3d 965\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (R.I. 2012). In the course of relating the facts in that opinion, the Court made two observations in footnotes\n   to which Mr. Ricci directs our attention in the instant case. The first of those footnotes is footnote 1, which reads as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   \"On [the assault count], the original indictment incorrectly charged defendant with violating G.L. 1956 \u00a7 11-5-20, rather than \u00a7 11-5-10. We pause to note that although the state later filed an 'amended indictment' correcting this error in open court, and defense counsel did not object, it is unclear from the record whether defendant himself consented to the 'amended indictment' in accordance with Rule 7 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure.\"\n   <em>\n    Ricci\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7312024\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/54/965/\">\n    54 A.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   967 n.1.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Subsequently, in footnote 2, this Court stated the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \"It appears from our review of the record that the Attorney General did not present Ricci as a habitual offender either within forty-five days of the arraignment or prior to the date of the first pretrial conference, as required by the statute. However, this issue is not before us on appeal.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7312024\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/54/965/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 967 n.2.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On February 15, 2013, Mr. Ricci filed a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   application for postconviction relief, in which he alleged: (1) that the indictment in his case was \"improperly amended without [his] consent;\" (2) that he was \"improperly sentenced as an habitual offender because [he] was not presented as an habitual offender within forty-five days of arraignment or prior to the first pretrial conference;\" and (3) that his \"trial attorney was ineffective for failing to object to the amendment of the indictment, and for failing to object to the untimely habitual offender notice and sentence.\" Mr. Ricci was then provided with court-appointed counsel; that attorney subsequently filed a no-merit memorandum and a motion to withdraw pursuant to the dictates of\n   <em>\n    Shatney v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11200839\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/755/130/\">\n    755 A.2d 130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (R.I. 2000). That motion was granted, and Mr. Ricci thereafter engaged private counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In March of 2014, Mr. Ricci's private counsel submitted a \"Post Conviction Relief Pre-Hearing Memorandum.\" In that document, the above-summarized allegations were expanded to include the further allegations that Mr. Ricci's trial counsel had been ineffective for: (1) his \"failure to establish a sound theory of the case;\" (2) his \"failure to make effective and timely objections\" concerning the prosecutor's opening statement, the direct and re-direct testimony of Mr. Quinn, the testimony of Walter French,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the admission of the transcript of Mr. Quinn's 911 call; (3) his \"failure to effectively impeach the state's key witness;\" and (4) his \"failure to make an effective final argument.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On April 11, 2014, the state moved for summary judgment pursuant to G.L. 1956 \u00a7 10-9.1-6.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   A hearing on that motion took\n   place on June 13, 2014 in Superior Court. At the close of that hearing, the hearing justice granted the state's motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In rendering her opinion, the hearing justice began by describing at some length the factual and procedural history of the case. The hearing justice next noted that the burden of proof with respect to an application for postconviction relief was on the petitioner, Mr. Ricci. She then began her analysis by addressing the contention that the habitual offender notice was not filed at the appropriate time. She concluded that the notice was in fact timely and that, regardless, the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   barred consideration of the argument because it could have been raised in Mr. Ricci's direct appeal. With respect to the amendment of Mr. Ricci's indictment, she determined that the statutory citation error in the indictment was not prejudicial to Mr. Ricci and, as such, was not an \"error in form\" as contemplated by Rule 7(e) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure, which would have required his consent to amend the indictment. She further held that, in any event, that issue was similarly barred by the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The hearing justice also addressed the allegations of ineffective assistance of trial counsel. She noted that Mr. Ricci had the burden of demonstrating the existence of a genuine issue of material fact and that he could not rely on mere allegations, unsupported statements, and pleadings. She concluded that Mr. Ricci had not met that burden because he had presented \"no affidavit or other evidence * * * that demonstrate[d] that [Mr. Ricci] was prejudiced inasmuch as the jury would have acquitted him had it not been for counsel's alleged defective examinations, his inadequate final argument, and his failure to object at various times during the trial * * *.\" She also noted that there was \"overwhelming evidence\" against Mr. Ricci.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Accordingly, on June 13, 2014, a judgment entered granting the state's motion for summary judgment and denying Mr. Ricci's application for postconviction relief. On August 29, 2016, Mr. Ricci filed a petition for the issuance of a writ of certiorari for review of that judgment, which petition this Court subsequently granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    II\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   We begin by noting that \"[o]ur review of a case on certiorari is limited to an examination of the record to determine if an error of law has been committed.\"\n   <em>\n    DeCurtis v.

We shall also address his argument, set forth in his application for postconviction relief, that the trial justice erred in permitting the amendment of his indictment without his consent, which consent he alleges was required pursuant to Rule 7(e) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   However, we need not delve any further into the specific facts forming the basis of Mr. Ricci's arguments in this portion of the opinion, due to our conclusion that his contentions were barred by the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   and could not be raised in Mr. Ricci's application for postconviction relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The doctrine of\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   as applied to applications for postconviction relief is codified in \u00a7 10-9.1-8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <em>\n    Hall v.

Additionally, Mr. Ricci's direct appeal clearly resulted in a final judgment. And, most importantly, Mr. Ricci could have raised his contention with respect to the timeliness of the habitual offender notice in his direct appeal. He could also have raised at that time his contention that it was error for the trial justice to allow the amendment of his indictment without his consent.

Specifically, he posits that \"ineffective assistance of counsel is a material fact\" because determinations of credibility cannot be made at the summary judgment stage. He cites to the following sentence in\n   <em>\n    Randall v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12119681\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/609/949/\">\n    609 A.2d 949\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (R.I. 1992), to support his contention: \"Since a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel raises questions of fact, disposition of such a case by way of summary judgment is not possible.\"\n   <em>\n    Randall\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12119681\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/609/949/\">\n    609 A.2d at 950\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Finally, it is his contention that the hearing justice could not make credibility determinations without an evidentiary hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   We must first address the\n   <em>\n    Randall\n   </em>\n   case on which Mr. Ricci relies. While Mr. Ricci accurately quotes from that opinion, we are of the view that the statement in that opinion to the effect that allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel raise issues of fact that cannot be disposed of by way of summary judgment is not a blanket statement intended to apply to every allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   We turn next to Mr. Ricci's contention that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to raise the allegedly untimely filing of the habitual offender notice. Section 12-19-21(b) states in pertinent part as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   \"Whenever it appears a person shall be deemed a 'habitual criminal,' the attorney general, within forty-five (45) days of the arraignment, but in no case later than the date of the pretrial conference, may file with the court a notice specifying that the defendant, upon conviction, is subject to the imposition of an additional sentence in accordance with this section[.]\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   In the instant case, Mr. Ricci was arraigned on April 8, 2010. The habitual offender notice was filed on June 21, 2010. Mr. Ricci contends that the first pretrial conference in the instant case occurred on May 17, 2010. However, the hearing justice stated that the May 17, 2010 pretrial conference was \"vacated\" and was conducted on June 21, 2010 instead. Our review of the record confirms the hearing justice's statement. Thus, the habitual offender notice in the instant case was filed outside the forty-five day window provided for in the statute, but on the same day as the first pretrial conference. In\n   <em>\n    State v. Peterson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11768629\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/722/259/\">\n    722 A.2d 259\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (R.I. 1998), this Court held that an habitual offender notice filed outside the forty-five day window provided for in the statute but before the first pretrial conference was timely.\n   <em>\n    Peterson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11768629\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/722/259/\">\n    722 A.2d at 263-64, 265\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Given the existence of such a holding in our jurisprudence, it cannot be said that an attorney was ineffective for failing to raise an argument about a purported untimely filing of the habitual offender notice in this case. Accordingly, we perceive no reversible error by the hearing justice with respect to the issue of the ineffectiveness of trial counsel for failure to raise the timeliness of the habitual offender notice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The next allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel to be addressed is Mr. Ricci's contention that it was ineffective for his counsel to have failed to object to the amendment of his indictment. He contends that the amendment of his indictment required his consent and, as this Court noted in\n   <em>\n    Ricci\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7312024\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/54/965/\">\n    54 A.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   967 n.1, that consent was not given. Rule 7(e) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure provides in pertinent part as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   \"At any time prior to verdict or finding, the court may with the consent of the defendant permit the indictment to be amended to correct an error in form or the description of the offense intended to be charged or to charge a lesser included offense.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Meanwhile, Rule 7(c) states in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   \"Error in the citation or its omission shall not be grounds for dismissal of the\n   indictment, information, or complaint or for reversal of a conviction if the error or omission did not mislead the defendant to the defendant's prejudice.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   As the hearing justice noted in the instant case, this Court reconciled those two rules in\n   <em>\n    State v. Donato\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11292765\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/414/797/\">\n    414 A.2d 797\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (R.I. 1980). In that case, we were likewise confronted with an error as to a statutory citation in the indictment.\n   <em>\n    Donato\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11292765\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/414/797/\">\n    414 A.2d at 801\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We held that \"a nonprejudicial error in statutory citation simply * * * could not properly be deemed to be a Rule 7(e) 'error in form.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11292765\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/414/797/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11292765\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/414/797/\">\n    at 802\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

We went on to state that only if the error were prejudicial to the defendant would it be deemed an \"error in form\" under Rule 7(e) requiring the defendant's consent to amend the indictment.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11292765\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/414/797/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   We held that the citation error in the indictment in that case was not prejudicial.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11292765\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/414/797/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11292765\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/414/797/\">\n    at 804\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The indictment in the instant case charged Mr. Ricci with \"knowingly and willfully commit[ting] an assault and battery upon Francis Quinn, he being a person over Sixty (60) years of age, causing bodily injury, in violation of \u00a7 11-5-20 of the General Laws of Rhode Island * * *.\" The citation in the indictment should have been to \u00a7 11-5-10 rather than \u00a7 11-5-20. That error was certainly not prejudicial to Mr. Ricci, because it was clear what crime he was being charged with from the text of the indictment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Donato\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11292765\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/414/797/\">\n    414 A.2d at 804\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The citation error was clearly of the\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   variety. As such, Mr. Ricci's consent was not required for the indictment to be amended. We perceive no error on the part of the hearing justice in finding that there was no evidence to demonstrate a genuine issue of material fact concerning Mr. Ricci's allegation that his trial counsel was ineffective in failing to object to the amendment of the indictment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   What is more, with respect to the remaining allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel, our thorough review of the hearing justice's decision indicates that, contrary to the assertion of Mr. Ricci, she did not make credibility determinations. Rather, it was her clear holding that Mr. Ricci had produced no evidence to indicate that any of the remaining allegedly ineffective actions or inactions by his trial counsel had resulted in any prejudice to him; specifically, she found that Mr. Ricci was relying on mere allegations and the fact that he was ultimately convicted. After our review of the record in this case, we are in agreement with the hearing justice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Page\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7290916\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/995/934/#p942\">\n    995 A.2d at 943\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (discussing the second prong of the\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   standard). Mr. Ricci has not produced any evidence to indicate that a genuine issue of material fact exists with respect to whether, but for the allegedly ineffective actions or inactions of trial counsel, the result of his trial would have been different.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Barros\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12493554\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/180/823/#p828\">\n    180 A.3d at 829\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Moreover, we note that there was strong evidence of Mr. Ricci's guilt, including the fact that Mr. Quinn identified Mr. Ricci as his attacker. Thus, given the fact that Mr. Ricci did not produce any evidence to show the existence of a genuine issue of material fact\n   with respect to the second prong of the\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   standard, the state was entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the remaining allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 10-9.1-6(c) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Doyle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5546134\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ri/122/590/#p594\">\n    122 R.I. at 593-94\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11365563,5546134\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/411/907/\">\n    411 A.2d at 909\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Accordingly, we perceive no reversible error in the hearing justice's grant of summary disposition as to the allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    C\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    Other Issues Raised by Mr. Ricci\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Mr. Ricci raises two additional contentions before this Court.

We shall address these contentions in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   We first address Mr. Ricci's contention that he was entitled to an evidentiary hearing due to the severity of his sentence. This Court stated in\n   <em>\n    Tassone v.

Mr. Ricci has not been sentenced to life without the possibility of parole; and, therefore,\n   <em>\n    Tassone\n   </em>\n   is inapplicable. Additionally, we decline at this time to consider extending the holding in\n   <em>\n    Tassone\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Mr. Ricci further argues that the hearing justice inappropriately used what Mr. Ricci characterizes as the \"farce and mockery\" standard when assessing his contentions that his trial counsel was ineffective. Specifically, the hearing justice stated as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   \"[A] Court deciding an actual ineffective assistance claim must judge the reasonableness of counsel's challenged conduct on the facts of the particular case viewed as of the time of counsel's conduct.

There is no merit to this contention. The hearing justice was utilizing \u00a7 10-9.1-6(c), not subsection (b), and it is clear from perusal of her decision that she was not requiring definitive proof of a different outcome but rather some evidence to show that a genuine issue of fact existed as to whether or not the result of Mr. Ricci's trial would have been different but for the alleged errors by trial counsel.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
