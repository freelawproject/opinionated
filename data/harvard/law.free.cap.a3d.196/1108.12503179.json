In the above consolidated cases, the State appeals the trial court's interlocutory orders granting defendants' motions in limine seeking to suppress evidence of their refusal to submit to blood tests to determine if they were operating a motor vehicle under the influence of drugs (DUI). The trial court granted the motions in limine based on its conclusion that in\n   <em>\n    Birchfield v. North Dakota\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597986\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2160/\">\n    136 S.Ct. 2160\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597986\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2160/\">\n    195 L.Ed.2d 560\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016), the U.S. Supreme Court recognized a constitutional right, pursuant to the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, to refuse to submit to a warrantless blood test. In the trial court's view, that constitutional right supersedes Vermont's implied consent law and precludes the State from introducing evidence of defendants' refusal at their criminal DUI trial. The State challenges the trial court's interpretation of Birchfield, arguing that the U.S. Supreme Court indicated therein that evidence of a refusal to take a warrantless blood test in the context of a DUI arrest and prosecution could be admitted at trial as evidence of guilt. Defendants respond that the constitutional issue has been effectively mooted by a post- Birchfield amendment to Vermont's implied consent law and that, in any event, the trial court correctly construed Birchfield and other related federal law to prohibit the admission of evidence of a refusal to consent to a warrantless blood test. We conclude that the amendment to the implied consent law did not moot the constitutional issue before us. We further conclude that the trial court erred in determining that, following the\n   <em>\n    Birchfield\n   </em>\n   decision, the Fourth Amendment prohibits admitting in a criminal DUI proceeding evidence of a defendant's refusal to submit to a warrantless blood test requested pursuant to Vermont's implied consent law. Accordingly, we reverse the trial court's decisions granting defendants' motions in limine and remand the cases for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I. Facts and Procedural History\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 2. In\n   <em>\n    State v. Rajda\n   </em>\n   , the trial court accepted as true the following facts set forth in the State's affidavits. On September 3, 2015, a state trooper responded to a report of a motor vehicle accident in\n   Shrewsbury, Vermont. At the scene, the trooper interviewed defendant, who stated that she \"blacked out\" while driving on the road and regained consciousness immediately before crashing her vehicle. She told the trooper that her driver's license had been suspended following a conviction for DUI. She also stated that she had a history of alcohol use and opiate addiction. She denied having had anything to drink before the crash, and a preliminary breath test indicated a 0.00 blood-alcohol content (BAC).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 3. The trooper then arrested defendant on suspicion of DUI and driving with a suspended license. Following the arrest, a drug recognition expert evaluated defendant and determined that she was under the influence of a central nervous system depressant. When asked to submit to a blood test, defendant refused.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 4. The State originally charged defendant with: DUI, third offense\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   ; criminal refusal; operating a motor vehicle with a suspended license; reckless endangerment; and cruelty to a child under ten years of age. Following the\n   <em>\n    Birchfield\n   </em>\n   decision, in which the U.S. Supreme Court held that a motorist suspected of DUI could not be criminally prosecuted for refusing to take a blood test, --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597986\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2160/\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 2184-86\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the State dismissed the criminal refusal charge. Defendant filed a motion in limine seeking to suppress evidence of her refusal to submit to a blood test, arguing that under Birchfield she had a constitutional right to refuse to submit to the test and thus the State could not present evidence of her refusal to do so. In opposition to the motion, the State argued that the holding in\n   <em>\n    Birchfield\n   </em>\n   prohibited only a separate prosecution for a refusal and did not extend to prohibiting admission of evidence of a refusal at a DUI prosecution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 5. In a February 1, 2017 decision, the trial court agreed with defendant, ruling that after the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Birchfield, the Fourth Amendment prohibited admission of evidence of a refusal to submit to a warrantless blood test. Accordingly, the court concluded that the provision in Vermont's implied consent law explicitly allowing the introduction of evidence of a refusal to take an evidentiary test, defined as either a breath or blood test, was unconstitutional under the U.S. Constitution to the extent it applied to blood tests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 6. Two months later, the same trial court judge, by entry order, granted defendant's motion in limine in\n   <em>\n    State v. Lape\n   </em>\n   . As in\n   <em>\n    Rajda\n   </em>\n   , a drug recognition expert found defendant to be impaired after he was arrested for DUI. Defendant was initially charged with DUI-fourth offense, criminal refusal-third offense, driving with a suspended license, and possession of a narcotic drug. In response to defendant's motion in limine, the State dismissed the criminal refusal charge. The trial court concluded that no facts distinguished this case from\n   <em>\n    State v. Rajda\n   </em>\n   with respect to its legal analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 7. In each case, the State filed a motion for permission to file an interlocutory appeal, and the trial court granted the motions. We accepted the interlocutory appeals and consolidated the cases for purposes of briefing and argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 8. On appeal, the State argues that there is no constitutional basis for excluding refusal evidence in DUI prosecutions and that the U.S. Supreme Court's decision\n   in Birchfield strongly suggested that the evidentiary consequences of a refusal to submit to a blood test in such circumstances are not constitutionally barred. Defendants respond that: (1) the appeals should be dismissed as moot in light of an amendment, effective July 1, 2017, to Vermont's implied consent law that continues to expressly allow the admission of a refusal to submit to a warrantless breath test, but no longer expressly allows the admission of a refusal to submit to a warrantless blood test; and (2) in any event, the trial court correctly ruled that, after Birchfield, the admission of evidence at a criminal DUI prosecution of a defendant's refusal to submit to a warrantless blood test violates the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   II. Statutory Amendment\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 9. Defendants first argue that we need not resolve the constitutional issue raised in these appeals because the Legislature has amended the implied consent statute to make it clear that evidence of a refusal to take a blood test, as opposed to a breath test, may not be admitted at a criminal DUI prosecution. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 10. Under Vermont's implied consent law, any person operating a motor vehicle on a highway within the state \"is deemed to have given consent to an evidentiary test of that person's\n   <em>\n    breath\n   </em>\n   for the purpose of determining the person's alcohol concentration or the presence of other drug in the blood.\" 23 V.S.A. \u00a7 1202(a)(1) (emphasis added). Further, a motor vehicle operator \"is deemed to have given consent to the taking of an evidentiary sample of\n   <em>\n    blood\n   </em>\n   \" in situations where \"breath testing equipment is not reasonably available or ... the officer has reason to believe that the person is unable to give a sufficient sample of breath for testing or ...\n   <em>\n    the law enforcement officer has reasonable grounds to believe that the person is under the influence of a drug other than alcohol\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597986\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2160/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1202(a)(2) (emphasis added). When an officer has reasonable grounds to believe that a person is operating a motor vehicle while impaired, in violation of 23 V.S.A. \u00a7 1201, an \"evidentiary test shall be required.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597986\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2160/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1202(a)(3). An evidentiary test is defined by statute as \"a breath or blood test which indicates the person's alcohol concentration or the presence of other drug and which is intended to be introduced as evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597986\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2160/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1200(3). The implied consent law criminalizes refusing a reasonable request to take \"an evidentiary test\" when either the person has a prior DUI conviction or was involved in an accident that resulted in serious bodily injury or death to another.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597986\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2160/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1201(b) - (c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 11. In June 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court held in\n   <em>\n    Birchfield\n   </em>\n   that, absent exigent circumstances, \"the Fourth Amendment permits warrantless breath tests incident to arrests for drunk driving,\" but does not permit the taking of warrantless blood tests either incident to an arrest for drunk driving or based on the driver's legally implied consent to submit to the test. --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597986\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2160/\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 2184-86\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In an apparent response to this decision, the Legislature amended \u00a7 1202 as follows. First, at the end of the subsection on blood tests, \u00a7 1202(a)(2), the following sentence was added: \"A blood test sought pursuant to this subdivision (2) shall be obtained pursuant to subsection (f) of this section.\" 2017, No. 62, \u00a7 9. Second, the clause \"[i]f a blood test is sought from a person pursuant to subdivision (a)(2) of this section\" was added to the beginning of \u00a7 1202(f), which provides that a law enforcement officer may apply for a search warrant to conduct a blood test if a person who has been involved in an accident resulting in serious injury or death to another refuses an evidentiary test.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597986\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2160/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 12. Third, and most relevant to this appeal, is the amendment to \u00a7 1202(b). The subsection previously provided as follows: \"If the person refuses to submit to an\n   <em>\n    evidentiary\n   </em>\n   test it shall not be given, except as provided in subsection (f) of this section, but the refusal may be introduced as evidence in a criminal proceeding.\" 23 V.S.A. \u00a7 1202(b) (2014) (emphasis added). After enactment of the amendment, the subsection now reads: \"A refusal to take a\n   <em>\n    breath\n   </em>\n   test may be introduced as evidence in a criminal proceeding.\" 23 V.S.A. \u00a7 1202(b) (emphasis added); see 2017, No. 62, \u00a7 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 13. Defendants argue that this change demonstrates the Legislature's intent to prohibit admitting in a criminal DUI proceeding evidence of a refusal to submit to a warrantless blood test. Defendants reason that because \u00a7 1202(b) still explicitly allows admitting evidence of a refusal to take a breath test but no longer explicitly allows admitting evidence of a refusal to take an evidentiary test, which by definition would include a blood test, the Legislature has expressed its intent to prohibit admitting evidence of a refusal to take a blood test. Defendants further argue that because amendments concerning the admissibility of types of evidence are considered procedural rather than substantive in nature, the amended statute must be applied to the instant cases, which were pending at the time of the amendment. See 1 V.S.A. \u00a7 213 (\"No act of the General Assembly shall affect a suit begun or pending at the time of its passage, except acts regulating practice in court, relating to the competency of witnesses, or relating to amendments of process or pleadings.\"); see also\n   <em>\n    Ulm v. Ford Motor Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1220439\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/170/281/#p287\">\n    170 Vt. 281\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 287-88,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1220439\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/170/281/#p287\">\n    750 A.2d 981\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 987 (2000) (concluding that because subsections of safety belt statute \"prohibit the admissibility of a particular type of evidence, thereby regulating practice in court,\" they \"are procedural rather than substantive\" and \"fall within \u00a7 213's exception\"). The State does not challenge the retroactive application of the amended statute to the instant cases, but it asserts that nothing in the 2017 amendment prohibits the introduction of refusal evidence with respect to blood tests and that the Legislature intended only to comply with Birchfield, which does not prohibit admitting in a criminal DUI proceeding evidence of a refusal to submit to a blood test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 14. \"When construing a statute, our paramount goal is to effectuate the intent of the Legislature.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Love\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20VT%2075\">\n    2017 VT 75\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 9, 205 Vt. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12491627\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/174/761/\">\n    174 A.3d 761\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation omitted). We look first to the statutory language's plain meaning as an expression of legislative intent, but when the statutory language is ambiguous or does not provide sufficient guidance to ascertain that intent, \"the Court may look elsewhere to determine the legislative intent in order to provide a fair and reasonable construction of the statute.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Reed\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20VT%2028\">\n    2017 VT 28\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 20,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=204%20Vt.%20399\">\n    204 Vt. 399\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12490845\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/169/1278/\">\n    169 A.3d 1278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Further, \"[t]estimony given to a committee of the Legislature may provide some clues as to the purpose of [an] amended statute.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12490845\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/169/1278/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In this case, the plain language of the statute does not make it clear whether the Legislature intended to exclude at a criminal DUI proceeding evidence of a refusal to submit to a blood test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 15. Our review of the legislative history reveals that the Legislature enacted the 2017 amendment to \u00a7 1202 to make Vermont's implied consent law compliant with the federal constitutional constraints imposed by the U.S. Supreme Court in Birchfield. The language amending \u00a7 1202 that ultimately became part of the more comprehensive Act 62 was initially introduced before the House Committee on\n   Transportation as H.146 and later H.511. Legislative counsel explained to the committee that the bill was drafted to amend \u00a7 1202 so that it complied with the two main holdings in Birchfield barring under the Fourth Amendment warrantless blood tests as well as criminal prosecution for a refusal to consent to a warrantless blood test. Hearing on H.146 Before House Comm. on Transp., 2017-2018 Bien. Sess. (Vt. Mar. 1, 2017), at 1:45-2:30. Committee members repeatedly asked if the amendment satisfied the constitutional requirements of Birchfield. Legislative counsel, as well as attorneys representing the Defender General's Office and the Office of States' Attorneys, agreed that it did. At one point during his testimony before the Committee, legislative counsel stated that Birchfield held if one were to refuse a blood test, the refusal could not be introduced into a criminal proceeding.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21:40-22:02. He further stated that all of the changes to the statute were necessary to comport with Birchfield.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22:15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 16. Added to both H.146 and H.511 was the following statement of purpose, which was not included in the more comprehensive H.503 that became Act 62:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   This bill proposes to make Vermont's implied consent statute consistent with the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Birchfield v. North Dakota\n   </em>\n   by providing that: (1) a warrant is required before a blood test can be given to a person suspected of DUI; and (2) a person cannot be criminally prosecuted for refusing to submit to the blood test.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   See H.146, 2017-2018 Gen. Assem., Bien. Sess. (Vt. 2017) (bill as introduced), https://legislature.vermont.gov/assets/Documents/2018/Docs/BILLS/H-0146/H-0146%20As%20Introduced.pdf [https://perma.cc/853F-YF8X]; see also H.511, 2017-2018 Gen. Assem., Bien. Sess.

The State emphasizes that the 2017 amendment to 23 V.S.A. \u00a7 1202(b) does not explicitly prohibit the admission of a refusal to take a blood test. According to the State, construing the amendment as doing so would make it inconsistent with two other provisions of \u00a7 1202 that were left in place: (1) the provision in \u00a7 1202(d)(6) requiring officers to inform persons, among other things, that a refusal to take an\n   <em>\n    evidentiary\n   </em>\n   test \"may be offered into evidence against the person at trial\"; and (2) the provision in \u00a7 1202(f) that if a blood sample is obtained by search warrant, the refusal to take a blood test \"may\n   <em>\n    still\n   </em>\n   be introduced in evidence, in addition to the results of the evidentiary test\"-thereby retaining the notion that a refusal to take a blood test may be admitted when no test was obtained. (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 18. We find little force to this argument, particularly given the fact that the Legislature also left in place the provisions\n   in \u00a7 1201(b) - (c) criminalizing refusal to take \"an evidentiary test\" in certain situations, as well as the provision in \u00a7 1202(d)(6) that an officer must inform a person, among other things, that refusing to take \"an evidentiary test\" may result in that person being \"charged with the crime of criminal refusal\" if the person has a prior DUI conviction or is involved in an accident resulting in serious bodily injury or death to another. The U.S. Supreme Court in Birchfield unequivocally prohibited a separate prosecution for a refusal to take a warrantless blood test. Thus, it appears that the 2017 amendment simply failed to address all of the language in the implied consent statute that was inconsistent with that holding in Birchfield.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 19. Nevertheless, we conclude that, in enacting Act 62, the Legislature's sole intent was to ensure that Vermont's implied consent law comported with the constitutional constraints imposed by the U.S. Supreme Court in Birchfield. The scope of those constitutional constraints is the precise question raised in these appeals-specifically, did those constraints extend to prohibit the admission in a criminal DUI prosecution of evidence of a refusal to submit to a blood test? Furthermore, insofar as the Legislature has not explicitly prohibited the admission of refusal evidence with respect to blood tests, the evidence is admissible in these cases unless we agree with defendants' constitutional challenge to admission of the evidence.

The South Dakota statute at issue permitted a suspect to refuse the test but penalized the refusal by revoking for one year the suspect's license, which the Court called an \"unquestionably legitimate\" penalty \"assuming appropriate procedural protections,\" and \"by allowing the refusal to be used against the defendant at trial.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6200055\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/459/553/#p554\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6200055\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/459/553/#p554\">\n    at 559-60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6200055\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/459/553/#p554\">\n    103 S.Ct. 916\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Court reasoned that the state was not directly compelling\n   suspects to refuse the test because it was giving them a choice whether to take or refuse it; however, this reasoning was based in part on the consideration \"that the state could legitimately compel the suspect, against his will, to accede to the test\"-a consideration later negated by the Birchfield holding at issue here.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6200055\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/459/553/#p554\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6200055\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/459/553/#p554\">\n    at 562-63\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6200055\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/459/553/#p554\">\n    103 S.Ct. 916\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court further reasoned that the lack of coercion is bolstered by the reality that the state wants the suspect to choose to take the test because \"the inference of intoxication arising from a positive blood-alcohol test is far stronger than that arising from a refusal to take the test.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6200055\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/459/553/#p554\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6200055\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/459/553/#p554\">\n    at 564\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6200055\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/459/553/#p554\">\n    103 S.Ct. 916\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In discussing the states' interests, the Court noted that state courts \"would be swamped\" if search warrants were required for every search incident to arrest not involving exigent circumstances.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597986\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2160/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597986\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2160/\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 2180\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court also noted that two basic reasons for requiring a search warrant-having an independent neutral magistrate ensure the existence of probable cause and limiting the scope of the search upon a finding of probable cause-are diminished in the context of a DUI stop because: (1) a magistrate is in a poor position to challenge an officer's characterization of the indicia of impairment that are largely the same from one drunk driving stop to another; and (2) the scope of the warrant is simply administering the test.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597986\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2160/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597986\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2160/\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 2181\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 29.

Having concluded that the search-incident-to-arrest exception did not justify the taking of a warrantless blood sample, the Court then addressed whether implied consent laws established a consent exception to the need for a warrant. In addressing this question, the Court first recognized its approval in prior opinions \"of implied-consent laws that impose civil penalties and evidentiary consequences on motorists who refuse to comply.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597986\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2160/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597986\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2160/\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 2185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Since\n   <em>\n    Birchfield\n   </em>\n   issued, several state courts have acknowledged that strong suggestion in holding that the Fourth Amendment does not bar admission of evidence of refusal to submit to a warrantless blood draw.

As the Court suggested, however, the admission of evidence of a refusal to submit to a blood draw is a qualitatively different consequence with respect to its burden on the Fourth Amendment. Criminalizing refusal places far more pressure on defendants to submit to the blood test-thereby impermissibly burdening the constitutionally protected right not to submit to the test-than merely allowing evidence of the refusal at a criminal DUI trial, where a defendant can explain the basis for the refusal and the jury can consider the defendant's explanation for doing so. Moreover, the admission of refusal evidence in the context of a DUI proceeding, without directly burdening the privacy interest protected by the Fourth Amendment,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   furthers the reliability of the criminal process and its truth-seeking function by allowing the jurors to understand why the State is not submitting an evidentiary test in a DUI prosecution.

The implied consent statute establishes a bargain in which, in exchange for the privilege of engaging in the potentially dangerous activity of operating a motor vehicle on the highway, motorists impliedly consent to testing for impaired driving to protect the public.\n   <em>\n    State v.

In\n   <em>\n    Birchfield\n   </em>\n   , the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled, with respect to the more invasive blood test, that only criminalizing the revocation of implied consent crosses the line in terms of impermissibly burdening the Fourth Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b6 37. But allowing evidence of a refusal to submit to a blood test in the context of a DUI prosecution does not warrant the same constitutional protection. \"The speculative conclusion that a citizen will consent to a search that he or she would otherwise resist solely to avoid evidentiary implications at a possible future trial seems too attenuated to meet the [U.S. Supreme] Court's test in practice.\" Melilli,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 913. Indeed, as the Court in\n   <em>\n    Birchfield\n   </em>\n   pointed out, states began criminalizing refusals because the other civil and evidentiary consequences provided an insufficient incentive for motorists-most particularly repeat DUI offenders-to submit to testing. --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597986\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2160/\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 2169\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b6 38.

The only plausible understanding of the Legislature's intent in amending 12 V.S.A. \u00a7 1202(b) is that it intended to eliminate the statute's authorization of the use in a criminal proceeding of refusal evidence with respect to blood tests. The Legislature amended a section that previously authorized evidentiary use of refusals of\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   warrantless breath and blood tests so that it only authorized evidentiary use of refusals of warrantless\n   <em>\n    breath\n   </em>\n   tests. The majority's suggestion that the State could introduce evidence of blood test refusals before the statutory amendment, and could continue to do so afterwards, renders the 2017 amendment to \u00a7 1202(b) entirely meaningless. \"We presume that the Legislature intended to change the meaning of a statute when it amends it ....\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

In fact, understood as the majority construes it, the statute makes little sense: it will expressly authorize introduction of evidence of a refusal of a warrantless breath test, say nothing about the use as evidence of a refusal of a warrantless blood test, but nevertheless intend to allow evidentiary use of\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   . This was not a complex amendment that changed lots of statutory sections; other than the two amendments specifically dealing with the requirement of a warrant as a predicate to a blood test, the only other language change was the elimination of authorization to admit evidence of a refusal of a blood test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   \u00b6 43. The amendment was imperfect insofar as the Legislature failed to conform all of the relevant statutory language to its amendment to \u00a7 1202(b). See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"240867\" index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/174/172/#p178\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1202(d)(6) (authorizing introduction of evidence of a refusal to take an\n   <em>\n    evidentiary\n   </em>\n   test, as opposed to just breath test, as evidence at trial). But the Legislature's intent was clear, and to the extent that the new language is in tension with some of the pre-existing language, the Legislature's more recent enactment trumps. See\n   <em>\n    State v. Lynch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4710125\" index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/137/607/#p610\">\n    137 Vt. 607\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 610,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4710125\" index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/137/607/#p610\">\n    409 A.2d 1001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1004 (1979) (explaining that where \"there are two statutes upon the same subject that are in irreconcilable conflict, the statute which is the more recent legislative enactment will control, since it is the latest expression of the legislative will\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   \u00b6 44. The majority doesn't lean too heavily on the language of the statute, instead relying on its understanding of the Legislature's intent. The majority reasons, essentially: (1) the Legislature intended only to bring Vermont's implied consent statute into conformity with Birchfield ; (2) the majority has concluded that Birchfield does not preclude states from allowing the use of evidence of an individual's refusal to submit to a warrantless blood test; (3) therefore, the Legislature did not intend to amend Vermont's implied consent statute to preclude the use of evidence of an individual's\n   refusal to submit to a warrantless blood test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   \u00b6 45. But the legislative history candidly acknowledged by the majority knocks the legs out from under this line of reasoning. If statutory language is ambiguous, \"we also look at the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, and the legislative policy it was designed to implement\" in construing the statute.\n   <em>\n    Dep't of Corr. v. Human Rights Comm'n\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3587044\" index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/181/225/\">\n    2006 VT 134\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 22,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3587044\" index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/181/225/\">\n    181 Vt. 225\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3587044\" index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/181/225/\">\n    917 A.2d 451\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation omitted). There is little doubt that the Legislature's\n   <em>\n    goal\n   </em>\n   was to bring Vermont law into compliance with Birchfield. But, as the majority acknowledges, the language of the amendment was drafted with the understanding that Birchfield prohibits admission of evidence of a refusal of a warrantless blood test in a criminal proceeding. In walking through the draft that the Legislature ultimately enacted as Act No. 62, legislative counsel advised the House Judiciary Committee that in addition to its two main holdings, prohibiting a warrantless blood test and prohibiting criminal prosecution of a refusal of a warrantless blood test, Birchfield prohibits the introduction as evidence in a criminal proceeding of a person's refusal to submit to a warrantless blood test. Hearing on H.146 Before House Comm. on Transp., 2017-2018 Bien. Sess. (Vt. March 1, 2017), at 21:40. Counsel represented to the committee that the proposed amendments were designed to bring Vermont's statute into compliance with all\n   <em>\n    three\n   </em>\n   of these requirements, including the requirement relating to the use of refusal evidence.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 22:15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   \u00b6 46. The majority may now have concluded that this understanding of Birchfield was wrong, and that the case establishes no such requirement. But it's the Legislature's actual understanding of the constitutional constraints it sought to accommodate, not this Court's later determination of the constitutional question, that gives us insight into the Legislature's intended meaning. To say that, had the Legislature known how this Court would rule on the constitutional issue, it would not have changed the implied consent statute to preclude admission into evidence of an individual's refusal of a warrantless blood test is to substitute the majority's judgment about what the Legislature\n   <em>\n    would have done\n   </em>\n   if it had accurately anticipated the majority's ruling for an assessment of what it actually\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   given its own understanding. What the Legislature\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   is apparent from the language of Act No. 62, and is entirely consistent with the Legislature's apparent understanding of its constitutional responsibilities at the time it amended the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   \u00b6 47. The State does not dispute that insofar as the statute purported to amend a rule governing the admissibility of evidence, it regulates court practice and is thus applicable in proceedings subsequent to the statute's enactment, regardless of whether the statute was in effect at the time of the underlying act for which defendant was charged. See\n   <em>\n    Ulm v.

At best, from defendants' perspective, Birchfield was inconclusive on whether evidence of a refusal to take a blood test would be admissible in criminal DUI trials. The Legislature's decision to amend \u00a7 1202(b) so as not to either explicitly allow or disallow such refusal evidence may have been an attempt to immunize the statute against this uncertainty.
