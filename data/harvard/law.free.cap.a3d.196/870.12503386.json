Black, in this legal malpractice action predicated on the defendant's alleged failure to advise the plaintiff that his acceptance of a plea offer in a\n   criminal proceeding would preclude him from subsequently pursuing an action for malicious prosecution. In rendering summary judgment, the court concluded, as a matter of law, that the plaintiff could not prevail on such an action, as\n   probable cause existed to charge him with the crime of risk of injury to a child in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53-21. The plaintiff now challenges the propriety of that determination. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Mindful of the procedural posture of the case, we set forth the following facts as gleaned from the pleadings, affidavits and other proof submitted, viewed in a light most favorable to the plaintiff. See\n   <em>\n    Martinelli\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Fusi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4143430\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/290/347/#p350\">\n    290 Conn. 347\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 350,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=963%20A.2d%20640\">\n    963 A.2d 640\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009). On the morning of Saturday, June 23, 2012, officers from the Fairfield Police Department (department) responded to a 911 call from the plaintiff's then wife, Miriam Dubinsky,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   regarding an incident at their home in which the plaintiff shoved her onto a bed and repeatedly struck their minor son, Jake, with a belt in the presence of the plaintiff's minor stepdaughter, Abigail.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiff, at that time, was arrested and charged with one count of risk of injury to a child in violation of \u00a7 53-21, one count of assault in the third degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-61, and three counts of disorderly conduct in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-182.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Later that day, department officials filed a request for a probable cause determination with the Superior Court. Accompanying that request were copies of the police incident report, an arrest affidavit signed by Officer John Tyler, a family violence offense report, and a\n   written statement by Miriam regarding the incident. After reviewing those materials that evening, the court,\n   <em>\n    Bellis, J\n   </em>\n   ., concluded that probable cause existed and signed the request. The plaintiff was arraigned on Monday, June 25, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Following his arraignment, the plaintiff retained the services of the defendant, an attorney licensed to practice law in this state, who represented the plaintiff in connection with the aforementioned criminal charges. Plea negotiations with the state followed. The state ultimately made an offer, pursuant to which the plaintiff would enter a conditional plea of guilty to the charges of breach of peace and disorderly conduct. The plea offer further provided that, if the plaintiff complied with the terms of a protective order issued by the court and completed a family violence education program, all charges would be vacated and dismissed. The defendant encouraged the plaintiff to accept that conditional guilty plea offer and, on August 30, 2012, the plaintiff so pleaded before the court. The plaintiff thereafter complied with the terms of the plea agreement and all charges against him were dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On August 14, 2014, the plaintiff commenced the present legal malpractice action, claiming that the defendant failed to advise him that acceptance of the plea offer would preclude him from instituting a malicious prosecution action against the arresting officers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In his\n   answer, the\n   defendant denied the substance of that allegation. The defendant also raised the special defenses of accord and satisfaction, waiver, laches, and comparative negligence, all of which the plaintiff denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The defendant filed a motion for summary judgment on January 3, 2017, in which he argued that the plaintiff could not establish the causation element of his legal malpractice action. More specifically, the defendant claimed that no genuine issue of material fact existed as to whether the arresting officers possessed probable cause to institute the underlying criminal action. The defendant's motion was accompanied by seventeen exhibits, including copies of the police incident report and Miriam's signed statement to the police made on the date of the incident, transcripts from the underlying criminal proceedings, and deposition transcripts of various individuals. In opposing that motion for summary judgment, the plaintiff submitted only one exhibit-a copy of the January 28, 2013 decision, issued following an evidentiary hearing, of the administrative hearings\n   unit of the Department of Children and Families on the issue of the plaintiff's physical neglect of Jake.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The court rendered summary judgment in favor of the defendant on February 21, 2017. In its memorandum of decision, the court stated in relevant part that the plaintiff \"would not have prevailed in any action alleging ... malicious prosecution ... because he could not prove want of probable cause .... Therefore, [the plaintiff] would not have been able to prove that [the defendant's] failure to advise him of the consequences of the plea agreement caused him harm when he lost his right to recover in a civil litigation for ... malicious prosecution.\" (Citations omitted.) From that judgment, the plaintiff now appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   As a preliminary matter, we note the well established standard that governs\n   our review of the trial court's decision to grant summary judgment. \" Practice Book \u00a7 17-49 provides that summary judgment shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, affidavits and any other proof submitted show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. In deciding a motion for summary judgment, the trial court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.... [T]he moving party ... has the burden of showing the absence of any genuine issue as to all the material facts.... When documents submitted in\n   support of a motion for summary judgment fail to establish that there is no genuine issue of material fact, the nonmoving party has no obligation to submit documents establishing the existence of such an issue.... Once the moving party has met its burden, however, the [nonmoving] party must present evidence that demonstrates the existence of some disputed factual issue.... Our review of the trial court's decision to grant the defendant's motion for summary judgment is plenary.\" (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Lucenti\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Laviero\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12491913\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/176/1/#p772\">\n    327 Conn. 764\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 772-73,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12491913\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/176/1/#p772\">\n    176 A.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The present action is one sounding in legal malpractice. As our Supreme Court has explained, \"[i]n legal malpractice actions, the plaintiff typically proves that the defendant attorney's professional negligence caused injury to the plaintiff by presenting evidence of what would have happened in the underlying action had the defendant not been negligent.

Accordingly, the plaintiff in the present case bore the burden of establishing not only negligence on the part of the defendant in apprising him of the consequences of his guilty plea in the underlying criminal proceeding, but also that he would have prevailed in his malicious prosecution claim against the arresting officers. We therefore focus our attention on that cause of action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \"Malicious prosecution is a tort arising out of a criminal complaint that is intended to protect an individual's interest in freedom from unjustifiable and unreasonable litigation ....\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Lefebvre\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Zarka\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4050400\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/106/30/#p35\">\n    106 Conn.

In the context of the motion for summary judgment filed by the defendant in the present case, the critical question is whether the plaintiff can demonstrate that the officers had no objectively reasonable basis to believe that an offense has been committed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The documentation submitted in connection with that motion convinces us that no genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether the arresting officers possessed an objectively reasonable basis to believe that the plaintiff's conduct on June 23, 2012, placed both Jake and Abigail in a situation that was likely to be psychologically injurious to them. Abigail watched as\n   the plaintiff wound up his arm and then struck Jake with the belt several times, which reduced her to tears and left her shaking and visibly upset when officers arrived at the residence soon thereafter. Abigail, at that time, described the incident as \"very disturbing\" and informed officers that she was fearful that the plaintiff would hit her in the future. Seven year old Jake not only bore the brunt of the plaintiff's blows with the belt, but also watched the plaintiff shove his mother to the bed when she attempted to intervene on his behalf. When the officers spoke with Jake and asked if he was okay, the boy began to cry and then confessed that his \"butt really hurts,\" so much so that it pained him to be seated. In her written statement, Miriam informed the officers that Jake was screaming as the plaintiff struck him and that the plaintiff's behavior had frightened Abigail. Miriam also indicated in that statement that she \"will not have my children subject to or witness to violence.\" Furthermore, the officers in the present case were summoned to the residence by a 911 call that included a report of domestic violence,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the plaintiff thereafter responded to the officer's questions in a defiant manner, insisting that they could not \"tell [him] how to discipline [his] son\" and imploring them to \"[p]ut this on the record ... I will use the belt again and I will spank my son again.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Viewing the record before us in a light most favorable to the plaintiff, we conclude that the plaintiff has not demonstrated the existence of a genuine issue of material fact as to whether, on the totality of the circumstances and the facts known to them at the time, the arresting officers lacked an objectively reasonable basis to believe that he had violated the situational prong of \u00a7 53-21 (a). The plaintiff, therefore, cannot establish the\n   probable cause element of an action for malicious prosecution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The plaintiff nonetheless argues that the arresting officers lacked probable cause in light of the protection afforded parents under General Statutes \u00a7 53a-18 (1).

In his appellate brief, the plaintiff reiterated that he had informed the defendant \"of his desire to sue the arresting officers and [Miriam] for malicious prosecution.\" At oral argument before this court, the plaintiff's counsel abandoned any such claim with respect to Miriam, conceding that it was not a \"viable lawsuit\" and stating that the plaintiff was not pursuing a claim against Miriam. The present appeal, therefore, concerns the viability of a malicious prosecution action against the arresting officers.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    Although it reversed an earlier substantiation of physical neglect, that administrative decision also noted that the June 23, 2012 incident \"was no doubt an ugly scene, and one which likely will have a lasting impact on the family.\" It also noted that, when the police arrived at the residence that day, the plaintiff \"became flippant and belligerent with the responding officers. His behavior appeared erratic at that time.\" The plaintiff's belligerent behavior toward law enforcement responding to a 911 call also is documented in the police incident report, which provides necessary context for the probable cause determination made by the arresting officers.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    During his deposition testimony, Officer Tyler indicated that the risk of injury charge was premised on the \"dangerous situation\" created by the plaintiff's conduct.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    The police incident report states in relevant part that Miriam \"called 911 to report that her husband ... is beating [their] seven year old son ... with a belt.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    The police incident report states in relevant part that Miriam and Sergeant Edward Weihe \"inspected Jake's buttocks and they were cherry red, with welts....\" In his deposition, the plaintiff testified: \"I don't believe there [were] any marks [on Jake's body]. I don't see how there could have been.... [T]here wasn't any marks ... the police lied, lied, and ... there were no marks on Jake, on Jake's butt.\" In his appellate brief, the plaintiff alleges that the arresting officers \"lied about the alleged 'red welts' \" in the police incident report.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    In her deposition testimony, which was submitted in support of the defendant's motion for summary judgment, Miriam stated that she inspected Jake's buttocks soon after the incident and observed red marks on his buttocks. Miriam further testified that she observed \"black and blue marks\" on her son's body a day or two after the incident transpired. In response, she took him to department headquarters, where an officer took photographs of his body. Three photographs depicting bruising on Jake's buttocks were submitted to the court in support of the defendant's motion for summary judgment, and are contained in the record before us.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
