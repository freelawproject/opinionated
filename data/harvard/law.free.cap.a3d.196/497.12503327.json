As the Chevrolet approached a red light and came to a stop, Detective Jones pulled up behind it and, using an onboard electronic database, ran a \"random tag check.\" In doing so, he noticed that its owner, David Fitzgerald, had a suspended driver's license. After pulling alongside the Chevrolet and confirming that Fitzgerald was,\n   in fact, driving, Detective Jones initiated a traffic stop, notifying his dispatcher as he did so. There was one other occupant of that vehicle-Mills, who was sitting in the front passenger seat.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Detective Jones approached the Chevrolet and \"made contact with\" Fitzgerald. While he was speaking with Fitzgerald, Officers Derek Bowman and Jacob Reed, having heard about the traffic stop from the dispatcher, arrived at the scene, having driven separately in marked police vehicles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   As a precaution, Officer Reed parked directly in front of Fitzgerald's Chevrolet to prevent it from moving, while Officer Bowman pulled in behind Detective Jones's vehicle. Officer Reed then approached the passenger side of Fitzgerald's car and began speaking with Mills, asking him \"where they were both coming from and where they were going,\" but Mills sat\n   silently, ignoring the officer's questions and avoiding eye contact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Meanwhile, an \"intoxicated male\" bystander \"started walking up to\" Fitzgerald's vehicle and \"yelling something like he knew the individual in the car.\" Officer Bowman \"told him several times\" that he needed to \"stand to the side.\" Eventually he heeded that advice and left the scene.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Officer Reed, who had been questioning Mills, then asked him to step out of the vehicle and \"stand towards the back,\" where Officer Bowman was then located. After Mills complied with that request, Officer Reed \"knelt over and looked under the [front passenger] seat.\" When he did so, he saw a Glock 9 mm semiautomatic handgun \"under the seat.\" The officer \"backed away from\" the car and several times said \"1030,\" a code indicating that he intended to arrest Mills. Neither Officer Bowman nor Detective Jones heard that warning, however. Then, looking at Detective Jones, Officer Reed said, \"Gun.\" Upon hearing the latter exclamation, Mills \"took off running northbound on Highland Avenue.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Detective Jones and Officer Bowman gave chase, while Officer Reed remained with Fitzgerald's car. The pursuing police officers were joined in the chase by Sergeant Frederick Steigerwald, who was stationed nearby and who had heard about the foot chase over the police radio. Sergeant Steigerwald ultimately found Mills hiding underneath a parked truck, four blocks from the scene of the traffic stop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   A search incident to Mills's arrest yielded a \"bundle\" of cash in his right front pocket, totaling $1,676, as well as two cell phones. When Fitzgerald's car was searched, Officer Reed recovered, in an open storage compartment in the passenger side door, \"a clear plastic bag\" containing what was later confirmed to be crack cocaine, lying next to a pair of socks, as well as the aforementioned handgun.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   A thirteen-count indictment was returned, charging Mills with possession of, and conspiracy to possess, a firearm under sufficient circumstances to constitute a nexus to drug trafficking; three counts of possession of a regulated firearm after\n   conviction of a disqualifying crime; wearing, carrying, and transporting a handgun in a vehicle, and conspiracy to do the same; wearing, carrying, and transporting a handgun on and about the person; possession of ammunition after conviction of a disqualifying crime; possession of, and conspiracy to possess, cocaine with intent to distribute; and possession of, and conspiracy to possess, cocaine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The case proceeded to a jury trial, which began with a\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   challenge that will be discussed more fully. Following various dismissals and grants of motions for judgment of acquittal, five charges were presented to the jury: possession of cocaine\n   with intent to distribute; possession of cocaine; possession of a firearm under sufficient circumstances to constitute a nexus to drug trafficking; possession of a regulated firearm after conviction of a disqualifying crime; and possession of ammunition after conviction of a disqualifying crime. The jury convicted Mills of both drug offenses and acquitted him of all firearms-related offenses. The court sentenced Mills to a term of twelve years' imprisonment, with all but four years suspended, to be followed by three years' probation, for possession of cocaine with intent to distribute and merged the simple possession count. Mills thereafter noted this timely appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Mills's\n     <em>\n      Batson\n     </em>\n     Challenge\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Mills contends that the trial court erred in concluding that he did not establish a prima facie case, under\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   that the State had exercised its peremptory challenges in a racially discriminatory manner.

I don't --\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   THE COURT: Okay. But I don't know what his -- his race is?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]:\n   <strong>\n    I understand. I'm just telling you why.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   THE COURT:\n   <strong>\n    But I have to make the analysis. You're -- I'm not calling upon you to make the analysis.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I understand.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   THE COURT: All right.\n   <strong>\n    So the record is complete, I was the initial scan indicated that the males constituted 37 percent, which means we ought to have about 4.5 men in the jury, and that the whites accounted for 27 percent, which means that we should have about 3.3 whites on the jury if they just -- the normal shuffle just filled up the jury box.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   So under those circumstances, considering the fact that at this moment, we have one, two, three, -- three white women and one, two men in the jury box,\n   <strong>\n    I don't believe that the statistical scan establishes a prima facie case, so the motion is denied.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Notably, the court did not appear to consider the question of discriminatory intent at the level of the individual venirepersons stricken, but instead, as shown by a statistical model that compared the racial and gender composition of the empaneled jury with that of the venire. In any event, after the court denied the State's\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   challenge on that basis, jury selection resumed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Shortly thereafter, the parties commenced making additional strikes from the box. The State struck Juror 2132, a married, 61-year-old African-American female whose highest attained education level was indicated, \"HS OR GED - NA\" and whose occupation (as well as that of her spouse) was likewise indicated, \"NA.\" In total (including Juror 2132), the State had made four peremptory strikes against African-American venirepersons. The others stricken by the State\n   included Juror 2119, a single, 64-year-old male with a high school education; Juror 2155, a single, 60-year-old female with a high school education; and Juror 2164, a single, 39-year-old female with a high school education.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   At that point, the defense raised its own\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   challenge. In response, the State acknowledged, \"I'll concede based on the pattern.\" The following colloquy then took place:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   THE COURT: Okay. But the pattern is still consistent. And --\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]:\n   <strong>\n    The pattern of strikes is all African/Americans.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   THE COURT:\n   <strong>\n    But the strikes left us with one, two, three, four whites, though I was expecting 3.3. And as far as males, one, two, three, four, five, when I was expecting 4.5.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    Nothing the State has done has changed the -- the basic appearance of the way the jury would have looked had we just thrushed the crowd and said \"Everyone run up and take a seat.\" So I'm going to deny the motion, as a prima facie case has not been established yet.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Judge, can I just briefly be heard, that I --\n   <strong>\n    I don't think that necessarily the panel jury is the standard. It's whether the State is striking individual jurors because of their race.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   THE COURT: No. You see, if -- if 75 percent of the people who came in were black females, I would expect that 75 percent of the people who were stricken would be black females. That's why\n   <strong>\n    I do a statistical analysis on how I'm expecting the jury to look and see whether or not actions taken by the parties is taking that out of balance.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    That I believe is part of what I'm required to do for the initial prima facie showing. It's not just a question of how many strikes you used against a particular group.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   No matter how that would seem, it depends on how things are. Because, let's face it, most of the people who came into the room when we called for and ended up getting 57 people, most of the people were black females.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   (Emphasis added.) With that, the court denied Mills's\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   challenge.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The circuit court clearly erred in applying its statistical test for determining whether Mills had set out a prima facie case of racial discrimination by the State in its exercise of peremptory strikes.

Mills had been\n   seated in the front passenger seat-the seat that was closest to the passenger-side door. Moreover, although the jury acquitted him of the handgun charges, we note that the handgun was recovered from beneath the passenger-side front seat, in which Mills had been sitting. Thus, there certainly was proximity between Mills and the contraband.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   We next consider whether the cocaine was in Mills's view or otherwise within his knowledge. Mills asserts that the contraband was not only out of his view, but it was also unclear whether it had been stored with items (the socks) that did not belong to him, which, in his view, further dilutes the inference that the contraband belonged to him. He ignores, however, that a photograph depicting the bag of cocaine in the door compartment was admitted into evidence and indicates that the bag was visible and, specifically, not concealed by the pair of socks. Construing this exhibit in a light most favorable to the State, as we must, we hold that, contrary to Mills's assertion, a reasonable jury could have concluded that the cocaine was visible to the passenger of the car.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Moreover, under Mills's hypothesis, it would necessarily be true that Fitzgerald, the driver of the vehicle, possessed the contraband. We think it unlikely that Fitzgerald would have stored contraband in the passenger-side door when other alternatives, such as the compartment in the driver-side door or even the trunk, were available to him, unless, at minimum, he and Mills jointly possessed the contraband. Whether to draw this or the opposite inference, as Mills would have us do, was properly within the province of the jury.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    State v.

We accord that\n   factor, however, only slight significance, as otherwise we would be forced to conclude that a passenger in a vehicle does not typically possess items found in close proximity to him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   As for the fourth factor, the presence of circumstances from which a reasonable inference could be drawn that Mills was participating in the mutual use of the contraband, we note that, upon hearing a police officer call out, \"Gun,\" Mills fled the scene and was discovered, shortly thereafter and four blocks away, hiding beneath a truck.

Because, he asserts, the evidence against him was \"quite weak,\" that improper comment cannot be deemed to have had no effect on the verdict, and he therefore claims that reversal is required.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The State counters that this claim is unpreserved because Mills objected only to entirely different prosecutorial comments regarding the handgun and the purported location a \"hack\" would store narcotics. But, maintains the State, even on the merits of this claim, the prosecutor's comment was within the scope of permissible argument, as it was based upon the jury's observation of the defendant and the reasonable inferences it could draw from that observation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   We begin by setting forth some factual background. During the State's closing argument, the following took place:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   THE STATE: We know that the defendant was prohibited from possessing this [the handgun] due to a prior conviction.

But we would imagine the seats would be about even.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   <strong>\n    Now, if I'm the driver, it's awfully hard for me to get this gun over and under that seat.

No. That's not a good way to store your drugs.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   And if I am storing my drugs in my vehicle for any long-term trip, why am I going to put it there? Why don't I put it in the trunk of my car, the police are probably not going to be able to search if I get pulled over.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]:\n   <strong>\n    Objection, Your Honor.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   THE COURT: Overruled.

The State counters that Mills's objections were made to entirely different comments-the prosecutor's suggestion to the jury to \"imagine the gun\" and the prosecutor's comments regarding the optimal method a vehicle occupant would use to store contraband.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   In our view, the State has the stronger argument. Although it is true, as Mills points out, that \"when the trial court does not request a statement of the grounds for an objection, a general objection is sufficient to preserve all grounds which may exist,\"\n   <em>\n    Ali v.
