Certainly, an inmate's potential use of Timberland or Rocky boots as a deadly weapon against Department staff is a rational safety reason for the Department's Regional Deputy Secretaries and their supervising Executive Deputy Secretary for Institutional Operations to change the Department's boot-style policy without specifying to the inmates the reason therefor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   O'Toole asserts that his property right in his Timberland boots stems from the fact that the boots \"were chosen by the [Department, were] the only boots available for purchase, and [were] sold ... by the [Department] at a profit[.]\" Petition \u00b6 9.

No. 272 M.D. 2018). On May 3, 2018, this Court granted the Department's application to stay the above-captioned proceedings pending the outcome of this case. On May 22, 2018, O'Toole objected to the Court's stay order, claiming that he cannot adequately represent other inmates' interest, and \"by taking this action[,] the Court has put a 'BULLS EYE' on [his] back.\" O'Toole Obj. to Stay of Proceedings in Similar Litigation at 1.
