Trust Company .was duly placed in charge of the Finance,Commissioner of the State of Missouri, under the laws of said State.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-7\">' \u201cOn October'21, 1931, City Lake'Coal Company, desiring to purchase a money transfer order from the claimant, The Western Union Telegraph Company, paid to and deposited with Fidelity Bank and Trust Company the sum of $200, with'which to pay for said money transfer order, \"aii'd thereupon Fidelity Bank and Trust Company, by its treasurer, duly issued and delivered-to The Western Union Telegraph'- Company its treasurer\u2019s check No. 23169, dated October 21, 1931, iff said sum, payable to The We\u00e1tern Union Telegraph Company.

No. part of said several sums has been paid by said bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-3\">\u201cPrior to the issuance of said money transfer orders The Western Union Telegraph Company had refused to credit the\u2019 said City Lake\u2019 Coal Company and Joseph Greenspon\u2019s Sons Iron &amp; Steel Company,; and required that said money transfer orders be paid for in cash. -Saidi several sums were deposited with the Fidelity Bank and Trust Company by said City Lake Coal Company and Joseph Greenspon\u2019s Sons? Iron &amp; Steel Company for the purpose of paying for said several, money transfer orders, and said several treasurer\u2019s checks were1 issued by said Fidelity Bank and Trust Company for the purpose of-transferring said sums to The Western Union Telegraph Company. The Western Union Telegraph Company paid its said money transfer orders issued for said respective sums before said treasurer\u2019s checks were returned to it by the First National Bank in St. Louis, and be-i fore it learned of the closing of said Fidelity Bank and Trust Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-4\">\u201cThis claim is admitted as a general claim and same is submitted to the Court to determine the question of priority. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b923-5\">The trial resulted in a judgment for claimant, allowing its claim in the sum of $1855.14 as a preferred claim. Defendant appeals.' \u2022\u20225</p>\n<p id=\"b923-6\">Usually a statement of facts is agreed upon for the purpose of set-' ting at rest all dispute as to the facts. Yet the chief contention here1 arises out of different interpretations of the language used in stating the facts. But when the statement is read as a whole, the conclusion is inevitable that the transaction involved amounted to nothing more nor less than the purchase of treasurer\u2019s checks by the payment of the cash therefor over the counter of the bank. In such5 case no preference is allowed. [McClure Garage v. Sturdivant Bank (Mo. App.), 76 S. W. (2d) 438; Hoffman v. Sturdivant Bank (Mo. App.), 76 S. W. (2d) 441; Bank of Republic v. Republic State Bank (Mo.), 42 S. W. (2d) 27; Smalley v. Queen City Bank (Mo. App.), 94 S. W. (2d) 954; Cormandy v. Wells-Hine Trust Co. (Mo. App.), 44 S. W.

Annot. 66.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-7\">Respondent urges in argument that the agreed statement expressly recites that respondent refused to credit the Coal Company and the1 Greenspon Company and required that the money orders should- be' \u201cpaid for in cash,\u201d that the several sums were paid to the bank by the Coal Company and the Greenspon Company \u201cfor the purpose ofr purchasing and paying for\u201d the money orders, that said sums were5 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>paid to the bank \u201cfor the use and benefit of\u201d the respondent, and that the treasurer\u2019s cheeks were issued by the bank \u201cfor the pur&lt;pose of transferring said sums\u201d to the respondent. It is true that the agreed statement so recites. But over against this phraseology is the fact that the Coal Company and the Greenspon Company, instead of paying the money to the respondent, paid it to the bank for the respondent, and the respondent thereupon elected to take treasurer\u2019s checks therefor instead of the money which it could have had for the asking. The transaction is no different than if the Coal \u2022Company and the Greenspon Company had paid the money directly to respondent, and respondent had itself paid it over to the bank and taken treasurer\u2019s checks therefor.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-5\">Respondent cites and seems to rely on section 5575, Revised Statutes 1929, (Mo. St. Ann., sec. 5575, p. 7715). That section covers two classes of transactions, one where items are presented to the drawee or payor bank for payment, and the other where items are entrusted to an agent collecting bank for collection. The transaction involved here is obviously not within either class.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-6\">It follows that the respondent is not entitled to a preference.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-7\">The case of Stoller v. Coates, 88 Mo. 514, relied on by respondent, is so clearly distinguishable on its facts from the case at bar that a discussion of it could serve no useful purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-8\">The Commissioner recommends that the judgment of the circuit court be reversed and that the cause be remanded to said court with directions to enter judgment in accordance with the views herein expressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-9\">PER CURIAM:\u2014The foregoing opinion of Sutton, C., is adopted as the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-10\">\u25a0 The judgment of the circuit court is accordingly reversed and the cause remanded to that court with directions as recommended by the Commissioner.</p>\n<judges id=\"AEv\"><em>Hosietter, P. J., </em>and <em>Becker </em>and <em>McGullen, JJ., </em>concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b924-11\">On Motion for a Rehearing.</p>\n<author id=\"b924-12\">SUTTON, C.</author>\n<p id=\"ABF7\">Respondent, on motion for a rehearing, insists that the statement in the agreed statement of facts that the treasurer\u2019s checks were issued by the bank \u2018! for the purpose of transferring said sums\u201d paid over to the bank by the Coal Company and the Greenspon Company, shows that our conclusion that respondent is not entitled to a preference is wrong. We are not persuaded, however, that this is so. The expression quoted and relied on must be construed in the light of the facts stated. Respondent says that the money paid over to the bank became, a trust fund and that it remained a trust <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>fund notwithstanding the respondent purchased treasurer\u2019s checks with it. It is true that the money was turned over to the bank for respondent, and the respondent had a right to use the money as if saw fit. It could take the money if it wished, or it could take therefor treasurer\u2019s checks, as it did. If respondent itself had paid the money over to the bank and taken treasurer\u2019s checks therefor, no one would contend that a right to a preference would have arisen. What is the difference whether the money was paid over to the bank by the respondent itself or was paid over to the bank for respondent by others ? The money was put in the bank for the respondent. It had a right to have the money delivered to if it so desired, or it could use the money to purchase treasurer\u2019s checks. It elected to take treasurer\u2019s checks instead of the money. Respondent\u2019s anomalous insistence is that it took treasurer\u2019s checks for the purpose of transferring to itself the money that was in the bank ready to be transferred to it over the bank counter. This is not a case in which the respondent paid its money into the bank and directed the bank to transfer it to a third party, or to use it for a designated purpose. This is just what the Coal Company and the Greenspon Company did, but after the money was paid over to the bank for respondent- it applied the money to the purchase of treasurer\u2019s checks, when it could have had the money direct from the bank instead of the treasurer\u2019s checks. It is obvious that respondent elected to take credit, evidenced by the treasurer\u2019s checks, in lieu of the money, said treasurer\u2019s checks to be paid in due course as treasurer\u2019s checks are ordinarily paid, and so in such sense to transfer \u201csaid sums\u201d to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-4\">Some of the suggestions made by respondent\u2019s learned counsel with respect to what the agreed statement of facts does not show indicates that counsel have overlooked the rule now firmly established that the burden is on him who seeks a preference against the assets of an insolvent bank to show that he is entitled to such preference and not on the finance commissioner to show the contrary. This means \"that the party seeking a preference must show facts entitling him to the preference, and not on the finance commissioner to show facts that would defeat the preference.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-5\">The Commissioner recommends that respondent\u2019s motion for a rehearing be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-6\">PER CURIAM:\u2014The foregoing opinion of Sutton, C., is adopted as the opinion of the court. Respondent\u2019s motion for a rehearing is accordingly overruled.</p>\n<judges id=\"AWSZ\"><em>Hostetter, P.
