T. Carlton filed their claim for compensation in-the amount of $6,000 for the death of the said W. T. Carlton and $500 for funeral expenses,' alleging that deceased \u201cwas employed as a pumper, repairman, watchman and caretaker of pump station and'premises at Gray\u2019s Point,' and in entering said station to investigate a burglary he was shot and killed by a burglar who had broken in the building. \u2019\u2019\u2019 Employer filed its answer, and it was admitted on a hearing before one of the referees of the commission,. Mar eh 30, 1-936, that the only issues in the case are \u2018 \u2018 whether or not the employment of the deceased employee \u2022 comes under the compensation law of the State of Missouri, and, second, whether or not the death of the employee was a result of an accident arising out of. and in the course of his employment.\u201d' The referee entered an award,. answered the first question in the affirmative, the latter in the negative, and denied compensation. Following the entry of the referee\u2019s award, an application for review by the full commission was <em>filed; </em>and on August 8, 1936, an award was entered affirming that of the referee. The claimants appealed to the circuit court where, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>on November 25, 1936, the court-entered -its judgment reversing the award and remanding the cause to the commission \u201cwith -directions to make a finding of the amount of compensation due plaintiff under the undisputed facts and the law.of the case.\u201d The appeal of the employer to .this court has followed in the usual course.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">The record discloses the following stipulation: -</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">\u201cIt is hereby,stipulated and agreed by and between the parties in this case that W. T. Carlton was in the employ of the. St. Louis Southwestern Railway Company on May 8, 1935, and had been for a period of more than one year prior thereto; that the employee\u2019s salary was $125 per, month and had been for the year prior to May 8, 1935; that the St. Louis Southwestern Railway Company-was a major employer andso far as any liability of said company under the compensation law, they were-authorized self insurers; that-the: employer had notice of the accident and that claim for compensation was filed within time prescribed by law, having been received by the commission on November 4, 1935; that on or about 9 p. m. of said May 8, 1935, said employee was shot by highwaymen while in the pump house of said St. Louis Southwestern Railway Company in Scott county, Missouri, said pump house being immediately adjoining and a part of the same building occupied by employee as his living quarters; that the highwayman had secured entrance to the pump house by breaking and entering a window on the west side of the pump station; that these highwaymen were in the living room of his house at the time the shots were fired, the employee being in the pump house. It is further stipulated and agreed that the deceased died at 10 p. m. the same night as a result of said wounding, and that he left surviving him his widow, Flora-Carlton, aged 29, and his daughter,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Juanita Carlton, aged 19, both totally dependent upon the employee.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">It is further shown by the evidence that the pump station at which Mr. Carlton was killed is located on the Mississippi river about- four miles from Ulmo-Fornfelt terminal -of the St. Louis Southwestern Railway Company in an isolated, and sparsely populated section. \"Water is pumped from .the Mississippi river into a settling basin- at Gray\u2019s Point, and then into a large water tower at the roundhouse at Fornfelt, and is used by trains and by shops, offices, and factories in Illmo and Fornfelt. There are two pumps, one in the building used as living quarters, for W.-T. Carlton and--claimants which is electrified, the other located about a quarter of a mile up the river which is run by both electricity and steam.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">Mr. Carlton was paid $125 per month, and his living quarters, fuel and lights were furnished by the -employer.. Mrs. Carlton testified that sometimes Mr. Carlton was required to -be on duty almost twenty-four hours a day. \u201cOf course, he. didn\u2019t work all the time like that, but if he had trouble on anything he had to work/that way.\u201d He-was employed as a .pumper-repairman, and -on occasions, sometimes at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>night, he would repair the pump, replace\u2019 fuses, and at all times, do such repair work as was incident to such a plant. On some occasions 'Mr. Carlton would start the pump at five o\u2019clock in the evening and shut it off at two in the morning. He looked after the premises, mowed the lawn, cut the weeds, cleaned the- three settling basins, and looked after the premises and property generally. \u25a0 He had no set time to start and stop'the pumps, that being determined largely by the amount of water used. He was never away from the station more than three or four hours at a time.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">Mrs. Carlton testified that Mr. Carlton was required to live in the living quarters adjoining the pump station in which he was killled. We quote from the record: \u201cQ. You say Mr. Carlton was required to live there; do you know that as a fact? A. Yes, sir. Q. On what do you base your knowledge? A. Well, they built the home for us and required him to'move up there. Q. Couldn\u2019t live in town if he wanted to? A. No, he couldn\u2019t.\u201d Mrs. Carlton further testified that ho- watchman- was furnished Mr. Carlton to look after the premises. Mr. Carlton did that. \u201cThe other station up the river was broken into by pilferers breaking down the door. Mr. Carlton ran them away. On the date that Mr. Carlton was killed he had put up new -screens, painted the screen wire and casings in the pumping station, and had cl\u00e9aned the motors. At 6:15 on the evening he was killed he went to Cape Girardeau to get a little fresh air, as the painting -had made Mr. Carlton ill. He -returned to the pumping station at nin\u00e9 o \u2019clock in order to turn on the pumps.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">When the Carltons returned, there was a light in the portion of the building they occupied as their home. They put the car in the garage and Mr. Carlton entered the pump house as'was his custom. The light was burning in- the pump house when he left, and :it was on when he returned. The light went off in the living quarters, and immediately after Mr\u00a1 Carlton entered the pump room, Mrs. Carlton heard a shot. The shot was fired from the -living quarters and Mr. Carlton was- found mortally wounded in the pump room. Mrs. Carlton also testified that although Mr. Carlton was not required to carry a gun,- he carried one, and had it with him when he went in- the pump house that night. ...</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">From re-cross examination of Mrs. Carlton'we quote: \u201cQ. Now, was Mr. Carlton going\u2019backto that pump house that night to do any repair work:? A. He was just going back to start the pump.\u2019'\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">After Mr. Carlton was shot the highwaymen asked Mrs. Carlton for money. It was admitted that she had'about $425. \u201cQ. And they asked for that money? A. They asked for some money.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b224-9\">The testimony of Juanita Carlton was, in substance, the same as that of Mrs. Carlton. She testified that the pumps required almost constant attention; that Mr: Carlton was frequently called during the night to shut.down-the motors when the water-tower would run <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>over; that he did repair work as required, both day'and night, such as replacing bearings and fuses; and if anything went wrong and the power was shut off he would receive a call from Illmo notifying him to start the motors.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">William Proffer, manager of the Missouri Utility Company, stated that he serviced the station at Gray\u2019s Point in May, 1935, and prior .thereto; that he had been called frequently by Mr. Carlton to come out to the pumping station at night in order to help him fix the pumps; that he had seen Mr. Carlton take care of the motors in the pumping station at night and had often seen him working about the machinery after midnight.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">James Wagner testified that he lived in Illmo; that he had been frequently at the Gray\u2019s Point pumping station; that he had seen Mr. Carlton making repairs on the machinery in the pumping house at night and that it was not possible to operate the pump from seven until five in the day and then shut it off without further attention.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">Luther E. Morse, present pumper at the Gray\u2019s Point station, testified, in part, that he did not know whether the conditions in the pumping station were the same when he took charge as they were when Mr. Carlton operated it, as he did not take charge immediately. We quote from the record:</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">\u201cQ. Can that pump, Mr. Morse, be operated steadily over, say, a period of from 7 until 4 and be shut off, and given no further attention, and perform the duties that it is supposed to perform under service? A. Well, which pump are you talking about?</p>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">\u201cQ. The whole plant out there. A. .No, it couldn\u2019t.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-10\">\u201cQ. It couldn\u2019t? In other words, does it require attention to operate it at nighttime as well as in' the daytime, with one man ? A. Well, it doesn\u2019t require any attention after it is put on. ...</p>\n<p id=\"b225-11\">\u201cQ. How long will it run? A. It runs different; depends on the amount of water you have to pump.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-12\">\u2018 \u2018 Q. Do your duties require you to work at night to properly operate the pump ? A. No, not necessarily. ,</p>\n<p id=\"b225-13\">\u201cQ. Well, in the operation of\" the pump\u2014do you work at night up there ? A. No, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-14\">\u201cQ. Do you turn it off at any time? A. Well, not since'I have been there I haven\u2019t turned it off any time during the night; it is always 7 o\u2019clock. ...</p>\n<p id=\"b225-15\">\u201cQ. Then you mean that you could perform the duties of operating that pump station out there by Working from 7 o\u2019clock until 4 and quitting, and that is all you would have to do; wouldn\u2019t have to give it any attention during the night to properly operate it? A. No.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-16\">\u201cQ. You wouldn\u2019t have to give it any attention? ' A. You couldn\u2019t do that. ...</p>\n<p id=\"b225-17\">\u201c Q. Suppose the water tower was filled by the pumping around' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>midnight, what would, you be required to do ? A.

Do you occupy the same quarters occupied by Mr. Carlton at the time of his death? A. Tes, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">He also stated that a watchman was furnished when one was needed, and that one was needed only in cold weather to keep the plant from freezing; that he himself was not employed as a watchman but .that his official capacity was pumper. We quote from his testimony again..</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">\u201cQ. Do you work under .any agreement, with reference to the union? A.. Tgs, sir. .... ... :.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">\u201cQ- What, is that agreement; do you. work\u2014what hours do you work under that, agreement? <em>.A. </em>There are no specified hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-9\">\u201cQ.

Tes, sir. . ..=</p>\n<p id=\"b226-11\">\u201cQ. It isn\u2019t part,of your compensation? A. No, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-12\">' \u201cQ.. If you lived in town you would still get the same rate of pay, wouldn\u2019t you? A. Tes; sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-13\">\u2018 \u2018 Q. Could you operate that station living in town if you wanted to? A. No, sir, I.don\u2019t belie.ye I could. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b226-14\">\u201cQ. \u2022 Why not.? A. Well, the tower would run over and the pump stop; I would have to be there to take care of it. .</p>\n<p id=\"b226-15\">\u201cQ. Can\u2019t you regulate those pumps so.that,you can either turn them on or shut them off at 7 o\u2019clock and not touch them until 7 o\u2019clock the next morning? A. No, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-16\">\u201cQ. Tou can\u2019t do that? A. No, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-17\">\u2018 \u2018 Q. Over what period of the day are you supposed to work ? A. Well, there is no specific time; I work to suit myself.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-18\">\u201cQ. \u25a0 Is it a twenty-four-hour job; in other words, you are supposed to be there all the time? A.

I hope that in the future you will consider these matters and. continue to handle the plant in a manner that-is satisfactory to all, and in case you do not desire to continue on this job at the present rate for all services rendered, I will arrange for another man.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">Claimants\u2019 exhibit No. 3 is another letter from Mr. Livingston addressed to Messrs. W. T. Carlton and C. D. Bedwell, parts of which follow: \u201cEffective March 16 Mr. W. T.

Yes, sir; he could regulate that pump that pumps to Fornfelt; you could regulate that by the discharge valve on the discharge side of the -pump so it would pump 100, .200, 250 gallons a minute.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">\u201cQ. Is that practical? A. Yes, sir; if you want to run it over a longer period of time you can open it wide and it will pump 250 gallons a minute; and close the discharge valve and decrease the discharge as low as 100 gallons a minute.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">\u2018 \u2018 Q.

Jackoway-Katz Cap Co. et al., 82 S. W. (2d) 909.]</p>\n<p id=\"AGM\">Since the subdivisions of the assignment of errors are so closely related they will be considered together. It is contended by employer that Mr. Carlton was not employed as a watchman or caretaker. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>is true he was not so employed, but under all the evidence and undisputed facts, in addition to his work as pumper and repairman, he did the work peculiar to that of a watchman or caretaker with full knowledge of the employer. For a number of years three men worked on the job, Mr. Carlton being head pumper, the others working under him; and after the pumps weye in part electrified Mr. Carlton and Mr. Bedwell rendered this service, Mr. Carlton as head pumper and Mr. Bedwell as assistant. Subsequently, Mr. Bedwell was released and Mr. Carlton was in'complete charge;'fixed his own working hours, and- was on duty twenty-four hours of the day, not constantly, of course, but ready for duty whenever his'attention'was required. At the time he was killed he had returned to the pump station, after an absence of three or four hours on his own business,- to do that which he had previously plann\u00e9d to do and as a part of the -duties required of him; that is, to start the pump. The pump was in a room adjacent to, and a part of, the building occupied by Mr. Carlton and his family; built, owned, lighted by electricity, and maintained by defendant employer for' its-and the pumper\u2019s convenience.-' As to whether Mr. Carlton was shot in the act of starting the pump, or was shot in an effort to eject the intruders who had broken the window in the pump house and taken-possession of the building, we think, is of no consequence.' In either \u25a0 event, he was serving \u25a0 his master and out of his effort the accident arose which caused his\" d\u00e9ath.' This being true, as Judge Ragland stated in the case of Leilich v. Chevrolet Motor Co., 40 S. W. (2d) 601, \u201cwhy- split hairs -in trying to trace a \u2018causal connection\u2019 between his employment \u00e1nd:his 'death.\u201d\u2019 [Sweeny v. Sweeny Tire Stores Co., 49 S. W. (2d) 205; Beem v. H. D. Lee Mercantile Co., 337 Mo. 114, 85 S. W. (2d) 441; Kinkead v. Management &amp; Engineering Corp. et al., 103 S. W. (2d) 545.]</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">It is insisted by the employer that Mr. Carlton was not required, to occupy the living quarters in the- building in which the 'pump- was located and that he could have lived at Illino and So arranged his hours that his services would not have been required at the pump station at 9 o \u2019clock on the evening he- was killed.' However,- he did occupy these living quarters with 'the- sanction and desire of his 'employer, since as a special inducement, his lights, fuel and other incidentals were furnished him free of charge. Perhaps he could have arranged to start the primp at a different hour on the- evening that he was killed so that it would not have beefi necessary for him to be present at that time, but he could not anticipate a robbery at that particular hour, or the tragedy that resulted when he returned to his work. The facts are undisputed that- ML- Carlton was in control of the pumping facilities, had complete supervision thereof, and had authority to operate the pump at such times, day or night, as was necessary to keep a sufficient supply of water: Assuming that Mr. Carlton could have lived \u00e1t a different place and that he could have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number><em>. </em>arranged to start the pump at. a different hour, on that fatal evening, .. he .was- pot required, so to do, therefore, ou. the face of this record, it would -in no -way: change the -result, and .the. position taken by. appellant is..wholly without merit., , ... \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"AcE\">Under the evidence before us- there can be no question but that the accident arose in the course of Mr.. Carlton\u2019s employment. It occurred within the. period of his employment \u00e1t a place where his employment required him to be, and while he was reasonably fulfilling the duties ;of his employment, or engaged -in doing something incidental thereto. [Reed v. Sensenbaugh, 86 S. W. (2d) 388.] To decide- whether it grew out of his. employment is a more difficult question. An accident may arise in the course of employment and yet not arise out of it. As stated in the case of Leilich v. Chevrolet Motor Co., supra,</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">\u201cThere is no justification for investing the words \u2018arising out of . . . his employment\u2019 with a technical meaning; they are plain, ordinary, and everyday words, and should therefore be given their plain, usual, and ordinary meaning. Every case involving their application should be decided upon its own particular facts and circum- - stances and not by reference to some formula. . . . It is not necessary, therefore, that such accident should have been one reasonably to be anticipated as an incident of the employment. The only question is whether it did in fact arise out of and in the course of the employment. . . . It is of no significance whether the precise physical harm was the natural and probable or the abnormal and inconceivable consequence of the employment.\u201d [Phillips v. Air Reduction Sales Co., 85 S. W. (2d) 551.]</p>\n<p id=\"b232-9\">Furthermore, Mr: Carlton had no idea who was in his house, whether ' friend or foe; and if an enemy, whether harm was intended to him personally or was directed against the property of his employer. It -seems to us that he was faced with an emergency and acted under a sudden impulse to protect the property of his employer. To illustrate ; \u25a0 suppose that long after customary working hours, in the dead of night, he had discovered a fire in his living quarters, or in the pump house, and in attempting to extinguish the fire he was injured. Could it'be said that such an accident did not arise out of the employment merely because he was not employed as a fireman and had no instructions from his employer in regard to fires? The courts are not in- . dined to be severe upon employees who are injured by attempts to further ..the employer\u2019s business, although the attempt is in a line somewhat outside the precise scope of the employment. Mr. Carlton was not employed 'as a watchman, it is true, but he was performing the same services he was in the habit of performing when he was injured; as.well as attempting to protect his employer\u2019s property and \u25a0 to regain possession thereof, a useful and helpful act for his employer, although outside the special duties which he was employed to perform, and he could not be considered a volunteer. [Sweeny <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>v. Sweeny Tire Stores Co., supra; Edwards et al. v. Ethyl Gasoline Corp. et al., 112 S. W. (2d) 555.]</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">We find no case in Missouri similar to the one at bar, but we believe a North Carolina ease, Goodwin et al. v. Bright et al., 163 S. E. 576, is in point. In that case the deceased employee was required to be at his employer\u2019s planing mill between five and seven o\u2019clock in the morning to fire the boiler, an hour and a half before the other employees arrived. He was shot and killed by a robber while he was in the boiler room. His body was found'at 7 a. m. by a fellow employee. He had been robbed of his money and his car had been stolen. It was held that the employee\u2019s death arose out of and in the course of his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">In view of the undisputed evidence in the record before us, the-nature and character of the employment in which Mr. Carlton was engaged, and the purpose and intent that motivated his action at the time he was shot, we are irresistably led to the conclusion, .and so hold, that the accident and resulting death of Mr. Carlton arose out of and in the course of his employment. We further find that there is no substantial competent evidence to the contrary, and that the finding of the commission that the accident did not so arise is not supported by any evidence, and consequently, there was no basis for the award made by the commission in which compensation was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">The judgment of the circuit court, as heretofore stated, remanded the cause to the commission \u201cwith directions to make a.finding of the amount of compensation due plaintiff under the undisputed facts and the law of the case.\u201d It is our opinion that under section 44 of the Compensation Act, Laws 1927, page 512 (Mo. Stat. Ann., see. 3342) the judgment of the circuit court should be modified by striking out the directions \u201cto make a finding of the amount of compensation due plaintiff under the undisputed facts and the law of the case. \u2019 \u2019 [Schulz v. Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Company (Mo. Sup.), 56 S. W. (2d) 126; Russell v. Ely and Walker Dry Goods Co. (Mo. Sup.), 60 S. W.
