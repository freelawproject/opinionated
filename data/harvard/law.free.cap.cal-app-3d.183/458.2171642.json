A.), P. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AY8\">Andrew Seburn Matthews appeals from a judgment entered on a jury verdict finding him guilty of robbery (Pen. Code, \u00a7211; count one); kidnapping (Pen. Code, \u00a7 207 [a lesser included offense of kidnapping for robbery]; count two); and robbery (Pen. Code, \u00a7 211; count three). Two deadly weapon use enhancements (Pen. Code, \u00a7 12022, subd. (b)) and enhancements for two prior felonies (Pen. Code, \u00a7 667, subd. (a)) were found to be true. He received a total sentence of 19 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">The critical facts are stated in respondent\u2019s brief which we substantially utilize.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">On the evening of March 22, 1984, Luellen J. Stephen was on duty in her position as a clerk at the Circle K convenience store located in Los Banos, California. At approximately 9:30 p.m., an individual, subsequently identified as appellant, approached the checkout counter, placed a 12-pack of Budweiser beer on the counter and asked Luellen for a carton of Camel unfiltered cigarettes. As Luellen returned with the carton of cigarettes, appellant displayed a handgun (it was subsequently determined that the weapon was actually a BB gun). Appellant demanded all the money. Luellen complied and removed the cash and coins from the cash register. Appellant ordered Luellen to \u201churry up\u201d and kept pointing the weapon at Luellen. Appellant ordered Luellen \u201cto give him five minutes.\u201d Appellant exited the convenience store with an individual subsequently identified as Ronald Ray McCall. After appellant and McCall departed, Luellen locked the front door of the store and contacted the police authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">At approximately 10 p.m., 15-year-old Donovan was at the apartment he shared with his mother, Ella Mae, in Los Banos. Shortly after the robbery, appellant and McCall arrived at the apartment in possession of a 12-pack of beer and a carton of Camel unfiltered cigarettes. The men also possessed cash and a large amount of change. One of the men stated, \u201cBoy, that was easy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b440-9\">On the evening of March 24, 1984, Frank Moreno was on duty as a taxi driver with the Los Banos City Taxi Company. At approximately midnight, Moreno stopped at Tony\u2019s Rendezvous Bar located on I Street in Los Banos. At that location Moreno picked up appellant and McCall. The men directed him to the address of Ella Mae\u2019s apartment. No one was at home at the apartment, so appellant and McCall directed Moreno to drive them to the Casa Mobile Trailer Court located on North Mercy Springs in Los Banos. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>En route to the trailer park appellant produced a buck knife and placed the point of it at Moreno\u2019s neck. Moreno exclaimed, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? You guys robbing me?\u201d Appellant nodded his head in agreement, and McCall stated, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but we have to do it.\u201d The men directed Moreno to keep driving north and indicated they wanted to go to Stockton. After driving approximately three miles, appellant removed the knife from Moreno\u2019s neck and stated, \u201cWe\u2019re not going to hurt you.\u201d At one point, appellant allowed Moreno to handle the knife. After driving approximately five miles, the men removed Moreno\u2019s wallet from him (the wallet contained approximately $14). Approximately 15 miles from Los Banos the men ordered Moreno to stop the vehicle and ordered him out of the car at knife point. Moreno exited the vehicle and walked to a farm house where he telephoned his employer. Subsequently Moreno was able to flag down a sheriff\u2019s deputy and reported the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">Appellant was arrested in Stockton in the early morning hours of March 24, 1984, riding in the Los Banos taxi. He was in possession of a knife.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"AZq\">Part I</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">\n<em>Faretta Error at the Preliminary Examination.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">It is conceded by respondent that the municipal court committed <em>Faretta (Faretta </em>v. <em>California </em>(1975) 422 U.S. 806 [45 L.Ed.2d 562, 95 S.Ct. 2525]) error in denying appellant the right to represent himself at the preliminary examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-9\">However, our review of the record satisfies us that the error was not raised in the superior court pursuant to a Penal Code section 995 motion to dismiss, so the superior court never had the opportunity to pass upon the municipal court error.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-10\">Appellant relies upon an in propria persona motion made in the superior court which stated: \u201cDefendant, Andrew Seburn Matthews, will move for an order of the court for a new preliminary hearing. [|] On the grounds that, #1\u2014I was denied the right to dismiss counsel, even after showing the municipal court judge in Los Banos that a conflict did in fact exists [sic]. #2 Iniffetive [sic] assistance of councel [sic]: Councel [sic] has no intrest [sic] in case: ask no questions crutial [sic] to case, at pre.lim. #3 Inadequate research.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b442-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>In the points and authorities submitted in support of the motion by his counsel,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> appellant cited authorities and argued the motion on the basis that appellant had incompetent counsel at the preliminary examination who, upon his motion at the preliminary examination, should have been replaced by other counsel. He argued that the refusal of the magistrate to replace counsel at the preliminary examination caused appellant\u2019s commitment to be illegal and therefore appellant was entitled to a new preliminary examination. No mention was made of the refusal of the magistrate to permit appellant to represent himself or to the <em>Faretta </em>case, or to any other case in which the refusal to permit the defendant to represent himself was an issue. Further, the reporter\u2019s transcript of the hearing on the motion does not contain any mention whatsoever of appellant\u2019s being deprived of the right to represent himself in the municipal court. Accordingly, we conclude that a motion on this ground was not made in the superior court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> To conclude otherwise on this record would be the equivalent of manufacturing the existence of such a motion out of thin air. Having not been raised in the superior court, the issue is not cognizable on direct appeal from a judgment of the superior court.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">Penal Code section 996 states the general rule regarding defendant\u2019s failure to make a Penal Code section 995 motion prior to an appeal: \u201cIf the motion to set aside the indictment or information is not made, the defendant is precluded from afterwards taking the objections mentioned in Section 995.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">As we stated in <em>People </em>v. <em>Pendergrass </em>(1986) 182 Cal.App.3d 63 [226 Cal.Rptr. 851]: \u201cWe hold the issue [nondisclosure of informant] is not cognizable on direct appeal since this court reviews alleged errors of the superior court, not the municipal court, and the issue is waived where the appellant did not raise in the superior court the failure to disclose the identity of the informant. <em>(Rugendorf </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1964) 376 U.S. 528 [11 L.Ed.2d 887, 84 S.Ct. 825]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Talley </em>(1967) 65 Cal.2d 830, 836, fn. 1 [56 Cal.Rptr. 492, 423 P.2d 564]; <em>Coy </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1959) 51 Cal.2d 471, 473 [334 P.2d 569]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Rodgers </em>(1976) 54 Cal.App.3d 508, 516-517 [126 Cal.Rptr. 719].) The normal method of raising the denial of the motion by the municipal court is by way of a Penal Code section 995 motion in the superior court. A failure to move to set aside the information <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>in the superior court bars the defense from questioning on appeal any ruling made at the preliminary hearing. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 996; <em>People </em>v. <em>Harris </em>(1967) 67 Cal.2d 866, 868, 870-871 [64 Cal.Rptr. 313, 434 P.2d 609].)</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">\u201cAppellant relies upon a statement taken out of context from <em>Priestly </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1958) 50 Cal.2d 812, 819 [330 P.2d 39]; \u2018A defendant cannot raise the problem of nondisclosure in the appellate courts when he did not seek disclosure at the trial or preliminary hearing . . .\u2019to support his argument that the denial of the motion to disclose in the municipal court may be raised in the Court of Appeal without having raised the issue in the superior court.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">\u201cThe statement is loose dicta because in <em>Priestly </em>the defendant raised the issue in both the municipal court and superior court\u2014in the former by way of a motion to disclose, and in the latter by way of a motion to suppress. In light of the authority to the contrary and the illogic of concluding otherwise, we do not interpret the statement in <em>Priestly </em>as authority for the proposition that the appellate court on direct appeal should review errors committed in the municipal court absent a Penal Code section 995 motion in the superior court.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 67-68.)</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">The aforesaid reasoning applies equally to the error of the magistrate in refusing to permit the appellant to represent himself at the preliminary examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-8\">Accordingly, we need not reach the merits of the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-9\">Parts II, III<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b443-10\">Part IV</p>\n<p id=\"b443-11\">\n<em>Retaliatory Prosecution.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b443-12\">Appellant contends that \u201che was denied due process of law when the prosecutor retaliated by filing more serious charges . . . after a failed plea bargain.\u201d He urges the prosecution was guilty of vindictive or retaliatory prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-13\">The complaint contained two counts of robbery (Pen. Code, \u00a7 211), one count of kidnapping for robbery (Pen. Code, \u00a7 209, subd. (b)), and a count <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>charging unlawful driving and taking of a vehicle (Veh. Code, \u00a7 10851). Each of the four counts was enhanced by use of a deadly weapon, a knife (Pen. Code, \u00a7 12022.3, subd. (a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">Thereafter two informations followed in succession. Each charged only two counts of robbery. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 211.) As to the first information, one robbery count was enhanced by an allegation of use of a deadly or dangerous weapon (Pen. Code, \u00a7 12022, subd. (b)). In the second information both robbery counts were enhanced by allegations of being armed with a firearm (Pen. Code, \u00a7 12022, subd. (a)). As to each information, the preliminary hearing was waived and the matter was referred to the superior court. In each instance the plea bargain failed. After the second failed plea bargain, the superior court remanded the cause to the municipal court for a preliminary examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">A preliminary examination was held on the original complaint and appellant was held to answer on all counts of the complaint. The third information<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> following the preliminary examination alleged two robberies (Pen. Code, \u00a7 211), one kidnapping for robbery (Pen. Code, \u00a7 209, subd. (b)), and two prior felonies qualifying under Penal Code section 667, subdivision (a). In the third information one of the robberies remained enhanced by a use of a dangerous and deadly weapon allegation (Pen. Code, \u00a7 12022, subd. (b)) and the other was changed to being enhanced by use of a deadly weapon, a firearm (Pen. Code, \u00a7 12022.5). The kidnapping for robbery count which was contained in the original complaint was enhanced by a use of a deadly or dangerous weapon allegation (Pen. Code, \u00a7 12022, subd. (b)).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">Aside from some changes in the use and arming enhancements, the net result of these multiple changes was to add two Penal Code section 667, subdivision (a), prior felony enhancements that were not in the original complaint. Though appellant does not specifically say so, apparently these two enhancements are the additional charges appellant maintains were vindictively added after the failed plea bargains.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\"><em>In re Bower </em>(1985) 38 Cal.3d 865 [215 Cal.Rptr. 267, 700 P.2d 1269] is the most recent expression of the California Supreme Court on this subject. In <em>In re Bower, </em>the petitioner was first tried on second degree murder charges and at a point where the trial was almost completed a mistrial was declared. In the second trial the prosecution increased the charges to first degree murder, and he was convicted of first degree murder. In a habeas corpus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>proceeding he successfully argued that there was a presumption of vindictive prosecution when the charges were increased after a mistrial. The prosecution had produced no evidence to overcome the presumption, and the court ordered the conviction reduced from first to second degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">At page 873, the court in <em>In re Bower </em>stated: \u201cThe constitutional protection against prosecutorial vindictiveness is based on the fundamental notion that it \u2018would be patently unconstitutional\u2019 to \u2018chill the assertion of constitutional rights by penalizing those who choose to exercise them.\u2019 <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Jackson </em>(1968) 390 U.S. 570, 581 [20 L.Ed.2d 138,147, 88 S.Ct. 1209].)\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">The <em>Bower </em>court reviewed both United States and California precedent on the subject, noting that the decision is based on both the California and United States due process clauses prohibiting charges motivated by prosecutorial vindictiveness. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 880, fn. 8.)</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">With respect to the circumstances giving rise to a presumption of vindictiveness, the Supreme Court recognized the dichotomy existing in the federal Supreme Court precedent between cases where the additional charges are added after a trial where jeopardy has attached <em>(Blackledge </em>v. <em>Perry </em>(1974) 417 U.S. 21 [40 L.Ed.2d 628, 94 S.Ct. 2098]; <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Pearce </em>(1969) 395 U.S. 711 [23 L.Ed.2d 656, 89 S.Ct. 2072]) and situations where the new charges are added in a pretrial plea bargain context <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Goodwin </em>(1982) 457 U.S. 368 [73 L.Ed.2d 74, 102 S.Ct. 2485]; <em>Bordenkircher </em>v. <em>Hayes </em>(1978) 434 U.S. 357 [54 L.Ed.2d 604, 98 S.Ct. 663], rehg. den. 435 U.S. 918 [55 L.Ed.2d 511, 98 S.Ct. 1477]).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-8\">Referring to <em>Bordenkircher, </em>the court states: \u201c[T]he <em>Pearce-Perry </em>presumption of vindictiveness was held not to arise where charges were increased prior to the attachment of jeopardy.\u201d <em>(In re Bower, supra, </em>38 Cal.3d at p. 874.) The court distinguished <em>Pearce </em>and <em>Perry, </em>quoting from <em>Bordenkircher. </em>\u201c\u2018[I]n those cases the Court was dealing with the State\u2019s unilateral imposition of a penalty upon a defendant who had chosen to exercise a legal right to attack his original conviction\u2014a situation \u201cvery different from the give-and-take negotiation common in plea bargaining between the prosecution and defense . . . .\u201d [Citation.]\u2019 <em>(Id., </em>at p. 362 [54 L.Ed.2d at p. 610].) \u2018. . . [I]n the \u201cgive-and-take\u201d of plea bargaining, there is no such element of punishment or retaliation so long as the accused is free to accept or reject the prosecution\u2019s offer.\u2019 <em>([Bordenkircher </em>v. <em>Hayes, </em>434 U.S.] at p. 363 [54 L.Ed.2d at pp. 610-611].)\u201d <em>(In re Bower, supra, </em>38 Cal.3d at p. 875.)</p>\n<p id=\"b445-9\">Again, the court stated, partly quoting from <em>Goodwin-. </em>\u201cThe timing of the prosecutor\u2019s action is important because \u2018[a] prosecutor should remain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>free before trial to exercise the broad discretion entrusted to him to determine the extent of the societal interest in prosecution. An initial decision should not freeze future conduct. [Fn. omitted.] As we made clear in <em>Bordenkircher, </em>the initial charges filed by a prosecutor may not reflect the extent to which an individual is legitimately subject to prosecution.\u2019 <em>([United States </em>v. <em>Goodwin, </em>457 U.S.] at p. 382 [73 L.Ed.2d at p. 86].)</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">\u201cThe court noted that an important factor in assessing the timing element is the attachment of jeopardy. At the pretrial stage \u2018the prosecutor\u2019s assessment of the proper extent of prosecution may not have fully crystallized. <em>In contrast, once a trial </em>begins\u2014and certainly by the time a conviction has been obtained\u2014it is much more likely that the State has discovered and assessed all of the information against an accused and has made a determination, on the basis of that information, of the extent to which he should be prosecuted.\u2019 <em>(Id., </em>at p. 381 [73 L.Ed.2d at p. 85], italics added.)\u201d <em>(In re Bower, supra, </em>38 Cal.3d at pp. 875-876.)</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">The <em>Bower </em>court cites the California cases of <em>People </em>v. <em>Rivera </em>(1981) 127 Cal.App.3d 136, 144 [179 Cal.Rptr. 384], and <em>People </em>v. <em>Farrow </em>(1982) 133 Cal.App.3d 147, 153 [184 Cal.Rptr. 21], as cases recognizing the federal plea bargain exception for pretrial amendments and emphasizing the importance of timing of the amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\"><em>Twiggs </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1983) 34 Cal.3d 360 [194 Cal.Rptr. 152, 667 P.2d 1165] is another recent California Supreme Court case in which, like <em>Bower, </em>the charges were increased after a partial trial and a declaration of a mistrial. In <em>Bower, </em>the court distinguishes <em>Twiggs </em>from those cases where the added charges give rise to a presumption of vindictiveness, stating at page 877: \u201cAdditionally, we decided that cases suggesting that the presumption of vindictiveness was inapplicable to pretrial settings were not dispositive of Twiggs\u2019 situation\u2014a retrial after a mistrial. Rather, Twiggs\u2019 situation was \u2018analogous to that in the post-conviction context; no new facts were developed through the preliminary hearing or trial, but defendant faces a risk of greater punishment apparently as a result of choosing to face a retrial rather than plead guilty.\u2019 ([Twiggs v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1983) 34 Cal.3d] at pp. 373-374.) As in the cases involving retrial after appeal in <em>Twiggs </em>jeopardy had attached. Since the presumption applied, we concluded that the prosecution bore a heavy burden of rebutting with an explanation that adequately dispelled the apprehension of vindictiveness. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 374.)\u201d <em>(In re Bower, supra, </em>38 Cal.3d at p. 877, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">In the case at bench the two prior felony charges were added in the normal course of pretrial proceedings pursuant to the authority contained in Penal Code sections 739 and 1009 in the context of failed plea bargains <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>and after a preliminary examination. Jeopardy had not attached. There had been no trial or partial trial. Thus the timing and circumstances do not give rise to a reasonable likelihood of vindictiveness. Accordingly, adding the two prior felonies did not give rise to a presumption of vindictiveness and the prosecution was not required to present evidence in the first instance tending to show the absence of vindictiveness.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">Woolpert, J., and Hamlin, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b442-6\">After the motion was filed, counsel who represented appellant at the preliminary examination was relieved by the court upon appellant\u2019s motion and counsel\u2019s concurrence. New counsel was appointed who filed the points and authorities.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b442-7\">Substantiating this view is appellant\u2019s remark at the hearing on the multiple in propria persona motions made by appellant in the superior court, \u201cYes, sir, but I don\u2019t feel adequately up on the law to sufficiently represent myself without advisory counsel.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b443-14\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 458.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b444-8\">Later a fourth amended information was filed making routine correction as to dates, misspellings, and correcting code section designations on the enhancements.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
