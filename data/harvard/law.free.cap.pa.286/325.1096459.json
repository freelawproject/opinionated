Since there are no qualifying adjectives in the mortgage it must be presumed that the word is used in its commonly accepted meaning. It cannot be supposed that it means gross income because it would be ridiculous to argue that the gross income of a railroad is subject to the lien of the railroad\u2019s mortgages, for then its general creditors could not secure payment of their obligations but must be postponed to the bondholders.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b351-4\">It was suggested in the court below that perhaps the defendant company had a right to mortgage its income by reason of some common law power. In answer to this, plaintiff states that a corporation has no common law powers; whatever it does it must find authority for in its charter or special act of assembly or general incorporation laws: P. R. R. v. Canal Co., 21 Pa. 9; Murphy v. Bank, 20 Pa. 415; Solebury Mutual Protective Assn., 3 Pa. Co. C. R. 637.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b351-5\">A claim or demand, being put in suit and passing to final judgment, is merged or swallowed up in that judgment and loses its vitality and cannot thereafter be used either as a cause of action or as a set-off: Murray v.

R., 272 Pa. 442.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b351-7\">The property levied on by the sheriff is covered by the terms of the mortgage and by the very terms of the judgment entered in this case is not subject to levy: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>Com. v.

R. R. v. Woelpper, 64 Pa. 366.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b352-5\">Appellee had the right to mortgage its tolls, issues, income and profits: P., W. &amp; B. R. R. v.

When the bonds fell due, plaintiffs demanded payment of them, and, this having been refused, they each brought suit and recovered a judgment, which, by agreement, expressly limited the right of execution upon it to \u201cproperty which is not subject legally to the lien\u201d of said mortgage. One of plaintiffs issued an attachment execution on his judgment, naming the Pennsylvania Railroad Company as garnishee, and sought thereby to attach defendant\u2019s share of certain passenger, freight and car service rates, which had been paid to the garnishee in consideration of continuous service over the lines of the two railroads; each company being entitled to a specified part thereof. The other plaintiff issued a fieri facias on his judgment, and, under it, a levy was made on defendant\u2019s office furniture and equipment, at the place where the clerical and executive part of its business is transacted. The court below decided that the assets referred to were not liable to the execu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>tions, and each plaintiff appeals from the order in his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">The $1,500,000 mortgage expressly covers, inter alia, \u201call the tolls, issues, income and profits hereafter'derived\u201d by reason of the operation of the railroad; a provision for security therein, operating in futuro, which the legislature had power to authorize: The Phila., Wilmington &amp; Baltimore R. R. Co. v. Woelpper, 64 Pa. 366; Collins\u2019s App., 107 Pa. 590. By the mortgage, the trustees became the repository of the title to the corporate franchise and the property mortgaged, in trust for all the bondholders: Com. v. Susquehanna &amp; Delaware River R. R. Co.; 122 Pa. 306. The collections made by the garnishee are none the less \u201ctolls, issues, income and profits\u201d because they are still in its hands. They belong to the trustees because they are of the character stated. So, also, it is of no consequence to plaintiff that defendant, if and when, it receives the money, may use part of it in paying operating and office expenses. If the mortgage expressly or impliedly authorizes such expenditures/ no one can complain of that use; if it does not, the entire body of bondholders are the only ones who can be injured thereby, if indeed they can, since such use directly inures to their benefit, by enabling the railroad to function as a going concern. Certainly plaintiff, by virtue of his judgment, had no legal right to enforce an attachment against this money, which equitably belongs to the trustees, for the benefit of all the bondholders.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">Plaintiff also contends that, even if the mortgage be so construed as to include the sums in the hands of the garnishee, as we have shown it should be, still it fails of its intended purpose since no statute authorized defendant to issue a mortgage covering those items. To this also we cannot agree. Without stopping to consider the other objections to this contention (see Com. v. Susquehanna &amp; Delaware River R. R. Co., 122 Pa. 306; Manhattan Hardware Co. v. Phalen, 128 Pa. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>110; Mechanics\u2019 Building &amp; Savings Assn., No. 2\u2019s Assigned Est., 202 Pa. 589), it is sufficient to say that defendant had ample statutory power to insert that clause in the mortgage. The incorporating Act of May 6, 1852, P. L. 614, expressly gave to it the same powers as are specified in the General Railroad Act of February 19, 1849, P. L. 79, section 2 of which authorized corporations chartered under it, <em>\u201cto </em>purchase, receive, have, hold, use, and enjoy to them and their successors, goods, chattels and estate, real and personal, of what kind and nature soever, and the same from time to time, to sell, exchange, <em>mortgage, </em>grant, alien or otherwise dispose of......and generally to do all and singular, the matters and things which to them it shall lawfully appertain to do for the well-being of said corporation, and the due ordering and management of the affairs thereof.\u201d As shown in Philadelphia, Wilmington &amp; Baltimore R. R. Co. v. Woelpper, supra, this is broad enough to authorize a mortgaging of future \u201ctolls, issues, income and profits\u201d; and it is clear the right so to do is in no way affected by the limiting proviso, to which plaintiff calls our attention, that the powers authorized shall not \u201cbe construed as in any way giving, to such corporation, any banking privileges whatever.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">That the furniture and equipment in defendant\u2019s business office are exempt from sale on the fi. fa. is also clear. In order to reasonably and effectively carry on its business, defendant must have an office, and furniture and equipment therein. This being so, such property cannot be sold separately, but only with the franchise and the other property reasonably necessary for the due exercise of the franchise: Margo v. Penna. R. R. Co. (No. 2), 213 Pa. 468; McNulty Bros. Co. v. Penna. R. R. Co., 272 Pa. 442. That requirement is founded on a broad public policy, which keeps all such assets intact in order that defendant, or any purchaser of the franchise and those assets, may be able to properly perform the public duties specified in the charter of incorpora<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>tion. This being so, the exemption from a separate sale cannot be limited to the locomotives, cars, rails, fuel and similar assets, bnt must include all property used or to be used in, and reasonably necessary for carrying on, the chartered business of the company. Surely a place to keep its records, and to carry on its clerical and executive business, is reasonably necessary for the purpose stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-3\">In each case, the order of the court below is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
