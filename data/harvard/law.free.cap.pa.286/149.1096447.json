D. &amp; C. R. 523, in which the Orphans\u2019 Court of Philadelphia County ruled on the same question involved in this appeal, the majority opinion confuses the question of distribution with the question of tax liability.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b174-10\">In the case at bar the direction in the will of the decedent for the payment of funeral expenses transfers the primary liability for such expenses from the husband to the estate, hence such expenses are deductible either as a debt of decedent'or as an expense of administration : Melot\u2019s Est., 231 Pa. 520.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AXm\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>April 12, 1926:</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b175-3\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"ApZe\">Mr. Justice Schaefer,</author>\n<p id=\"b175-4\">The question for determination is, Whether the funeral expenses of a deceased married woman, who leaves a surviving husband, are deductible in calculating the clear value of her estate for transfer inheritance tax purposes. The orphans\u2019 court determined that they are and from the decree dismissing its exceptions the Commonwealth appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">We think it not necessary to review the legislation on the subject of inheritance taxes prior to the Act of July 12,1923, P. L. 1078, which is the statute under which the Commonwealth seeks to maintain a tax on the amount expended for funeral expenses. That act provides, \u201cAll taxes imposed by this act shall be at the rate of two per centum upon the <em>clear value </em>of the property subject to such tax passing to or for the use of father, mother, husband, wife, children,......and at the rate of ten per centum upon the clear value of the property subject to such tax passing to or for the use of any other person or persons, bodies corporate or politic; to be paid for the use of the Commonwealth. In ascertaining the clear value of such estates, the only deductions to be allowed from the gross values of such estates shall be the debts of the decedent, <em>reasonable and customary funeral expenses, </em>bequests or devises in trust, in reasonable amounts, the entire interest\u2019 or income from which is to be perpetually applied to the care and preservation of the family burial lot or lots, their enclosures and structures erected thereon, reasonable expenses for the erection of monuments or gravestones, grave and lot markers, and the expenses of the administration of such estates,......\u201d It will be seen that whatever may have been the language of prior enactments providing for the collection of taxes on decedent\u2019s estates and however they may have been judicially construed, the act now to be considered provides in express terms that, \u201cin ascertaining the clear value.....the.....deductions to be allowed from the gross values......shall be [among <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>others] reasonable and customary funeral expenses.\u201d The Commonwealth argues that the husband is primarily liable for his wife\u2019s funeral expenses and, this being so, we should read into the act a limitation of deductibility to such expenditures as the wife\u2019s estate would be primarily liable for, citing to us such cases as Waesch\u2019s Est., 166 Pa. 204, and Mitchell\u2019s Est., 79 Pa. Superior Ct. 208, but the legislature in determining what deductions it would allow before assessing the tax said in explicit terms that allowance should be made for \u201creasonable and customary funeral expenses\u201d and placed no other limitation thereon. We think this plain language negatives the idea that the deduction was to be made only in the event that the husband is unable to pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">There is a direction in the will that all funeral expenses shall be paid out of the estate; it is our view, however, that the presence or absence of such a provision has no bearing on the question presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
