On the 18th of December following, he filed a suggestion in writing, supported by affidavit, for the removal of the record of proceedings in the case to the Court of some adjoining Circuit for trial. An amendment in regard to the removal of causes for trial, made to Section 8 of Article 4 of the Constitution of 186Y, by the Act of 18Y4, ch. 364, went into effect on the 15th of November, 18Y5. Held:</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b113-11\">That although the traverser was indicted before 15th of November, 18Y5, the question of his right to have his case removed, was to be governed by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>provisions of the amendment to the Constitution which went into effect om that day.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b114-5\">The right to have one\u2019s case removed for trial is not a vested right; it is only a remedy given to secure an impartial trial, and may be altered or modified at any time by the proper authority.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b114-6\">Appeal from the Criminal Court of Baltimore City.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b114-7\">The case is stated in the opinion of the Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b114-8\"><em>Exception. </em>\u2014 Before the trial, the defendant filed a suggestion in writing, supported hy affidavit, that he could not have a fair and impartial trial in the Criminal Court of Baltimore City, and prayed the Court to order and direct the removal of the record of proceedings in his case, to the Court of some adjoining Circuit for trial; this prayer the Court (Gtlmor, J.,) refused, and the defendant excepted and took this appeal.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b114-9\">The cause was submitted to Bartol, C.

Under its provisions, however, they are restricted, and can be taken only <em>\u201c </em>to such ruling or determination of the Court,\u201d as may be made <em>at the trial. </em>In the present case the exception was taken before the traverser had pleaded, or any trial had commenced. His exception was taken therefore without any authority of law, and the case is not properly before us. Instead of taking and filing a bill of exceptions, he should have resorted to his petition assigning errors.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">But even if the appeal could be entertained, the ruling of the Court below would be affirmed. The ground of error alleged is, that the traverser being indicted before the 15th of November, the question of his right to remove his case was not affected by the amendment of the Constitution, in regard to the removal of causes, which went into effect on that day, and before his application for removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">It is argued in his behalf, that the right of removal under the provision of the Constitution, which was in force when the indictment was filed, is to govern his case, and that the right was a vested one which could not be impaired by any subsequent amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">A right conferred in regard to the removal of causes does not fall within the class of vested rights. It is but a remedy given to secure an impartial trial, which at any time may be altered or modified by the proper authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">The case of <em>William Smith vs. State of </em>Maryland, 44 <em>Md., </em>530, is in all respects precisely similar to the present one. In that case the same questions were presented, and are reviewed in the opinion of the Court. It was held that the appeal must be dismissed for want of jurisdiction, and such must also be our determination in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-9\">\n<em>Appeal dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
