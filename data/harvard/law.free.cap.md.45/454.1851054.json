The State offered evidence tending to prove that the appellant committed, without any provocation, a violent assault upon Patrick Winn, and cut him with a knife upon the head and face. The appellant, -on his part, offered evidence tending to prove that Patrick Winn, followed hy a crowd, approached the appellant, struck him with his fist a violent blow on the neck, and knocked him down ; that while the appellant was down and Winn on top heating him, the appellant drew a common pocket knife, and, in self-defence, inflicted the blows on the head and face of Winn. . A witness called hy the appellant was asked, what was the relative strength and size of the appellant and Winn ? The State objected to the question and the Court (Brown, J.,) sustained the objection. The defendant excepted. The verdict of the jury was \u201cnot guilty of assault with intent to murder, hut guilty of common assault.\u201d The defendant appealed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b469-6\">The cause was suhmited to Bartol, C.

The hill of exceptions in this case, though signed, is without the seal of the Judge of the Criminal Court of-Baltimore City, and is therefore as of little avail as if it were also without the signature of that Judge.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b470-10\">(Decided 21st December, 1876.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">Second. \u2014 The Act of 1872, also requires, as an express condition upon which the appeal is allowed, that the <em>counsel </em>of the party indicted shall make oath that tide appeal is not taken for delay. In the case of <em>Deckard vs. The State, </em>38 <em>Md., </em>200, this Court said: \u201c This proviso was inserted for the purpose of preventing delay in the punishment of offences, hy appeals on points too plain to he controverted. It does not permit a <em>party </em>found guilty of crime to secure a postponement of punishment, consequent upon an appeal, hy taking this oath, hut requires it to he made in all cases where the accused is the appellant, hy his <em>counsel, </em>thus requiring a solemn pledge from the judgment and conscience of one, who is a member of a learned and honorable profession, that he believes the rulings against his client are erroneous. It is the duty of this Court to see to it, so far as it may have power, that the intention of the Legislature in imposing this wholesome and salutary restriction upon appeals in such cases, is not defeated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">To maintain this salutary restriction this Court will not entertain' an appeal in a criminal case, unless the record shows that the required affidavit has been made by the <em>counsel </em>of the accused. In this case it is merely stated, \u201cappeal prayed to Court of Appeals by the traverser, and affidavit filed that appeal is not taken for delay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">Eor aught that apjiears in the record the affidavit may have been made by the <em>accused, </em>when it should <em>affirmatively </em>appear that it was made by his <em>counsel.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">This appeal will therefore be' dismissed for the causes herein stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-9\">\n<em>Appeal dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
