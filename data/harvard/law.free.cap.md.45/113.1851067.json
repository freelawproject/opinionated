That if the jury believe that the plaintiff was the owner and holder of three shares of stock issued by the defendant, as appears by certificates Nos. 14, 27 and 47 ; that on or about the 18th day of June, 1874, she gave a notice to withdraw the same, as required by Article 17 of the constitution of said defendant, offered in evidence; that more than three months elapsed between the giving of such notice and the bringing of this suit, and defendant did not pay plaintiff, then plaintiff is entitled to recover in this action the difference between the amount represented by said certificates and what, if any thing, has been paid plaintiff on account thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b130-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>2. That if the defendant recognized the plaintiff as a member, and issued to her the certificate 47, for stock mentioned in the declaration, that is evidence from which the jury may find she was a member of the defendant, and that if said two certificates, 14 and 27, were transferred from A. Th. Berg to the plaintiff, in accordance with Article 18 of said constitution, that is sufficient to enable the plaintiff to maintain suit on such certificates.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b130-5\">The defendant offered four prayers. The first and second were withdrawn; the third and fourth were as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b130-6\">3. That the verdict must be for the defendant, because the plaintiff, under the evidence, held but one share in the defendant, which share has been paid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b130-7\">4. That the plaintiff is not entitled to be allowed for more than the amount of one share, with interest from the 18th day of June, 1874, after deducting therefrom one-third of the seven hundred dollars admitted to have been paid by the declaration.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b130-8\">The Court (GtAREV, J.,) granted the prayers of the plaintiff and rejected those of the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b130-9\">The defendant excepted. The jury rendered a verdict for the plaintiff, and judgment was entered accordingly. The defendant appealed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b130-10\">The cause was argued before Bartol, C. J., Stewart, Bowie, Alvey and Robinson, J.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b130-11\"><em>Edward Duffy, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b130-12\"><em>Thos.

In that event she no longer occupied the position' of a member of the association, except for the purpose of receiving her money; but the relation of creditor and debtor supervened between her and the association, by virtue of this provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-10\">The language admits of no other sensible construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-11\">It is, in terms, provided that a member <em>may withdraw </em>his <em>shares, </em>and <em>receive his moneys, </em>not as a distributive portion of the assets of the corporation, after allowance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>for profits and losses, but as a creditor, entitled to demand the <em>money advanced </em>on the shares to the company. <em>Withdrawing </em>and <em>recalling her shares, </em>the appellee was entitled to be re-invested with and repaid <em>her money, </em>\u2014 not a <em>dividend </em>upon the funds of the association, to be measured by the amount of her shares, as provided by the twentieth Article.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b132-10\">(Decided 16th June, 1876.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">If such had been the meaning, pertinent language would have\u201ebeen used for that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">It was evidently, the object of the association to induce persons to join it, and advance <em>their money </em>the more readily, because of the condition that they might <em>withdraw </em>and receive <em>their money </em>bach, without reference to <em>profits and losses. </em>This could not be done until the year had expired; of course the corporation would have the use of the money during that period, and could sustain no loss by the operation, if a member then retired.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">It seems the appellee was the owner of three shares, and upon the hypothesis of the facts embraced in the first and second prayers of the plaintiff below, she was entitled to recover, and there was no error in the granting of these prayers, and the rejection of the defendant\u2019s prayers.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">This conclusion disposes of the case, and the other points made and discussed become immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-9\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
