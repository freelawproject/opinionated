The defendant pleaded in bar a former recovery for the same subject-matter. A rule was laid upon the plaintiff to reply. On the suggestion and affidavit of the defendant, the case was removed to the Circuit Court for Baltimore County for trial. After the removal of the case there was entered on the docket \"Issue joined,\u201d and an <em>ex parte </em>trial was had which resulted in a verdict and judgment for the plaintiff. On the following day counsel appeared for the defendant and moved the Court to strike out the verdict and judgment, and in support of the motion filed the following reasons:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b489-5\">1st. Because the same were a surprise to the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b489-6\">2nd. Because the plaintiff in the Superior Court of Baltimore City, heretofore recovered upon the same cause of action against the defendant, a verdict and judgment for one cent damages and costs, which judgment and costs, recovered as aforesaid, the said defendant has fully paid and satisfied ; that said recovery was had upon the same subject and was between the same parties as involved in this case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b489-7\">The defendant offered to file additional reasons in support of his motion and the plaintiff objected. The Court sustained the objections of the plaintiff and disallowed the offer of the defendant, and overruled the motion to strike out. The defendant appealed from the refusal of the Court to allow him to file additional reasons, and from the order overruling the motion to strike out.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b489-8\">Afterwards the defendant moved that the judgment he arrested for the following reasons:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b489-9\">1st. Because'of errors apparent upon the face of the record in this case in entering the judgment, in this: That the plaintiff was under rule replication, and a replication of any kind was not filed by him in the said cause in reply to the plea in bar, as appears from the papers and record in said case, before submission of the said case to the jury, though under rule replication.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b490-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>2nd. Because the entry of \u201cIssue joined\u201d made by the clerk of said Court in said case upon the docket.of said Court, was erroneous and unwarranted in law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b490-5\">3rd. Because the said case not being at issue when submitted to the jury, their verdict and the judgment thereon were therefore void in law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b490-6\">The Court overruled the motion in arrest of judgment and the defendant appealed, <em>i</em></summary>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b490-7\">The cause was argued before Bartol, C.

The verdict could not cure the defect, and the motion of the defendant, made the following day, to strike out the verdict and judgment ought to have prevailed, rendering, of course, any motion in arrest of ju'dgment unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-15\">After the defendant had made the motion to strike out the judgment, and filed reasons therefor, and a day had been fixed for the hearing of the motion, the offer of the defendant to file additional reasons, was a matter within the sound discretion of the Court to permit it to be done or not, and the refusal to allow it to be done, is not the subject of appeal.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b491-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>(Decided 11th January, 1877.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">The judgment of the Circuit Court, overruling the motion of the defendant, to strike out the verdict and judgment, must he reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\"><em>Judgment </em>reversed, <em>and new trial </em>ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
