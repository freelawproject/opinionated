In addition to this, when the plaintiff called upon the defendant for the payment of the purchase money, the latter told him not to be uneasy about the money, \u2014 that it should be paid, \u2014 that Z. ought to have paid it; and further said that they.had lost money upon the purchase of horses.

The former exists only by the actual intention of the parties, the latter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>may arise by mere operation of law against tbe intention of the parties. But this case is within the ruling of <em>Crawford, et al. vs. Austin, et al., </em>34 <em>Md., </em>50.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b456-5\">A party who receives a proportion of the profits as a compensation for his services, will not be deemed a partner as to third persons, because the transaction admits of a different interpretation, and may justly he deemed a mere mode of ascertaining and paying the compensation of an agent as in a naked case of agency. <em>Bennett\u2019s Story on Partnership, see. </em>32.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b456-6\">All of the hooks sustain the distinction between an interest in the profits themselves as profits, and the payment of money in proportion'to a given quantum of profits, as the reward of and as a compensation for labor and services, and that to constitute one a partner with another, each person must have a specific interest in the profits as a principal trader. <em>Bennett\u2019s Story on </em>Partn., <em>sec. </em>33 ; <em>Gow on Partn., ch. </em>1, <em>p. </em>18, <em>(3rd Ed.;) Collyer on Partn., B. </em>1, <em>C. 1, D. </em>1 <em>, pp. </em>17, 18, <em>(2nd Ed.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b456-7\">As Chancellor Walworth, adopting Lord Eldon\u2019s language, expresses it, \u201cIf a man stipulates that as the reward of his labor he shall have, not a specific interest in the business, but a given sum of money even in proportion to the quantum of profits, that will not make him a partner.\u201d Champion <em>vs. Bostwick, </em>18 <em>Wend., </em>175,184; <em>Bennett\u2019s Story, sec. </em>39, <em>n. </em>1.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b456-8\">Judge Story strongly urges that the obligations of partnership ought not to apply to cases where one party is to act manifestly as the mere agent of another, and is to receive a compensation for his labor and services only, and not a share as a partner, or to possess the rights and powers of a partner. <em>Bennett\u2019s Story, secs. </em>48, 49.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b456-9\">There is no partnership in a case of service, where the employ\u00e9 has no power as a partner in a firm, and no interest in the profits as property, hut is simply employed as a servant or special agent, and is to receive a proportion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>of the profits as a compensation for his services. An interest in the profits as profits, constitutes one a partner. <em>Berthold vs. </em>Goldsmith, 24 <em>Howard, (U.

Such declarations, it is clear, were not binding upon the appellant, unless Zeigler was at the time his agent, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>acting within the scope of his authority; nor were they admissible in evidence, unless there was proof from which the agency could be inferred. Without reviewing the several cases in -which this question has been considered by this Court, it is sufficient to say, that the declarations of a person professing to -act as the agent of another, are not <em>per se </em>admissible in evidence to bind the principal; and in order to make them so, there must be proof <em>aliunde, </em>from which the agency may be inferred. If the proof in this respect be so slight and inconclusive, as not to justify a jury, in the exercise of a reasonable intelligence, to infer the agency, such declarations are inadmissible; on the other hand, if it be <em>legally sufficient </em>to warrant the jury in finding that the party making the declarations was the agent, then they ought to be admitted. It is not easy to lay down a more certain and definite rule. In all cases however, the admissibility of the declarations is a preliminary question for the Court, but agency <em>vel non, </em>is a question for the jury. <em>Henderson vs. Mayhew, </em>2 <em>Gill, </em>409; <em>Morrison vs. Whiteside, </em>17 <em>Md., </em>459; <em>York County Bank vs. Stein, </em>24 <em>Md., </em>465 ; <em>Thomas vs. Sternheimer, </em>29 <em>Md., </em>271; <em>Natl. Mechanics\u2019 Bank of Balt. vs. Natl. Bank of Balt., </em>36 <em>Md., </em>20.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">The inquiry then on this branch of the case resolves itself into this, was the proof offered by the appellee sufficient to justify the inference that Zeigler was the agent of the appellant at the time such declarations were made?</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">Now the evidence shows, that prior to the purchase of the plaintiff\u2019s horse, Zeigler had purchased horses of other persons as the agent of the appellant, and that these purchases had been ratified and adopted by the appellant; and that these facts were known to the appellee. In addition to this, when the appellee called upon the appellant for the payment of the purchase money, the latter told him not to be uneasy about the money, that it should be paid, \u2014 that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>Zeigler ought to have paid it; and further said, that they had lost money on the purchase of horses. Here then was proof, not only of the adoption and ratification by the appellant of the acts of Zeigler, hut in addition thereto, the pregnant fact, that when the purchase money was demanded of him by the appellee, there was no denial of Zeigler\u2019s agency or authority, \u2014 on the contrary, there was an implied admission that the horse had been purchased by the authority of the appellant. This evidence was sufficient, in our opinion, to warrant the jury in finding the agency of Zeigler; and if so, the declarations made by him at the time of the purchase were admissible in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">To rebut the proof thus offered by the appellee, the appellant testified, that he had employed Zeigler to purchase horses, and that, by the terms of their agreement, the appellant was to furnish the money and pay for the horses and cattle, and that Zeigler was to make the purchases and bring the horses in, and that in consideration of such services the appellant was to give him a part of the profits. The appellant further said, he was to bear all the losses, and he did not consider it a partnership.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">Upon the evidence thus offered, the Court instructed the jury, \u201cthat if they believed from the evidence, that prior to the sale and purchase of the horse, the price of which is sued for in this action, a partnership existed between Henry Rowland and John F. Zeigler for the purchase of horses, and that no notice of the dissolution of said partnership was given to the public, by publication or otherwise, or that the plaintiff had not notice in some other way of such dissolution, and the plaintiff sold to John F. Zeigler, as the partner of said Henry Rowland, the horse, for the price of which this suit is instituted, without any knowledge of said dissolution, if there was a dissolution, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>but relied on tbe responsibility of said Rowland, then tbe plaintiff is entitled to recover.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">We see no objection to tbis prayer. Whatever conflict there may be in the decided cases as to what are the elements necessary to constitute a partnership, and however difficult it may be to lay down definite rules as applicable to all cases, it is well settled, we think, that where two persons agree to carry on a trade or business for their mutual benefit, one to furnish the money and the other to perform certain labor and services, and each to share the .profits to he derived from such trade or business, they become liable as partners <em>to third persons, </em>although in fact no partnership was contemplated by the parties themselves. In such a case, each party has an <em>interest or property in the profits as profits, </em>and is entitled to an account for the same. <em>Waugh vs. Carver, </em>2 <em>Hy. Black., </em>235; <em>Smith\u2019s Leading Cases, vol. </em>1, <em>part </em>2, <em>and note, </em>1175 ; <em>Smith vs. Watson, 2 B. &amp; C., </em>407; <em>Ex parte Rowlandson, </em>1 <em>Rose, </em>91; <em>Green vs. Beesley, </em>2 <em>Bing. N. C., </em>110; <em>Ex parte Langdale, </em>18 <em>Vesey, </em>300; <em>Hazard vs. Hazard, </em>1 <em>Story, </em>371.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">Here the appellant was to furnish the money, and Zeigler was to purchase the horses, and the profits to be realized from the purchases and sales were to be divided between them. Tbe exact proportion of the profits to which each was entitled does not appear from the evidence, but that is quite immaterial. Now, under such an agreement as this, it is clear from all the authorities, that they became liable as partners to third parties, although in fact they may not have intended to form a partnership.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">The defendant\u2019s prayer was properly rejected by the Court. It entirely ignored the liability of the appellant if the jury should find that there existed a partnership between him and Zeigler. It was also objectionable, because from its language the jury might infer they were bound to find that Zeigler had <em>special authority </em>to purchase the horse sued for.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b461-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>(Decided 15th December, 1876.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">The modification of the prayer hy the Court, presented the law correctly to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">Finding no error in the rulings below, the judgment will he affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed,</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
