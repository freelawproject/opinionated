At the trial an exception was taken by the traverser to the refusal of the Court to permit a question to be answered by a witness. This Court did not decide the point thus raised, and the exception is therefore not set out. The traverser appealed. Pending the appeal, the Act of 1816, ch. 213, sec. 55, repealing the Act of 1861, ch. 390, sec. 55, was passed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b64-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>The cause was submitted ou briefs, to Bartol, C.
