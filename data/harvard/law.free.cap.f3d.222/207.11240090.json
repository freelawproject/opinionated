He contends that the Commissioner failed to apply the correct legal standards and that his decision was not supported by substantial evidence. We have reviewed the record and the briefs of the parties, and we conclude that the district court was without jurisdiction to entertain Jackson\u2019s claims of hearing loss and procedural error before the Administrative Law Judge because of Jackson\u2019s failure to raise these issues before the Appeals Council. <em>See Paul v. Shalala, </em>29 F.3d 208, 210 (5th Cir.1994). We affirm the district court\u2019s decision on this alternate basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-10\">In this appeal, Jackson does not argue whether substantial evidence supports the Commissioner\u2019s decision vis-a-vis his claim of right-eye blindness. Instead, he argues only that substantial evidence does not support a decision denying benefits based on his asserted hearing loss. Accordingly, Jackson abandons the only issue properly before this court on appeal \u2014 whether the Commissioner\u2019s decision denying him Social Security Income benefits based on his blindness claim is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
