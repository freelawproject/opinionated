Plaintiffs complaint, filed February 24,1994, and thereafter amended solely to add additional defendants, was dismissed on the motion of defendant Dr. Robert Greene at the close of plaintiffs case. Because we conclude that plaintiffs direct evidence at trial presented a <em>prima facie </em>claim of medical negligence, we reverse and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b484-12\">We commence our analysis by a review of the testimony offered by plaintiff, Marge Teilhaber, in her direct case.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-13\">On February 24,1992, plaintiff suffered severe fractures of both legs in an automobile collision. Plaintiff was transported to Mountainside Hospital, where she was examined in the emergency room by two physicians, Drs. Peter Wujciak and Michael Wujciak. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>Pending further patient consultation, plaintiff was stabilized by the insertion of a pin in each leg.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">The following day, both physicians returned to further examine plaintiff and to discuss with her a proposed course of treatment. According to plaintiff, both physicians proposed surgery on each leg and neither physician discussed any alternative form of treatment. Yet, plaintiff offered into evidence the hospital records which included Drs. Wujciaks\u2019 service notes reflecting: \u201cextensive discussion ... with patient and family ... outlining treatment alternatives including traction management through rigid internal fixation,\u201d and \u201c[E]xtensive discussions were had with the patient and family and in particular the mother as to possible surgical and nonsurgical alternatives to management that were available.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">Plaintiff, desiring a second opinion, consulted defendant Dr. Robert Greene, an orthopedic surgeon. According to defendant\u2019s deposition testimony,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> he spoke with the Drs. Wujciak before he met plaintiff. After examining plaintiff, defendant advised her that he would treat her with traction. Plaintiff testified that defendant advised her of the problems associated with traction: discomfort and aggravation from lying on her back for several months, pulmonary embolism, and bed sores. She indicated that she elected to be treated by defendant because she \u201cliked hearing\u201d that defendant could \u201ctake care of [her] without surgery,\u201d and because of her trust in him attributable to his \u201cconfident demean- or.\u201d We find a portion of plaintiffs testimony and the comments of the trial judge pertinent to our ultimate conclusion in this appeal.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-8\">Q. And what was it that Dr. Greene told you when he came in to see you in reference to a second opinion?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-9\">A. He said very clearly and very confidently that he could get \u2014 we could get the same good result from traction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-10\">Q. The same good results from traction as what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>A. As opposed to surgery, because he had spoken to the Dr. Wqjciaks and he . knew what they had in mind and he examined the x-rays. And I\u2019m very clear that he said, very confidently, I can get you the same good results with traction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-5\">Q. And your mother and father were\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-6\">The Court: This is not a contract guarantee state. I\u2019m serious. I mean, it should not be. Those kinds of things have nothing whatever to do with whether or not he deviated from any accepted standards. This is not an informed consent case and it\u2019s not a contract case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-7\">Plaintiffs counsel: I understand that. May I proceed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-8\">Q. Did Dr. Greene ever speak to you about the possibility of having the open reduction surgery done?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-9\">A. No. Didn\u2019t even mention it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-10\">Q. Did he ever\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-11\">A. Other than saying that he felt that the good \u2014 the result \u2014 the result would be similarly good results.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-12\">Q. He did not make any recommendation that you have open reduction surgery?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-13\">A. Absolutely not.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-14\">Defendant\u2019s consultant\u2019s report, included in the hospital record which was offered in evidence, reflects the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-15\">Definitive orthopedic treatment is primarily whether to leave this lady in skeletal traction until this fracture heals down into what would be quite satisfactory position or whether to do open reduction on these and consider doing intramedullary rods____ I wonder ... whether a blade would have enough fixation in the lateral condylar area to hold anything____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-18\">Plaintiff was placed in traction and remained at Mountainside Hospital until April 1992, when she was discharged to the Kessler Institute for Rehabilitation. In July 1993, plaintiff was discharged to her home under the care of a twenty-four-hour attendant. On that day, plaintiff was walking with the aid of a walker. Three days later plaintiff was x-rayed. Defendant read those x-rays and informed plaintiff that the bones in her legs were not aligned, that she would \u201cnever have a normal walk\u201d and that she would \u201cneed an osteotomy<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of both legs in order to walk normally.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>Plaintiff then consulted Dr. Howard Rosen. Dr. Rosen performed an osteotomy on plaintiffs left leg on September 21, 1992. After conservative treatment on plaintiffs right leg failed to correct the non-alignment, Dr. Rosen performed an osteotomy on plaintiffs right leg in June 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">Plaintiff filed a complaint on February 24,1994, and an amended complaint on June 15, 1994. In the amended complaint, plaintiff asserted, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-7\">Defendants<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> were negligent and careless individually and in association in their care and treatment ... and failed to render the medical care that plaintiffs condition demanded and either lacked the skill and ability to render the care and treatment that the plaintiffs condition demanded or failed to use the skill and ability which they did possess in treating the plaintiff and the defendants were further negligent and careless in failing to, during their care and treatment of the plaintiff, properly perform surgical procedures upon the plaintiff and to perform the necessary tests and examinations of the plaintiff in .the area upon which a surgical procedure was performed on or about February 25, 1992 and for some time thereafter failed to properly observe and to apply the results of such observation to the plaintiffs physical condition in the area of the proposed surgical procedure which was rendered on or about February 25,1992----</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">At trial, in addition to plaintiffs testimony and the corroborative testimony offered by her mother, plaintiffs only witness was her expert, Dr. Elias Sedlin, a board-certified orthopedic surgeon associated with the Mt. Sinai Medical Center in New York. Because the trial judge dismissed plaintiffs amended complaint at the close of plaintiffs case, we must fully evaluate Dr. Sedlin\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-9\">Dr. Sedlin opined that the use of traction was abandoned twenty-five or thirty years ago by the \u201cfraternity,\u201d or the \u201corthopedic group,\u201d and that traction \u201chas no place in the treatment of this injury, save with certain kinds of patients who are never going to walk again, never did walk ... [o]r where they have certain life-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>threatening problems precluding a definitive operation.\u201d Dr. Sedlin testified that the use of traction as the treatment for plaintiffs injury was \u201cgrossly inappropriate.\u201d \u201cThe decision to maintain the patient in traction was a deviation from accepted medical standards\u201d and plaintiffs poor result flowed from the fact that plaintiff had traction rather than surgery. He opined that traction was unacceptable because \u201cit can\u2019t do the job.\u201d Additionally, (1) the medical complications associated with traction, which he enumerated, outweigh the medical complications of surgery; and (2) traction prohibits the knee from moving, and the ultimate goal of the treatment for a fractured leg, aside from aligning the bone, is for the knee to move well. He explained that the development of surgical plates and the greater understanding of the benefits of joint mobilization made surgery the preferred treatment for severe leg injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">Dr. Sedlin did admit that surgery also creates some problems, as one in four patients who would undergo this type of surgery, initially recommended by the Drs. Wujciak, would \u201chave some failure,\u201d but that the alternatives to surgery \u201cwere worse.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>After plaintiff rested her case, defendant moved for a directed verdict. During the colloquy that followed, the trial judge stated: \u201cThis is not an informed consent case. The patient makes the decision, not the doctor.... The testimony is clearly that the patient was given two choices, surgery or traction____ [Ojnce the patient has been given the option, it is not up to the physician. The physician can not overrule the patient.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">The judge asked plaintiffs counsel, \u201cWell, tell me what the [cause] of action is then,\u201d to which plaintiffs counsel began to respond, \u201cDefendant deviated from accepted medical practice by suggesting to [plaintiff] and giving a specific statement that we____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b489-9\">The trial judge interrupted and stated, \u201cYou never brought this as an informed consent case. If you were saying she was given bad information, that\u2019s an informed consent case.\u201d In further colloquy the judge emphasized that plaintiff had been informed about surgery by Drs. Wujciak and then indicated, \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong whatsoever in trying the less invasive situation first.\u201d After further colloquy, the judge again indicated, \u201cThis is the way I\u2019m reading this. It\u2019s being argued as an informed consent case.\u201d He also added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-10\">The question is ... is it a battery to treat the patient without the patient\u2019s consent. You, therefore, have to have informed consent. But it is the patient, not the doctor. We don\u2019t even use professional standard anymore. We \u2014 whether we used to use before <em>Largey [v. Rothman, </em>110 <em>N.J. </em>204, 540 A.2d 504 (1988)], we used to call it a professional standard, which I didn\u2019t quite agree with anyway, but I can\u2019t imagine that any doctor would come in and say you have the right to make the decision. That\u2019s exactly what Sedlin was doing. Sedlin was going on the professional standard more than ... the patient\u2019s standard.... And this patient was informed. The patient may have \u2014 and I\u2019m not disagreeing with her or anything else like that. She had the option. It is not an informed consent case. You are telling me there\u2019s a deviation. She opted for that treatment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>The judge later stated, \u201cYou brought a deviation case. You said it was a deviation not under \u2014 to put her under the knife. And I\u2019m telling you, that\u2019s her choice.\u201d The judge acknowledged that the patient has the right to choose the procedure of treatment for an injury, and the doctor must provide information that a reasonably prudent patient needs to make an informed decision. \u201cThere is no question she had the information. She made the decision\u201d; and though Dr. Greene did not give the patient the option of surgery, she already knew of the surgical option from the Wujciaks, and \u201c[t]he law says that you don\u2019t have to tell people what they already know.\u201d The judge then concluded that plaintiff had failed to present a <em>prima facie </em>case, and that \u201cif there had been any case whatsoever, it would have been an informed consent case ... [a]nd that\u2019s not the way the case was presented and there is no evidence to support an informed consent case in this ... instance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">In plaintiffs sole point of error asserted in her appeal she contends: \u201cThe Court below erred in directing a verdict of dismissal of plaintiffs case when she rested following completion of its presentation.\u201d We agree and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">We commence our analysis recognizing that the issue is whether the evidence, together with the legitimate inferences that can be drawn from it, sustain the judgment in favor of defendant rendered at the close of plaintiffs case. <em>R. </em>4:37-2(b). We must accept as true all evidence supporting plaintiffs claim and accord her the benefit of all favorable inferences; if reasonable minds could differ, the motion to dismiss must be denied. <em>Dolson v. Anastasia, </em>55 <em>N.J. </em>2, 5, 258 A.2d 706 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">Here, the trial judge concluded that plaintiffs theory was predicated upon a cause of action grounded solely in \u201cinformed consent\u201d and that plaintiff had failed to allege that theory in her complaint. To the contrary, we conclude that the judge too narrowly viewed the gravamen of plaintiffs amended complaint and then too narrowly viewed the evidence presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>A plaintiff may bring an action against a doctor for personal injuries under at least three theories: deviation from the standard of care, <em>see Gardner v. Pawliw, </em>150 <em>N.J. </em>359, 696 A.2d 599 (1997); lack of informed consent, <em>see Largey v. Rothman, </em>110 <em>N.J. </em>204, 540 A.2d 504 (1988); and battery, <em>see Perna v. Pirozzi </em>92 <em>N.J. </em>446, 457 A.2d 431 (1983).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> However, it is now clear that both deviation from the standard of care and failure to obtain informed consent are simply sub-groups of a broad claim of medical negligence. <em>Baird v. American Medical Optics, </em>155 <em>N.J. </em>54, 70, 713 A.2d 1019 (1998) (citing <em>Perna, supra, </em>92 <em>N.J. </em>at 459, 457 A.2d 431; <em>Lugenbuhl v. Dowling, </em>701 <em>So.2d </em>447, 452 (La.1997)). The <em>Baird </em>Court disapproved a premise enunciated in <em>Lombardo v. Borsky, </em>298 <em>N.J.Super. </em>658, 690 A.2d 150 (App.Div.), <em>certif. granted, </em>150 <em>N.J. </em>28, 695 A.2d 671 (1997), and <em>appeal dismissed, </em>153 <em>N.J. </em>44, 707 A.2d 149 (1998), \u201cthat a medical malpractice claim differs so fundamentally from one based on the failure to obtain a patient\u2019s informed consent that the statute of limitations on the consent claim should start running on a date different from that applicable to the medical malpractice claim\u201d and thus the <em>Baird </em>Court overruled <em>Lombardo. </em>155 <em>N.J. </em>at 70, 713 A.2d 1019.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">A complaint must set forth a claim for relief that contains \u201ca statement of the facts on which the claim is based, showing that the pleader is entitled to relief, and a demand for judgment for the relief to which the pleader claims entitlement.\u201d <em>R. 4:5-2. </em>In <em>Spring Motors Distribs., Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., </em>191</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number><em>N.J.Super. 22, </em>465 A.2d 530 (App.Div.1983), <em>aff'd in part and rev\u2019d in part on other grounds, </em>98 <em>N.J. </em>555, 489 A.2d 660 (1985), we noted the requirement that a pleading must \u201cfairly apprise the adverse party of the claims and issues to be raised at trial\u201d and further held that \u201c[o]n an attack upon a complaint all facts, reasonable inferences and implications are to be considered most strongly in favor of the pleader.\u201d 191 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 29-30, 465 A.2d 530 (citations omitted). \u201cA complaint ... is not required to spell out the legal theory upon which it is based.\u201d <em>Farese v. McGarry, </em>237 <em>N.J.Super. </em>385, 390, 568 A.2d 89 (App.Div.1989). Because pleadings are primarily fact-based, the court may instruct the jury as to a legal theory not expressly alleged if all of the underlying facts have been pleaded and proved. <em>Id. </em>at 390-92, 568 A.2d 89; Pressler, <em>Current N.J. Court Rules, </em>comment on <em>R. </em>4:5-2 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">These general concepts are particularly important in construing a complaint alleging medical negligence. As the Court noted in <em>Baird:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-6\">In most cases, medical malpractice and informed consent claims will conform so closely that knowledge of facts sufficient to start the statute of limitations on one claim should start running on the other. The statute should start running on both claims when injured parties know of them injuries and of facts sufficient to support the institution of either claim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">[155 <em>N.J. </em>at 71, 713 A.2d 1019.]</p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">Here, plaintiffs amended complaint alleged in part, \u201c[Defendant] failed to properly observe and to <em>apply the results of such observation to the plaintiffs physical condition </em>in the area of the . proposed surgical procedure.\u201d (emphasis supplied). Viewed liberally, and giving all \u201creasonable inferences and implications ... in favor of the pleader,\u201d <em>Spring Motors, supra, </em>191 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 29-30, 465 A.2d 530, we can infer that plaintiffs complaint encompassed a claim that defendant, after observing plaintiffs condition, failed to apply the results of his observation to provide plaintiff with sufficient information so as to inform her of the alternative types of treatment available to treat her leg injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>To establish a <em>prima facie </em>case for medical negligence premised on a theory of liability for lack of informed consent, a plaintiff must show \u201c(1) the physician failed to comply with the applicable standard for disclosure; (2) the undisclosed risk occurred and harmed the plaintiff; (3) a reasonable person under the circumstances would not have consented and submitted to the operation or surgical procedure had he or she been so informed; and (4) the operation or surgical procedure was a proximate cause of plaintiffs injuries.\u201d <em>Bennett v. Surgidev Corp., </em>311 <em>N.J.Super. </em>567, 572-73, 710 A.2d 1023 (App.Div.1998) (citing <em>Largey, supra, </em>110 <em>N.J. </em>at 215, 540 A.2d 504; <em>Caputa v. Antiles, </em>296 <em>N.J.Super. </em>123, 133-34, 686 A.2d 356 (App.Div.1996), <em>certif denied, </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>143, 693 A.2d 112 (1997)); <em>see also Matthies v. Mastromonaco, </em>310 <em>N.J.Super. </em>572, 589, 709 A.2d 238 (App.Div.), <em>certif. granted, </em>156 <em>N.J. </em>406, 719 A.2d 638 (1998) (citing <em>Largey, supra, </em>110 <em>N.J. </em>at 206, 540 A.2d 504). It seems abundantly clear that plaintiffs expert provided a sufficient opinion, coupled with plaintiffs testimony, that defendant did not discuss with her an alternative form of treatment, i.e., surgery. As such, we conclude that plaintiff brought forth evidence supporting the claim that defendant failed to comply with the applicable standard for disclosure and supporting a <em>prima facie </em>case for negligence based on lack of informed consent. <em>Bennett, supra, </em>311 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 572, 710 A.2d 1023.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">To establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of negligence in a medical malpractice action alleging deviation from the standard of care, \u201ca plaintiff must present expert testimony establishing (1) the applicable standard of care; (2) a deviation from that standard of care; and (3) that the deviation proximately caused the injury.\u201d <em>Gardner, supra, </em>150 <em>N.J. </em>at 375, 696 A.2d 599 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">Thus, we can additionally conclude that defendant deviated from the applicable standard of care in providing information to his patient. Because plaintiff brought sufficient evidence to support a <em>prima facie </em>case for medical negligence based on both theories of liability \u2014 lack of informed consent and deviation from the stan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>dard of care \u2014 the trial judge should have refrained from granting defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss at the close of plaintiffs case.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">Even if the judge viewed plaintiffs complaint as deficient, a \u201cdeficient\u201d complaint that omits a specific legal theory may be remedied at trial by showing the appropriate proofs for the omitted theory. <em>Farese, supra, </em>237 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 390-92, 568 A.2d 89. Rather than grant defendant\u2019s motion for an involuntary dismissal at the close of plaintiffs case, <em>R. </em>4:37-2(b), the judge should have permitted plaintiff to amend her complaint to more specifically allege a theory of medical negligence encompassing a theory of liability based on lack of informed consent. We reach this conclusion despite the fact that at one point in the initial colloquy, plaintiffs counsel agreed with the judge\u2019s observation that plaintiffs cause of action was not one of informed consent. We fully recognize that counsel\u2019s agreement with the judge\u2019s observation occurred as an aside during plaintiffs testimony, well before counsel had fully presented the entirety of plaintiffs claim and prior to presenting plaintiffs expert\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">In sum, plaintiffs complaint, when liberally construed, did assert a medical negligence claim premised upon a theory of liability for lack of informed consent and plaintiffs entire case at the close of the testimony, when liberally construed, was sufficient to withstand defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss pursuant to <em>R. </em>4:37-2(b). <em>Dolson v.
