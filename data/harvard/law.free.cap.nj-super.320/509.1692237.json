Accordingly, we affirm the order denying summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">Plaintiff Crest-Foam manufactured and processed polyurethane and polyether foam in a facility in Moonachie, New Jersey, from 1965 to 1986. The facility consisted of three buildings. On December 1,1986, Crest-Foam entered an agreement to sell all of its outstanding stock to Leggett &amp; Platt Foam Acquisition Company (L &amp; P) which \u201ctriggered\u201d application of the Environmental Cleanup Responsibility Act (ECRA), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:lK-6 to -14 then in effect.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In order to comply with ECRA, Environmental Resources Management Inc. (ERM) was retained to conduct a comprehensive environmental site audit of the facility. An initial report by ERM, dated November 25, 1986, indicated that the site \u201cmay have potential environmental problems. Potential long-term environmental problems could stem from ground water contamination by the dry wells and the underground \u2018salvage\u2019 tank.\u201d ERM prepared a second report embodying its Probable Opinion of Remediation Cost, dated December 24, 1986, also indicating that there may be ground water contamination beneath the site. The report stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-7\">Subsurface investigation and sampling program revealed significant contamination of ground water and soils in the area adjacent to the drum storage area at Building No. 1....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-8\">Ground water contamination at Building No. 1 is assumed to have moved beyond the property boundaries and a 10 year treatment effort is required.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-9\">The report also indicated that additional subsurface investigation would be necessary to determine the extent of the contamination. The estimated cost for remediation ranged from $900,000 to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>$1,600,000. Under ECRA, plaintiff was required to conduct an environmental investigation and take any necessary remedial action as a condition of the sale. <em>N.J.S.A, </em>13:lK-9 (repealed).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">On December 30, 1986, plaintiff entered into an ACO with the NJDEP. The ACO stated that Crest-Foam \u201cshall initiate, complete, and submit to NJDEP the results from any NJDEPapproved Sampling Plan\u201d and Crest-Foam \u201cshall implement any NJDEP-approved Cleanup Plans in accordance with the approved time schedule or defer implementation of all or part of the Cleanup Plan(s) subject to NJDEP approval____\u201d As part of the ACO, plaintiff was required to provide \u201cfinancial assurance\u201d in the amount of $1,000,000 subject to amendment upon NJDEP approval of a cleanup plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">Pursuant to the ACO, plaintiff retained First Environment Inc. as its clean-up plan consultants, and submitted a sampling plan to NJDEP for approval. On March 15, 1988, NJDEP issued a conditional approval of the plan. Plaintiff thereafter conducted soil sampling, installed five shallow ground water wells and sampled existing monitoring wells. A report containing ECRA Sampling Plan Results was filed with NJDEP on September 1, 1988. According to the sampling plan report, there was both \u201csoil[ ] and groundwater\u201d contamination outside two of the buildings.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">As of May 1996, a \u201cfinal\u201d clean-up plan for the site had not been approved by NJDEP. In June 1995, NJDEP required plaintiff to analyze whether any contamination had \u201cspread off-site.\u201d NJDEP requested further study of the issue before a clean-up plan could be approved. Development of a remediation plan thereafter continued, and cost estimates for cleanup ranged from $2,200,000 to $2,700,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-9\">In the interim plaintiff sought indemnification for the clean-up costs from its insurers. Defendant Hartford had issued four general liability policies covering the period May 1982 to May 1986. Each provided coverage of $1,000,000 for property damage. The basic terms of all four policies are the same, and provided that \u201cthe company will pay on behalf of the insured all sums which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>the insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages because of ... property damage ... to which this insurance applies, caused by an occurrence.... \u201d The policies define an \u201coccurrence\u201d as \u201cproperty damage neither expected nor intended from the standpoint of the insured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">Each of the policies also contained a \u201cno action\u201d clause which provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-7\">No action shall lie against the company unless, as a condition precedent thereto, there shall have been full compliance with all of the terms of this policy, nor until the amount of the insured\u2019s obligation to pay shall have been finally determined either by judgment against the insured after actual trial or by written agreement of the insured, the claimant and the Company.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">On September 17, 1991, plaintiff notified Hartford that it was seeking coverage for cleanup costs at the site. Plaintiffs letter to Hartford stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-9\">[Crest-Foam] has been required by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection to address soil and groundwater contamination at its former facility in Moonachie, New Jersey. In order to comply with this requirement, Crest-Foam Corporation has incurred substantial costs and will continue to do so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-10\">This letter is being sent to advise you of this loss and to request that you defend and indemnify Crest-Foam Corporation to the extent of its policy limits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-11\">Hartford responded by letter dated September 25,1991, indicating that it did not think the facts presented a \u201ccovered loss\u201d but requested additional information. The letter requested the information \u201c[i]n order to evaluate this claim you have made for coverage.\u201d The letter also stated \u201c[t]his is to advise you that The Hartford is presently in the process of reviewing the claims against Crest Foam Corp____to determine whether and to what extent the policies issued by The Hartford provide coverage for such claims.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b543-14\">On January 17, 1992, plaintiff provided Hartford with the additional information it had requested. On January 24, 1992, Hartford again responded by writing that it \u201cdid not consider this a covered loss\u201d but again sought additional information to evaluate the issue. Hartford stated \u201c[t]he information so far reviewed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>indicates that Crest Foam had knowledge of this problem in 1986 but did not notify Hartford until 9/21/91.\u201d The author also stated he was \u201cextremely concerned that the late reporting has compromised Hartford\u2019s position.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">After receiving no response to this request, Hartford wrote to plaintiff on October 9, 1992, again requesting information. Without receiving an express \u201cdenial\u201d from Hartford, plaintiff filed this action in February 1993 seeking a \u201cdeclaratory judgment\u201d (count one) and, <em>inter alia, </em>a declaration of rights, \u201crecovery\u201d and indemnification based on \u201cbreach of contract\u201d (count two).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">In January 1996, Judge Marguerite T. Simon granted plaintiff partial summary judgment on the grounds that the ECRA cleanup costs were \u201c \u2018damages\u2019 for which plaintiff is legally obligated to pay\u201d for purposes of coverage under the Hartford policies and because the ACO was not an obligation \u201cvoluntarily\u201d assumed for purposes of a policy exclusion. Thereafter, Hartford moved for summary judgment in June 1996, on the basis that plaintiffs action was barred by the six-year statute of limitations. According to Hartford the claim was barred by plaintiffs failure to bring suit within six years of its discovery of ground water contamination and execution of the ACO. Judge Simon denied Hartford\u2019s motion \u201cwithout prejudice.\u201d She found that the knowledge of ground water contamination in 1986 and the signing of the ACO were not sufficient to trigger the running of the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">Hartford renewed its motion for summary judgment in May 1998 based upon then recently decided case law to the effect that the insured\u2019s cause of action accrues when the insured discovers the contamination that is the basis for its claim. The motion was denied by Judge Martin J. Kole, who found that, although Hartford advised that it did not consider the claim a covered loss, \u201cthe request for additional information\u201d \u201cgave Crest-Foam a reasonable basis for assuming\u201d that Hartford would reconsider its position. He concluded that the statute of limitations therefore \u201ceither tolled or should not be applied here as a matter of fairness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>and justice.\u201d Judge Kole further held that, in any event, the statute of limitations only begins to run when \u201cthe insurer declines to pay the insured\u2019s claim,\u201d and since Hartford did not deny coverage and \u201cbreach[ ] its insurance contract with Crest Foam by denying coverage\u201d until it answered the declaratory judgment complaint, the action was not barred by the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">In New Jersey, causes of action based on contractual claims must be brought within six years \u201cafter the cause of any such action shall have accrued.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:14-l.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The general rule is that the statute of limitations applicable to contracts governs insurance actions as well. <em>Breen v. New Jersey Mfrs. Indemn. Ins. Co., </em>105 <em>N.J.Super. </em>302, 309, 252 A.2d 49 (Law Div.1969), <em>aff'd, </em>109 <em>N.J.Super. </em>473, 263 A.2d 802 (App.Div.1970). Thus, \u201c[a]bsent a provision in the insurance policy or an express statute to the contrary, the statute of limitations applicable to a suit on a policy of insurance\u201d is six years. <em>Walkowitz v. Royal Globe Ins. Co., </em>149 <em>N.J.Super. </em>442, 448, 374 A.2d 40 (App.Div.), <em>certif. dismissed, </em>75 <em>N.J. </em>584, 384 A.2d 815 (1977). To that end, Hartford contends that the complaint is time barred because the action accrued at the latest in 1986 when the ACO was executed. Plaintiff, however, contends that, even if there was a known basis for coverage at that time, its \u201ccause of action did not accrue until defendant breached its contractual obligation to pay for clean-up costs\u201d and, in any event, the six-year period has been extended by the policy\u2019s \u201cno action\u201d clause. According to plaintiff, \u201c[u]nder Hartford\u2019s \u2018no action\u2019 clause, Crest-Foam is not entitled to file suit against Hartford until there is either a final judgment or an agreement setting forth the <em>amount </em>of damages against it.\u201d Defendant insists, however, \u201cthat the no-action clause is inapplica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>ble on its face\u201d because \u201c[b]y its terms, the no action clause has no application <em>except </em>in situations where there are formal legal proceedings which will result in a final adjudication of the insured\u2019s obligation to pay \u2018either by judgment ... after trial or by written agreement of the insured, the claimant and the company,\u201d\u2019 and here there can \u201cbe no such final adjudication against Crest-Foam because its liability was established as a matter of law and because Crest-Foam voluntarily agreed to cooperate with NJDEP by signing the ACO without Hartford\u2019s consent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">Justice (then Judge) Francis has described the purpose of the so-called \u201cno action\u201d clause, such as the one at issue here, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-5\">The basic purposes of this language are (1) to avoid joinder of the insurance company by the injured person in the damage action against the insured, and (2) to prevent suit against the carrier by the injured person or the insured until the <em>Damages </em>have been fixed by final judgment after trial of that action or by proper agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-6\"><em>[Condenser Serv. &amp; Eng\u2019g Co., Inc. v. American Mut. Liab. Ins. Co., </em>45 <em>N.J.Super. </em>31, 41, 131 A.2d 409 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>24 <em>N.J. </em>547, 133 A.2d 395 (1957).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">Thus, the terms of the \u201cno-action\u201d clause are generally seen as \u201cconditions precedent to the insured\u2019s right of action against its carrier,\u201d <em>Bacon v. American Ins. Co., </em>131 <em>N.J.Super. </em>450, 459, 330 A.2d 389 (Law Div.1974), <em>aff'd, </em>138 <em>N.J.Super. </em>550, 351 A.2d 771 (App.Div.1976), and \u201c[i]n the event that the insured does not have either judgment or settlement and nonetheless commences suit against the insurer, the carrier can set up the failure to comply with the [no-aetion] condition as a defense.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">However, as Justice Francis further explained, the \u201cno action\u201d clause \u201cwas never intended to serve nor can it be construed to serve, the purpose of avoiding a declaration of rights when the insurer allegedly has repudiated the contract and declined to furnish an agreed defense of a covered damage action.\u201d <em>Condenser Serv., supra, </em>45 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 41, 131 A.2d 409. <em>See also Kielb v. Couch, </em>149 <em>N.J.Super. </em>522, 528, 374 A.2d 79 (Law Div.1977), in which the court noted that a \u201cno action\u201d clause \u201cmay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>not be utilized as a bar to a declaratory judgment action instituted to adjudicate issues of coverage and defense.\u201d <em>Accord McNally v. Providence Washington Ins. Co., </em>304 <em>N.J.Super. </em>83, 90-91, 698 A.2d 543 (App.Div.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">Here \u201cthe <em>[djamages </em>have [not] been fixed by final judgment after trial ... or by proper settlement,\u201d <em>Condenser Serv., supra, </em>45 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 41, 131 A.2d 409, but the insured\u2019s rights can be adjudicated in a declaratory judgment action.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Moreover, the \u201cno-action\u201d clause prevents the defendant from asserting the statute of limitations as a defense to the claim for indemnification. In the absence of specific definitions in a policy, the words used by the insurer must be accorded their plain, ordinary and commonly understood meaning in order to fulfill the reasonable expectations of the insured, <em>e.g., Property Casualty Co. of MCA v. Conway, </em>147 <em>N.J. </em>322, 326-27, 687 A.2d 729 (1997); <em>Morton Int\u2019l Inc. v. General Accident Ins. Co. of Am., </em>134 <em>N.J. </em>1, 27, 629 A.2d 831 (1993), <em>cert. denied, sub. nom. Insurance Co. of N. Am. v. Morton Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>512 <em>U.S. </em>1245, 114 <em>S.Ct. </em>2764, 129 L.Ed.2d 878 (1994); <em>Lansco, Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Envtl. Protection, </em>138 <em>N.J.Super. </em>275, 281-82, 350 A.2d 520 (Ch.Div.1975), <em>aff'd, </em>145 <em>N.J.Super. </em>433, 368 A.2d 363 (App.Div.1976), <em>certif. denied, </em>73 <em>N.J. </em>57, 372 A.2d 322 (1977), and defendant offers no reasonable meaning or construction of the \u201cno-action\u201d clause other than one that requires the insured to wait until the terms of the clause are satisfied before filing an action. On this record, those terms have not been met, so the statute of limitations cannot provide a defense to the action. <em>See Kielb v. Couch, supra, </em>149 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 529, 374 A.2d 79 (only after \u201ctermination of the third party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>action\u201d against the insured and \u201cthe totality of his claim ... was ascertainable and his right of action complete\u201d could the insured successfully \u201cwithstand a defense based upon the \u2018no action\u2019 clause in the policy\u201d so that the statute of limitations could pose no bar); <em>Bacon, supra, </em>131 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 458, 330 A.2d 389 (where, in interpreting a no-action clause in a dispute between the insured and the carrier, the court noted that \u201c[a]bsent the presentation of proofs in a court of competent jurisdiction and a finding by the court or jury of liability, it cannot be said that the [insured] is \u2018legally obligated\u2019 to pay damages\u201d). <em>See also Diamond Shamrock Chem. v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., </em>258 <em>N.J.Super. </em>167, 250-51, 609 A.2d 440 (App.Div.1992), <em>certif. denied, </em>134 <em>N.J. </em>481, 634 A.2d 528 (1993); <em>cf. McNally v. Providence Washington Ins. Co., supra, </em>304 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 91-92, 698 A.2d 543. Hence, the declaratory judgment action is a viable method of establishing plaintiffs rights under a policy with a \u201cno action\u201d clause, and unless the time provided in the clause is triggered as expressly provided therein, the statute of limitations cannot be asserted as a defense. In essence, the \u201cno action\u201d clause may prevent or delay an action for indemnification, but it also prevents the assertion of the statute of limitations defense to a declaratory judgment action before it is triggered and for six years thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">Defendant cites our recent decision in <em>Metex Corp. v. Federal Ins. Co., </em>290 <em>N.J.Super. </em>95, 104-05, 675 A.2d 220 (App.Div.1996), for the proposition that the insured\u2019s strict liability \u201cattaches\u201d under the Spill Act, <em>N.J.S.A </em>58:10-23.11 to -23.11z, \u201conce [the] insured is on notice\u201d of a discharge.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It also cites <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number><em>Summit Assoc.

Defendant argues that the statute of limitations must, therefore, run from discovery of the contamination. We also recognize \u201cthat for purposes of a general liability policy, groundwater should not be considered property \u2018owned by the insured,\u201d and that coverage is triggered by the \u201cdamages\u201d or expense of an ECRA investigation, monitoring and remediation as well as a third party action, including one by the State or the NJDEP, relating to the groundwater contamination. <em>Strnad v. North River Ins. Co., </em>292 <em>N.J.Super. </em>476, 482, 679 A.2d 166 (App.Div.1996). <em>See also Ohaus v. Continental Casualty Ins.

Co., </em>283 <em>N.J.Super. </em>411, 419-20, 662 A.2d 562 (App.Div.1995). However, in these cases no issue regarding the impact of a \u201cno action\u201d clause was involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">In <em>Metex, </em>the insured manufacturer sued its liability carriers for a declaratory judgment and contract damages following DEP\u2019s proposal that it and DEP enter into a memorandum of agreement regarding the insured\u2019s cleanup of the site. <em>Metex, supra, </em>290 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 98-99, 675 A.2d 220. <em>Metex </em>made no mention of a \u201cno-action\u201d clause in the policy, and in finding that the insured\u2019s liability did not turn on NJDEP\u2019s \u201cknowledge or enforcement efforts,\u201d we indicated that there was nothing in the policy language which conditioned the insured\u2019s liability or the defendant\u2019s coverage on some third-party action or judgment. Writing for the court, Judge Villanueva pointed out:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>the language of an insurance policy is to be given its plain meaning in order to fulfill the objectively reasonable expectations of a policy holder, <em>Morton Int'l, Inc. v.

Accident &amp; Casualty Ins. Co., </em>35 <em>N.J. </em>1, 8,170 A.2d 800 (1961). Here, the language of Federal\u2019s primary CGL insurance policy does not require any \u201cenforcement,\u201d \u201cclaim\u201d or \u201csuit\u201d by a third party in order to entitle the plaintiff to coverage. Since there is nothing in the policy so limiting coverage, a reasonable insured would assume that it is equally as legally obligated to comply with statutory mandates as it is to comply with an administrative directive or a court decree; in other words, the source of the legal obligation is of no consequence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-5\"><em>[Id. </em>at 104, 675 A.2d 220.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">The significance of <em>Metex, </em>therefore, includes its reference to the impact of the policy language with respect to the commencement of an action.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">In <em>Federal Ins. Co. v. Purex Indus., Inc., </em>972 <em>F.Supp. </em>872 (D.N.J.1997), a liability carrier brought a declaratory judgment action against its insured for clarification of its responsibilities regarding the insured\u2019s environmental cleanup responsibilities under ECRA. <em>Id. </em>at 876. There, as here, the insured had entered into an ACO with NJDEP in order to effectuate the sale of the subject site to another party. <em>Ibid. </em>The insured filed a counterclaim \u201cseekfing] a declaration that the insurers [had] a duty to defend and indemnify [it] for all losses, liabilities and expenses arising from its clean up\u201d obligation. The carriers asserted the New Jersey statute of limitations as a defense because more than six years passed following execution of the ACO. <em>Id. </em>at 879. The insured insisted, however, that because its cleanup liabilities were \u201cnot yet fully resolved\u201d and the administrative proceeding with NJDEP had \u201cnot yet concluded,\u201d the cause of action had not \u201caccrued.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">In rejecting the statute of limitations defense, Judge Simandle wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-9\">The court finds that [the insured\u2019s] claim is not untimely under New Jersey\u2019s six year statute of limitations. The insurers\u2019 claim that the liability of [the insured] was finally determined by the signing of the ACO is unpersuasive. The ACO merely required testing of environmental conditions and remediation of contamination that might be discovered. In other words, liability was not finally determined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>at this point because any liability was contingent upon the discovery of contamination. Reports of contamination at the ... site were not confirmed until ... [a date within the statute of limitations].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-6\">The claims against [the insured] by the NJDEP under ECRA remain unresolved. Although [the insured] has submitted a cleanup plan and begun remediation under the plan, it insists that the NJDEP may still modify the plan or bring suit under a number of environmental statutes. Summary judgment will thus be denied on the grounds of the statute of limitations as the insurers have not proved as a matter of law that the counterclaims asserted by [the insured] were untimely.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-7\"><em>[Id. </em>at 880.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">Plaintiffs arguments are similar in this case. Furthermore, the <em>Purex </em>court went on to describe \u201can alternative theory not mentioned by the parties\u201d under which the insured\u2019s claims would also have been timely \u2014 \u201cthat the declaratory claim accrues when the insured\u2019s claim for coverage is denied on the merits, in alleged breach of the contract of insurance.\u201d <em>Ibid.; see also Southland Corp. v. Ashland Oil, Inc., </em>696 <em>F.Supp. </em>994, 1003-04 (D.N.J.1988). According to Judge Simandle:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-9\">Such a construction makes sense if the insurer is concerned about an indefinite length of future risk in a remediation process that may consume years before the full extent is known. In the present case, this construction is of no avail to the insurers, which did not deny coverage on the merits of [the insured\u2019s] claims until after this suit was filed____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-10\">\n<em>[Ibid.]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-11\">The same is true here, as Judge Kole noted, and independent of the fact that the \u201cno action\u201d clause prevents utilization of the statute of limitations defense, in these circumstances defendant cannot contend that the cause of action accrued before it wrote its letter denying coverage.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b551-12\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-13\">The order under review is affirmed, and the matter is remanded to the Law Division for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b541-10\"> Defendant Hartford is the only surviving defendant in the action.
