(Not Raised Below)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-8\"><em>POINT III </em>THE IMPOSITION OF CONSECUTIVE SENTENCES FOR RELATED OFFENSES, WITHOUT A STATEMENT OF REASONS, WAS MANIFESTLY EXCESSIVE.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-9\">We conclude that the trial judge erred in excusing a juror during deliberations and, accordingly, reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-10\">The pertinent facts are as follows. In June, 1990, 81-year-old Lucy Pascale was killed by manual strangulation. Her children, who found the body, also discovered that their mother\u2019s bedroom had been ransacked. Defendant, a maintenance man in the victim\u2019s building, was originally among the suspects, but the police had no sufficient basis upon which to make an arrest. Defendant and an accomplice were arrested about six years later, following a tip to the police from an informant. With the benefit of the <em>Miranda </em><footnotemark>*</footnotemark> warnings, defendant gave the police a statement which included some specific details about the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-11\">At trial, defendant alleged not only that his statement to the police had been coerced by means of physical force, but also that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>the police told him what to say in his statement. Defendant\u2019s accomplice, who had pled guilty to conspiracy and burglary, also made an allegation of physical coercion when he was cross-examined by defense counsel. A police officer who was present at the interrogation denied the assertions.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">The allegation of police coercion had an impact on the jury\u2019s deliberations. Fifty-five minutes after deliberations had begun, the judge received a message from one of the jurors stating: \u201cDuring the first few minutes of the deliberations, [Juror number eight] stated his relative told him that police often beat accused criminals.\u201d Juror number eight had disclosed on <em>voir dire </em>that he had a cousin who was a police detective.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">Following receipt of the note, the trial judge interviewed juror number eight individually in chambers, on the record, with counsel present, concerning the reported incident in the jury room. The juror stated that his comments had been blown out of proportion, but that whatever statement he had made flowed more from \u201cwhat I have experienced personally growing up\u201d than from conversations with his cousin. After some colloquy with counsel out of the juror\u2019s presence and a further interview with the juror on his capacity to decide the facts based upon the evidence alone, which the juror said he could do, the trial judge determined that juror number eight would be excused. The trial judge had opined that the juror was \u201cinterjecting his own experiences [into the deliberations, and] that is not what jurors are supposed to do, they\u2019re supposed to decide the case based upon what the evidence is in the case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">The trial judge then interviewed three other jurors individually in chambers, also with counsel present. The juror who had sent the note related what had occurred during deliberations to cause him to write it. The foreperson was next. She also, in somewhat less detail, described what had transpired in the jury room to precipitate the note. The trial judge then asked her if she could decide the matter solely upon the evidence free from extraneous influence. An affirmative response was given. Juror number two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>was next. He verified that one juror had related what he had been told by a police officer relative, and indicated that, notwithstanding, he could discharge his juror responsibilities fairly and based solely upon the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">In an ensuing colloquy with counsel alone, after the trial judge restated his intention to excuse juror number eight and impanel an alternate, defense counsel moved for a mistrial. The motion was denied. The entire remaining jury panel was then brought into the courtroom and heard a reinstruetion from the judge about the jury\u2019s general duty to decide the issues based upon the evidence, with a concluding question whether each individual could \u201cdecide this case based solely on what you have heard in the courtroom, putting aside any extraneous materials that somebody may have told you in the jury room.\u201d Each juror when addressed individually for a response answered in the affirmative. An alternate was then impaneled and the matter was resubmitted to the jury with a supplemental charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">After reviewing the record, we conclude that the procedures employed by the trial judge to deal with the problem presented amounted to an undue intrusion upon the jury\u2019s deliberations, and that the method he chose to resolve the matter was erroneous. Accordingly, the convictions that resulted must be vacated, and the matter remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article I, paragraph 10 of the New Jersey Constitution guarantee the right to trial by an impartial jury, <em>ie. </em>an unbiased jury that renders a verdict only on the basis of the evidence presented in court, not extraneous material such as outsiders\u2019 communications or rumors that circulate within the jury itself. <em>State v. Williams, </em>93 <em>N.J. </em>39, 60-61, 459 A.2d 641 (1983). If juror bias is discovered or the jury\u2019s deliberations have been tainted by the introduction of extraneous material, the correct remedy depends on the stage of the proceedings that has been reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>Before deliberations commence, discharge and substitution of any \u201coffending\u201d juror may be warranted if the court determines that the remaining jurors can set aside the extraneous material and decide the case on the basis of the evidence. <em>State v. Hightower, </em>146 <em>N.J. </em>239, 254, 680 A.2d 649 (1996) (quoting <em>State v. Trent, </em>157 <em>N.J.Super. </em>231, 239, 384 A.2d 888 (App.Div.1978), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>79 <em>N.J. </em>251, 398 A.2d 1271 (1979)); <em>State v. Nelson, </em>318 <em>N.J.Super. </em>242, 723 A.2d 627 (App.Div.1999). Once the case has been given to the jury, however, discharge and substitution is no longer appropriate when juror bias, outside influences, or problems arising in the interaction between jurors are discovered. In such instances, once the court determines that a taint exists, it must discharge the entire jury, <em>i.e., </em>declare a mistrial. Substitution of one juror for another, to address a problem that arises after deliberations have commenced, is not among the choices available to the trial judge, except in limited circumstances. <em>Hightower, supra, </em>146 <em>N.J. </em>at 254, 255-56, 680 A.2d 649 (quoting <em>Trent, supra, </em>157 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 239, 384 A.2d 888).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">To ensure the jury\u2019s protection from interference on the part of the judge, the remedy of discharge and substitution during deliberations is permitted only in those instances where a juror falls ill or is otherwise unable to continue for strictly personal reasons. <em>R. </em>l:8-2(d). With respect to the question when a juror may be deemed \u201cunable to continue,\u201d the New Jersey Supreme Court has held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-7\">a juror cannot be discharged as \u201cunable to continue\u201d unless the record adequately establishes that the juror suffers from an inability to function that is personal and unrelated to the interaction with the other jury members.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-8\">We emphasize ... that the fundamental right of fair trial and impartial jury deliberations must be zealously protected____ That protection is not ensured when a court discharges a juror under circumstances that bring into question the integrity of the jury\u2019s deliberative function.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-11\"><em>[State v. Valenzuela, </em>136 <em>N.J. </em>458, 643 A.2d 582 (1994) (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>The facts of <em>Trent, supra, </em>157 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 231, 384 A.2d 888, are instructive in this regard. In that case, one juror so strongly identified the defendant with her son that she became upset and ill during deliberations. <em>Id. </em>at 236, 384 A.2d 888. The judge discharged the juror and replaced her with an alternate juror. <em>Id. </em>at 237, 384 A.2d 888. We affirmed, holding that the juror\u2019s personal feelings, which physically incapacitated her, were sufficient grounds to excuse her from the jury. <em>Id. </em>at 240, 384 A.2d 888.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">By contrast, <em>Hightower, supra, </em>146 <em>N.J. </em>at 239, 680 A.2d 649, presented circumstances that did not merit removal of a juror. In that capital murder case, during penalty phase deliberations, one juror told the others that the victim had children, a fact that had previously been withheld from the jury. <em>Id. </em>at 250, 680 A.2d 649. After exploring the circumstances, the trial court removed the one juror and proceeded with an alternate juror instead. <em>Ibid. </em>The Supreme Court held that this was error because the reason for removal of the juror did not concern exclusively personal circumstances, as it must. The Court declared:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-6\">When a jury is exposed to extraneous information after deliberations have begun, a mistrial will almost always be required.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A5x\">[Id. at 264, 680 <em>A.2d </em>649.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">The case before us is factually congruent with <em>Hightower, </em>and we therefore conclude that here, also, the trial court erred in substituting a juror instead of declaring a mistrial. Indeed, it is questionable whether juror number eight\u2019s statement amounted to \u201cextraneous material\u201d at all. At least to the extent that that juror made general observations based on his own experiences with police conduct or his own attitudes concerning it, such observations may be viewed as reflections on the credibility of the State\u2019s witnesses and the sufficiency of its proofs, subsumed within a juror\u2019s right to make experience-based judgments in these connections. Viewed thusly, such observations are at the very heart of the jury function and should be free from interference. <em>See State v. Athorn, </em>46 <em>N.J. </em>247, 251-52, 216 A.2d 369, <em>cert. denied, </em>384 <em>U.S. </em>962, 86 <em>S.Ct. </em>1589, 16 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>674 (1966) (upholding jury verdict because juror\u2019s statements, during deliberations, that \u201ccops take <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>bribes\u201d demonstrated a shared experience rather than bias against a defendant police officer).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">However, even if the juror\u2019s statements constituted extraneous material, any inability to continue on his part was due, not to his personal circumstances, but rather to the threat he was seen to pose to the integrity of the process. The case law is clear that in such an instance, especially where the extraneous material has already intruded into the jury\u2019s deliberative processes, a mistrial, rather than substitution is indicated. If a court finds \u2014 as the trial judge here must be taken to have found \u2014 that the deliberative process has been tainted by improper influences, it cannot hope to save the trial by substitution; a mistrial must follow. If there had been no taint sufficient to warrant a mistrial, then there was no basis for removal of the juror at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">We conclude that the measure employed by the trial judge compounded the problem it sought to address. By dismissing a juror who arguably had done nothing more than voice an opinion about the quality of the evidence, the judge controlled the jury\u2019s deliberations in a manner that requires reversal. <em>See State v. Harvey, </em>318 <em>N.J.Super. </em>167, 173-75, 723 A.2d 107 (App.Div.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">Our reversal of the conviction renders the remaining points on appeal moot. We add a word about the unacceptable behavior of the prosecutor, however.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-9\">In his summation, defense counsel asserted that the inconsistency of the evidence warranted an acquittal, especially in the light of the allegations of police brutality. In response, the prosecutor argued that defense counsel\u2019s comments about police brutality were</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-10\">lawyer talk to divide us somehow, maybe to make us think of something else, but that\u2019s only lawyer talk____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-12\">Let me tell you what lawyers can do. Lawyers can, any time they want, have a response to a certain answer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>We have got an answer for everything. Whatever comes up, the lawyers have a spin they can put on it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-5\">^ i}: sj:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-6\">Whatever answer [witnesses] give you, the lawyers can make a big deal out of it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AjZ\">This type of disparaging remark is highly improper. A prosecutor must limit his summation to commenting on the evidence of record and the inferences that may reasonably be drawn therefrom. <em>State v. Farrell, </em>61 <em>N.J. </em>99, 103, 293 A.2d 176 (1972). <em>Ad hominem </em>attacks on defense counsel in particular or on defense lawyers in general are not acceptable. <em>State v. Thornton, </em>38 <em>N.J. </em>380, 398, 185 A.2d 9 (1962), <em>cert. denied, </em>374 <em>U.S. </em>816, 83 <em>S.Ct. </em>1710, 10 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>1039 (1963); <em>State v. Sherman, </em>230 <em>N.J.Super. </em>10, 552 A.2d 621 (App.Div.1988). While the prosecutor\u2019s right to argue his case vigorously is beyond question, it is also undisputed that \u201c[t]he primary duty of a lawyer engaged in public prosecution is not to convict, but to see that justice is done.\u201d <em>Canons of Professional Ethics of the American Bar Association, </em>Canon 5. Critical interests of our adversarial system are disserved when the State\u2019s attorney seeks to elevate his position in the eyes of the jury by disparaging the role of defense counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">A comment on the sentence imposed is also appropriate. Although an extended term on the robbery count was well warranted, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-3(a), we question the imposition of consecutive terms without an explanation of why consecutiveness was indicated in the circumstances which had been developed. The offenses here involved a single victim and may be seen to have occurred so closely together in time and place, that they may not be subject to characterization as predominantly independent. <em>See State v. Yarbough, </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>627, 643-46, 498 A.2d 1239 (1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>475 <em>U.S. </em>1014, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>1193, 89 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>308 (1986). Further, the SNSF assessment ordered, in the total amount of $150, was improper because the date of the offense, June 1, 1990, preceded the date when the statute authorizing the SNSF became <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>effective, August 3,1993. Because retroactive application of criminal penalties is not permitted, <em>State v. J.F., </em>262 <em>N.J.Super. </em>539, 542, 621 A.2d 520 (App.Div.1993), the SNSF assessment was without a foundation in law.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b392-12\"><em> Miranda v.
