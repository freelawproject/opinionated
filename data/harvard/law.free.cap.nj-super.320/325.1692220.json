The stop led to a charge of driving while intoxicated (DWI). The primary issue presented by this appeal is whether the police officer\u2019s action can be sustained as part of the community caretaking function based on his testimony that he stopped the vehicle for two reasons \u2014 the orders and his concern \u201cfor why the vehicle was stopped for such a period of time at the green light.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b354-13\">Defendant pled guilty in municipal court to DWI, <em>N.J.S.A </em>39:4-50.1, preserving his right to test on appeal the validity of the officer\u2019s stop of the vehicle. The Law Division, in a de novo trial on the record below of the suppression hearing, agreed with the municipal court and independently determined that the stop was valid community caretaking. We disagree and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">The facts are not in dispute. At approximately 4:24 a.m., on September 5, 1997, a uniformed police officer was traveling eastbound on Columbia Turnpike in a marked police car. At the intersection with James Street, the officer pulled up behind defendant\u2019s vehicle, a Toyota Land Cruiser, which was stopped in the left-hand turning lane for the red light. Because the rear windows were tinted, all he could see were the silhouetted figures of two people in the Toyota. Using his mobil data terminal,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the officer determined that there was nothing out of the ordinary with respect to the vehicle. When the light turned green, the defendant\u2019s vehicle remained stationary for approximately five seconds and then \u201cproceeded to make the left-hand turn very slowly.\u201d The officer followed for about 100 feet, then activated his emergency lights and stopped defendant in a parking lot near the comer. There were no other vehicles on the road at this early-morning hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">The officer explained that there had been an unusually large number of burglaries in the area, and the police force was \u201crunning an extra patrol\u201d looking for burglars. The patrol officers were instructed to be particularly observant for vehicles containing more than one person, and they were also told that \u201cthere were stolen vehicles possibly being used.... \u201d He further explained the general orders in this manner:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-8\">[T]he orders I got from our detective lieutenant were we were to check <em>out </em>\u2014 stop any vehicle that basically moved within ... the Borough and we did accordingly. We stopped ... approximately 50 to 100 cars____ [It] .. is not normal for us to stop every car. It was a special detail designed by the Detective Bureau and that also filtered down onto the .. road guys.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-11\">The officer was asked, \u201cSo any vehicle you saw from midnight until the end of your detail at 7:00 [a.m.] you pulled over?\u201d The officer answered, \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>When he was asked why he had stopped defendant\u2019s vehicle, the officer conceded that there was no indication that this vehicle had been involved in a burglary and said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-5\">My purpose in signaling the stop was ... for two reasons. I was concerned for why the vehicle was stopped for such a period of time at the green light, and I was also inquisitive about the vehicle in relation to the burglaries. We were stopping every car. So I was just performing my duty as far as I was told by our detective lieutenant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">The officer also explained his action by noting that when the vehicle did not move after the light changed, \u201cI was suspicious as to \u2014 I wanted to get some information about the vehicle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">The State contends that this motor vehicle stop may be sustained under the community caretaking function. <em>Cady v. Dombrowski, </em>413 <em>U.S. </em>433, 441, 93 <em>S.Ct. </em>2523, 2528, 37 L.Ed.2d 706, 714-15 (1973). The Law Division judge, although noting that the case presented a \u201cvery close call,\u201d accepted that theory. An appellate court is required to give considerable deference to a judge\u2019s factfinding, <em>see, e.g., State v. Locurto, </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>463, 470-72, 724 A.2d 234 (1999), but we are not obliged to give deference to the judge\u2019s legal conclusions, <em>State v. Brown, </em>118 <em>N.J. </em>595, 604, 573 A.2d 886 (1990); <em>Manalapan Realty v. Township Committee, </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>366, 378, 658 A.2d 1230 (1995) (\u201cA trial court\u2019s interpretation of the law and the legal consequences that flow from established facts are not entitled to any special deference.\u201d) In this case, as we have noted, the facts are undisputed, and we accept the judge\u2019s findings in that regard. However, we differ with respect to the legal consequences that flow from those facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-9\">We first addressed the community caretaking theory in <em>State v. Goetaski, </em>209 <em>N.J.Super. </em>362, 507 A.2d 751 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>104 <em>N.J. </em>458, 517 A.2d 443 (1986). In that case, the officer observed the defendant at about 4 a.m. driving slowly on the shoulder of a rural state highway. <em>Id. </em>at 363, 507 A.2d 751. The speed limit was fifty miles per hour. <em>Ibid. </em>The defendant\u2019s left-turn signal was blinking. <em>Ibid. </em>The officer stopped the vehicle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>after watching it proceed in that manner for a tenth of a mile. <em>Ibid. </em>When the officer approached the car and talked with the driver, he made observations that led to a DWI charge. <em>Ibid. </em>We defined the issue as whether those circumstances provided a \u201csufficient reason for the officer to stop defendant and inquire generally if there was any <em>problem or difficulty.\u201d Id. </em>at 364, 507 A.2d 751 (emphasis added). We sustained the stop, even though no motor vehicle law had been violated, because \u201cthe facts were unusual enough for the time and place to warrant the closer scrutiny of a momentary investigative stop and inquiry.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 366, 507 A.2d 751. But we also said, \u201cwe do not hesitate to add that this stop is about as close to the constitutional line as we can condone.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">We returned to the community caretaking issue in <em>State v. Martinez, </em>260 <em>N.J.Super. </em>75, 615 A.2d 279 (App.Div.1992), also a DWI case. A state trooper observed Martinez driving, at 2 a.m., less than ten miles per hour in a residential twenty-five mile per hour zone. <em>Id. </em>at 77, 615 A.2d 279. He described the vehicle as proceeding \u201cat a snail\u2019s pace,\u201d which he considered abnormally slow. <em>Ibid. </em>After following for a time not set out in the opinion, the officer stopped Martinez and made the observations leading to the DWI charge. <em>Ibid. </em>We sustained the stop and made these comments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-7\">We take notice, however, that operation of a motor vehicle in the middle of the night on a residential street at a snail\u2019s pace between five and ten m.p.h. is indeed \u201cabnormal,\u201d as the Trooper testified. Such abnormal conduct suggests a number of objectively reasonable concerns: (a) something might be wrong with the ear; (b) something might be wrong with its driver; (c) a traffic safety hazard is presented to drivers approaching from the rear when an abnormally slow moving vehicle is operated at night on a roadway without flashers; (d) there is some risk that the residential neighborhood is being \u201ccased\u201d for targets of opportunity. Possibilities (a), (b) and (c) involve the \u201ccommunity caretaking function\u201d expected of alert police officers. <em>See, Cady v. Dombrowski </em>413 <em>U.S. </em>433, 441, 93 <em>S.Ct. </em>2523, 2528, 37 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>706 (1973); <em>Goetaski, supra, </em>209 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 365, 507 <em>A.2d </em>751; <em>State v. Marcello, </em>[157 <em>Vt. </em>657] 599 <em>A.2d </em>357, 358 (Vt.1991); <em>State v. Pinkham, </em>565 A<em>.2d </em>318, 319 (Me.1989). Possibility (d) implicates the \u201ccommon-law right to inquire\u201d based upon a founded suspicion that criminal activity might be afoot. <em>See </em>LaFave, <em>Search and Seizure, </em>See. 9.2(h) (2d ed.1987). It is appropriate to consider all of these applicable concerns and balance them against the minimal intrusion involved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>in a simple inquiry stop. We are satisfied on this balance that the stop was objectively reasonable and fell far short of the line of unconstitutionality we drew in <em>Goetaski</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-5\"><em>[Id. </em>at 78, 615 A.2d 279.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">Finally, in <em>State v. Washington, </em>296 <em>N.J.Super. </em>569, 687 A.2d 343 (App.Div.1997), we sustained a stop in another DWI ease where the defendant had been observed at 12:20 a.m. traveling thirty-six miles per hour in a forty-five mile per hour business zone, weaving within his lane. <em>Id. </em>at 571, 687 A.2d 343. We had this to say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-7\">Police officers have a community caretaldng function. That function has its source in the ubiquity of the automobile and the dynamic, differential situations police officers are confronted with to promote driver safety. <em>See United State [States] v. Rodriguez-Morales, </em>929 <em>F.2d </em>780, 784-86 (1st Cir.1991), <em>cert. denied, </em>502 <em>U.S. </em>1030, 112 <em>S.Ct. </em>868, 116 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>774 (1992). It finds support in the premise that abnormal operation of a motor vehicle establishes a reasonably objective basis to justify a motor vehicle stop. <em>See State v. Martinez, </em>260 <em>N.J.Super. </em>75, 78, 615 <em>A.2d </em>279 (App.Div.1992). What is reasonably objective is measured by the dynamics or totality of the circumstances from the perspective of the officer on duty at the time and not from the esoteric perspective of the courtroom. <em>See United States v. Cortez, </em>449 <em>U.S. </em>411, 418, 101 <em>S.Ct. </em>690, 695, 66 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>621, 629 (1981). Applying the former perspective, we are satisfied the officer had a reasonably objective basis to stop defendant\u2019s automobile.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-8\">Fundamental logic dictates that an officer has a reasonably objective basis to stop a motor vehicle weaving down a roadway in the manner here. This is true whether or not the driver stays in his or her lane of travel. Even while maintaining one\u2019s lane of travel, a driver that weaves a car down a Wghway, as defendant did, engenders reasonable grounds to conclude that the vehicle is a potential safety hazard to other vehicles and that there is either something wrong with the driver, with the car, or both. <em>See Martinez, supra, </em>260 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 78, 615 A.2d 279. If on-duty police officers are to fulfill their responsibility to promote safety for the traveling public, intervention is mandated in such circumstances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-9\">That defendant stayed in his lane of travel did not extinguish a community caretaking function. Driving in a manner that could lead to crossing the center line at an inopportune time, a time when another oncoming vehicle is about to pass, is a controlling consideration. Moreover, when the weaving is combined with the unconventionally slow speed, there is more than a reasonably objective basis to conclude defendant\u2019s ability to drive was impaired, justifying the stop.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-10\">In sum, we conclude the manner of defendant\u2019s driving on the night in question provided the officer with a reasonably objective basis for stopping the car. Consequently, the order under appeal was improvidently entered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-11\"><em>[Id </em>at 572-73, 687 A.2d 343.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>In each of the above cited cases the stop was justified on a community caretaking basis because the abnormal operation of the vehicle indicated that the driver might be in some difficulty, thereby presenting a hazard to himself or others. Inferences of that sort cannot be reasonably drawn from a driver\u2019s failure to proceed for five seconds after a red light has turned green when the only other vehicle in the area is a marked police car stopped immediately to the driver\u2019s rear. Therefore, a stop in these circumstances is not objectively reasonable; it is unconstitutional. <em>See, e.g., Doheny v. Commissioner of Public Safety, </em>368 <em>N.W.2d </em>1, 2 (Minn.Ct.App.1985) (holding the officer\u2019s belief that the motorist was lost did not justify the stop); <em>North Dakota v. Brown, </em>509 <em>N.W.2d </em>69, 71-72 (N.D.1993) (holding a stop invalid because the officer failed to provide any clear reason for thinking the driver needed assistance); <em>Washington v. DeArman, </em>54 <em>Was.App. </em>621, 774 P.2d 1247, 1249-50 (1989) (holding despite the officer\u2019s belief that defendant or his motor vehicle was disabled because the vehicle remained motionless at a stop sign for forty-five to sixty seconds, this belief was dispelled when the vehicle moved, and therefore the stop was unjustifiable).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">The State contends, in the alternative, that the stop was justified because the officer had an articulable and reasonable suspicion that defendant was violating the law. More specifically, the State argues that in these circumstances there was reason to believe that the driver was intoxicated because of his delay in moving forward and the slowness of his turn; that he was driving carelessly, in violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-97; and that his slow turning speed supported the inference that defendant was \u201ccasing the area for burglaries.\u201d Putting to one side the fact that none of these thoughts came to the officer, who testified that he stopped this vehicle because he was under orders to stop every moving vehicle during his shift, we reject the proposition that the facts objectively viewed would justify the inferences suggested by the State. <em>See, e.g., Locurto, supra, </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>at 466, 724 A.2d 234 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>(vehicle speeding); <em>State v. Smith, </em>306 <em>N.J.Super. </em>370, 380, 703 A.2d 954 (App.Div.1997) (vehicle weaving in and out of its lane); <em>State v. Murphy, </em>238 <em>N.J.Super. </em>546, 554, 570 A.2d 451 (App.Div.1990) (license plate improperly displayed). Furthermore, in deciding this case, the Law Division judge noted, without objection from the State, that he understood the State to be conceding that the officer did not have an articulable and reasonable suspicion that an offense had been committed. In fact, the prosecutor specifically limited her argument in support of the stop to the community caretaking theory and declined to argue any other justification.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Questions not raised below \u201cwill ordinarily not be considered on appeal.\u201d <em>State v. Bobo, </em>222 <em>N.J.Super. </em>30, 33, 535 A.2d 983 (App.Div.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">The order denying defendant\u2019s motion to suppress is reversed. Since there is no evidence of guilt other than that gained from the illegal stop, defendant\u2019s conviction is reversed as well.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b355-12\"> This device is described in detail in <em>State v. Donis, </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>44, 46-48, 723 A.2d 35 (1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b360-11\"> At no time has the State argued that the general order involved here, that officers on patrol were to stop all moving vehicles, passes muster under the Fourth Amendment. Certainly, our roadblock cases would suggest otherwise. <em>See, e.g., State v. Kadelak, </em>280 <em>N.J.Super. </em>349, 362-72, 655 A.2d 461 (App.Div.1995), <em>certif. denied, </em>141 <em>N.J. </em>98, 660 A.2d 1197 (1995); <em>State v.
