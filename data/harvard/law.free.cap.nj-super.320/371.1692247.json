Plaintiff John R. Johnson, III, is the participant spouse in the union\u2019s Annuity Fund which contends the provisions in paragraph fifteen of the Johnsons\u2019 dual final judgment of divorce and the post-judgment orders which require payment of attorneys\u2019 fees from the fund constitute an assignment of benefits expressly prohibited by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), the Internal Revenue Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>(IRC), and the Annuity Plan. We agree with the Annuity Fund and reverse the orders compelling payment of the parties\u2019 attorneys\u2019 fees by the ERISA-qualified retirement plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">On March 28,1996 a dual final judgment of divorce was entered in the Family Part, Camden County dissolving the marriage of the parties, Sharon Johnson, age 41, and John R. Johnson, III, age 39. Paragraph four of the divorce judgment stated the value or balance of plaintiff-husband John Johnson\u2019s interest in the Annuity Fund totalled $17,840.08 in September 1995. There was also an $8,510.54 separate account balance in the Annuity Fund in defendant-wife Sharon Johnson\u2019s name as of September 1995. Paragraph four of the divorce judgment also required that Sharon Johnson transfer this $8,510.54 balance to John Johnson and that she sign any and all waivers or execute any Qualified Domestic Relation Orders (QDRO\u2019s) to effect that transfer, together with any accumulated interest or dividends on the balance.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">Paragraph fifteen of the divorce judgment stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-9\">From the annuity which has been refunded to the plaintiff, JOHN R. JOHNSON, III, $8000.00 shall be withdrawn and shall be paid to the attorneys in the following sums:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-10\">(a) Louise D. Donaldson, Esquire $4000.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-11\">(b) Leslie J. Jandoli, Esquire $4000.00</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-12\">Mr. Jandoli represented plaintiff John Johnson and Ms. Donaldson represented defendant Sharon Johnson in the divorce proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-13\">Sharon Johnson filed a notice of motion to enforce litigant\u2019s rights returnable December 13, 1996 requesting, among other things, an order requiring John Johnson to pay her attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to paragraph fifteen of the divorce judgment. On February 24,1997 the judge entered an order which required</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AGc\">That the administrator of the pension/annuity fund of the plaintiff, John R. Johnson, III, through Local 322, Plumbers and Steamfitters Union, shall pay to Louise D. Donaldson, Esquire, attorney for the defendant, Sharon Johnson, the sum of Four Thousand ($4,000.00) Dollars and to Leslie J. Jandoli, Esquire, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>attorney for the plaintiff, John R. Johnson, III, the sum of Four Thousand ($4,000.00) Dollars, after deduction of $800.00 per payment, to satisfy the required income tax and penalty assessments. Said payment shall be made within 30 days.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">This judicial order for counsel fees was obviously a result of the settlement of the matrimonial litigation which involved the marital home, child support, alimony, debts, visitation, custody, personal property, and other customary issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">On April 18, 1997 the Annuity Fund\u2019s then-attorneys, Brown &amp; Connery, sent a letter to the judge stating the Annuity Fund could not comply with his order. The letter, in pertinent part, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ad1\">Neither ERISA nor Local 322\u2019s Pension and Annuity Fund Plans permit the disbursement of Fund assets to pay for attorneys\u2019 fees incurred in a divorce action. Complying with this Order could jeopardize the tax exempt status of our Plan. We are therefore unable to comply with Your Honor\u2019s Order.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">In response to the Annuity Fund\u2019s April 18, 1997 letter, the judge held a conference with the Annuity Fund\u2019s and the John-sons\u2019 attorneys on June 3, 1997. The judge reaffirmed his earlier direction of payment of attorney\u2019s fees from the Annuity Fund. On June 9, 1997 the Annuity Fund\u2019s attorney sent a confirming letter to the judge summarizing the outcome of the June 3, 1997 conference. The letter stated in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-8\">Your Honor rejected the authority we cited and reiterated the Order directing that the Annuity Plan pay the attorneys\u2019 fees to counsel as directed. In light of Your Honor\u2019s ruling rejecting our objection to make such payments, we will comply with the Order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-9\">By copy of this letter, we are advising Ms. Donaldson and Mr. Jandoli that we will direct the Fund to pay them $4,000 each from Mr. Johnson\u2019s Annuity Fund pursuant to the Order.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b404-10\">The Annuity Fund\u2019s attorneys, Brown &amp; Connery, sent the attorneys, Ms. Donaldson and Mr. Jandoli, a letter dated July 3, 1997 stating the Annuity Fund administrator had directed its custodian bank to issue their $4,000 checks for their attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-11\">John Johnson\u2019s attorney, Mr. Jandoli, eventually filed a motion to enforce litigant\u2019s rights, returnable December 5, 1997, requesting an order requiring the Local 322 Annuity Fund to comply with the court\u2019s prior February 24, 1997 order which compelled the Annuity Fund to pay the parties\u2019 attorneys\u2019 fees. This motion was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>apparently postponed until January 1998. In his certification, Mr. Jandoli stated the office of Tomar, Simonoff, Adourian, O\u2019Brien, Kaplan, Jacoby &amp; Graziano had replaced Brown <em>&amp; </em>Connery as attorneys for the Annuity Fund. Mr. Jandoli also stated Ms. Donaldson no longer represented Sharon Johnson. Attorney Nan S. Famular, Esquire, replaced Ms. Donaldson as Sharon Johnson\u2019s attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">The Annuity Fund, through Tomar Simonoff s office, then filed a notice of cross-motion returnable January 9, 1998 requesting (1) dismissal of John Johnson\u2019s attorney\u2019s motion to enforce litigant\u2019s rights, (2) the judge\u2019s February 24, 1997 order be vacated, and (3) paragraph fifteen of the divorce judgment also be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">The judge heard oral arguments on this application on January 14, 1998. Mr. Jandoli appeared for John Johnson. The Annuity Fund\u2019s attorney argued it was not a party to the case and could not be bound by the divorce judgment. The Annuity Fund also argued that under ERISA the judge could not order it to pay the attorneys\u2019 fees. The judge ruled that he would join the Annuity Fund as a party and reaffirm his February 24, 1997 order. On January 26, 1998 the judge entered an order joining the Annuity Fund as a party and affirmed his prior order of February 24, 1997 compelling the Annuity Fund to pay John and Sharon Johnson\u2019s attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b405-9\">The Annuity Fund sought relief under <em>R. </em>4:50-1\u00a9 from the order compelling it to pay the Johnsons\u2019 attorneys\u2019 fees. The Annuity Fund contends if it complies with the judge\u2019s orders it will violate IRC \u00a7 401(a), ERISA \u00a7\u00a7 404(a) and 502(a), and paragraph 11.11 of John Johnson\u2019s Annuity Plan. The Annuity Fund also contends compliance with the judge\u2019s orders will jeopardize its tax-exempt status and subject its trustees to liability for breach of fiduciary duty by Plan participants and the United States Department of Labor. The Johnson respondents did not participate in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>Relief from a judgment or order is provided for under our court rules:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-5\">On motion, with briefs, and upon such terms as are just, the court may relieve a party or the party\u2019s legal representative from a final judgment or order for the following reasons:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-6\">sfc 4;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-7\">(f) any other reason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment or order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-8\">[R. 4:50 \u2014 1(f).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-9\">Granting or denying a motion under <em>R. </em>4:50-l(f) is addressed to the motion judge\u2019s sound discretion. <em>Housing Authority of Town of Morristown v. Little, </em>135 <em>N.J. </em>274, 286, 639 A.2d 286 (1994). \u201cBecause of the importance that we attach to the finality of judgments, relief under <em>Rule </em>4:50-l(f) is available only when \u2018truly exceptional circumstances are present.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>Baumann v. Marinaro, </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>380, 395, 471 A.2d 395 (1984)). Judge Pressler explains a motion to vacate a judgment based on any of the six specified grounds in <em>R. </em>4:50-1 should be granted sparingly. Pressler, <em>Current N.J. Court Rules, </em>comment 1.1 on <em>R. </em>4:50-1 (1999). Each case brought under a <em>R. </em>4:50-l(f) motion must be resolved on its own particular facts. <em>Baumann v. Marinaro, </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>at 395, 471 A.2d 395. The movant must demonstrate the circumstances are exceptional and enforcement of the judgment or order would be unjust, oppressive or inequitable. <em>Quagliato v. Bodner, </em>115 <em>N.J.Super. </em>133, 138, 278 A.2d 500 (App.Div.1971). In such exceptional circumstances, <em>R. </em>4:50-l(f)\u2019s \u201cboundaries are as expansive as the need to achieve equity and justice.\u201d <em>Court Invest. Co. v. Perillo, </em>48 <em>N.J. </em>334, 341, 225 A.2d 352 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-10\">Appellate review of a motion judge\u2019s ruling on a <em>R. </em>4:50-1(f) motion is the abuse of discretion standard. <em>Housing Authority of Town of Morristown v. Little, </em>135 <em>N.J. </em>at 283, 639 A.2d 286. However, if a judge makes a discretionary decision but acts under a misconception of the applicable law or misapplies the applicable law to the facts, an appellate court need not extend deference. We must adjudicate the controversy in light of the applicable law to avoid a manifest denial of justice. <em>State v. Steele, </em>92 <em>N.J.Super. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>498, 507, 224 A.2d 132 (App.Div.1966); <em>Kavanaugh v. Quigley, </em>63 <em>N.J.Super. </em>153, 158, 164 A.2d 179 (App.Div.1960); <em>O\u2019Neill v. City of Newark, </em>304 <em>N.J.Super. </em>543, 550, 701 A.2d 717 (App.Div.1997). We consider the Annuity Fund\u2019s motion for relief from judgment as filed within a reasonable time. <em>See R. </em>4:50-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">The Annuity Fund is established and maintained pursuant to the provisions of ERISA, 29 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1001 to -1461, and the IRC, 26 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 401 to -419A. The Annuity Fund understandably contends it is required to comply with all the provisions of ERISA and the IRC. Congress enacted ERISA to protect the welfare of employees and their dependents who depend on retirement plans. <em>Hawxhurst v. Hawxhurst, </em>318 <em>N.J.Super. </em>72, 82-83, 723 A.2d 58 (App.Div.1998); <em>Ablamis v. Roper, </em>937 <em>F.2d </em>1450, 1453 (9th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">ERISA has an antialienation provision which states: \u201cEach pension plan shall provide that benefits provided under the plan may not be assigned or alienated.\u201d 29 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 1056(d)(1). The United States Supreme Court stated this provision \u201creflects a considered congressional policy choice, a decision to safeguard a stream of income for pensioners ... even if that decision prevents others from securing relief for the wrongs done them.\u201d <em>Guidry v. Sheet Metal Workers Nat'l Pension Fund, </em>493 <em>U.S. </em>365, 376, 110 <em>S.Ct. </em>680, 107 L.Ed.2d 782 (1990). The IRC has a similar antialienation provision which states, \u201cIn general. \u2014A trust shall not constitute a qualified trust under this section unless the plan of which such trust is a part provides that benefits provided under the plan may not be assigned or alienated.\u201d 26 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 401(a)(13)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">The Department of the Treasury declares the definition of assignment and alienation includes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-9\">Any direct or indirect arrangement (whether revocable or irrevocable) whereby a party acquires from a participant or beneficiary a right or interest enforceable against the plan in, or to, all or any part of a plan benefit payment which is, or may become, payable to the participant or beneficiary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-10\">[26 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 1.401(a)\u201413(c)(l)(ii).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>The Annuity Fund\u2019s provisions demonstrate its compliance with ERISA and the IRC\u2019s antialienation provisions. Paragraph 11.11 of the Annuity Fund states,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-5\">To the end of making it impossible for participants covered by this Plan improvidently to imperil the provisions made for their support and welfare by directly or indirectly anticipating, pledging, or disposing of their benefit payments hereunder, it is hereby expressly stipulated that no participant hereunder shall have the right to assign, alienate, transfer, sell, hypothecate, mortgage, encumber, pledge, commute, or anticipate any benefit payments and that such payments shall not in any way be subject to any legal process to levy execution upon or attachment or garnishment proceedings against the same for the payments of any claim against any participant nor shall such payments be subject to the jurisdiction of any bankruptcy court for insolvency proceedings by operation of law or otherwise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">Question 25 in the question and answer section of the Annuity Fund\u2019s booklet states,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-7\">May I assign, sell or transfer my rights under the Plan?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-8\">No. This is not allowed by the Annuity Plan. All payments from the Fund must be made directly to the participant, his spouse or- his beneficiary, (emphasis in original.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-9\">Here, paragraph fifteen of the divorce judgment created a direct arrangement through which the Johnsons\u2019 attorneys acquired an interest presently enforceable against the plan. Paragraph fifteen, together with the orders of February 24, 1997 and January 26, 1998 compelling the Annuity Fund to pay the John-sons\u2019 attorneys\u2019 fees, facially violated ERISA\u2019s antialienation provision codified in 29 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1056(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-10\">There are only two exceptions to ERISA\u2019s antialienation provision. The first exception permits \u201cany voluntary and revocable assignment of not to exceed 10 percent of any benefit payment----\u201d 29 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1056(d)(2). This first exception does not apply to the present situation because benefits are not currently payable, according to this record. Benefits are not payable until retirement at age 55 or later, six months after complete withdrawal from active employment with the local, or after six consecutive months of working in non-covered employment. The second exception is for qualified domestic relations orders (QDRO) which meet precise statutory requirements. 29 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 1056(d)(3)(A). Exceptions to ERISA\u2019s antialienation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>provision are strictly construed and exceptions must be expressly mandated by Congress. <em>Guidry v. Sheet Metal Workers National Pension Fund, </em>493 <em>U.S. </em>at 375-77, 110 S.Ct. 680.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">Congress expressly mandated the second exception which states, in part, that the antialienation provision</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-7\">shall not apply if the order is determined to be a qualified domestic relations order. Each pension plan shall provide for the payment of benefits in accordance with the applicable requirements of any qualified domestic relations order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-10\">[29 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 1056(d)(3)(A).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-11\">ERISA defines a QDRO as a domestic relations order \u201cwhich creates or recognizes the existence of an alternate payee\u2019s right to, or assigns to an alternate payee the right to, receive all or a portion of the benefits payable with respect to a participant under a plan, and with respect to which the requirements of subparagraphs (C) and (D) are met.\u201d 29 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 1056(d)(3)(B)(i). It defines a domestic relations order as \u201cany judgment, decree, or order (including approval of a property settlement agreement) which relates to the provision of child support, alimony payments, or marital property rights to a spouse, former spouse, child, or other dependent of a participant, and is made pursuant to a State domestic relations law (including a community property law).\u201d 29 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 1056(d)(3)(B)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-12\">QDRO\u2019s must meet certain requirements for exemption from ERISA\u2019s antialienation provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-13\">(C) A domestic relations order meets the requirements of this subparagraph only if such order clearly specifies\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-14\">(i) the name and the last known mailing address (if any) of the participant and the name and mailing address of each alternate payee covered by the order,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-15\">(ii) the amount or percentage of the participant\u2019s benefits to be paid by the plan to each such alternate payee, or the manner in which such amount or percentage is to be determined,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-16\">(iii) the number of payments or period to which such order applies, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-17\">(iv) each plan to which such order applies.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-18\">(D) A domestic relations order meets the requirements of this subparagraph only if such order\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-19\">(i) does not require a plan to provide any type or form of benefit, or any option, not otherwise provided under the plan,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>(ii) does not require the plan to provide increased benefits (determined on the basis of actuarial value), and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-5\">(in) does not require the payment of benefits to an alternate payee which are required to be paid to another alternate payee under another order previously determined to be a qualified domestic relations order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-6\">[29 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 1056(d)(3)(C) and (D)J</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">Here, the judge neither considered nor applied the pertinent law.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">Mindful that exceptions to ERISA\u2019s antialienation provisions are strictly construed, we find the QDRO exception to ERISA\u2019s antialienation provision is not applicable; the divorce judgment, the February 24, 1997 order, and the January 26, 1998 order did not meet ERISA\u2019s requirements of a QDRO. 29 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1056(d)(3)(A) \u2014 (D). First, under ERISA a QDRO is a domestic relations order which recognizes the rights of an alternate payee to receive benefits under the plan. 29 <em>U.S.CA </em>\u00a7 1056(d)(3)(B). The Johnsons\u2019 attorneys do not fall within ERISA\u2019s definition of an \u201calternate payee,\u201d defined as \u201cany spouse, former spouse, child, or other dependent of a participant who is recognized by a domestic relations order as having a right to receive all, or a portion of, the benefits payable under a plan with respect to such participant.\u201d 29 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 1056(d)(3)(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-9\">Second, those documents do not relate to provisions of child support, alimony or the Johnsons\u2019 marital property rights as required in the Retirement Equity Act of 1984, 29 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 1056(d)(3)(B)(ii)(I). Rather, paragraph fifteen of the divorce judgment and the orders relate to provisions of attorneys\u2019 fees arising out of the dissolution of the Johnsons\u2019 marriage, a matter not provided for under the antialienation exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-10\">Third, requiring the party\u2019s attorneys\u2019 fees to be paid from John Johnson\u2019s pension and annuity fund is a benefit not provided for under the Annuity Fund Plan and thus violates 29 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1056(d)(3)(D)(i). The Annuity Fund Plan provides for monthly payments in the form of a lifetime annuity when John Johnson reaches age 55 or has withdrawn from active employment under the local\u2019s contracts for at least six months. The Annuity Fund Plan also provides an option for a lump-sum payment when the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>plan participant becomes eligible to retire if the participant is single or, if married, the spouse consents. The Annuity Fund Plan does not provide for a pre-retirement lump-sum withdrawal to pay attorneys\u2019 fees. The Annuity Fund Plan specifically forbids a plan participant from assigning, selling or transferring rights and states all payments from the Annuity Fund must be made to the plan participant, spouse or a beneficiary. Because the John-sons\u2019 attorneys are not plan participants, spouses of the Johnsons, or beneficiaries under John Johnson\u2019s pension, and because the $8,000 lump-sum payment for attorneys\u2019 fees is not a benefit provided for under the Annuity Fund, this assignment violates the provisions of the Annuity Fund Plan and 29 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 1056(d)(3)(D)(i). Thus paragraph fifteen of the divorce judgment, together with the judge\u2019s orders of February 24, 1997 and January 26,1998, are ineffective.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">\u201cERISA preempts all marital dissolution decrees that do not meet the statutory definition of a QDRO.\u201d <em>Ross v. Ross, </em>308 <em>N.J.Super. </em>132, 150, 705 A.2d 784 (App.Div.1998). The requirements in 29 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1056(d)(3)(C) \u201cfor the creation of a QDRO must be strictly complied with before a domestic relations order may be considered \u2018qualified.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 153, 705 A.2d 784 (citing <em>Hawkins v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>86 F.3d 982, 993 (10th Cir.1996)).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">Although there are no relevant New Jersey cases, a few federal courts addressing similar issues support our conclusion. In <em>Dickerson v. Dickerson, </em>803 <em>F.Supp. </em>127, 129 (E.D.Tenn.1992), a divorce decree stated the former wife was awarded a lump-sum payment of $8,000 to be immediately paid from her former husband\u2019s pension benefits \u201cas quickly as administratively possible following the entry of the Final Decree of Divorce,\u201d rather than waiting until her former husband\u2019s pension benefits reached payment status. The divorce decree included language purporting to issue a QDRO in compliance with 29 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1056(d). <em>Id. </em>at 128. The former husband\u2019s pension plan did not comply with the command in the divorce decree because of the violation of ERISA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>and the IRC. The former husband\u2019s pension plan provided that monthly retirement benefits would begin when the former husband reached age 55 or became disabled. His pension plan also had an antialienation clause. The federal district court determined the divorce decree did not meet ERISA\u2019s requirements for a QDRO. Although the former wife met the statutory definition of an \u201calternate payee,\u201d the court concluded the divorce decree was not a QDRO because it sought \u201cto provide a benefit not otherwise permitted under the pension plan and to disburse pension funds prior to\u201d the commencement of the participant\u2019s retirement benefits. <em>Id. </em>at 134.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">In <em>Stott v. Bunge Corporation, </em>800 <em>F.Supp. </em>567 (E.D.Tenn.1992), the federal district court determined the QDRO did not meet ERISA\u2019s requirements. The QDRO in that case required 50% of the former husband\u2019s pension benefits paid to the former wife in a lump-sum payment \u201cas soon as administratively possible.\u201d The court determined the QDRO violated 29 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 1056(d)(3)(E)(ii) because it required payment to the former wife before the former husband reached \u201cthe earliest retirement age\u201d and therefore required the pension plan to provide a benefit not otherwise provided for under the plan in violation of 29 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 1056(d) (3)(D)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">In <em>AT &amp; T Management Pension Plan v. Tucker, </em>902 <em>F.Supp. </em>1168 (C.D.Cal.1995), the former husband\u2019s pension plan was joined as an interested party in the Tuckers\u2019 divorce action and reserved the right to object to any orders that violated ERISA. The family-court judge in that case ordered the pension plan to pay over $50,000 to the former wife\u2019s attorney as attorney\u2019s fees incurred during their communications with the pension plan and in pressing their application for attorney\u2019s fees over the pension plan\u2019s objections. <em>Id. </em>at 1170. The pension plan appealed the family-court judge\u2019s order. The family-court judge then granted the former wife\u2019s motion for an additional award of $10,000 in attorney\u2019s fees expected in handling the appeal from the trial-level court. The plan appealed this order as well. The plan then filed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>a complaint in the federal district court for injunctive and declaratory relief to restrain ERISA violations. <em>Id. </em>at 1171. The district judge, without providing a detailed analysis, determined the orders for attorneys\u2019 fees were not QDRO\u2019s and were preempted by ERISA\u2019s antialienation clause. <em>Id. </em>at 1176.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">Similarly, here, the divorce judgment and the judge\u2019s orders require the lump-sum $8,000 payment for attorneys\u2019 fees made prior to John Johnson\u2019s pension achieving payment status. This clearly violates 29 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1056(d)(3)(D)\u00ae because his pension benefits will not reach payment status until either he reaches age 55, withdraws from his employment with the local for at least six months, or stops working in covered employment for six consecutive months. Based on the arguments presented by the Annuity Fund in its brief, any situation which would convert the Annuity Fund into payment status has not occurred as of August 3, 1998, the date its brief was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">We reverse and remand to the Family Part and direct that the judge vacate paragraph fifteen of the divorce judgment and the orders of February 24, 1997 and January 26, 1998 ordering payment from the Annuity Fund. In view of the potential inequities from alteration of the terms of the original marital settlement contemplating payment of attorneys\u2019 fees from the Annuity Fund, either party may apply for supplemental relief in the Family Part within forty-five days of the date of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-8\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
