Ispahani and Dunkin\u2019 Donuts are also parties to an \u201cExclusive Development Agreement\u201d which authorized Ispahani to open four Dunkin\u2019 Donuts stores (in addition to those he was already operating) at locations to be approved by Dunkin\u2019 Donuts.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-15\">On December 18,1997, Ispahani filed this lawsuit against defendant Allied Domecq Retailing, U.S.A., which he alleges was Dun-kin\u2019 Donuts\u2019 successor. Ispahani\u2019s complaint asserts, in substance, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>that he purchased property to be used as a site for a new Dunkin\u2019 Donuts store, paid or obligated himself for the purchase price, and incurred substantial additional expenses in reliance on verbal approval from an authorized representative of Dunkin\u2019 Donuts. The complaint continues that final approval was unjustifiably refused and Ispahani suffered a substantial financial injury as a consequence. Ispahani also filed an amended complaint which states substantially the same claim against Dunkin\u2019 Donuts, but also alleges defendants violated the Franchise Practices Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:10-1 to -15.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">Dunkin\u2019 Donuts filed a counterclaim against Ispahani and a third-party complaint against Five Flowers alleging that they breached their obligations under their franchise agreement by failing to pay continuing franchise fees and contributions toward advertising expenses. Dunkin\u2019 Donuts\u2019 pleading also alleges that it sent the franchisees notices of default and notices to cure as required by the franchise agreement, that they failed to cure, and that it therefore sent them notices terminating their franchises.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">These claims and counterclaims are still awaiting trial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Ispahani and Five Flowers are still operating as Dunkin\u2019 Donuts franchisees. Dunkin\u2019 Donuts moved to enjoin them \u201cfrom operating donut shops at their former franchised locations\u201d during the pendency of this litigation. As grounds for the injunction, Dunkin\u2019 Donuts argued to the motion court that Ispahani and Five Flowers had \u201cfailed to pay substantial franchise and advertising fees for the use of the Dunkin\u2019 Donuts trade name and proprietary marks,\u201d thereby causing the termination of their franchises, and that the former franchisees\u2019 continuing operations infringe Dun-kin\u2019 Donuts\u2019 trademarks, violate covenants against competition, and have caused it \u201cirreparable harm.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">In support of its motion for an interlocutory injunction, Dunkin\u2019 Donuts relied on a certification of Gregory Justice, its \u201cCollection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>Coordinator.\u201d His certification is dated May 15, 1998. In it he alleges:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-6\">[A] Notice to Cure monetary defaults was issued to Plaintiff/Third-Party Defendant Syed Ispahani and Third-Party Defendant Five Flowers Corporation, ... they failed to cure such defaults within the time permitted and ... a Notice of Termination of their Franchise Agreement was issued, terminating their Franchise Agreement effective sixty (60) days from the issuance of the Notice to Cure. A Notice of Termination was also issued confirming the termination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">Justice\u2019s certification also alleges that Ispahani and Five Flowers continue to hold themselves out as Dunkin\u2019 Donuts franchisees and that, as of May 14, 1998, they owed unpaid franchise and advertising fees for two stores in an amount which Dunkin Donuts estimated to be $45,796.01, plus attorneys\u2019 fees and collection costs of $8,529.30. Dunkin\u2019 Donuts also relied on the terms of its franchise agreement which included a clause stating that accepting late payments does not waive the franchisor\u2019s right to insist on timely payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">Mr. Ispahani submitted an opposing certification dated May 27, 1998, which implicitly admitted that he owed fees, but denied the amount and asserted that Dunkin\u2019 Donuts had agreed to accept payments late because, in substance, it recognized that its conduct had caused him to suffer financial losses and cash flow problems. He also alleged that he had been working ten to fourteen hours a day for the past nine years operating the franchise and that granting the injunction would cause him \u201cirreparable harm\u201d by destroying his livelihood. Mr. Ispahani testified briefly at the July 10, 1998 hearing on Dunkin\u2019 Donuts\u2019 application for an interlocutory injunction that two days earlier he had reported sales through June and had paid the royalties due for those sales, and that the day before the hearing he had sent Dunkin\u2019 Donuts a check covering fees for the week ending July 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-9\">The motion court denied Dunkin\u2019 Donuts\u2019 application to enjoin Ispahani and Five Flowers from continuing to operate as Dunkin\u2019 Donuts franchisees during the pendency of this litigation. In a brief oral opinion, the court referred to the prerequisites for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>issuance of a preliminary injunction, <em>see Crowe v. De Gioia, </em>90 <em>N.J. </em>126, 132-34, 447 A.2d 173 (1982), and declared:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-4\">This court is unable to find if Dunkin\u2019 Donuts will suffer immediate and irreparable harm if the injunction does not issue. Further, Dunkin\u2019 Donuts has not demonstrated that it will suffer the greater harm if the preliminary injunction is denied than the plaintiff will suffer if it is granted. It appears to the court that enjoining the operation of the franchise preliminarily will impose a greater harm on the plaintiff than [denying] it will on Dunkin\u2019 Donuts____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">We agree with the motion court that Dunkin\u2019 Donuts did not make the showing necessary to justify the relief which it sought. To obtain a preliminary injunction, the applicant must establish that he will suffer irreparable injury if the relief is denied, that his claim is based on a settled legal right, that the material facts are substantially undisputed, and that the harm to him if the injunction is denied will be greater than the harm to the opposing party if the injunction is granted. <em>Crowe v. DeGioia, supra, </em>90 <em>N.J. </em>at 132-34, 447 A.2d 173. Since Dunkin\u2019 Donuts has relied on federal cases dealing with the grant or denial of preliminary injunctions in Lanham Act cases, 15 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1051 to 1127, we note that the prerequisites for a preliminary injunction are described in similar terms in those decisions. <em>See e.g., McDonald\u2019s Corp. v. Robertson, </em>147 F.3d 1301, 1306 (11th Cir.1998) (permitting district court to grant preliminary injunction where movant shows: \u201c(1) substantial likelihood of success on the merits; (2) irreparable injury will be suffered unless the injunction issues; (3) the threatened injury to the movant outweighs whatever damage the proposed injunction may cause the opposing party; and (4) if issued, the injunction would not be adverse to the public interest\u201d); <em>Pappan Enters., Inc. v. Hardee\u2019s Food Sys., Inc., </em>143 F.3d 800, 803 (3d Cir.1998) (same). In the present case, Dunkin\u2019 Donuts failed to carry its burden of establishing that it will probably prevail on the merits of its claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">In the context of Dunkin\u2019 Donuts\u2019 application to enjoin Ispahani and Five Flowers from continuing to operate as its franchisees, proving that Dunkin\u2019 Donuts will probably \u201cprevail on the merits\u201d means establishing that it probably had the legal right to terminate their franchise contracts. The facts bearing on that issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>were sparse and contested. Dunkin\u2019 Donuts proved by its officer\u2019s certification and its franchisees\u2019 admission that Ispahani and Five Flowers had not paid royalties and advertising fees on time. The amount due and unpaid was disputed. Both sides relied on conclusory statements, without providing or referring to underlying records to substantiate their claims. None of the parties offered proof of the total amount of royalties and advertising fees paid per month or per year so that the court could evaluate the significance of the arrearage. Ispahani claimed that Dunkin\u2019 Donuts\u2019 allegedly unconscionable breaches of their development agreement were responsible for the tardiness of the payments and that Dunkin\u2019 Donuts had specifically consented to the payments being made late. No testimony was presented on Dunkin Donuts\u2019 alleged consent, and the court made no findings on that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">Dunkin\u2019 Donuts\u2019 argument on the issue of its likelihood of prevailing is not entirely clear, but it seems to be contending that it is not obligated to prove the franchisees\u2019 material breach of contract and its own clean hands in order to justify its termination of their franchises. In support of this proposition, it relies on <em>S &amp; R Corporation v. Jiffy Lube International, </em>968 <em>F.</em>2d 371 (3d Cir.1992), which it interprets to mean that, as a matter of federal law, a franchise resting on a federally registered trademark can be revoked for any reason, or at least for any infraction of the franchise agreement, without regard either to its own responsibility for the breach or to the materiality of the breach.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">Its reliance is misplaced. A recent commentary summarizes the relevant law as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-8\">In a small minority of jurisdictions, wrongful termination claims are not valid defenses to a Lanham Act claim and are viewed merely as independent claims for damages. [Citing, among other eases, <em>S &amp; R Corp., supra, </em>968 <em>F.</em>2d at 375.] These decisions thus appear to be based on the notion that a franchisor can unilaterally withdraw Lanham Act \u201cconsent\u201d to use a mark, subject only to the risk that if that action is later held to have been unlawful the franchisor could be liable for a damage award to the franchisee. [Footnote omitted.] <em>More commonly, however, courts examine whether the termination or nonrenewal was lawful to determine whether there has been a violation of the Lanham Act. </em>[Emphasis added; footnote omitted.] These cases thus appear to assume that Lanham Act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>\u201cconsent\u201d is subject to state law \u2014 both statutory law and common law \u2014 regulating franchise termination and nonrenewal. [Footnote omitted.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-5\">[Thomas L. Casagrande, <em>Using the Lanham Act to Ward off Preliminary Injunctions, </em>18 <em>Franchise L.J. </em>87, 90 (1999).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">For the proposition that franchisees cannot be preliminarily enjoined from operating under their franchises and from utilizing Lanham Act trademarks without proof that the franchise was rightfully terminated for cause, see McDonald\u2019s <em>Corporation, supra, </em>147 F.3d at 1308 (requiring franchisor to make some type of showing that it properly terminated the franchise agreement to prevail on the merits of a trademark infringement claim); and <em>Digital Equipment Corporation v. Altavista Technology, Inc., </em>960 <em>F.Supp. </em>456, 472-73 (D.Mass.1997) (same). New Jersey law is to the same effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">Dunkin\u2019 Donuts\u2019 franchise agreement with Ispahani and Five Flowers is subject to the New Jersey Franchise Practices Act, <em>N.J.S.A </em>56:10-1 to -15. <em>See Mariniello v. Shell Oil Co., </em>511 F.2d 853, 860 (3rd Cir.1975). The provision of the Act which prohibits termination of a franchise except for good cause, <em>N.J.S.A </em>56:10-5, is not preempted by the Lanham Act or any other federal law. <em>See Mariniello, supra, </em>511 F.2d at 857. One of the issues which will have to be determined at the final hearing is whether, on the basis of all of the facts of this case, Dunkin\u2019 Donuts has \u201cgood cause\u201d for terminating the franchises of Ispahani and Five Flowers. <em>Cf. E.S. Bills, Inc. v. Tzucanow, </em>38 <em>Cal.3d </em>824, 215 <em>Cal.Rptr. </em>278, 700 P.2d 1280, 1286-87 (1985) (determining that in franchise contract that gave plaintiff right and duty to set prices, defendants\u2019 declaration that they would pay less than prices set would not be breach and would not be good cause to terminate the franchise if plaintiff violated the contract by charging improper prices).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-8\">The order appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b524-8\"> Leave to appeal was granted pursuant to <em>R. 2:2-4.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
