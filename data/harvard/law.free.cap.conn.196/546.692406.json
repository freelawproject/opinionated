The facts as found by the employment security division board of review (hereinafter board) are not disputed in this appeal. The defendant claimants were air traffic controllers employed by the plaintiff federal aviation administration (hereinafter FAA). They were discharged from their employment for participation in a nationwide strike of air traffic controllers that commenced on August 3, 1981. The defendants were terminated for being absent from their posts without leave during the strike and for participation in the strike in violation of their oaths and federal statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">Subsequent to their termination from federal service, the defendants filed for, and were allowed Connecticut unemployment compensation benefits by the defendant administrator of the Connecticut unemployment compensation commission (hereinafter administrator). The FAA filed a timely appeal from that decision to the employment security appeals division. The board of review, acting on its own motion and pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-248a, transferred the case to itself and assumed jurisdiction. A de novo evidentiary hearing was held on March 18, 1982, and by decision dated June 14,1982, the board upheld the decision of the administrator to grant unemployment compensation benefits to the defendants. In the plaintiff\u2019s subsequent administrative appeal to the Superior Court, the trial court agreed with the board of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>The determinative issue on this appeal, as it was in the administrative proceedings before the board of review, is the interpretation of General Statutes \u00a7 31-236 (2) (B). In August of 1981, this statute provided in pertinent part: \u201cAn individual shall be ineligible for benefits ... if, in the opinion of the administrator, he has been discharged or suspended for felonious conduct or repeated wilful misconduct in the course of his employment . . . <em>\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The board found that the defendants were discharged for wilful misconduct in the course of their employment. The board, however, concluded that the defendants\u2019 continued and voluntary absence from work on and after August 3, 1981, was not <em>repeated </em>wilful misconduct which would have disqualified them for benefits under General Statutes \u00a7 31-236 (2) (B). The board apparently reasoned that failure to report to work, though on successive days, was a single act. Our disposition of this appeal makes it unnecessary to consider further this conclusion of the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">The board also found that participation by the defendants in a strike against the United States government was in fact and in law felonious conduct and that the defendants were discharged for felonious conduct in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1918.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The board, noting that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>the felonious conduct provision of General Statutes \u00a7 31-236 (2) (B) is of recent vintage and that prior cases it had considered concerning discharge for felonious conduct involved violation of Connecticut criminal statutes, not federal criminal statutes, determined that this was a case of first impression. It therefore decided it must look to the legislative intent to resolve the question of whether the disqualification prescribed by the felonious conduct provision of General Statutes \u00a7 31-236 (2) (B) extends to and embraces the type of felonious conduct which caused the defendants\u2019 discharge, in this case the violation of a federal criminal statute defined as a felony. Looking to the legislative history of General Statutes \u00a7 31-236 (2) (B), the board found an intent that felonious conduct, to be a basis for disqualification from receiving unemployment compensation benefits in the event of discharge from employment, must involve a felony under the criminal statutes of the state of Connecticut. <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The board therefore determined that the defendants were entitled to benefits and upheld the decision of the administrator. The trial court deferred to the board\u2019s construction of \u00a7 31-236 (2) (B) in dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s appeal. We find error.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\">In the interpretation of statutes, the intent of the legislature is to be found not in what it meant to say <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>but in what it did say. <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>194 Conn. 213, 222, 479 A.2d 814 (1984); <em>Gomeau </em>v. <em>Forrest, </em>176 Conn. 523, 526, 409 A.2d 1006 (1979). A primary rule of statutory construction is that if the language of the statute is clear, it is assumed that the words themselves express the intent of the legislature; <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra, 221; <em>Houston </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>169 Conn. 247, 251, 363 A.2d 121 (1975); <em>Hartford Hospital </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>160 Conn. 370, 375-76, 279 A.2d 561 (1971); and there is no need to construe the statute. <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>173 Conn. 223, 226, 377 A.2d 299 (1977). The words of a statute are to be given their commonly approved meaning unless a contrary intent is clearly expressed. <em>Holmquist </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>168 Conn. 389, 393, 362 A.2d 971 (1975). Where the legislative intent is clear and unambiguous, there is no need for statutory construction or a review of the legislative history. Moreover, it is not the province of a court to supply what the legislature chose to omit. The legislature is supreme in the area of legislation, and courts must apply statutory enactments according to their plain terms. <em>In re Petition of State\u2019s Attorney, Cook County, Illinois, </em>179 Conn. 102, 107, 425 A.2d 588 (1979); <em>Weingarten </em>v. <em>Allstate Ins. Co., </em>169 Conn. 502, 507-508, 363 A.2d 1055 (1975). It, therefore, is not for the board or the court to search out some intent which they believe the legislature had; they are confined to the intention which is expressed in the words used. <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co. </em>v. <em>Walsh, </em>134 Conn. 295, 301, 57 A.2d 128 (1948).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">We recognize that the provisions of General Statutes chapter 567 should be construed, interpreted and administered in such manner as to presume coverage, eligibility and nondisqualification in doubtful cases. General Statutes \u00a7 31-274 (c). This, however, is not a doubtful case. General Statutes \u00a7 31-236 (2) (B) clearly disqualifies an individual from receiving benefits if dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>charged from employment for felonious conduct. The board found that the defendants were discharged for felonious conduct. Whether that conduct was felonious conduct under the laws of the state of Connecticut or of the United States is immaterial. The term \u201cfelonious conduct\u201d as used in the statute is clear and unambiguous and not subject to interpretation. Connecticut being a part of the United States, the legislature must be presumed to have been aware that federal laws operate within our borders. If the legislature had desired an exception for federal felonious conduct, it could easily have inserted one in the statute. It is not the prerogative of the board or the court to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">There is error, the judgment is set aside and the case is remanded with direction to render judgment sustaining the plaintiffs appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">In this opinion Peters C.

Healey, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A3T\">dissenting. I do not agree with the majority that the conduct for which these defendant claimants were discharged constituted \u201cfelonious conduct\u201d within the meaning of General Statutes (Rev. to 1981) \u00a7 31-236 (2) (B) of the Connecticut Unemployment Compensation Act. The administrator of the Connecticut Unemployment Compensation Act initially determined that the claimants were eligible under the act for unemployment benefits. The plaintiff employer appealed this decision to the employment security board of review (the board); General Statutes \u00a7 31-237a (a); which conducted a de novo hearing, made findings of fact, and affirmed the determination of the administrator. The plaintiff employer appealed that decision to the Superior Court, which, in upholding the board, affirmed the administrator\u2019s construction of the act. Against this background, the majority declares that the pertinent provision upon which they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>base their decision is \u201cclear and unambiguous and not subject to interpretation.\u201d I respectfully disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">At the time these claimants applied for unemployment benefits, the Connecticut Unemployment Compensation Act provided in pertinent part that \u201c[a]n individual shall be ineligible for benefits . . . if, <em>in the opinion of the administrator, </em>he has been discharged or suspended for felonious conduct or repeated wilful misconduct in the course of his employment . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 31-236 (2) (B). The \u201copinion of the administrator\u201d language is clear legislative recognition of the administrator\u2019s duties and powers to administer the act with the expertise in that area that he has. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 31-250 through 31-253. We have very recently reiterated our recognition of the deference due to the administrator\u2019s construction of the unemployment compensation statutes which he has the statutory duty and authority to administer. See <em>Fellin </em>v. <em>Administrator, </em>196 Conn. 440, 447, 493 A.2d 174 (1985); see also <em>Burnham </em>v. <em>Administrator, </em>184 Conn. 317, 323, 439 A.2d 1008 (1981) (\u201cstorm Larry\u201d claims). I acknowledge that the deference to be accorded is not absolute. The trial court, however, in a thoughtful decision, not only determined that in this case deference was to be accorded the administrator\u2019s construction of the act but also recognized that the administrator is charged by statute \u201cto presume coverage, eligibility and nondisqualification in doubtful cases.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 31-274 (c); see also <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Unemployment Security Board of Review, </em>181 Conn. 1, 24, 434 A.2d 293 (1980). At the very least, this case is a \u201cdoubtful case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">The administrator and the board were of the opinion that the term \u201cfelonious conduct,\u201d as intended by the legislature, was to be limited to conduct that constituted felonies only under Connecticut law. Although the administrator\u2019s and the board\u2019s construction is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>the only possible construction of the \u201cfelonious conduct\u201d provision, as the majority opinion indicates, it nevertheless is a plausible and supportable construction and, as such, was properly upheld by the trial court. See <em>Connecticut Department of Income Maintenance </em>v. <em>Heckler, </em>471 U.S. , 105 S. Ct. 2210, 2215 n.21, 85 L. Ed. 2d 577 (1985), citing <em>Unemployment Compensation Commission of Alaska </em>v. <em>Aragon, </em>329 U.S. 143, 153, 67 S. Ct. 245, 91 L. Ed. 136 (1946); see <em>also Burnham </em>v. <em>Administrator, </em>supra, 322-23.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">I am aware that tenets of statutory construction should be utilized to resolve, not to create, an ambiguity. Although the majority opinion states that the term \u201cfelonious conduct\u201d may seem \u201cclear and unambiguous,\u201d a legitimate question in my opinion is presented in this case in the context of the act, and the administrator and the board both recognized this.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">The United States Supreme Court has stated that although there is \u201cno more persuasive evidence of the purpose of a statute than the words by which the legislature undertook to give expression to its wishes . . . [frequently, however, even when the plain meaning did not produce absurd results but merely an unreasonable one \u2018plainly at variance with the policy of the legislation as a whole\u2019 . . . [it] has followed that purpose, rather than the literal words.\u201d (Footnotes omitted.) <em>United States </em>v. <em>American Trucking Assns., </em>310 U.S. 534, 543, 60 S. Ct. 1059, 84 L. Ed. 1345 (1940). That court also said \u201c[w]hen aid to construction of the meaning of words, as used in the statute, is available, there certainly can be no \u2018rule of law\u2019 which forbids its use, however clear the words may appear on \u2018superficial examination.\u2019 \u201d Id., 543-44. A statute \u201cdoes not become ambiguous merely because the parties contend for differing meanings . . . [but rather] [t]he intent of the legislature is to be found in the meaning of the words of the statute; that is, in what the legislature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>actually <em>did </em>say, not in what it <em>meant </em>to say.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>Harris Data Communications, Inc. </em>v. <em>Heffernan, </em>183 Conn. 194, 198, 438 A.2d 1178 (1981); see also <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Unemployment Security Board of Review, </em>supra, 6-7 (construing the \u201cvoluntary quit\u201d provision of General Statutes \u00a7 31-236 [2]). When circumstances justify, and they do in this case, \u201ca court may use available aids to construction no matter how clear the statute may appear at first inspection.\u201d <em>Brigham </em>v. <em>United States, </em>539 F.2d 1312, 1316 n.8 (3d Cir. 1976); see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Duncan, </em>527 F.2d 1278, 1280 (3d Cir. 1976). \u201cA word or statute is ambiguous when capable of being interpreted by reasonably well-informed persons in either of two or more senses.\u201d <em>Town of Vernon </em>v. <em>Waukesha County, </em>99 Wis. 2d 472, 477, 299 N.W.2d 593 (1980), aff\u2019d, 102 Wis. 2d 686, 307 N.W.2d 227 (1981); 73 Am. Jur. 2d, Statutes \u00a7 258 (1974). That is the situation in this case. The term \u201cfelonious conduct\u201d as used in the Connecticut Unemployment Compensation Act falls squarely within this category, and in this case the administrator and the board qualify as \u201creasonably well-informed persons.\u201d Still, the majority does not consider this a \u201cdoubtful case.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 31-274 (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">Courts should accord \u201c \u2018 \u201cgreat deference to the construction given the statute by the agency charged with its enforcement.\u201d \u2019 \u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>Connecticut State Board of Labor Relations, </em>190 Conn. 235, 241, 460 A.2d 1255 (1983); see also <em>Fellin </em>v. <em>Administrator, </em>supra, 447. Various appellate courts, in this context of acknowledging this black-letter principle of administrative law; see, e.g., 2 Am. Jur. 2d, Administrative Law \u00a7 241 (1962); have used such terms as \u201cconsiderable deference\u201d; <em>Gladstone, Realtors </em>v. <em>Village of Bellwood, </em>441 U.S. 91, 107, 99 S. Ct. 1601, 60 L. Ed. 2d 66 (1979); \u201csubstantial deference\u201d; <em>Quern </em>v. <em>Mandley, </em>436 U.S. 725, 738, 98 S. Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>2068, 56 L. Ed. 2d 658 (1978); \u201cgreat deference\u201d; <em>Van Wyk </em>v. <em>Bergland, </em>570 F.2d 701, 705 (8th Cir. 1978); and \u201cmost respectful consideration.\u201d <em>Faile </em>v. <em>South Carolina Employment Security Commission, </em>267 S.C. 536, 540, 230 S.E.2d 219 (1976); see also 2 Am. Jur. 2d, supra, \u00a7 241 (\u201chighest respect\u201d). This is particularly so when the agency interpretation can be said \u201cto be a reasoned and supportable interpretation of the statute.\u201d <em>Levine </em>v. <em>Fairleigh Dickinson University, </em>646 F.2d 825, 831 (3d Cir. 1981), citing <em>Whirlpool Corporation v. Marshall, </em>445 U.S. 1, 11, 100 S. Ct. 883, 63 L. Ed. 2d 154 (1980). Of course, \u201cthe weight [to be accorded an agency determination] in a particular case will depend upon the thoroughness evident in its consideration, the validity of its reasoning, its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements, and all factors which give it power to persuade, if lacking power to control.\u201d <em>Skidmore s. Swift &amp; Co., </em>323 U.S. 134, 140, 65 S. Ct. 161, 89 L. Ed. 124 (1944).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">The application of those tenets of statutory construction show that there can be no question that the administrator\u2019s and the board\u2019s decisions in this matter constitute a reasonable and supportable interpretation of this provision of the Connecticut Unemployment Compensation Act, particularly in light of both the legislative mandate of \u00a7 31-274 (c) creating a presumption of eligibility <em>and </em>the \u201cin the opinion of the administrator\u201d language of the disqualification provision, \u00a7 31-236 (2) (B). For these reasons alone, the determination that these claimants were eligible for unemployment compensation was entitled to significant deference by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">Further, as the trial court pointed out, the administrator and the board, when faced with this question of first impression, looked to the legislative history of the 1977 amendments to the Act, of which the \u201cfelonious conduct\u201d language was one part, and particularly the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>remarks of Senator James J. Murphy, who had introduced the 1977 amendments that included this language on behalf of the joint standing committee on labor and industrial relations. In response to a question whether a definition existed for the newly added \u201cfelonious conduct\u201d language for disqualification in the case of a discharge, Senator Murphy explained the amendment as follows: \u201cMr. President, what is intended by this language <em>as far as putting it as to legislative </em>intent, what we\u2019re talking about here, we\u2019re talking about conduct which an employee would be guilty of, which conduct would constitute a felony <em>under our general judicial penalty or criminal statutes.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) 20 S. Proc., Pt. 4,1977 Sess., p. 1553. It is clear that he was referring to \u201cour\u201d Connecticut criminal statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">Moreover, in 1982, the General Assembly amended the same provision by adding as a disqualifying factor \u201cparticipation in an illegal strike as determined by state or federal laws or regulations.\u201d Public Acts 1982, No. 82-262, \u00a7 2, codified at General Statutes \u00a7 31-236 (2) (B). Significantly, the legislature made no amendment to the \u201cfelonious conduct\u201d language of \u00a7 31-236 (2) (B). Although this 1982 amendment may indicate some legislative dissatisfaction with the administrator\u2019s determination of these claimants\u2019 eligibility for unemployment compensation, it must be pointed out that there is no indication that the legislature intended to alter the construction by the administrator and the board of the \u201cfelonious conduct\u201d language. It is axiomatic that the legislature is presumed to know the existing law, including the interpretation given by the administrative agency charged with its enforcement and implementation. Moreover, it is a well settled canon of statutory construction that provisions that are reenacted into law, as was the \u201cfelonious conduct\u201d language, continue to operate as they had prior to any amendment. An amendatory act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>presumably does not change the existing law any further than is expressly declared or necessarily implied. <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Unemployment Security Board of Review, </em>supra, 21 n.6; <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Institute of Living, Inc., </em>175 Conn. 49, 63, 392 A.2d 491 (1978); <em>State </em>v. <em>Fahy, </em>149 Conn. 577, 582, 183 A.2d 256 (1962), rev\u2019d, 375 U.S. 85, 84 S. Ct. 229, 11 L. Ed. 2d 171 (1963). That presumption has not been shown to be rebutted in this case. In addition, the legislature has also mandated that \u201c[n]o part of [the Unemployment Compensation Act] shall be deemed repealed by subsequent legislation if such construction can reasonably be avoided.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 31-274 (b). Therefore, because the legislature has not expressly repealed the administrator\u2019s construction of the phrase \u201cfelonious conduct,\u201d that construction must be still given full effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\">Under the circumstances of this case as set out above, including the remedial purpose of the act, I agree with the trial court and would affirm the administrator\u2019s decision, which is a reasonable and supportable one.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">I would find no error and, therefore, I dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
