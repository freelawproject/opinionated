The sole issue on appeal is whether the trial court erred in finding that, for the purposes of the forcible entry and detainer statute, the plaintiff had actual possession of the demised premises. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-11\">An examination of the record reveals that on or about November 17,1981, the plaintiff and the city of Bridge<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>port parking authority executed two documents by which the plaintiff leased forty-eight square feet in both the Bridgeport train station and the Bridgeport bus terminal. Each document described the exact location of the square footage in the leased premises and defined the use to- be \u201cthe operation by the public of four (4) coin operated video machines.\u201d These documents were duly recorded in the Bridgeport town clerk\u2019s office.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">The plaintiff constructed wooden enclosures around the video machines in both locations. These enclosures consisted of two sides, a roof, and electrical wiring. In addition, the enclosure in the train station had a sign placed over it reading \u201cCommuter Break.\u201d A roll-down security gate was installed by the plaintiff at the bus station enclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">The video machines remained on the demised premises from December 10,1981, until May 7, 1982. During this period, the plaintiff made monthly rental payments to the defendant for the use of these designated areas. On the latter date, while the plaintiff was present, the defendant had the video machines removed from the railroad station by two armed police officers and two parking commission employees. The machines were placed in a locked storage room and detained by the defendant. The video machines located in the bus terminal were removed on the same day and were locked in the cashier\u2019s office. The plaintiff was not on those premises at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">The right of action for forcible entry and detainer is a creature of statute. <em>Harbor View Building Corporation </em>v. <em>Baron, </em>10 Conn. Sup. 100, 101 (1941). General Statutes \u00a7 47a-43 provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) When any person ... (3) enters into any land, tene<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>ment or dwelling unit and causes damage to the premises or damage to or removal of or detention of the personal property of the possessor . . . the party thus ejected, held out of possession, or suffering damage may exhibit his complaint to any judge of the superior court.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A plaintiff suing under the forcible entry and detainer statute must prove his <em>actual </em>possession of the land or property from which he claims to have been dispossessed. <em>Carrier </em>v. <em>Carrier, </em>85 Conn. 203, 207, 82 A. 187 (1912); <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Raymond, </em>18 Conn. 91, 100 (1846). The defendant does not challenge the trial court\u2019s finding that his entry at the train station was by force. Nor does the defendant challenge the finding that his detainer of the video machines at the bus terminal was by force. Rather, he contends that the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the plaintiff was in actual possession of the demised areas is clearly erroneous. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>The question of whether the plaintiff was in actual possession at the time of the defendant\u2019s entry is one for the trier of fact. <em>Gray </em>v. <em>Finch, </em>23 Conn. 495, 513-14 (1855). Generally, the inquiry is whether the individual has exercised the dominion and control that owners of like property usually exercise. 35 Am. Jur. 2d, Forcible Entry and Detainer \u00a7 15; see <em>Hancock </em>v. <em>Finch, </em>126 Conn. 121, 123, 9 A.2d 811 (1939). Although the defendant argues otherwise, it is not necessary that there be a continuous personal presence on the land by the person maintaining the action. There, however, must be exercised at least some actual physical control, with the intent and apparent purpose of asserting dominion. 35 Am. Jur. 2d, supra, \u00a7 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">The evidence before the trial judge included leases and accompanying documentation and testimony which described the wooden enclosures built around the machines, the roll-down security gate at the bus terminal and the \u201cCommuter Break\u201d sign at the train station. In its totality, this evidence warranted the court\u2019s finding that the plaintiff exercised sufficient dominion and control to constitute actual possession of the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b405-12\"> The plaintiff commenced two separate actions against the defendant, one based on the removal of the video machines located in the train station, and the other based on the removal of the video machines located in the bus terminal. The actions were consolidated at trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b406-8\"> The validity of these two leases is being challenged by the defendants in a separate proceeding. The trial judge properly found that their legitimacy was irrelevant to this action. See <em>Carrier </em>v. <em>Carrier, </em>85 Conn. 203, 206-207, 82 A. 187 (1912).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b407-6\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 47a-43.
