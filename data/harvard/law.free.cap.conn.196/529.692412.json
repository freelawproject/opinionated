Healey, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A45\">This appeal arises from an action brought by the plaintiff, Samuel R. Perille, against both his former employer, RaybestosManhattan-Europe, Inc. (Raybestos), and a former coworker, Joseph Tighe. Specifically, the plaintiff appeals from the trial court\u2019s determination on Raybestos\u2019 motion for summary judgment that the Connecticut Workers\u2019 Compensation Act bars this action against his former employer. See General Statutes \u00a7 31-284 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">The plaintiff had been employed with Raybestos at its Stratford facility for a number of years prior to his voluntary resignation in September, 1980. In 1978, Tighe, also a Raybestos employee, was transferred into the same department in which the plaintiff worked. For whatever reasons, the plaintiff and Tighe did not peaceably coexist. According to the plaintiff, Tighe \u201cover a long period of time did ridicule, molest, harass, torment, tease, threaten and ultimately assault [him].\u201d Several on-the-job episodes occurred in which Tighe allegedly assaulted the plaintiff and had to be physically restrained by other Raybestos employees. These incidents were brought to the attention of their immediate supervisor. The plaintiff maintains that Raybestos took no corrective action with respect to either the plaintiff or Tighe, and the plaintiff finally resigned from Raybestos in 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">The plaintiff, in February, 1981, applied for workers\u2019 compensation for injuries allegedly received by him during his employment at Raybestos. An informal hearing was held in May, 1981, on the plaintiff\u2019s claim for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>compensation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In August, 1981, he instituted this legal action in a four count complaint against the defendants Raybestos and Tighe. Sounding in tort, the three counts directed against Raybestos claimed that the plaintiff sustained \u201csevere mental and physical harm\u201d as a result of Raybestos\u2019 alleged breach of an implied condition of its employment contract, violation of General Statutes \u00a7 31-49, and \u201cnegligence and carelessness.\u201d The fourth count, directed against his former coworker Tighe, alleged assault and battery.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">Raybestos, by way of special defense, pleaded that the \u201calleged injuries arose out of and in the course of [the plaintiff\u2019s] employment,\u201d and that, in accordance with \u00a7 31-284 (a), workers\u2019 compensation provided his exclusive remedy. Raybestos\u2019 motion for summary judgment based on this special defense of exclusivity was granted on all three counts against it.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the trial court, in granting summary judgment for the defendant Raybestos, erred in that: (1) the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act does not constitute an employee\u2019s sole remedy \u201cif the employer engages in serious and willful misconduct\u201d; (2) \u201ca knowing violation of an employer\u2019s duty to provide his employees with a safe place to work permits a direct action against the employer\u201d under General Statutes \u00a7 31-49; and (3) summary judgment was improper in this case because of the existence of \u201cunresolved questions of fact.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>Under our Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, \u201c[a]n employer shall not be liable to any action for damages on account of personal injury sustained by an employee arising out of and in the course of his employment . . . . \u201d General Statutes \u00a7 31-284 (a); <em>Mingachos </em>v. <em>CBS, Inc., </em>196 Conn. 91, 98, 491 A.2d 368 (1985); <em>Jett </em>v. <em>Dunlap, </em>179 Conn. 215, 216, 425 A.2d 1263 (1979). \u201cIn previous decisions under the [Workers\u2019] Compensation Act we have consistently held that where a worker\u2019s personal injury is covered by the act, statutory compensation is the sole remedy and recovery in common-law tort against the employer is barred.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Jett </em>v. <em>Dunlap, </em>supra, 217. An employee\u2019s injury is compensable under the act \u201cif it is an injury \u2018arising out of and in the course of employment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Morin </em>v. <em>Lemieux, </em>179 Conn. 501, 504, 427 A.2d 397 (1980); see also General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 31-275 (8), (12), 31-294; <em>Bakelaar </em>v. <em>West Haven, </em>193 Conn. 59, 67, 475 A.2d 283 (1984); <em>Klapproth </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>156 Conn. 276, 279, 240 A.2d 886 (1968); <em>Dennison </em>v. <em>Connecticut Good Humor, Inc., </em>130 Conn. 8, 10, 31 A.2d 332 (1943). As we have stated, \u201c[a]n intentional tort committed upon one employee by another, which causes personal injury arising out of and in the course of his employment, is covered by the compensatory provisions of the [Workers\u2019] Compensation Act. <em>Willis </em>v. <em>Taylor &amp; Fenn Co., </em>137 Conn. 626, 627-28, 79 A.2d 821 (1951); 82 Am. Jur. 2d, Workmen\u2019s Compensation \u00a7 330.\u201d <em>Jett </em>v. <em>Dunlap, </em>supra, 218.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">We recognized in <em>Jett </em>that \u201c[u]nless the defendant employer intentionally directed or authorized [the coworker] to strike the plaintiff, the employer has a right to view the incident as an injury arising out of and in the course of employment, another \u2018industrial mishap in the factory, of the sort he has a right to consider exclusively covered by the compensation system.\u2019 2A Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation (1976) \u00a7 68.21, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>p. 13-11.\u201d Id., 218. We concluded, accordingly, that \u201c[i]f the assailant can be identified as the alter ego of the corporation, or the corporation has directed or authorized the assault, then the corporation may be liable in common-law tort; if the assailant is only another employee who cannot be so identifed, then the strict liability remedies provided by the [Workers\u2019] Compensation Act are exclusive and cannot be supplemented with common-law damages.\u201d Id., 219.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">In the present case, the assaults and other conduct alleged to form the basis for this action clearly were perpetrated by one co-worker against another and occurred during work hours on the employer\u2019s premises. The plaintiff has made no allegation either that Tighe acted \u201cas the alter ego\u201d of Raybestos or that Raybestos had \u201cdirected or authorized\u201d the assaults in question. Id. The plaintiff does allege that Raybestos <em>\u201cwillfully and maliciously </em>failed to provide the plaintiff with a reasonably safe place to work . . .\u2019\u2019despite his claim that \u201con numerous occasions [he] notified the defendant ... its agents, servants and/or employees, of the continuous conduct of . . . Tighe.\u201d The plaintiff seems to argue that such nonfeasance on the employer\u2019s part distinguishes the present case from <em>Jett </em>v. <em>Dunlap; </em>by \u201cknowingly tolerating\u201d Tighe\u2019s alleged behavior towards him, Raybestos in effect \u201cnot only condoned it but actually encouraged it,\u201d thereby itself engaging in wilful and serious misconduct and thus taking the case outside the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">In <em>Mingachos </em>v. <em>CBS, Inc., </em>supra, we recently explicated the \u201cwilful or serious misconduct\u201d exception we had enunciated in <em>Jett </em>v. <em>Dunlap, </em>supra, to the exclusive remedy principle expressed in General Statutes \u00a7 31-284 (a). We explained that to be outside of the purview of \u00a7 31-284 (a), the employer must have engaged in <em>intentional </em>misconduct, as that has been defined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>through our case law; see, e.g., <em>Markey </em>v. <em>Santangelo, </em>195 Conn. 76, 77-78, 485 A.2d 1305 (1985); <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Doody, </em>119 Conn. 532, 534, 178 A. 51 (1935); directed against its employee. <em>Mingachos </em>v. <em>CBS, Inc., </em>supra, 102-103. Anything short of \u201cgenuine intentional injury\u201d sustained by the employee and caused by the employer is compensable under the Act. Id., 108. While the defendant employer in the present case may have been \u201cnegligent,\u201d as this plaintiff alleged, in its failure to take corrective measures that would have served to eliminate the likelihood of the claimed encounters between the plaintiff and his co-worker, none of the plaintiff\u2019s allegations, fairly read, indicated that Raybestos genuinely \u201cintended\u201d the occurrence of any of the plaintiff\u2019s resulting injuries.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Id., 101-102, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>107-108. \u201cUnless the employer has commanded or expressly authorized the assault, it cannot be said to be intentional from his standpoint any more than from the standpoint of any third person.\u201d 2A Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law (1976) \u00a7 68.21; see <em>Jett </em>v. <em>Dunlap, </em>supra, 219.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">Additionally, in arguing against the exclusivity of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, the plaintiff claims that under General Statutes \u00a7 31-49 he may maintain a direct action against Raybestos for \u201ca knowing violation of an employer\u2019s duty to provide his employees with a safe place to work.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Section 31-49 provides: \u201cIt shall be the duty of the master to exercise reasonable care to provide for his servant a reasonably safe place in which to work, reasonably safe appliances and instrumentalities for his work and fit and competent persons as his colaborers and to exercise reasonable care in the appointment or designation of a vice-principal and to appoint as such vice-principal a fit and competent person. The default of a vice-principal in the performance of any duty imposed by law on the master shall be the default of the master.\u201d The plaintiff contends that this provision \u201chas not been changed by\u201d the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act and thus permits a direct action against the employer for a breach of its statutory duty even though the injury alleged may be compensable under the act. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">Again, as we stated in <em>Mingachos </em>v. <em>CBS, Inc., </em>supra, although \u201cour Workers\u2019 Compensation Act [does not] bar tort actions against an employer that deliberately intended to injure its employee . . . \u2018the common-law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>liability of the employer cannot, under the almost unanimous rule . . . be stretched to include accidental injuries caused by the gross, wanton, wilful, deliberate, intentional, reckless, culpable, or malicious negligence, <em>breach of statute, </em>or other misconduct of the employer short of genuine intentional injury.\u2019 (Footnotes omitted.) 2A Larson, supra, \u00a7 68.13.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 107-108. In <em>Mingachos, </em>however, we were not directly confronted with any claims based upon \u00a7 31-49. In addressing this claim, we should examine the historical underpinnings of \u00a7 31-49 as well as its evolution over the years. \u201cThe court, in construing a legislative act, considers its history, its language, the purpose it is designed to serve and the circumstances surrounding its enactment . . . . \u201d <em>Bahre </em>v. <em>Hogbloom, </em>162 Conn. 549, 554, 295 A.2d 547 (1972); see also <em>Fidelity Trust Co. </em>v. <em>BVD Associates, </em>196 Conn. 270, 492 A.2d 180 (1985). \u201cThe legislative objects must be taken into account. <em>Norwalk </em>v. <em>Daniele, </em>143 Conn. 85, 87, 119 A.2d 732 [1955].\u201d <em>Bahre </em>v. <em>Hogbloom, </em>supra, 554-55.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">Our examination turns to the mid-nineteenth century when the industrial revolution was well underway. This court in <em>Hayden </em>v. <em>Smithville Mfg. Co., </em>29 Conn. 548 (1861), adopted the English rule of law which then held that \u201can employee can not recover for an injury suffered in the course of his business from defective machinery, unless the employer knew or ought to have known the fact, and the employee did not know it or had not equal means of knowing it.\u201d Id., 560. Although this common law duty required the employer to provide safe equipment for work and to give warnings of dangers of which the employee had not the \u201cequal means\u201d to be aware, the employee might nevertheless be denied any recovery for an employer\u2019s breach of that duty under the doctrine of assumption of the risk. See generally Prosser, Torts (4th Ed. 1971) \u00a7 80. Soon thereafter, the fellow-servant doctrine was also adopted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>by this court in <em>Burke </em>v. <em>Norwich &amp; Worcester R. Co., </em>34 Conn. 474 (1867); see also Prosser, supra. In that case it was stated: \u201cthat a master is not liable to a servant for an injury to him occasioned by the misconduct or negligence of a fellow-servant, has been so often recognized both in this country and in England that it must now be considered as settled law.\u201d <em>Burke </em>v. <em>Norwich &amp; Worcester R. Co., </em>supra, 479, citing <em>Farwell </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Worcester R. Co., </em>45 Mass. (4 Met) 49 (1842). We nevertheless questioned even then the \u201cjustness\u201d of the \u201creasoning\u201d underlying the fellow-servant rule. Id. This court further commented: \u201cWith respect to considerations of policy, it is by no means certain that the public interest would not be best subserved by holding the superior, with his higher intelligence, his surer means of information, and his power of selecting, directing, and discharging subordinates, to the strictest accountability for their misconduct in his service, whoever may be the sufferer from it.\u201d Id., 480; see Grillo, \u201cFifty Years of Workmen\u2019s Compensation\u2014 An Historical Review,\u201d 38 Conn. B.J. 239 (1964). Subsequently, this court softened the impact of the fellow-servant rule when we held in <em>Darrigan </em>v. <em>New York &amp; New England R. Co., </em>52 Conn. 285, 307 (1885) that, regardless of the rule\u2019s vitality and under the particular facts of that case, \u201c[rjeason, justice and law require that the [employer] should be held responsible.\u201d In <em>Darrigan, </em>this court observed that \u201cthe principles which we think should govern this case have been embodied in an act of Parliament [in 1880] and are now the law of England.\u201d Id., 308. Near the turn of the century, this court again expressed its dissatisfaction with the fellow-servant rule, although we said that it \u201cis too firmly established as law by a multitude of decisions to be now reversed or seriously modified by any exercise of the power vested in courts.\u201d <em>Nolan </em>v. <em>N.Y., N.H. &amp; H. R. Co., </em>70 Conn. 159, 194, 39 A. 115 (1898). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>In noting that England, where the fellow-servant rule had originated, had in effect abolished it through the 1897 \u201cWorkmen\u2019s Compensation Act\u201d; see Epstein, \u201cThe Historial Origins and Economic Structure of Workers\u2019 Compensation Law,\u201d 16 Ga. L. Rev. 775, 797-800 (1982); this court stated in a substantial footnote: \u201cBut the evil is too deep seated to be remedied by judicial action; it needs radical treatment through wise legislation.\u201d <em>Nolan </em>v. <em>N.Y., N.H. &amp; H. R. Co., </em>supra, 195.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">Regarding the employer\u2019s common law: duty to its employees, this court stated in 1891: \u201cThe rule of duty of master to servant is well settled in this state. It is the master\u2019s duty to exercise reasonable care to provide for his servant a reasonably safe place in which to work, reasonably safe appliances and instrumentalities for his work, and fit and competent persons as his co-laborers. It is equally well settled that performance of these duties cannot be effected by the simple giving of an order, \u2014by their execution being entrusted to another. The designation of an agent, however fit and competent that agent may be, for the execution of the master\u2019s duties, does not fill out the sum of the master\u2019s obligation, nor serve to relieve the master from further responsibility.\u201d <em>McElligott </em>v. <em>Randolph, </em>61 Conn. 157, 161-62, 22 A. 1094 (1891); see also <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Willimantic Linen Co., </em>50 Conn. 433 (1883). Subsequently and arguably in response to our evolving case law and in part to the court\u2019s invitation in 1898 in <em>Nolan </em>v. <em>N.Y, N.H. &amp; H. R. Co., </em>supra, the General Assembly in 1901 passed \u201cAn Act Concerning the Liability of Employers,\u201d which legislatively adopted the employer\u2019s duty as it had been articulated in <em>McElligott </em>v. <em>Randolph, </em>supra.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Now codified as General Statutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>\u00a7 31-49, that provision has remained intact and unchanged since its initial codification in 1902. <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> See General Statutes (1902 Rev.) \u00a7 4702; (1918 Rev.) \u00a7 5320; (1930 Rev.) \u00a7 5211; (1949 Rev.) \u00a7 7367; (1958 Rev.) \u00a7 31-49. Prior to the enactment in 1913 of our first workers\u2019 compensation act, this duty, as enunciated in both case law and this statute, seemed to provide the catalyst for legal actions instituted to establish employer liability for on-the-job injuries sustained by employees. During this period, verdicts awarded plaintiffs for work related injuries were upheld by this court. See, e.g., <em>Coogan </em>v. <em>Aeolian Co., </em>87 Conn. 149, 87 A. 563 (1913); <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Bishop Co., </em>85 Conn. 607, 84 A. 87 (1912); <em>Delinks </em>v. <em>N.Y., N.H. &amp; H. R. Co., </em>85 Conn. 102, 81 A. 1036 (1911); <em>Belevicze </em>v. <em>Platt Bros. &amp; Co., </em>84 Conn. 632, 81 A. 339 (1911); <em>Worden </em>v. <em>Gore-Meenan Co., </em>83 Conn. 642, 78 A. 422 (1910); <em>Swain </em>v. <em>O\u2019Loughlin, </em>80 Conn. 200, 67 A. 480 (1907); <em>Brennan </em>v. <em>Berlin Iron Bridge Co., </em>74 Conn. 382, 50 A. 1030 (1902); see also <em>Cavanaugh </em>v. <em>Windsor Cut Stone Corporation, </em>80 Conn. 585, 69 A. 345 (1908) (new trial ordered on plaintiff\u2019s appeal from verdict of only nominal damages).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">In 1913, the legislature finally enacted, without a dissenting vote, our state\u2019s \u201cWorkmen\u2019s Compensation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>Law,\u201d which went into effect on January 1,1914. See generally Grillo, \u201cFifty Years of Workmen\u2019s Compensation \u2014 An Historical Review,\u201d supra; Williams, \u201cDistinction between \u2018Employee\u2019 and \u2018Independent Contractor,\u2019 \u201d 2 Conn. B.J. 282, 286 (1928). Thereafter, we stated that the \u201cpurpose of our Act . . . is to give to the employee and to his dependents compensation for the loss of wages accruing from the employee\u2019s injury.\u201d <em>Bassett </em>v. <em>Stratford Lumber Co., </em>105 Conn. 297, 303, 135 A. 574 (1926). The act establishes, as part of an \u201con-going social compact,\u201d a system that \u201ccompromise[s] an employee\u2019s right to a common law tort action for work related injuries in return for relatively quick and certain compensation.\u201d <em>Mingachos </em>v. <em>CBS, Inc., </em>supra, 97, 105. Historically then, workers\u2019 compensation \u201cestablished almost a complete substitute for the common law of torts, as it affected the liability of industrial employers to their employees.\u201d Id., 98 n.10, quoting 1 Harper &amp; James, Torts (1956), p. xliii. In light of this historical survey, we next examine the tenets of statutory construction applicable in our examination of \u00a7 31-49.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">We have repeatedly stated that \u201c \u2018[t]he General Assembly is always presumed to know all the existing statutes and the effect that its action or non-action will have upon any one of them. And it is always presumed to have intended that effect which its action or non-action produces.\u2019 \u201d <em>New Haven Water Co. </em>v. <em>North Branford, </em>174 Conn. 556, 565, 392 A.2d 456 (1978); <em>Pizzola </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>167 Conn. 202, 205, 355 A.2d 21 (1974); <em>Knoll </em>v. <em>Kelley, </em>142 Conn. 592, 595, 115 A.2d 678 (1955); <em>State </em>v. <em>Staub, </em>61 Conn. 553, 566, 23 A. 924 (1892); see also <em>N.Y., N.H. &amp; H. R. Co.\u2019s Appeal, </em>80 Conn. 623, 635, 70 A. 26 (1908). \u201c \u2018[W]hen two statutes relate to the same subject matter every effort should be made to find a reasonable field for the operation of both statutes . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>[and] where there is a reasonable field of operation for each statute which does not impinge on the domain of the other, it is the court\u2019s duty to give them concurrent effect.\u2019 \u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (85-BC), </em>195 Conn. 344, 365, 488 A.2d 790 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">In considering \u00a7 31-49, we are mindful that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act was enacted after it and that, despite various amendments to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, \u00a7 31-49 has never been amended. We are entitled to presume that, in passing a statute, the legislature not only did so with knowledge of the existing statutes but also that it did not intend to enact a conflicting statute. See <em>State ex rel. Sloane </em>v. <em>Reidy, </em>152 Conn. 419, 425, 209 A.2d 674 (1965); <em>State ex rel. Pape </em>v. <em>Dunais, </em>120 Conn. 562, 566, 181 A. 721 (1935). While the fact that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act postdated \u00a7 31-49 is not controlling, a subsequent legislative act \u201cmay throw light on the legislative intent of a former related act.\u201d <em>General Realty Improvement Co. </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>133 Conn. 238, 242, 50 A.2d 59 (1946); <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Cato, </em>147 Conn. 418, 421, 162 A.2d 175 (1960). That act is of \u201cbroad humanitarian scope\u201d; <em>DeCarli </em>v. <em>Manchester Public Warehouse Co., </em>107 Conn. 359, 364, 140 A. 637 (1928); and is \u201cremedial\u201d and \u201cshould be broadly construed to accomplish its humanitarian purpose.\u201d <em>Adzima </em>v. <em>UAC/Norden Division, </em>177 Conn. 107, 117, 411 A.2d 924 (1979). \u201c \u2018The purpose of the workmen\u2019s compensation law has <em>always </em>been to provide compensation for an injury arising out of and in the course of the employment regardless of fault . . . .\u2019\u2019\u2019(Citations omitted.) <em>Plainville </em>v. <em>Travelers Indemnity Co., </em>178 Conn. 664, 669, 425 A.2d 131 (1979). It is thus fair to proceed on the premise that the act was intended to be and is the exclusive remedy available where it appears that the necessary employer-employee relationship exists and the injury-producing transaction arises <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>out of and in the course of that employment unless it is demonstrated otherwise.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">In speaking to \u00a7 31-49, we recognize, however, that we cannot assume that a legislative enactment is \u201cdevoid of purpose.\u201d <em>Savings Bank of Rockville </em>v. <em>Wilcox, </em>117 Conn. 188, 193, 167 A. 709 (1933). \u201cSound construction requires that the statute be considered \u2018in the light of its history, its language, the purpose it is designed to serve and the circumstances surrounding its enactment.\u2019 <em>Connecticut Mutual Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>113 Conn. 14, 25, 154 A. 246 [1931].\u201d <em>Savings Bank of Rockville </em>v. <em>Wilcox, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Palozie, </em>165 Conn. 288, 334 A.2d 468 (1973). We have already noted that the passage of \u00a7 31-49 predates that of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. Certain of the language in \u00a7 31-49, as originally enacted and as it remains today, was adopted verbatim from this court\u2019s decision in <em>McElligott </em>v. <em>Randolph, </em>supra, 161, and the balance of the statute incorporates the substance of other language in <em>McElligott. </em>See also <em>Channon </em>v. <em>Sanford Co., </em>70 Conn. 573, 578-79, 40 A. 462 (1898); <em>Gerrish </em>v. <em>New Haven Ice Co., </em>63 Conn. 9, 16-17, 27 A. 235 (1893). <em>McElligott </em>and <em>Gerrish </em>are cases that in substantive language enunciate the \u201cvice-principal\u201d language of \u00a7 31-49. We note parenthetically that while Professor Larson suggests that \u201cthe vice-principal doctrine\u201d is an \u201coutmoded concept\u201d; 2A Larson, The Law of Workmen\u2019s Compensation (1982) \u00a7 72.14; that view has met with demurrer. See <em>Athas </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>54 Md. App. 293, 303 n.9, 458 A.2d 859 (1983), and cases there cited. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>concept of vice-principals, of course, involves those who exercise some recognized common law nondelegable duty of the employer. See <em>Schatz </em>v. <em>York Steak House Systems, Inc., </em>51 Md. App. 494, 496, 444 A.2d 1045 (1982). We have already referred to the substantial footnote by Justice Hammersley writing for the court in <em>Nolan </em>v. <em>N.Y., N.H. &amp; H. R. Co., </em>supra, 194-95, which, fairly read, made the case for legislative and not judicial action. The original version of what is now \u00a7 31-49 was then passed. Some of our decisions thereafter sustained plaintiffs\u2019 verdicts in circumstances strongly suggesting that the rationale of \u00a7 31-49 applied. In <em>Swain </em>v. <em>O\u2019Loughlin, </em>supra, 204-205, in setting out the defendant employer\u2019s duty, we cited not only <em>McElligott </em>v. <em>Randolph, </em>supra, but also General Statutes \u00a7 4702 (now \u00a7 31-49). Section 31-49 still enjoys vitality where appropriate. See, e.g., <em>Balla </em>v. <em>Lonergan, </em>143 Conn. 197, 120 A.2d 705 (1956); see also General Statutes \u00a7 31-50. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Act and \u00a7 31-49 thus coexist in our statutory law, each to apply where appropriate. Since the case before us is clearly within the scope of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, \u00a7 31-49 provides no basis for the action asserted by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">Under these circumstances, it was not error for the trial court to have granted the defendant Raybestos\u2019 motion for summary judgment. We said <em>in Mingachos </em>v. <em>CBS, Inc., </em>supra, 111, that \u201c \u2018[t]he party moving for summary judgment \u201chas the burden of showing the absence of any genuine issue as to all the material facts, which, under applicable principles of substantive law, entitle him to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d \u2019 \u201d (Citations omitted.) A defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment is properly granted if it raises at least one legally sufficient defense that would bar the plaintiff\u2019s claim and involves no triable issue of fact. See 10A Wright, Miller &amp; Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure (2d Ed. 1983) \u00a7 2734. That is the case here. \u201cBecause the bur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>den of proof is on the moving party, the facts presented must be viewed in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Mingachos </em>v. <em>CBS, Inc., </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">Viewing the circumstances on summary judgment in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, any injury incurred by the plaintiff in this matter, at least as it pertains to the defendant Raybestos\u2019 alleged culpability, resulted from the employer\u2019s negligent supervision of its employees and as a matter of law was barred by our Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. See <em>LaBonte </em>v. <em>National Gypsum Co., </em>110 N.H. 314, 317, 269 A.2d 634 (1970). Therefore, under the circumstances, in view of \u00a7 31-284 (a) and the holdings of <em>Jett </em>v. <em>Dunlap, </em>supra, <em>and Mingachos </em>v. <em>CBS, Inc., </em>supra, \u201cwe find no error in the conclusion of the court that there existed no genuine issue as to any material fact and in its rendition of judgment for the defendant.\u201d <em>Horney </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>167 Conn. 621, 623, 356 A.2d 879 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">In this opinion Peters, C. J., Dannehy and F. Hennessy, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b545-7\"> The parties to this appeal acknowledge that a decision on the plaintiff\u2019s claim for workers\u2019 compensation has yet to be rendered. We anticipate that the workers\u2019 compensation determination will be forthcoming following publication of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b545-8\"> The defendant coworker, Joseph Tighe, has filed a counterclaim against the plaintiff, alleging that the plaintiff instigated the July, 1979 \u201cassault and battery.\u201d (Although the defendant characterizes this pleading as a \u201ccross complaint,\u201d it is under our practice rules a counterclaim. See <em>Home Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Todd, </em>195 Conn. 333, 340, 487 A.2d 1095 [1985].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b548-5\"> The plaintiff places great reliance upon <em>Mike </em>v. <em>Borough of Aliquippa, </em>279 Pa. Super. 382, 421 A.2d 251 (1980), to support its position that the employer may not be shielded from actions at law based on the intentional assault by a fellow employee. Such reliance is misplaced. The Pennsylvania Workers\u2019 Compensation Act \u201cspecifically excludes from [its] coverage an assault or attack by third persons because of personal animosity against the employee and which does not result because of the relationship between the employer and the employee.\u201d Id., 388; see Pa. Stat. Ann., tit. 77, \u00a7 411 (Purdon Sup. 1984). This \u201cthird person\u201d exclusion has been apparently construed to encompass \u201cfellow employees.\u201d See, e.g., <em>Gillespie </em>v. <em>Vecenie, </em>292 Pa. Super. 11, 436 A.2d 695 (1981); <em>Mike </em>v. <em>Borough of Aliquippa, </em>supra. We note that <em>Gillespie </em>and <em>Mike </em>have since been explained to mean \u201cthat an employer cannot be vicariously liable for the intentional acts of his employee. Rather, when an employee\u2019s intentional act, motivated by personal reasons, was foreseeable by the employer, the employer may be liable on a negligence theory for not providing a safe work place.\u201d <em>Scantlin </em>v. <em>Ulrich, </em>318 Pa. Super. 407, 412, 465 A.2d 19 (1983). Under <em>Jett </em>v. <em>Dunlap, </em>179 Conn. 215, 425 A.2d 1263 (1979), and <em>Mingachos </em>v. <em>CBS, Inc., </em>196 Conn. 91, 491 A.2d 368 (1985), that Pennsylvania rule is not the law in this state. See General Statutes \u00a7 31-307 and our discussion thereof in <em>Mingachos </em>v. <em>CBS, Inc., </em>supra, 104-106. The rationale of these Pennsylvania cases therefore is not applicable to construction of the Connecticut act. Nor is the rationale of <em>Blankenship </em>v. <em>Cincinnati Milacron Chemicals, Inc., </em>69 Ohio St. 608, 433 N.E.2d 572, cert. denied, 459 U.S. 857, 103 S. Ct. 127, 74 L. Ed. 2d 110 (1982), or <em>of Mandolidis </em>v. <em>Elkins Industries, Inc., </em>246 S.E.2d 907 (W. Va. 1978), upon which the plaintiff also relies, applicable. See <em>Mingachos </em>v. <em>CBS, Inc., </em>supra, 107-108.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b549-7\"> In the second count of his complaint, the plaintiff attempts to state a claim under General Statutes \u00a7 31-49 by alleging that the defendant Raybestos\u2019 conduct in this matter violated that statutory provision. The third count of his complaint sounds in negligence and seems to allege that \u00a7 31-49 establishes the employer\u2019s statutory duty as well as the applicable standard of care. Our discussion of \u00a7 31-49 applies to both the second and third counts where apposite.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b552-6\"> \u201cCHAPTER 155.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">\u201cAn Act concerning the Liability of Employers.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">\n<em>\u201cBe it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Assembly convened:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b552-9\">\u201cSection 1.

As I am confused by the rationale of the majority opinion for the continuing viability of General Statutes \u00a7 31-49 after enactment of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, I feel obliged to advance my own explanation for its present coexistence. I agree with the majority, nevertheless, that \u201c\u00a7 31-49 provides no basis for the action asserted by the plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b558-9\">At the time our first workers\u2019 compensation act was enacted in 1913 and for many years thereafter its coverage did not extend to employers of fewer than five persons. Public Acts 1913, c.138, pt. A, \u00a7 2. The number of employees required to make the statute applicable has been reduced until, since 1967, it applies to any<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>one \u201cusing the services of one or more employees for pay.\u201d Public Acts 1967, No. 842, \u00a7 1; General Statutes \u00a7 31-275. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Act still excludes from coverage: \u201c(A) An outworker; (B) one whose employment is of a casual nature, and who is employed otherwise than for purposes of the employer\u2019s trade or business; (C) a member of the employer\u2019s family dwelling in his house ... (D) any person engaged in any type of service in or about a private dwelling provided he is not regularly employed by the owner or occupier over twenty-six hours per week; or (E) an employee of a corporation who is a corporate officer and who elects to be excluded from coverage . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 31-275 (5).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">Section 31-49 is applicable wherever the master-servant relationship exists, regardless of whether more than one employee is hired or whether one of the exceptions to the coverage of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act set forth in \u00a7 31-275 (5) is applicable. In this limited area of civil liability, \u00a7 31-49 still may be regarded as playing a significant role in modifying some of the obsolete doctrines of the common law with respect to work-related injuries. See <em>Balla </em>v. <em>Lonergan, </em>143 Conn. 197, 199, 120 A.2d 705 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">In addition to its civil liability implications, \u00a7 31-49 is expressly included among those employment regulation statutes that the labor commissioner has a statutory duty to enforce \u201cby giving proper orders or notices to the persons or corporations owning, operating or managing the factories or buildings inspected by him and shall make complaint to the state\u2019s attorneys of any violation of said provisions.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 31-50. The retention of \u00a7 31-49 after passage of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, therefore, in no way modifies the provisions of General Statutes \u00a7 31-284 (a) exempting employers from civil actions for damages on account of personal injuries sustained by employees who are covered by the act.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
