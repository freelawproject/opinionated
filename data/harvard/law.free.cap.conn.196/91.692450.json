(CBS). On November 29, 1979, he died as a result of those injuries. On June 3, 1981, the plaintiff, Marcelino Mingachos, as administrator of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>the decedent\u2019s estate, instituted an action in three counts seeking compensatory and punitive damages against CBS and several individual fellow employees of the decedent, Rocco Pennozza, Charles Joseph and Andrew Dodd.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">The first two counts were directed to CBS. They alleged, in substance, that the explosion and the decedent\u2019s injuries and death were caused by CBS\u2019 \u201cviolations\u201d of certain enumerated Connecticut \u201cstatutory regulations\u201d and federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration Act (OSHA) regulations, that the violations were \u201cwillful\u201d and \u201creckless,\u201d and that \u201cthe natural and probable consequence reasonably to be anticipated . . . would be death or serious injury.\u201d The third count was directed to Pennozza, Joseph and Dodd. It also alleged in substance that the explosion and the decedent\u2019s injuries and death \u201cwere caused by and were the direct result\u201d of the individual defendants\u2019 violation of the same Connecticut \u201cstatutory regulations\u201d and federal OSHA regulations as alleged in the two earlier counts, that the violations were \u201cwilful,\u201d and again that \u201c[t]he natural and probable consequence reasonably to be anticipated . . . [therefrom] would be death or serious injury.\u201d The defendant CBS\u2019 answer to the first and second counts included the special defense of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (the act) and asserted the exclusivity of the act as a bar.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The special defense of the act was also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>interposed to the third count, with the individual defendants asserting its exclusivity because the case did not fall within the exceptions of \u00a7 31-293a<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of the act. Thereafter, the plaintiff filed his motion to strike the special defenses to all three counts \u201cfor the reason that said allegations do not constitute special defenses to an action for willful and intentional torts.\u201d The court, <em>Sullivan, J., </em>denied the motion as to the first two counts and granted it as to the third count.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">Thereafter, a three count amended complaint was filed. The first two counts, as amended, now alleged that the explosion and the decedent\u2019s injuries and death <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>were caused by \u201cCBS\u2019s violations and actions . . .\u2019\u2019of certain enumerated Connecticut statutory regulations and OSHA regulations, that \u201c[s]aid actions and violations\u201d were, as to the first count, \u201cwilful and intentional, and created a hazardous condition\u201d and that they were, as to the second count, \u201creckless, and created a hazardous condition.\u201d As to each of these two counts, it was now alleged that despite \u201cCBS\u2019 knowledge that such hazardous violations and conditions existed,\u201d it failed to correct them, it failed to warn its employees, and it failed to report them to certain governmental agencies as required by law. It was further alleged that this failure to correct, warn and report was, on the part of CBS, \u201cintentional, malicious, and in willful and wanton disregard of the health of the plaintiff\u2019s decedent and caused his injuries and consequent death.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">The defendants thereafter filed their motion for summary judgment<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> in which they asserted that the plaintiff\u2019s claim was \u201cbarred by law.\u201d The motion also alleged that \u201c[a]ll three counts . . . are based on the violations of the defendants of certain OSHA rules and regulations and are barred by Connecticut General Statutes Section 31-369 (b) and 29 United States Code Section 653 (b) (4).\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The court, <em>Maiocco, J., </em>granted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>the summary judgment motion as to all three counts. This appeal followed. <footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the trial court erred: (1) in overruling his motion to strike the special defenses to the first and second counts of the original complaint and (2) in granting summary judgment for the defendants on all three counts of his amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">The basic issue in this appeal is whether an employer has immunity from suit under General Statutes \u00a7 31-284 of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act when the employer is sued in intentional tort. The manner, however, in which the case was presented and argued to two judges in the trial court, one who decided the plaintiff\u2019s motion to strike special defenses to the original complaint and one who rendered summary judgment for the defendants on the later filed amended complaint, requires individual treatment.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u201cWe review this case on the theory upon which it was tried and upon which the trial court decided [each motion].\u201d (Citations <em>omitted.) Fuessenich v. DiNardo, </em>195 Conn. 144, 151, 487 A.2d 514 (1985). The basic issue does, however, permeate both motions which the parties have briefed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>separately although both with some overlapping. Accordingly, our discussion of the act will likewise permeate our determination of both motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">We first address the plaintiffs claims against the defendant employer. To do so we must necessarily examine the scope of General Statutes \u00a7 31-284, the \u201cexclusivity\u201d provision of the Connecticut Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">\u201cThe purpose of the workmen\u2019s compensation statute is to compensate the worker for injuries arising out of and in the course of employment, without regard to fault, by imposing a form of strict liability on the employer.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Jett </em>v. <em>Dunlap, </em>179 Conn. 215, 217, 425 A.2d 1263 (1979). The act is to be broadly construed to effectuate the purpose of providing compensation \u201cfor an injury arising out of and in the course of the employment regardless of fault.\u201d <em>Klapproth </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>156 Conn. 276, 279, 240 A.2d 886 (1968); <em>Stapf v. Savin, </em>125 Conn. 563, 565, 7 A.2d 226 (1939). Under typical workers\u2019 compensation statutes, employers are barred from presenting certain defenses to the claim for compensation, the employee\u2019s burden of proof is relatively light, and recovery should be expeditious. In a word, these statutes compromise an employee\u2019s right to a common law tort action for work related injuries in return for relatively quick and certain compensation. See <em>Iverson </em>v. <em>Atlas Pacific Engineering Ltd., </em>143 Cal. App. 3d 219, 191 Cal. Rptr. 696 (1983); 81 Am. Jur. 2d, Workmen\u2019s Compensation \u00a7 2 (1976); see generally Larson, \u201cThe Nature and Origins of Workmen\u2019s Compensation,\u201d 37 Cornell L.Q. 206 (1952). The purposes of the act itself are best served by allowing the remedial legislation a reasonable sphere of operation considering those purposes. See <em>Adzima </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>v. <em>UAC/Norden Division, </em>177 Conn. 107, 117, 411 A.2d 924 (1979).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">Under General Statutes \u00a7 31-284 (a) an \u201cemployer\u201d within the scope of the act is not liable in \u201cany action for damages on account of <em>personal injury </em>sustained by an employee arising out of and in the course of his [or her] employment or on account of death resulting from <em>personal injury </em>so sustained . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) The act mandates that the term \u201c[p]ersonal injury . . . shall be construed to include, in addition to <em>accidental </em>injury which may be definitely located as to the time when and the place where the <em>accident </em>occurred, an injury to an employee which is causally connected with his employment and is the direct result of repetitive trauma or repetitive acts incident to such employment, and occupational disease as herein defined.\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 31-275 (8); see <em>Plainville </em>v. <em>Travelers Indemnity Co., </em>178 Conn. 664, 669-70, 425 A.2d 131 (1979). \u201cEvery word in a legislative enactment is presumed to have meaning. <em>State ex rel. Kennedy </em>v. <em>Frauwirth, </em>167 Conn. 165, 168, 355 A.2d 39 (1974).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>184 Conn. 102, 107, 441 A.2d 53 (1981). We have recognized that \u201ccourts do not torture words to import ambiguity where the ordinary meaning leaves no room for it . . . .\u201d <em>Heffernan </em>v. <em>Slapin, </em>182 Conn. 40, 46, 438 A.2d 1 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>Under the act, <em>\u201cin addition to </em>accidental injury,\u201d the definition of \u201cpersonal injury\u201d or \u201cinjury\u201d clearly encompasses any other specified injuries \u201ccausally connected\u201d with employment. (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 31-275 (8). The act\u2019s coverage is necessarily broad in scope, encompassing more than merely injuries resulting from \u201caccidents,\u201d giving that word its plain meaning. See General Statutes \u00a7 1-1; <em>Rivera </em>v. I. <em>S. Spencer\u2019s Sons, Inc., </em>154 Conn. 162, 164, 223 A.2d 808 (1966); 81 Am. Jur. 2d, Workmen\u2019s Compensation \u00a7 29, p. 725 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">We have recently recognized a narrow exception to the exclusivity of the act. In <em>Jett </em>v. <em>Dunlap, </em>supra, we held that an employee\u2019s action claiming intentional assault by another employee \u201cidentified as the alter ego\u201d of the employer would not be barred by \u00a7 31-284. Id., 219. This \u201calter ego\u201d exception maybe applicable in instances in which \u201cthe assailant is of such rank in the corporation that he may be deemed the alter ego of the corporation under the standards governing disregard of the corporate entity.\u201d Id.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Jett, </em>which involved an assault upon an employee by his work supervisor, does not, however, avail the plaintiff in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">The plaintiff would have us construe \u00a7 31-284 so that this provision would not bar actions at law against employers in cases such as the one now before us. He points to the statement in <em>Jett </em>v. <em>Dunlap, </em>supra, 218, that \u201c[a]n intentional tort committed upon one employee by another, which causes personal injury aris<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>ing out of and in the course of his employment, is covered by the compensatory provisions of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act.\u201d Going on, he also refers to the dicta in <em>Jett </em>v. <em>Dunlap, </em>supra, 221, where we said: \u201cWhere such wilful or serious misconduct is engaged in by an employer, as identified by the standard we set forth today, then a plaintiff may pursue common-law remedies.\u201d It is therefore clear, he continues, that by this later language we have created for intentional torts committed by an employer an exception to the exclusivity defense of the act for injuries sustained in the course of a worker\u2019s employment and so, when injury results from the commission of an intentional tort by an employer, an employee \u201cis permitted to pursue remedies beyond those contemplated by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">In the present appeal the plaintiff is really requesting that we extend judicially the <em>Jett </em>exception to \u00a7 31-284 to include injuries to employees resulting from \u201cintentional,\u201d or \u201cwilful,\u201d or \u201creckless\u201d violations by the employer of safety standards established pursuant to federal and state laws, such as OSHA. In the absence of any such legislative direction, we decline to do so for a number of reasons that we set forth as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">First, our decisional law constrains us from giving such an expansive reading of the terms \u201cintentional,\u201d \u201cwilful,\u201d or \u201creckless\u201d because they have been previously defined in the context of common law tort actions. We begin our analysis here by pointing out that it is generally agreed that workers\u201d compensation laws were not intended to shield an employer from common law liability for injuries he intentionally inflicted upon his employee. See <em>Shearer </em>v. <em>Homestake Mining Co., </em>557 F. Sup. 549, 553 (D.S.D. 1983), aff\u2019d, 727 F.2d 707 (8th Cir. 1984); 2A Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law (1976) \u00a7\u00a7 68.10 and 68.13. It will be useful to put such terms as \u201cwilful,\u201d \u201cintentional\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>\u201creckless\u201d in context considering the plaintiffs core claim that the Connecticut Workers\u2019 Compensation Act is not a defense available to the defendant employer in this tort action.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">In his description of intentional tortious conduct, Dean Prosser has said: \u201c \u2018Intent\u2019 is the word commonly used to describe the desire to bring about the physical consequences [of an act] .... Intent, however, is broader than a desire to bring about physical results. It must extend not only to those consequences which are desired, but also to those which the actor believes are substantially certain to follow from what he does.\u201d Prosser, Torts (4th Ed. 1971) \u00a7 8. Similarly, according to the second Restatement of Torts, \u201cintent\u201d refers \u201cto the consequences of an act rather than to the act itself\u201d; 1 Restatement (Second), Torts \u00a7 8A, comment (a) (1965); and therefore \u201c[t]he word \u2018intent\u2019 . . . denotefs] that the actor desires to cause [the] consequences of his act, or that he believes that the consequences are substantially certain to follow from it.\u201d 1 Restatement (Second), Torts \u00a7 8A (1965).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Thus, the concept of \u201cintent\u201d in relation to tortious conduct has reference to the consequences of the act rather than to the act itself. One court has thus stated: \u201cBut a high risk or probability of harm is not equivalent to the substantial certainty without which an actor cannot be said to intend the harm in which his act results.\u201d <em>Shearer </em>v. <em>Homestake Mining Co., </em>supra, 559. In terms of intentional tort then, the use of the word \u201cintent\u201d in allegations \u201cis not a talisman that can change the allegations into colorable claims of true intentional torts.\u201d <em>Keating </em>v. <em>Shell Chemical Co., </em>610 F.2d 328, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>332 (5th Cir. 1980). Nor is it any more so with the allegations of a \u201cwilful\u201d act, as Justice Cardozo stated in <em>Messersmith </em>v. <em>American Fidelity Co., </em>232 N.Y. 161, 165-66, 133 N.E. 432 (1921): \u201cEvery act, if we exclude, as we must, gestures or movements that are automatic or instinctive, is willful when viewed in isolation and irrespective of its consequences. ... A driver turns for a moment to the wrong side of the road, in the belief that the path is clear, and deviation safe. The act of deviation is willful, but not the collision supervening.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">To bypass the exclusivity of the act, the intentional or deliberate act or conduct alleged must have been designed to cause the injury that resulted.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Such a concept is nothing new to our jurisprudence. Only recently, drawing on our earlier cases, we said: \u201c \u2018A wilful and malicious injury is one inflicted intentionally without just cause or excuse. It does not necessarily involve the ill will or malevolence shown in express malice. Nor is it sufficient to constitute such an injury that the act resulting in the injury was intentional in the sense that it was the voluntary action of the person involved. Not only the action producing the injury but the resulting injury must be intentional.\u2019 <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Doody, </em>119 Conn. 532, 534, 178 A. 51 (1935). \u2018A wilful or malicious injury is one caused by design. Wilfulness and malice alike import intent. . . . [Its] characteristic element is the design to injure either actually entertained or to be implied from the conduct and circumstances.\u2019 <em>Sharkey </em>v. <em>Skilton, </em>83 Conn. 503, 507-508, 77 A. 950 (1910). The intentional injury aspect may be satisfied if the resultant bodily harm was the direct and natural consequence of the intended act. <em>Alteiri </em>v. <em>Colasso, </em>168 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>Conn. 329, 334, 362 A.2d 798 (1975).\u201d <em>Markey </em>v. <em>San</em>tangelo, 195 Conn. 76, 77-78, 485 A.2d 1305 (1985). It is also well recognized that \u201c[although the line between a highly foreseeable risk and an intentional tort often grows thin, it has always been deemed to exist: \u2018On the other hand, the mere knowledge and appreciation of a risk, short of substantial certainty, is not the equivalent of intent. The defendant who acts in the belief or consciousness that he is causing an appreciable risk of harm to another may be negligent, and if the risk is great his conduct may be characterized as reckless or wanton, but it is not classed as an intentional wrong. In such cases the distinction between intent and negligence obviously is a matter of degree. Apparently the line has been drawn by the courts at the point where the known danger ceases to be only a foreseeable risk which a reasonable man would avoid, and becomes a substantial certainty.\u2019 \u201d <em>Keating </em>v. <em>Shell Chemical Co., </em>supra, 332, quoting Prosser, supra, 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">Alleged misconduct deemed to be \u201creckless,\u201d as the plaintiff also claims, differs from intentional misconduct. \u201cWhile an act to be reckless must be intended by the actor, the actor does not intend to cause the harm which results from it.\u201d 3 Restatement (Second), Torts \u00a7 500, comment f (1965). \u201cIt is enough that he realizes or, from facts which he knows, should realize that there is a strong probability that harm may result, even though he hopes or even expects that his conduct will prove harmless. However, a strong probability is a different thing from a <em>substantial certainty </em>without which he cannot be said to <em>intend </em>the harm in which his act results.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">A second reason that the \u00a7 31-284 (a) exclusivity rule bars common law actions for damages against employers for safety violations is the present statutory scheme itself. We have previously recognized that in construing the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, this court \u201cmakes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>every part operative and harmonious with every other part insofar as is possible . . . .\u201d <em>Bahre </em>v. <em>Hogbloom, </em>162 Conn. 549, 554, 295 A.2d 547 (1972). \u201cThe entire enactment must be examined and its parts reconciled and made operative so far as possible.\u201d <em>Kulis </em>v. <em>Moll, </em>172 Conn. 104, 111, 374 A.2d 133 (1976), quoting <em>United Aircraft Corporation v. Fusari, </em>163 Conn. 401, 411, 311 A.2d 65 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">In 1978, the General Assembly amended the act to include a provision that allows a greater amount of compensation to be paid to an employee \u201cwho suffers any injury or illness caused by his employer\u2019s violation of any health or safety regulation . . . after such violation has been cited in accordance with [OSHA or Connecticut OSHA] and not abated within the time fixed by the citation . . . .\u201d Public Acts 1978, No. 78-360, \u00a7 1, codified at General Statutes \u00a7 31-307.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> This provision buttresses the defendant employer\u2019s position that the legislature did not intend to abrogate the exclusivity principle in a case such as that presented here.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">It is axiomatic that compensation in common law tort serves a two-fold purpose: deterrence of socially undesirable conduct and compensation to those persons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>harmed by such conduct of others. See generally Prosser, Torts (4th Ed. 1971) \u00a7\u00a7 1, 3; 1 Harper &amp; James, Torts (1956), pp. xxxix-xlii. In pertinent part \u00a7 31-307 fulfills both of these purposes as the legislature obviously intended. First, the increase in workers\u2019 compensation from 66% to 75 percent of average weekly earnings permitted thereunder was designed to provide an incentive to employers to make the corrections necessary to ensure safe workplaces for their employees. 21 S. Proc., Pt. 6,1978 Sess., pp. 2342-43; 21 S. Proc., Pt. 7, 1978 Sess., pp. 2726-29; Hearings before the Joint Standing Committee on Labor and Industrial Relations, 1978 Sess., pp. 102,109,118-22, 125,130-31,149-50. This increase in compensation to employees for work related injuries due to safety violations within the scope of \u00a7 31-307 was a remedy provided them by the legislature within the confines of the act itself. The \u201cseventy-five per cent\u201d compensation rate allowable in such \u00a7 31-307 cases thus serves as a recent component of the legislative recognition of the on-going social compact of the existing workers\u2019 compensation system in this state for injuries within the scope of its coverage. See 21 S. Proc., Pt. 6,1978 Sess., pp. 2342-43; 21 S. Proc., Pt. 7,1978 Sess., pp. 2728-29; Hearings before the Joint Standing Committee on Labor and Industrial Relations, 1978 Sess., pp. 102, 109, 125.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">We note that the added remedy under \u00a7 31-307, which the legislature contemplated would be <em>the </em>remedy available to an employee injured due to the employer\u2019s unsafe working conditions, only applies to cases in which a covered employee is injured as a result of the employer\u2019s failure to take appropriate corrective measures <em>after </em>it has received a citation under either General Statutes \u00a7 31-375 or federal OSHA for a violation due to the offending condition. Because the issuing of the citation begins the running of the period of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>the employer\u2019s potential \u00a7 31-307 workers\u2019 compensation liability, the employer must be on notice that the unsafe condition exists for the \u201cseventy-five per cent\u201d provision to apply. A fortiori, even injuries that occur as a result of unsafe conditions of which the employer has actual notice in the form of a citation are within the scope of the act, and thus the statutory scheme of the act serves to bar common law actions in such cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">The third reason that we decline to construe \u00a7 31-284 as not barring such actions is that to do so would in this case usurp the legislative function.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> One court, in a workers\u2019 compensation case has said that \u201c[a] damage suit as an alternative or additional source of compensation, becomes permissible only by carving a judicial exception in an uncarved statute. . . .

It replaced the demurrer in our practice. Practice Book \u00a7 151.

The allegations of the pleading involved are entitled to the same favorable construction a trier would be required to give in admit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>ting evidence under them and if the facts provable under its allegations would support a defense or a cause of action, the motion to strike must fail. <em>Alarm Applications Co. </em>v. <em>Simsbury Volunteer Fire Co., </em>supra. Where, as in this instance, the motion to strike challenges the legal sufficiency of the special defense of the act to the original complaint, we must consider the complaint in the same posture as did the trial court. See <em>Ivey, Barnum &amp; O\u2019Mara </em>v. <em>Indian Harbor Properties, Inc., </em>supra, 530 n.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">In overruling the plaintiff\u2019s motion to strike and in determining that the act was the exclusive remedy, the trial court noted that the plaintiff had merely alleged \u201cwillful\u201d and \u201creckless\u201d violations of state and federal safety regulations and \u201csignificantly\u201d had \u201cnot alleged an \u2018intentional\u2019 injury.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The trial court thus rejected the plaintiff\u2019s arguments that \u00a7 31-284 (a) did not bar a tort action alleging wilful or reckless conduct on the part of the employer and that if \u00a7 31-284 (a) bars an employee from workers\u2019 compensation \u201cwhen the personal injury has been caused by the wilful and serious misconduct of the injured employee ...\u201d then the employer should be barred from raising the act\u2019s exclusivity as a defense when the employer is likewise charged with wilful, reckless or serious misconduct. The trial court maintained that this same argument had been rejected by this court in <em>Jett </em>v. <em>Dunlap, </em>179 Conn. 215, 218, 425 A.2d 1263 (1979), and also refused to follow <em>Mandolidis </em>and <em>Blankenship, </em>decisions from other jurisdictions. Because the act provides the exclusive remedy to the employee for conduct alleged in the origi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>nal complaint, the trial court\u2019s denial of the plaintiff\u2019s motion to strike the special defense was not clearly erroneous. Practice Book \u00a7 3060D.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">We also note that in those two counts the plaintiff based his action on the defendant\u2019s claimed violations of statutory regulations promulgated under both Connecticut and federal \u201cOSHA\u201d statutes. Neither Connecticut nor federal law provides that alleged violations of OSHA can be the basis of a private right of action \u201cwith respect to injuries, diseases or death of employees arising out of and in the course of employment.\u201d See General Statutes \u00a7 31-369 (b) and 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 653 (b) (4); <em>Jeter </em>v. <em>St. Regis Paper Co., </em>507 F.2d 973, 976-77 (5th Cir. 1975); annot., 35 A.L.R. Fed. 461 (1977). We have said, however, that regulations promulgated under OSHA are admissible, if applicable, as <em>evidence </em>in personal injury cases of the standard of care. <em>Wendland </em>v. <em>Ridgefield Construction Services, Inc., </em>184 Conn. 173, 181, 439 A.2d 954 (1981); see <em>Van Steensberg </em>v. <em>Lawrence &amp; Memorial Hospitals, </em>194 Conn. 500, 506, 481 A.2d 750 (1984). It would then appear that both the state and federal OSHA acts do not intend to \u201csupersede or in any manner affect\u201d existing rights, duties or liabilities of affected parties for those referenced matters arising out of or in the course of employment. Accordingly, a complaint which does not allege a legal duty but only alleges violation of federal or state OSHA regulations is vulnerable to a motion to strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">In sum, in the light of the applicable law, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act was properly pleaded as a special defense to the first two counts of the original complaint. The trial court, therefore, recognizing the exclusivity of the act, correctly denied the motion to strike the special defenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b124-9\">We turn now to the plaintiff\u2019s claim that the trial court erroneously granted the defendants\u2019 motion for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>summary judgment. The party moving for summary judgment \u201c \u2018has the burden of showing the absence of any genuine issue as to all the material facts, which, under applicable principles of substantive law, entitle him to a judgment as a matter of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>D.H.R. Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Donnelly, </em>180 Conn. 430, 434, 429 A.2d 908 (1980). Because the burden of proof is on the moving party, the facts presented must be viewed in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion. <em>Evans Products Co. </em>v. <em>Clinton Building Supply, Inc., </em>174 Conn. 512, 516, 391 A.2d 157 (1978). The party opposing such a motion must recite facts in accordance with Practice Book \u00a7 381. <em>Citizens National Bank </em>v. <em>Hubney, </em>182 Conn. 310, 312, 438 A.2d 430 (1980). Supporting and opposing affidavits \u201cshall be made on personal knowledge, shall set forth such facts as would be admissible in evidence, and shall show affirmatively that the affiant is competent to testify to the matters stated therein.\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 381; <em>Citizens National Bank </em>v. <em>Hubney, </em>supra; <em>Evans Products Co. </em>v. <em>Clinton Building Supply, Inc., </em>supra, 514.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">After the trial court\u2019s action on the motion to strike, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint. The first two counts, which repeated many of the allegations of the original complaint, now alleged the following: That the explosion and the decedent\u2019s injuries and death were caused by \u201cCBS\u2019s actions and [violations] . . .\u2019\u2019of certain enumerated Connecticut statutory regulations and OSHA regulations, that \u201csaid actions and violations\u201d were, as to the first count, \u201cwillful and intentional, and created a hazardous condition\u201d and that they were, as to the second count, \u201creckless, and created a hazardous condition.\u201d As to each of these two counts, it was now alleged that despite \u201cCBS\u2019 knowledge that such hazardous violations and conditions existed,\u201d it failed to correct these conditions and violations, it failed to warn its employees, including the plaintiff\u2019s decedent, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>of them, and it failed to report them to certain governmental agencies as required by law. It was then further alleged that this failure to correct, warn and report was, on the part of CBS, \u201cintentional, malicious, and in willful and wanton disregard of the health of the plaintiffs decedent and caused his injuries and consequent death.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The defendant employer again interposed the act as a special defense to the first two counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">Thereafter, all the defendants moved for summary judgment on all three counts. Claiming that the plaintiff\u2019s claim is \u201cbarred by law,\u201d their motion alleged that \u201c[a]Il three counts . . . are based on the violations of the defendants of certain OSHA rules and regulations and are barred by Connecticut General Statutes Section 31-369 (b) and 29 United States Code Section 653 (b) (4). . . .\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The trial court granted summary judgment, pointing out that, as to the first two counts, the language of the act in \u00a7 31-284 (a) was broad enough to encompass allegations of intentional misconduct and concluding that the most favorable reading of those counts required the conclusion that the act was a bar. In granting summary judgment on the third count, it recognized the thrust of \u00a7 31-293 (a), but pointed out that federal and state OSHA violations do not give rise to a private right of action. Moreover, the allegations of the amended complaint sound solely in violation of federal and state OSHA regulations, quite apart from, as the defendants claim, the existence of any legal duty. Both the federal and state OSHA statutes provide that such regulations may not be used to create a private cause of action for injuries arising out of or in the course of employment. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 653 (b) (4) and General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>Statutes \u00a7 31-369 (b); see <em>Jeter </em>v. <em>St. Regis Paper Co., </em>507 F.2d 973 (5th Cir. 1975); <em>Wendland </em>v. <em>Ridgefield Construction Services, Inc., </em>184 Conn. 173, 439 A.2d 954 (1981). We find no error in the granting of summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">We reaffirm what we have said earlier in this opinion concerning the purpose, ambit and interpretation of the act in our review of this summary judgment claim. The additional allegations made by the amended complaint do not serve to take any of its counts beyond the exclusivity of the act. We do note that even with the additional allegations each count still only makes out claims of violations of federal and state OSHA regulations quite apart from alleging any legal duty violated by any of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">The act provides the exclusive remedy to employees sustaining work related injuries or death from such injuries \u201ccaused by the negligence or wrong of a fellow employee . . . unless such wrong was wilful or malicious or the action is based on the fellow employee\u2019s negligence in the operation of a motor vehicle . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 31-293a.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> \u201cAlthough the legislative history of \u00a7 31-293a is not especially revealing\u201d; <em>Dias </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>189 Conn. 354, 359, 456 A.2d 309 (1983); the legislature apparently intended to distinguish \u201csimple negligence on the job\u201d from wilful or malicious wrong caused by a co-worker.

Practice Book \u00a7 381. Each defendant employee gave his affidavit personally, specifically disavowing, inter alia, any \u201cwillful intent\u201d to violate any OSH A regulation and each indicating that on the day in question he had spent time in the same area where the accident involved occurred. On the other hand, the only affidavit submitted by the plaintiff was one signed by his attorney, which, after referring to certain attached, unverified, OSHA records, averred that \u201c[tjhese exhibits indicate that the employer was aware of the need for ventilation where the explosion occurred; that the lack of ventilation presented a dangerous condition\u201d; and that \u201c[t]he employer did nothing to correct the need for ventilation until after the accident which killed the decedent.\u201d The record before us on this motion for summary judgment does not disclose that the plaintiff put into dispute the statements of the employees in their affidavit that each had no intent to injure the decedent. There was no genuine issue of material fact. Rather, with the exclusivity of the act, an issue of law emerged and summary judgment was properly granted on all counts of the amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b107-7\"> On March 4,1980, the plaintiffs representatives filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim against the defendant CBS, Inc.

Eliminating, as it did, the necessity of fault as a basis for liability and the fault of the worker, except in its extreme form, as a bar to recovery, the major economic risk of industrial accidents was shifted from the employee to the employer and his insurance carrier on the theory that industry initially and the consumer ultimately could better absorb the costs of such accidents than the individual victims thereof.\u201d 1 Harper &amp; James, Torts (1956), pp. xlii-xliii.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b113-8\"> In elucidating the alter ego theory we applied in <em>Jett </em>v. <em>Dunlap, </em>179 Conn. 215, 425 A.2d 1263 (1979), we took care to point out that \u201c[t]here is a distinction between an assault directly committed or authorized by the employer and an assault committed by a supervisory employee.\u201d Id., 218.

This section stops third party suits against fellow employees since such employee usually is unable to meet any judgment involving serious injuries. However, the section specifically permits suits against fellow employees where the injury or death was the result of wilful or malicious wrong by such fellow employee or involves the operation of a motor vehicle. We are here trying to make sure that a fellow employee cannot ordinarily be sued for simple negligence on the job, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>we do not believe that he should be protected against wilful or malicious wrong, nor do we believe he should be protected if the employee is injured as a result of a motor vehicle accident.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
