J.</author>\n<p id=\"ADs\">This case concerns the eligibility for unemployment compensation of a worker who, having been discharged from his primary employment, voluntarily leaves part-time secondary employment. The plaintiff employee, William Fellin, filed an administrative appeal in the Superior Court from the decision of the employment security board of appeals upholding the determination of the defendant administrator of the Unemployment Compensation Act that he was ineligible for benefits. The trial court dismissed the plaintiffs appeal. When the plaintiff then sought further review in the Appellate Court, this court transferred the case here pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 3004A.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>The underlying facts are undisputed. The plaintiff was a full-time employee of General Motors, his primary employer, for almost nine years until April 8, 1982. During the last eight months of his primary employment, he also worked part-time for General Corporation of America, his secondary employer. Several days after he was laid off from his primary job he voluntarily left his secondary job \u201cto avoid complications with [unemployment] benefit or [sub-benefit] programs and to allow [himself] more available hours for any other full-time employment.\u201d Although the plaintiff had previously been able to transfer his part-time work hours to accommodate his other commitments, he did not seek to change his part-time work schedule but instead terminated his secondary employment on April 11, 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">The plaintiff received unemployment benefits of $176 a week until the defendant administrator, after a hearing, determined that the plaintiff was not entitled to benefits from April 11, 1982, because \u201che voluntarily left suitable work without requisite cause.\u201d See General Statutes \u00a7 31-236 (2) (A).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As a result of this administrative determination, the plaintiff was declared to be ineligible for future benefits until he returned to work and earned ten times his benefit rate; see id.;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and, in addition, was notified to return $3344 representing weekly benefits mistakenly paid to him from April 11 to August 21, 1982. The administrative record indicates that the investigation into the plaintiff\u2019s eligibility was initiated by the claim of the plaintiff\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>secondary employer that the plaintiff \u201cleft our company of his own choosing.\u201d Throughout the administrative proceedings, the sole designated employer was the plaintiffs secondary employer, General Corporation of America.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">The plaintiffs appeal to the employment security appeals division challenged the factual premises upon which the defendant had concluded that the plaintiff was ineligible for unemployment benefits. Before the appeals referee, he argued that he had left his secondary part-time employment for compelling personal cause because he needed time to apply for and to make himself available for full-time work. This claim was rejected and the plaintiff appealed to the board of review of the employment security appeals division, arguing that he had been unaware that he would have been able to continue working part-time without forfeiting partial unemployment benefits and protesting the unfairness of having to repay benefits previously received in good faith. These arguments were also rejected. Throughout his unsuccessful administrative appeals, the plaintiff acted on his own behalf without the assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">Having exhausted his ordinary administrative remedies, the plaintiff sought the advice of counsel, who filed a motion to reopen, addressed to the board of review, and an appeal addressed to the Superior Court. Notably, in both of these challenges, the plaintiff principally claimed error in the factual findings that underlay the determination of his ineligibility for unemployment benefits. The board of review denied his motion to reopen.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The trial court determined that \u201c[t]he action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>of the administrator in denying the claim of the plaintiff for unemployment compensation was not unreasonable, arbitrary or illegal.\u201d The court then rejected the plaintiffs claim that his ineligibility for benefits violated either public policy or the plaintiff\u2019s constitutional rights to substantive due process or equal protection of the laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s appeal to this court puts the plaintiff\u2019s alleged eligibility for unemployment benefits into a new context. Although in one of his claims of error the plaintiff continues to maintain that the administrative decision was unreasonable, arbitrary and an abuse of discretion, the plaintiff\u2019s principal contention now is that the eligibility statute, properly construed, permits a distinction between eligibility for benefits arising out of part-time secondary employment and eligibility for benefits arising out of full-time primary employment. Should this court be disinclined to find such a distinction in the language of \u00a7 31-236 (2) (A), the plaintiff urges us to hold the statute to be so irrational as to violate the equal protection clauses of the United States and the Connecticut constitutions.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">We need not linger at length over the plaintiff\u2019s claim that the referee and the board of review erred in coming to the factual determination that he had left suitable work voluntarily and without sufficient cause connected with his work. As the trial court correctly noted, administrative appeals brought under General Statutes \u00a7 31-249b, insofar as they relate to factual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>findings, are limited to a review of the record certified and filed by the board of review. The scope of such judicial review is in turn limited to the question whether the administrative action was unreasonable, arbitrary, illegal or an abuse of discretion. <em>Burnham </em>v. <em>Administrator, </em>184 Conn. 317, 321-22, 439 A.2d 1008 (1981); <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Unemployment Security Board of Review, </em>181 Conn. 1, 5, 434 A.2d 293 (1980). The trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision persuasively demonstrates that the plaintiff cannot successfully challenge the factual premises of the administrator\u2019s action. In apparent recognition of the futility of further pursuit of this claim of error, the plaintiff\u2019s counsel at oral argument in this court expressly disclaimed any further disagreement with the factual findings underlying the plaintiff\u2019s declared ineligibility for unemployment benefits.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s principal claim on this appeal is that the administrative proceedings were flawed not by factual error but by misconstruction of the applicable statute. Due respect for the remedial purposes of the Unemployment Compensation Act requires, he maintains, a construction of General Statutes \u00a7 31-236 (2) (A) that limits ineligibility for benefits to the <em>particular </em>work that the employee \u201cleft . . . voluntarily and without sufficient cause connected with his work.\u201d This argument has two subparts, only the first of which was presented in the proceedings below. First, the plaintiff contends that, since he was not claiming benefits with regard to his part-time, secondary employment, he should be deemed fully eligible for unemployment benefits arising out of the involuntary termination of his full-time, primary employment. In the alternative, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>the plaintiff contends that he is at least entitled to retain those partial unemployment benefits, arising out of his discharge from his primary full-time work, which he could have collected had he retained his secondary, part-time job. Under either theory, he argues, the statute must be interpreted so that eligibility for unemployment benefits distinguishes between the work that was left without cause and the work from which the employee was discharged without fault.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">This claim of statutory construction, although not fully articulated below, is properly here. Judicial review of administrative proceedings allows for \u201cjudicial scrutiny of claims such as constitutional error; see <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co. </em>v. <em>Norwalk, </em>179 Conn. 111, 117, 425 A.2d 576 (1979); jurisdictional error; <em>Slagle </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>144 Conn. 690, 693, 137 A.2d 542 (1957); or error in the construction of the administrative agency\u2019s authorizing statute. See 2 Cooper, State Administrative Law (1965) 595-602. In addition, the leniency traditionally afforded to inexperienced pro se parties may justify belated consideration of claims not fully explored in earlier proceedings.\u201d <em>Burnham, </em>v. <em>Administrator, </em>supra, 322-23.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">This court has had little opportunity to examine the implications of part-time employment for eligibility for unemployment compensation. The case most closely relevant is <em>Consiglio </em>v. <em>Administrator, </em>137 Conn. 693, 81 A.2d 351 (1951). There a worker voluntarily left part-time work, at a time when she was receiving partial unemployment benefits, in order to obtain a better full-time job with another employer. After two weeks on her new job, she was laid off for lack of work. The administrator found that the worker had left her part-time employment without sufficient cause and concluded that she was totally disqualified for benefits for the statutory disqualification period. Although we empathized with the worker\u2019s legitimate desire to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>obtain a better job, we nevertheless held that \u201c[t]he statute compels disqualification in every case in which an employee has left his work, with the one exception where there is sufficient cause connected with the employment which he leaves, in the opinion of the administrator.\u201d Id., 700. <em>Consiglio </em>is not on all fours, because the partial unemployment benefits that the worker there forfeited were attributable to the work that she voluntarily left, that work having previously been full-time. Furthermore, this particular holding has been statutorily overruled by an express provision added in 1967.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Nonetheless, <em>Consiglio </em>is instructive on two points: our inability to rewrite the Unemployment Compensation Act to reflect our own view of public policy, and our deference to the determinations of those charged with the administration of the unemployment compensation system.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">The more expansive version of the plaintiffs statutory claim is that eligibility for unemployment compensation is causally related to the particular employment that is chargeable for benefits. This claim, which is the only issue of statutory construction that was pursued in the trial court, urges us to read critically the introductory language of \u00a7 31-236 which states that: \u201cAn individual shall be ineligible for benefits . . . .\u2019\u2019Because the statute does not use the words \u201cany and all benefits,\u201d the plaintiff suggests that the statute\u2019s subsequent disqualification of someone who \u201chas left suitable work voluntarily and without sufficient cause connected with his work . . .\u201d can logically be construed to limit disqualification to unemployment benefits attributable to the work voluntarily left. Applying that principle to the facts of this case, the plaintiff urges us to hold that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>he had forfeited unemployment benefits with regard to his part-time secondary work but not with regard to his full-time primary work. We disagree. The plaintiffs argument is inconsistent with our repeated holdings that \u201cthe questions of eligibility and chargeability are, under our unemployment compensation laws, separate and distinct.\u201d <em>Burnham </em>v. <em>Administrator, </em>supra, 324; see <em>Oppenheimer </em>v. <em>Administrator, </em>177 Conn. 593, 594, 419 A.2d 337 (1979). Furthermore, since the plaintiffs argument raises at best a possible ambiguity in the statute, we are well advised to defer to a contrary administrative construction that is facially plausible.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">The more limited version of the plaintiffs statutory claim, and the one he espoused at oral argument, is that he should be entitled to retain the partial benefits that he could have collected had he continued his part-time employment. Under \u00a7 31-229,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the plaintiff\u2019s part-time earnings would have reduced but would not have eliminated his unemployment benefits. Since the plaintiff had no duty to his former full-time employer to take up part-time employment, he maintains that he should not be penalized any further than to put him, and his former full-time employer, in the same position as if he had not voluntarily left his part-time work. In other words, his voluntary departure from his secondary employment should be irrelevant to the benefits attributable solely to his primary employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>In support of his claim, the plaintiff relies on the holdings of a number of courts in other jurisdictions that have afforded similar benefits to part-time workers. See, e.g., <em>Tomlin </em>v. <em>Unemployment Ins. Appeals Board, </em>82 Cal. App. 3d 642, 147 Cal. Rptr. 403 (1978); <em>Neese </em>v. <em>Sizzler Family Steak House, </em>404 So. 2d 371 (Fla. App. 1981); <em>Emerson </em>v. <em>Director of the Division of Employment Security, </em>393 Mass. 351, 471 N.E.2d 97 (1984); <em>Sticka </em>v. <em>Holliday Village South, </em>348 N.W.2d 761 (Minn. 1984); <em>Gilbert </em>v. <em>Hanlon, </em>214 Neb. 676, 335 N.W.2d 548 (1983); but see <em>Grandy </em>v. <em>Phillips, </em>64 App. Div. 2d 796, 408 N.Y.S.2d 155 (1978). These cases emphasize that it furthers the policy of unemployment compensation acts to provide incentives for employees to take part-time work. They suggest that if such employees were to risk the loss of all unemployment benefits upon their subsequent termination of their part-time jobs, they would be less likely to enter into such employment. The decisions also point out that a former full-time employer has no justifiable complaint about his liability for benefits in such cases since, absent the claimant\u2019s optional part-time work, the employer could have been charged for even larger benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>The plaintiffs argument might well be persuasive if, \u201cin the opinion of the administrator\u201d; General Statutes \u00a7 31-236 (2); it is determined to be a reasonable construction of the governing statutes. The record is, however, clear that no such question was ever raised during the proceedings before the referee or the board of review. It is equally clear that the full-time primary employer has never had the opportunity to be heard on this issue. The only employer who participated in the administrative hearings was the part-time secondary employer, who successfully demonstrated that the plaintiff left that employment voluntarily and without cause. Ordinarily, we would hold that the failure to lay a timely administrative foundation for our consideration of this question should bar its belated consideration in this court, especially when the matter was only tangentially addressed in the trial court. Nonetheless, because we are confronted with a novel issue that raises important policy considerations, and because the plaintiff was pro se throughout almost all of the administrative proceedings, we believe that the remedial purposes of the Unemployment Compensation Act counsel a remand to the board of review in this case for consideration of the matter as finally framed before this court.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b465-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>There is error, the judgment of the trial court is set aside and the matter is remanded with direction to remand the case to the board of review for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b455-7\"> Practice Book \u00a7 3004A provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">\u201cThe supreme court may transfer to itself a cause in the appellate court.

However, the possibility of partial eligibility was not addressed in any of these cases.
