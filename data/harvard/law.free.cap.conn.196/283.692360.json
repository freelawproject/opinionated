At the conclusion of the testimony offered by the plaintiff, the defendant moved, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 302, for a judgment of dismissal for failure to make out a prima facie case, and the court rendered judgment accordingly. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>From this judgment the plaintiff has appealed, claiming error in the two grounds relied upon by the court: (1) the change in the location of the plaintiff\u2019s business since the filing of his original application for inclusion on the \u201cmunicipal towers list\u201d; and (2) the failure of the plaintiff to exhaust his administrative remedy. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">Section 29-118<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of the New Haven code of ordinances provides that the chief of police shall prepare and main<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>tain a list of licensed towers who may perform municipal towing services. The municipal towers list includes licensed towers in New Haven who apply for inclusion, not to exceed nine in number. Applicants must meet certain minimum standards relating to operational capacity, including a requirement that they have available a storage area located in New Haven for at least one hundred vehicles.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">On January 7, 1982, the plaintiffs attorney sent a letter purporting to be a formal application for inclusion of the plaintiff on the municipal towers list and referred to his business as being located at 200 Sargent Drive in New Haven. Apparently the occasion for this application was a recent amendment of the ordinance that changed the maximum number of towers on the list from seven to nine. The defendant replied that despite the amendment, he had no intention at that time of increasing the number of towers above seven. In his mandamus action the plaintiff claimed that the defendant had no discretion to set the number of towers on the list at fewer than the number specified as a maximum in the ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">At the time of trial the plaintiff had moved his location from 200 Sargent Drive, as given in his application, to another New Haven address, 465 Boulevard. It also appeared that the plaintiff had never attempted to utilize the formal hearing procedure set forth in \u00a7 17-13<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of the New Haven code for appealing a denial of an application by the chief of police.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>\u201cMandamus is an extraordinary remedy designed to enforce the performance of a plain positive duty, and, as such, the writ will properly issue only when the person against whom it is directed is under a clear legal obligation to perform the act compelled.\u201d <em>Gerrity </em>v. <em>Bisciglia, </em>178 Conn. 235, 238, 423 A.2d 871 (1974). Regardless of whether his stated reason for denying the plaintiffs application was sound, the defendant had no legal duty at the time of trial to grant that application, because it related to the location at 200 Sargent Street no longer occupied by the plaintiff. No application for the new location had ever been submitted to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">The failure to exhaust an available administrative remedy is also a proper ground for denying mandamus. <em>Kays, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>170 Conn. 477, 481, 365 A.2d 1207 (1976). \u201c[IJssuance of the writ has been confined to situations where the aggrieved party has no adequate remedy either at law or in equity.\u201d <em>Milford Education Assn. </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>167 Conn. 513, 519, 356 A.2d 109 (1975). The plaintiff claims that the appeal procedure prescribed by the ordinance would have been fruitless in view of the defendant\u2019s position that the amendment did not require an increase in the number of towers on the list. See <em>Greenwich </em>v. <em>Liquor Control Commission, </em>191 Conn. 528, 542, 469 A.2d 382 (1983). We cannot assume that the defendant would have adhered to his original interpretation of the ordinance upon a formal hearing, where he might have had the opportunity to obtain legal advice. Furthermore, a decision reached following the hearing could have been appealed to the court pursuant to \u00a7 29-116<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>code and General Statutes \u00a7 51-197b. \u201cMandamus does not lie except where there is no other adequate remedy in the ordinary process of the law.\u201d <em>Basney </em>v. <em>Sachs, </em>132 Conn. 207, 209, 43 A.2d 449 (1945).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b298-7\"> Section 29-118 of the New Haven Code of General Ordinances provides as follows: \u201cSec. 29-118. municipal towers list.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">\u201c(a) The chief of police shall prepare and maintain a list of licensed towers who may perform municipal towing services to be called the \u2018municipal towers list.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b298-9\">\u201c(b) The municipal towers list shall include all licensed towers in the City of New Haven who apply for inclusion not to exceed seven in number and who meet the following minimum standards:</p>\n<p id=\"b298-10\">\u201c(1) The tower shall have sufficient operational capacity to accept and respond to all calls for municipal towing services, including, but not limited to, accidents, abandoned vehicles, parking violations, street cleaning, snow removal, parking bans, and removal of vehicles illegally on private property.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-11\">\u201c(2) The tower shall be operational, with an on-premise [sic] employee twenty-four (24) hours per day.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-12\">\u201c(E) The tower shall have a minimum of two (2) radio equipped tow trucks on duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-13\">\u201c(4) The tower shall have storage space available with a minimum of one hundred (100) spaces within the City of New Haven.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-14\">\u201c(5) The tower shall have the capacity to tow vehicles with locked transmissions and steering columns and vehicles stripped of their wheels.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-15\">\u201c(c) The chief of police may, for cause, suspend or remove from the municipal towers list any licensed tower who is in violation of application rules and regulations or any provision of this article, after due notice in writing to the tower and the hearing before the chief of police to be held, if requested by the tower, not less than three days after the date or [sic] such notice.
