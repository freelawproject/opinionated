Healey, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Adxy\">This appeal involves the prior pending action doctrine. The plaintiff, who had been employed by the defendant as a teacher, instituted an administrative appeal under General Statutes \u00a7 10-151 (f)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> from the termination of her employment. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>While that action was pending, the plaintiff, seeking a writ of mandamus and a declaratory judgment, instituted a second, separate action against the same defendant. The factual allegations in both actions are substantially identical, and the trial court, finding that the \u201cultimate goals in both cases are not dissimilar,\u201d granted the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the later action under the prior pending action rule. The plaintiff appeals. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">The present appeal arises from our remand in <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>181 Conn. 69, 434 A.2d 333 (1980). The plaintiff<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> was a tenured teacher employed by the defendant, the city of Bristol board of education, which discharged her from that position in 1974. Thereafter, pursuant to the Teacher Tenure Act; see General Statutes \u00a7 10-151; the plaintiff appealed from that decision to the Court of Common Pleas, which dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>missed the appeal. She then appealed to this court, and in <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>supra, we held that \u201ca tenured teacher discharged for cause under General Statutes \u00a7 10-151 (b) is entitled, as a matter of constitutional law, to a written statement of the decision reached, the reasons for the determination, and a fair summary of the evidence relied upon.\u201d Id., 79. Because these requirements had not been met, we set aside the trial court\u2019s judgment and the matter was remanded \u201cwith direction to return the case to the board for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\u201d Id., 84.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">Thereafter in November, 1980, the defendant board, comprised entirely of members who had not participated in the previous 1974 termination proceeding, \u201cissued \u2018findings and conclusions,\u2019 based upon the record\u201d of the plaintiff\u2019s 1974 pretermination hearing, to substantiate the plaintiff\u2019s discharge. On December 4, 1980, the plaintiff appealed those \u201cactions and decision\u201d of the defendant to the Superior Court where that action (the first action) is still pending. See General Statutes \u00a7 10-151 (f). While the first action was pending, the plaintiff also initiated this second action which forms the subject of this particular appeal before us. Although the allegations of these two complaints, except for one sentence in each,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> are identical, the prayers for relief differ somewhat. In the first action, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>the plaintiff alleged aggrievement and sought a reversal of the defendant\u2019s \u201cfinal decision,\u201d a declaration \u201cthat the action of said Board in attempting to terminate [the] plaintiff\u2019s contract of employment . . . [is] invalid,\u201d and an order \u201cthat this matter be remanded to the Board for a determination of the amount of back wages and benefits owed to [the] plaintiff by [the] defendant.\u201d The prayer for relief in the plaintiff\u2019s second action sought both a writ of mandamus and a declaratory judgment to the effect that the plaintiff either be reinstated to her previous position as a tenured teacher or be granted a \u201cnew hearing\u201d pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 10-151 \u201cto determine whether [the] plaintiff should be terminated from her position with [the] defendant as of the date of the determination resulting from that new hearing\u201d <em>and </em>that the defendant also must hold a \u201chearing\u201d for the purpose of determining \u201cthe amount of back wages and benefits\u201d owed to the plaintiff by the defendant \u201cfor the period of time from her unlawful termination to the date when she is either reinstated or lawfully terminated . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">Alleging lack of subject matter jurisdiction, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss the second action on the ground, inter alia, that it was \u201cvirtually identical to the one filed on December 4, 1980.\u201d See Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 142,143,145. The trial court granted the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss and, in its memorandum of decision, stated: \u201cThe parties in both cases are the same and the allegations raised in the appeal and in the instant action are mutual. Beyond this, both matters were filed and are pending in the same jurisdiction and venue. The court is mindful that the remedy sought in the instant matter is dissimilar to that in the earlier case. This is of no significant consequence. The ultimate goals in both cases are not dissimilar.\u201d The plaintiff appeals from this dismissal, but nevertheless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>concedes in her brief that, if the first appeal \u201cproceeds to a final decision on the merits, this action will be unnecessary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">\u201cIt has long been the rule that when two separate lawsuits are \u2018virtually alike\u2019 the second action is amenable to dismissal by the court. <em>Henry F. Raab Connecticut, Inc. </em>v. <em>J. W. Fisher Co., </em>183 Conn. 108, 112, 438 A.2d 834 (1981).\u201d <em>Solomon </em>v. <em>Aberman, </em>196 Conn. 359, 382, 493 A.2d 193 (1985). The prior pending action doctrine has evolved as a \u201crule of justice and equity\u201d;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Hatch </em>v. <em>Spofford, </em>22 Conn. 485, 494 (1853); and retains its vitality in this state, in which \u201cjoinder of claims and of remedies is permissive rather than mandatory.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Solomon </em>v. <em>Aberman, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">We have explicated the prior pending action doctrine as follows: \u201c \u2018 \u201cThe pendency of a prior suit of the same character, between the same parties, brought to obtain the same end or object, is, at common law, good cause for abatement. It is so, because there cannot be any reason or necessity for bringing the second, and, therefore, it must be oppressive and vexatious.\u201d This is \u201ca rule of justice and equity, generally applicable, and always, where the two suits are virtually alike, and in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>the same jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Hatch </em>v. <em>Spofford, </em>[supra, 494]; <em>Cahill v. Cahill, </em>76 Conn. 542, 547, 57 Atl. 284 [1904].\u2019 <em>Dettenborn </em>v. <em>Hartford-National Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>121 Conn. 388, 392, 185 A. 82 (1936); see <em>Zachs </em>v. <em>Public Utilities Commission, </em>171 Conn. 387, 391-92, 370 A.2d 984 (1976). \u2018The rule forbidding the second action is not, however, one \u201cof unbending rigor, nor of universal application, nor a principle of absolute law . . . .\u201d <em>Hatch </em>v. <em>Spofford, </em>[supra].\u2019 <em>Farley-Harvey Co. </em>v. <em>Madden, </em>105 Conn. 679, 682, 136 A. 586 (1927); see <em>Brochin </em>v. <em>Connecticut Importing Co., </em>137 Conn. 350, 352, 77 A.2d 336 (1950); <em>Dettenborn </em>v. <em>Hartford-National Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>supra, 393.\u201d <em>Henry F. Raab Connecticut, Inc. </em>v. <em>J. W. Fisher Co., </em>supra, 112-13. We must examine the pleadings to ascertain whether the actions are \u201cvirtually alike.\u201d See <em>Solomon </em>v. <em>Aberman, </em>supra, 383.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">The allegations contained in the plaintiff\u2019s complaints in both actions are identical, and, as we have already explained, the actions arise from the same factual background. Therefore, although we have recognized that \u201c[t]he fact that the damages sought by the plaintiff in these two cases may overlap is not dispositive\u201d; <em>Solomon </em>v. <em>Aberman, </em>supra, 385; it is necessary in this case to analyze the prayers for relief in these two complaints in order to ascertain the \u201cends or objects\u201d of these two actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">In the first action, the administrative appeal taken pursuant to \u00a7 10-151 (f), the plaintiff is seeking a determination from the trial court that the defendant\u2019s \u201cfinal decision\u201d be reversed, that the defendant\u2019s attempt to terminate her \u201cbe declared invalid and of no effect,\u201d and that the matter be remanded to the defendant for the purpose of determining the amount of back pay and benefits the plaintiff should receive. In the second action, which is the subject of this appeal, the plaintiff seeks both a writ of mandamus and a declaratory judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>ment to the effect that the plaintiff either be reinstated to her former position as a tenured teacher or be granted a \u201cnew hearing\u201d by the defendant <em>and </em>that the defendant be ordered to hold a hearing on the amount of back pay and benefits she should receive. As the trial court correctly observed, the result of the second action \u201cwould be mutual to the relief sought in the administrative appeal [first action]. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">We have recently said that \u201c[m]andamus is an extraordinary remedy, designed to enforce a plain, positive duty and available only to one who has a clear legal right to performance of that duty. <em>Cheshire Taxpayers\u2019 Action Committee, Inc. </em>v. <em>Guilford, </em>193 Conn. 1, 5, 474 A.2d 97 (1984).\u201d <em>Simons </em>v. <em>Canty, </em>195 Conn. 524, 533, 488 A.2d 1267 (1985). It is obvious that if this plaintiff could establish as a necessary threshold requirement to the issuance of the writ the \u201cclear legal right\u201d to the relief she has requested, that right could also be established, as well as vindicated, on her \u00a7 10-151 appeal.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Moreover, the request for a declaratory judgment would require the trial court \u201cto ascertain the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>rights of the parties under existing law.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Middlebury </em>v. <em>Steinmann, </em>189 Conn. 710, 715, 458 A.2d 393 (1983). In both the first action and the second action then, the plaintiff would be required to establish her right to an order from the court granting the relief requested, which in the two cases is ultimately the same: reinstatement or a new hearing and back pay and benefits. \u201c[T]he fact that different relief is sought does not prevent [dismissal] of a second action adjudicating the <em>same underlying rights. </em>\u201d (Emphasis added.) 1 Stephenson, Conn. Civ. Proc. (2d Ed.) \u00a7 104b, p. 423.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-4\">In sum, the \u201csame underlying rights,\u201d i.e., rights to reinstatement, new hearing, back pay and benefits, which the plaintiff asserted in the second action would be adjudicated and necessarily determined in the prior pending action. See <em>Zachs </em>v. <em>Public Utilities Commission, </em>supra, 393; <em>Cahill </em>v. <em>Cahill, </em>76 Conn. 542, 548, 57 A. 284 (1904). This the plaintiff has correctly conceded, and in this court she has presented neither claim nor argument that any remedy that could be accorded her in the prior pending action would be inadequate or incomplete. See <em>Welles </em>v. <em>Rhodes, </em>59 Conn. 498, 504, 22 A. 286 (1890). Therefore, the trial court correctly dismissed the second action.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b662-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 10-151 (f) provides: \u201cAny teacher aggrieved by the decision of a board of education or board of trustees of an incorporated or endowed high school or academy approved pursuant to section 10-84 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>after a hearing as provided in subsection (b) of this section may appeal therefrom, within thirty days of such decision, to the superior court for the judicial district in which such board or such high school or academy is located. Such appeal shall be made returnable to said court in the same manner as is prescribed for civil actions brought to said court. Any such appeal shall be a privileged case to be heard by the court as soon after the return day as is practicable. The board of education or the board of trustees of the incorporated or endowed high school or academy shall file with the court a copy of the complete transcript of the proceedings of the hearing held by the board of education or board of trustees of the incorporated or endowed high school or academy or by an impartial hearing panel for such teacher, together with such other documents, or certified copies thereof, as shall constitute the record of the case appealed from. The court, upon such appeal, shall review the proceedings of such hearing and shall allow any party to such appeal to introduce evidence in addition to the contents of such transcript, if it appears to the court that additional testimony is necessary for the equitable disposition of the appeal. The court, upon such appeal and after a hearing thereon, may affirm or reverse the decision appealed from. Costs shall not be allowed against the board of education or board of trustees of the incorporated or endowed high school or academy unless it appears to the court that it acted with gross negligence or in bad faith or with malice in making the decision appealed from.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b663-7\"> The plaintiff in the present appeal, Mrs. Elinor Halpern, is the former Elinor Lee.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b664-6\"> The first twenty enumerated paragraphs of the two separate complaints are identical, except that the complaint in the first action omits a reference to the date of our decision in <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>181 Conn. 69, 434 A.2d 333 (1980). The twenty-first paragraph in each complaint, as well as some of the language in the prayer for relief as enunciated in the text, differs.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">In the direct appeal filed by the plaintiff pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 10-151 (f), the plaintiff alleges: \u201c21. The plaintiff is aggrieved by the defendant board\u2019s actions and decision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b664-8\">In the present action, the plaintiff alleges in the twenty-first paragraph of her complaint: \u201c21. Since August 30,1974, defendant has refused to pay plaintiff any of the wages and benefits to which she would be entitled as a tenured teacher, and the plaintiff is aggrieved by the defendant\u2019s actions.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b666-7\"> We have recognized that the prior pending action rule does not truly implicate the subject matter jurisdiction of the court. <em>Henry F. Raab Connecticut, Inc. </em>v. <em>J. W. Fisher Co., </em>183 Conn. 108, 111-12, 438 A.2d 834 (1981); see also <em>Nielsen </em>v. <em>Nielsen, </em>3 Conn. App. 679, 682, 491 A.2d 1112 (1985). Any claim \u201cthat the pendency of a prior suit between the same parties, for the same thing, will abate a latter suit\u201d; <em>Quinebaug Bank </em>v. <em>Tarbox, </em>20 Conn. 509, 514 (1850); formerly could be raised by a \u201cplea in abatement.\u201d See, e.g., <em>Zachs </em>v. <em>Public Utilities Commission, </em>171 Conn. 387, 370 A.2d 984 (1976); <em>Ward </em>v. <em>Curtiss, </em>18 Conn. 290 (1847); <em>Durand </em>v. <em>Carrington, </em>1 Root 355 (1792). The plea in abatement; Practice Book, 1963, \u00a7 93; has, however, since been replaced by the motion to dismiss. Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 142,143; 1 Stephenson, Conn. Civ. Proc. (2d Ed. 1982 Sup.) \u00a7 103a. The parties in the present case properly proceeded upon the assumption then that the motion to dismiss was the proper device by which to request that the trial court dismiss the second action. 1 Stephenson, supra, \u00a7 104a; see also <em>Hannafin </em>v. <em>Ethics Commission, </em>39 Conn. Sup. 99,102, 470 A.2d 720 (1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b668-6\"> We have often stated that we generally review an appeal upon the theory under which it was tried and adjudicated in the court below. See, e.g., <em>Fuessenich </em>v. <em>DiNardo, </em>195 Conn. 144, 151, 487 A.2d 514 (1985). Because the plaintiff is now effectively \u201cout of court\u201d on the second action, we are not required here to consider any potential implications of our recent decisions in <em>Laurel Park, Inc. </em>v. <em>Pac, </em>194 Conn. 677, 485 A.2d 1272 (1984), and <em>Juliano </em>v. <em>Farrell, </em>196 Conn. 283, 492 A.2d 187 (1985). In those cases we indicated that the availability of an administrative appeal to provide the same relief as that sought in an action for an injunction or for a writ of mandamus barred resort to those remedies. \u201cWe have frequently stated that when a party has a statutory right of appeal from the decision of an administrative agency, he may not, instead of appealing, bring an independent action to test the very issue which the appeal was designed to test.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Carpenter </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>176 Conn. 581, 598, 409 A.2d 1029 (1979). The application of these principles to the present action seeking a declaratory judgment and a writ of mandamus might also support the judgment of dismissal. Because neither the parties nor the trial court have discussed this alternative ground for affirmance, however, we have decided to rely wholly upon the prior pending action doctrine, the only ground considered by the parties or the trial court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
