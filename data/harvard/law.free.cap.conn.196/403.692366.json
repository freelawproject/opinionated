J.</author>\n<p id=\"AWp\">The sole issue on this appeal is whether an indigent defendant in a state-initiated paternity suit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>has a constitutional right to court-appointed counsel. At the behest of the state and with the state\u2019s assistance, the plaintiff Gail A. Lavertue sued the defendant Mark Niman, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-160, naming him the father of her child Sherry Ann Lavertue. Prior to trial, the defendant filed a financial affidavit reflecting his indigency<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and moved for the appointment of counsel. The trial court, <em>Kremski, J., </em>denied the motion. The defendant was tried to the court, <em>Spear, J., </em>found guilty and ordered to pay weekly child support until the child\u2019s eighteenth birthday. He appeals from the judgment, claiming that the court erred in refusing to appoint counsel to represent him. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">The events at trial provide the necessary background to this appeal. The plaintiff was represented, at state expense, by Attorney Robert Chase. On direct examination, the plaintiff testified that, when her child was conceived in November, 1979, she was having sexual relations only with the defendant and that he was the child\u2019s father. She also testified that the state was contributing to the child\u2019s support. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">The defendant, appearing pro se, was able to do little to weaken or to contradict the plaintiff\u2019s case. Counsel for the plaintiff successfully objected to the defendant\u2019s effort to cross-examine the plaintiff about her sexual relations with other men and about the existence of other potential fathers. Although a blood grouping test had been authorized, its results were not introduced into evidence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendant belatedly sought judicial assistance to procure the presence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>an absent witness, but was not permitted to delay the trial for that purpose. His attempt to testify in his own behalf was cut short by his mistaken attempt to resume questioning the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">At the close of the evidence, the court found the defendant guilty and proceeded to a determination of the amount of child support to award. An employee of the state department of human resources testified that the state had incurred a total of $6777.81 in expenses, which included child support as well as attorney\u2019s fees, costs and a blood test. The defendant testified that he was twenty-three years old, had completed two years of high school education, was unemployed and had no income. The court ordered the defendant to pay $5 a week child support until the child\u2019s eighteenth birthday and $5 a week arrearage until the state\u2019s past expenses had been fully reimbursed, all payments to be made directly to the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">The defendant\u2019s only claim on this appeal is that he has a right to court-appointed counsel under the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution and under article first, \u00a7 10, of the Connecticut constitution.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Because his claim relies upon a showing of state action and upon the unique configuration of paternity actions in this state,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> it is important at the outset to clarify the background of this litigation. See <em>Little </em>v. <em>Streater, </em>452 U.S. 1, 9, 101 S. Ct. 2202, 68 L. Ed. 2d 627 (1981). We will then consider the test that determines whether a court is obligated to provide counsel to indigent defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">Whether state involvement in paternity actions is of sufficient significance to trigger constitutional rights to counsel depends upon whether the child whose paternity is in question is receiving public assistance. Absent public assistance, a paternity suit is simply a private action brought by the child\u2019s mother against the putative father. When public assistance is at stake, however, the state plays a dominant role in the initiation and the prosecution of the paternity suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">The state\u2019s interest in a paternity action concerning a child on public assistance is manifest and enduring. See <em>Little </em>v. <em>Streater, </em>supra, 9. The mother of such a child is required, on pain of contempt, to identify the child\u2019s father and, in the event he does not acknowledge paternity, to bring an action against him. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 17-82b, 46b-160, 46b-169; Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7\u00a7 17-82e-4 through 17-82e-6. The state assists the plaintiff in finding an attorney and pays the plaintiff\u2019s legal fees and costs. Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7\u00a7 17-82e-4, 17-82e-6. The attorney general is automatically a party to such a paternity action, and no such action can be settled without the approval of a state official. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 46b-160, 46b-170. If the paternity action is successful and results in an award of child support, the moneys so awarded are paid directly to the state because the mother of a child on public assistance must assign her rights of support to the state. General Statutes \u00a7 17-82b.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The attorney general is in fact the only party defending this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>The significance of the state\u2019s involvement in actions involving the paternity of children receiving public assistance is enhanced by the fact that all paternity proceedings have \u201c \u2018quasi-criminal\u2019 overtones.\u201d <em>Little </em>v. <em>Streater, </em>supra, 10. A paternity action results in a finding of \u201cguilt\u201d or \u201cinnocence,\u201d and nonpayment of support orders attendant to a finding of \u201cguilt\u201d may lead to contempt and imprisonment. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 46b-171, 46b-215, 53-304. Nonetheless, the plaintiff in a paternity proceeding need only prove her case by a fair preponderance of the evidence. <em>Terrasi </em>v. <em>Andrews, </em>3 Conn. Cir. Ct. 449, 453, 217 A.2d 75, cert. denied, 153 Conn. 729, 214 A.2d 130 (1965). Furthermore, she establishes a prima facie case by remaining constant in her accusation. <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In sum, the state has the capacity to insist on the initiation and prosecution of a paternity action in which a defendant is at considerable risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">The test that governs the due process right to court-appointed counsel is whether the absence of counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>deprives an indigent defendant of \u201c \u2018fundamental fairness.\u2019 <em>\u201d Lassiter v. Department of Social Services, </em>452 U.S. 18, 25, 101 S. Ct. 2153, 68 L. Ed. 2d 640, reh. denied, 453 U.S. 927, 102 S. Ct. 889, 69 L. Ed. 2d 1023 (1981). That test, in turn, involves an analysis of three separate factors: \u201cthe private interests at stake, the government\u2019s interest, and the risk that the procedures used will lead to erroneous decisions.\u201d Id., 27, citing <em>Mathews </em>v. <em>Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 335, 96 S. Ct. 893, 47 L. Ed. 2d 18 (1976). Once we identify the analytic components of this test, we must then determine what weight to attach to each of its elements, and whether any supervening presumptions tilt the balance in favor of or against a right to counsel. <em>Lassiter </em>v. <em>Department of Social Services, </em>supra, 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">The private interests that are at stake in this litigation involve both the putative father and the child. See <em>Little </em>v. <em>Streater, </em>supra, 13. The putative father faces a possible loss of liberty if he is found \u201cguilty\u201d and subsequently fails to pay court ordered child support. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 46b-171, 46b-215, 53-304. In addition, both father and child have substantial financial and property interests at stake. The father is liable for past, present and future child support. General Statutes \u00a7 46b-171. In later years the child may be liable for the support of its father; General Statutes \u00a7 53-304; and may eventually have claims upon the father\u2019s estate. The child\u2019s interests also extend to its health, which may depend upon an accurate family medical history. See <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>439 N.E.2d 1367, 1370 (Ind. App. 1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">In addition to these particularized private interests that militate in favor of procedural safeguards, we also recognize the more general interest that is implicated when what is \u201cat issue is the creation of a parent-child relationship.\u201d <em>Little </em>v. <em>Streater, </em>supra, 13. The family relationship is so significant as to be accorded constitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>tional protection. At stake for both parent and child are the rights to companionship, care and custody. <em>Little </em>v. <em>Streater, </em>supra, 13; <em>Cappetta </em>v. <em>Cappetta, </em>196 Conn. 10, 14, 490 A.2d 996 (1985); <em>McGaffin </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>193 Conn. 393, 400-401, 479 A.2d 176 (1984), cert. denied, U.S. , 105 S. Ct. 1747, 84 L. Ed. 2d 813 (1985). Obviously, both the father and the child in a paternity proceeding have an interest in seeing that these rights are accurately adjudicated. The child\u2019s interests in this regard are particularly strong. \u201cAny determination that a particular individual is a child\u2019s biological father may have profound sociological and psychological ramifications. ... It is in the child\u2019s interest not only to have it adjudicated that <em>some </em>man is his or her father and thus liable for support, but to have some assurance that the correct person has been so identified.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>Salas </em>v. <em>Cortez, </em>24 Cal. 3d 22, 33-34, 593 P.2d 226, 154 Cal. Rptr. 529, cert. denied, 444 U.S. 900, 100 S. Ct. 209, 62 L. Ed. 2d 136 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">In contrast to these strong private interests, the state has two somewhat conflicting concerns. On the one hand, in its role as <em>parens patriae, </em>it must protect the welfare of the child and thus shares the child\u2019s interest in accurately identifying the father and making that person responsible for its support.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> On the other hand, the state has a substantial economic stake in the adjudication of paternity. Since the child is being supported at state expense, the state\u2019s interest in \u201cfinding] any man it can hold financially liable to reimburse it\u201d; <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>supra, 1371; may undermine its interest in an accurate outcome. Furthermore, the state is understandably concerned that its expenses in a pater<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>nity proceeding be kept to a minimum. Nevertheless, \u201c[w]e must conclude that the State\u2019s monetary interest \u2018is hardly significant enough to overcome private interests as important as those here.\u2019 \u201d <em>Little </em>v. <em>Streater, </em>supra, 15-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">In addition to the competing interests of the state and the private individuals, <em>Lassiter </em>identifies the risk of error as the third factor to be considered in assessing the need for counsel. In <em>Little </em>v. <em>Streater, </em>supra, 14, the United States Supreme Court relied on \u201cthe usual absence of witnesses, the self-interest coloring the testimony of the litigants, and the State\u2019s onerous evidentiary rule and refusal to pay for blood grouping tests,\u201d in support of its holding that there is a considerable risk of error in Connecticut paternity actions. Because of this risk, the court held that, in order to give indigent paternity defendants a \u201c \u2018meaningful opportunity to be heard,\u2019 \u201d it was necessary to provide blood tests at state expense. Id., 16, citing <em>Boddie </em>v. <em>Connecticut, </em>401 U.S. 371, 377, 91 S. Ct. 780, 28 L. Ed. 2d 113 (1971). The state now seeks to turn <em>Little </em>on its head by arguing that access to blood test information is in and of itself sufficient to overcome the procedural obstacles that inhere in our paternity actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">We are unpersuaded by the state\u2019s argument. The use of scientific evidence itself may contribute to the risk of error because it increases the complexity of the litigation. The state\u2019s provision of counsel for the mother is, in part, a recognition of this fact. See <em>Salas </em>v. <em>Cortez, </em>supra, 31. Moreover, the defendant still bears a heavy evidentiary burden and must face the state as an adversary. Both of these factors \u201cskew . . . the outcome of the case.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">In our assessment of the significance of the risk of error, the issue is \u201cthe extent to which the provision of a lawyer to indigent [defendants] would enhance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>the fairness and reliability of the paternity procedure . . . . \u201d <em>Nordgren </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>716 F.2d 1335, 1337 (10th Cir. 1983). The role of an attorney in paternity proceedings is a multifaceted one. Counsel would alert the defendant of his right to have blood tests performed, advise him about the kinds of tests available and inform him of the procedures that must be followed to obtain accurate results.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Counsel would also be able to challenge test results submitted by the state.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> An attorney would develop defenses independent of the blood test evidence, such as lack of access to the mother or the existence of another potential father. Id., 1338. An attorney would conduct discovery, counsel the defendant on the possibility of reaching a pretrial settlement, subpoena witnesses and conduct cross-examination. The record in this case discloses the likelihood that a pro se defendant\u2019s own inartful questioning and failure to obtain witnesses will substantially impair the truth-finding function of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">In sum, analysis of the three <em>Lassiter </em>factors reveals that state-supported paternity proceedings manifestly involve significant private interests and a substantial risk of error. Taken alone, these factors clearly outweigh the state\u2019s contrary interest in avoiding the public expense of state-financed counsel. What remains to be determined is the weight to be assigned the fact that the direct risks to which the defendant is put are primarily psychological and financial. In <em>Lassiter </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number><em>Department of Social Services, </em>supra, 27, the United States Supreme Court counseled that, where loss of personal freedom was not at stake, there was a presumption against court-appointed counsel. Although Connecticut paternity suits have been characterized as quasi-criminal, and although a person found \u201cguilty\u201d of being a father may, in a subsequent contempt action, be imprisoned for failure to pay child support, the fact remains that the threat of imprisonment is only indirectly implicated in the paternity suit itself. See, e.g., <em>Nordgren </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>supra, 1339; <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>supra, 1369; <em>Wake County ex rel. Carrington </em>v. <em>Townes, </em>306 N.C. 333, 336-37, 293 S.E.2d 95 (1982), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 1113, 103 S. Ct. 745, 74 L. Ed. 2d 965 (1983); <em>State </em>v. <em>James, </em>38 Wash. App. 264, 272, 686 P.2d 1097 (1984); but see <em>Corra </em>v. <em>Coll, </em>305 Pa. Super. 179, 188, 451 A.2d 480 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">Our appraisal of this mix of factors is governed by our interpretation of the requirements not only of the federal constitution but also of article first, \u00a7 10, of the Connecticut constitution. From that vantage point, taking account of the unique configuration of paternity actions in this state, we conclude that indigent defendants in state-supported paternity actions have a constitutional right, under both the United States and Connecticut constitutions, to court-appointed counsel at state expense. This holding is in accordance with the result reached in a number of other jurisdictions subsequent to <em>Little </em>and <em>Lassiter. </em>See <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>supra; <em>State ex rel. Cody </em>v. <em>Toner, </em>8 Ohio St. 3d 22, 456 N.E.2d 813 (1983), cert. denied, 466 U.S. 938, 104 S. Ct. 1912, 80 L. Ed. 2d 461 (1984); <em>Corra </em>v. <em>Coll, </em>supra; but see <em>State ex rel. Hamilton </em>v. <em>Snodgrass, </em>325 N.W.2d 740 (Iowa 1982); as well as with a number of decisions before those cases were handed down. See, e.g., <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>Kimmons, </em>569 P.2d 799 (Alaska 1977); <em>Salas </em>v. <em>Cortez, </em>supra; <em>Artibee </em>v. <em>Cheboygan Circuit </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number><em>Judge, </em>397 Mich. 54, 243 N.W.2d 248 (1976); see generally Roberts &amp; Ott, \u201cThe Right to Counsel in Paternity Proceedings,\u201d 18 Clearinghouse Rev. 1170,1180 (1985). We recognize that some courts have preferred a case-by-case approach to the appointment of counsel. See <em>Nordgren </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>supra; <em>Wake County ex rel. Carrington </em>v. <em>Townes, </em>supra; <em>State ex rel. Adult &amp; Family Services Division </em>v. <em>Stoutt, </em>57 Or. App. 303, 644 P.2d 1132 (1982), cert. denied, 461 U.S. 928, 103 S. Ct. 2088, 77 L. Ed. 2d 299 (1983); <em>State </em>v. <em>James, </em>supra. We decline to follow such an approach, not only because of the unique evidentiary problems of our paternity proceedings, but because \u201c[i]t is often difficult to assess the complexities which might arise in a given paternity trial before that trial is held; thus, a case-by-case approach would necessarily require an after-the-fact evaluation of the record to determine whether appointed counsel could have affected the result reached in a paternity proceeding.\u201d <em>Corra </em>v. <em>Coll, </em>supra, 193 n.11.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">There is error, the judgment of paternity is vacated and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b418-8\"> In its brief, the state challenged the defendant\u2019s claim of indigency since the trial court had not made a specific finding that he was indigent.

In addition, the state must establish a child support enforcement program under Title IV-D of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 651 et seq.
