Healey, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AK3\">This action in which the plaintiffs sought injunctive and declaratory judgment relief was generated by efforts in 1981 to establish an historic district pursuant to Chapter 97a of the General Statutes in the defendant city of Norwalk. The plaintiffs opposed the creation of the proposed historic district.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b611-11\">The proposed historic district, which was to be known as the Norwalk Green Historic District (district), encompassed thirteen parcels of land in the vicinity of the Norwalk Green.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> One of these parcels, located at 7-9 Park Street, was occupied by the Park Towers Condominium (PTC), a sixty-seven unit condominium.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>January 27, 1981, the common council of the legislative body of Norwalk, after its receipt of the report of the Historic District Study Committee (study committee), voted to approve a resolution authorizing balloting for the establishment of the proposed district. On February 23,1981, ballots were issued by the defendant Mary Keegan, town clerk of Norwalk, and March 23,1981, was set as the deadline for submitting them. For that ballot the votes to be exercised were allotted as follows: each property owner of record was assigned one full vote except where joint ownership appeared of record, such joint owners were given a fractional vote. According to the record, each PTC condominium unit owner was given 1/67 of a full vote. When the ballots cast were counted, the statutorily required 75 percent affirmative vote<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of the owners voting necessary to approve the establishment of the proposed district was not attained.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">On May 27,1981, the common council adopted a resolution authorizing the study committee to hold another <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>public hearing for a new referendum at which each PTC unit owner was assigned one full vote. After a public hearing on August 20, 1981, the study committee recommended another balloting to the common council. That legislative body, at its meeting on September 8, 1981, directed that a new referendum be held on October 9, 1981, in accordance with its resolution of May 27, 1981, assigning sixty-seven votes, one to each of the PTC condominium owners.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In that referendum, the PTC unit owners who returned their ballots cast fifty-six full votes. After the ballots were counted, Keegan certified that the vote was sixty-two in favor of establishing the proposed district and five against.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">After a trial on the merits, the trial court held that General Statutes \u00a7 7-147b (g)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> required that each PTC unit owner was entitled to one full vote. Having so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>declared, it denied the plaintiffs any injunctive relief. Thus, the necessary 75 percent approval for the establishment of the proposed district was obtained and the historic district was thereafter established. The plaintiffs appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">On appeal, the plaintiffs claim that the trial court erred in: (1) determining that each owner of a condominium unit was entitled to one full vote in the historic district referendum; and (2) refusing to enjoin the defendant Norwalk town clerk from certifying the ballots cast in the October 9,1981 historic district referendum. We find error.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">On appeal, the plaintiffs argue that, with regard to allocation of voting rights for the purpose of the establishment of the proposed historic district, a consistent reading and interpretation of the historic district statutes, particularly \u00a7 7-147b, and of the condominium statute, requires the conclusion that each unit owner in PTC be allocated 1/67 of a vote. In looking to the condominium statutes, they argue that their \u201ccommon thread\u201d is \u201cto define the real property interest of the condominium unit owner, as the unit itself, which is clearly part of a building, and \u2018an undivided interest in the common elements specified\u2019 \u201d and that, therefore, \u201cit is clear that the ownership of each condominium unit owner in the real property, is the same as the ownership of a tenant in common, in that in addition to the unit the persons\u2019 [sic] ownership includes \u2018an undivided interest in the common elements speci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>fied.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The statutory scheme, they claim, clearly shows an intent to limit each parcel of land to one full vote regardless of size, value or improvements. The council\u2019s second resolution, in effect, established two separate voting classifications of tenants in common, they argue, \u201cone for condominium unit owners, and one for everyone else.\u201d Giving each unit owner one full vote makes the statutory scheme \u201cirrational\u201d because, they continue, the statutory scheme \u201cis to give each property one vote, divided into its various proportionate shares depending upon the nature of the ownership.\u201d Because the council\u2019s May 27, 1981 resolution did not follow this \u201cone parcel, one vote\u201d interpretation of the plaintiffs, the council, they claim, directed \u201can illegal method of voting, which should be declared invalid and permanently enjoined.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">On the other hand, the defendants argue that allocating a full vote to each condominium unit owner is not only directed by the plain language of \u00a7 7-147b (g) of the historic district statute, but also \u201cis consistent with the legislative intent to award the voting franchise to real property taxpayers.\u201d That statute does not, they claim, grant a fractional vote to a tenant in common in land but rather grants a fractional vote to a \u201ctenant in common of any freehold interest\u201d in land, and the statute thus illuminates the fallacy of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the \u201c \u2018entire parcel\u2019 \u201d at 7-9 Park \u201cis <em>a </em>freehold interest.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Rather, the defendants maintain that there are sixty-seven separate freeholds at 7-9 Park Street because each unit and its undivided interest in the common elements may be conveyed by \u201can indefeasible title in fee simple absolute,\u201d citing General Statutes \u00a7 47-72. Therefore, because \u201c \u2018property is a creature and creation of the law\u2019 \u201d there are, say the defendants, \u201c67 freeholds now <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>located at 7-9 Park Street, not one, and each unit owner possesses his freehold outright, not in common with his fellow unit owners.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">Over 200 years ago, Lord Mansfield said: \u201cAs the usages of society alter, the law must adapt itself to the various situations of mankind.\u201d <em>Barwell </em>v. <em>Brooks, </em>3 Doug. 371, 373 (1784). This venerable aphorism is appropriate in the resolution of the issues in this appeal. In considering the nature of a condominium unit owner\u2019s interests as it relates to a vote on the establishment of an historic district in which the condominium is located, we keep in mind that, although both relevant statutes are relatively recent in our jurisprudence, each one contains centuries old terms. Some of these terms, tenant in common, freehold interest, joint tenant, property and improvements have been defined by these statutes, while others presumably retain their common law meanings. The historic district statutes; General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 7-147a through 7-147k; were first enacted in this state in 1961, and the condominium act; General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 47-68a through 47-90c; was enacted in 1963.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">Over the past fifty years all fifty states and hundreds of municipalities have enacted laws to encourage or require the preservation of buildings and areas with historic or aesthetic importance. <em>Penn Central Transportation Co. </em>v. <em>New York, </em>438 U.S. 104, 107, 98 S. Ct. 2646, 57 L. Ed. 2d 631, reh. denied, 439 U.S. 883, 99 S. Ct. 226, 58 L. Ed. 2d 198 (1978). Such legislation has been precipitated by two concerns: first, \u201cin recent years, large numbers of historic structures, landmarks and areas have been destroyed without adequate consideration of either the values represented therein or the possibility of preserving the destroyed properties for use in economically productive ways\u201d; and, second, \u201ca widely shared belief that structures with special historic, cultural, or architectural significance enhance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>the quality of life for all.\u201d Id., 108; see <em>Maher </em>v. <em>New Orleans, </em>516 F.2d 1051 (5th Cir. 1975), cert. denied, 426 U.S. 905, 96 S. Ct. 2225, 48 L. Ed. 2d 830 (1976); <em>Figarsky </em>v. <em>Historic District Commission, </em>171 Conn. 198, 368 A.2d 163 (1976); 2 Anderson, American Law of Zoning (2d Ed. 1976) \u00a7\u00a7 9.68 through 9.75. In upholding New York City\u2019s landmarks preservation law in <em>Penn Central, </em>the United States Supreme Court stated that \u201c[(legislation designed to promote the general welfare commonly burdens some more than others.\u201d <em>Penn Central Transportation Co. </em>v. <em>New York, </em>supra, 133.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">In its statutory context the condominium is of relatively recent origin<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> offering, as it does, a means of shelter affording some of the benefits of property ownership without some of its burdens. The defendants in this case recognize that condominium ownership interests are \u201cunique,\u201d and the plaintiffs concede that these interests \u201cdo not fall neatly within any of the categories\u201d stated in the historic district voting provision. See General Statutes \u00a7 7-147b (g). This fairly sets the tone. The intermixture of the historic district and condominium statutes on this specific issue of vote allocation generates relevant considerations which, on analysis, do not precisely mesh or accurately fit any analytical mold. Given the argued tension between these two statutes, our construction, which involves seeking legislative purpose, strives for the application of common sense to achieve a sensible result in this case. See, e.g., <em>Aaron </em>v. <em>Conservation Commission, </em>183 Conn. 532, 548, 441 A.2d 30 (1981); <em>State </em>v. <em>Bello, </em>133 Conn. 600, 604, 53 A.2d 381 (1947); <em>Rawson </em>v. <em>State, </em>19 Conn. 292, 299 (1848).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>Section 7-147b (g) does not specifically mention condominiums, but the plaintiffs appear to concede that under \u00a7 47-73 each condominium unit owner has a \u201creal property interest\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> which would qualify such an owner to cast \u201ca fractional vote.\u201d We agree that each condominium owner is entitled to a fractional vote in the referendum permitted under \u00a7 7-147b. Section 47-73 in the condominium act provides that \u201c[e]ach unit, together with its undivided interest in the common elements, shall for all purposes constitute real property.\u201d Section 7-147b (g) requires the municipal clerk to mail ballots for such a referendum to \u201ceach owner of record of real property ... in the proposed district . . . . \u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> This statute also states that \u201c[a]ny tenant in common of any freehold interest in any land shall have a vote equal to the fraction of his ownership in said interest. Joint tenants of any freehold interest in any land shall vote as if each joint tenant owned an equal, fractional share of such land. ... No owner shall have more than one vote.\u201d The terms \u201ctenant in common\u201d and \u201cfreehold interest in any land\u201d in \u00a7 7-147b (g) are key in the dispute between the parties. We are urged, inter alia, to attach to such terms definitions and attributes premised on common law origin and evolution that do not fit perfectly into the argued tension between the two recent statutes in resolving the quality of the vote to be given PTC unit owners of record. This lack of a neat coalescence rests in the main on these two statutes, each of which could be said to be sui generis, on the unprecedented nature of the issue as it is presented to us, and on certain language <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>in each of the statutes, some defined and some not. One thing is, however, clear \u2014 our resolution must be guided by the intent of the legislature in enacting the historic district statute, and particularly \u00a7 7-147b (g).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">Such terms as \u201ctenants in common,\u201d \u201cfreehold interest\u201d and \u201cjoint tenancy\u201d have long been in the common law, and it is argued by the defendants that such terms and definitions when applied to \u00a7 7-147b (g) require that one full vote be given to each condominium unit owner.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We do not agree. The common law, of course, must change as circumstances change; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Muolo, </em>118 Conn. 373, 378, 172 A. 875 (1934); and it \u201cmust be rational and compatible with present society if it is to be respected and upheld.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Roth </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>24 Wash. App. 92, 100, 600 P.2d 602 (1979). \u201cIn applying the common law to an unprecedented situation, [the court] may properly inquire whether the traditional rule is suited to present conditions.\u201d <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth </em>v. <em>City Clerk of Lowell, </em>373 Mass. 178, 185, 366 N.E.2d 717 (1977); see <em>Nantucket Conservation Foundation, Inc. </em>v. <em>Russell Management, </em>380 Mass. 212, 219, 402 N.E.2d 501 (1980). \u201cIt is true that technical common law words when used in a statute without definition will generally be construed in that sense unless a contrary intention appears from the context.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Magruder, </em>42 F. Sup. 193, 197 (D. Md. 1941). As the <em>Jones </em>court said in ascertaining the congres<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>sional intent underlying the phrase \u201cland, tenements or other realty\u201d in a taxing statute: \u201cIt is, however, not probable that Congress intended ... to use the phrase \u2018lands, tenements, or other realty\u2019 in the technical nicety of the common law with respect to interests in lands flowing from a system of feudal tenure which did not exist in this country after the American Revolution.\u201d Id., 198. Therefore, sedulous adherence to every common law attribute is not called for here when we are dealing with interests \u201cin any freehold interest in any land\u201d flowing from ownership of a condominium unit where the condominium was unknown in our common law until created recently by statute. Legislative intent is not to be found in an isolated sentence; the whole statute must be considered. <em>Harris Data Communications, Inc. </em>v. <em>Heffeman, </em>183 Conn. 194, 197, 438 A.2d 1178 (1981); <em>West Haven </em>v. <em>Impact, </em>174 Conn. 160, 164, 384 A.2d 353 (1978). In ascertaining legislative intent, we may look to the history of the statute, the policy underlying it and the circumstances which brought about its enactment. <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>145 Conn. 355, 358, 143 A.2d 154 (1958); <em>State </em>v. <em>Cambria, </em>137 Conn. 604, 606, 80 A.2d 516 (1951). In construing a statute, common sense must be used and we must assume that the legislature intended to accomplish a reasonable and rational result. <em>State </em>v. <em>Roque, </em>190 Conn. 143, 151, 460 A.2d 26 (1983); <em>Stoni </em>v. <em>Wasicki, </em>179 Conn. 372, 376-77, 426 A.2d 774 (1979). A statute, of course, is not to be interpreted to thwart its purpose. <em>Mystic Marinelife Aquarium, Inc. </em>v. <em>Gill, </em>175 Conn. 483, 489, 400 A.2d 726 (1978). As Judge Learned Hand said in <em>Borella </em>v. <em>Borden Co., </em>145 F.2d 63, 64 (2d Cir. 1944), aff\u2019d, 325 U.S. 679, 65 S. Ct. 1223, 89 L. Ed. 1865 (1945): \u201cWe can best reach the meaning here, as always, by recourse to the underlying purpose, and, with that as a guide, by trying to project upon the specific occasion how we think persons, actuated by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>such a purpose, would have dealt with it, if it had been presented to them at the time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">In ascertaining the nature of the vote to which PTC unit owners are entitled, it is important to recognize that the historic district statute in Chapter 97a of the General Statutes<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> focuses not on people but on \u201cbuildings, structures, places or surroundings\u201d that are of \u201chistorical significance and architectural merit.\u201d See, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 7-147a, 7-147d through 7-147g. The statute can fairly be denominated as \u201csite\u201d oriented and permits a municipality, through following certain procedures, to establish an historic district. The purpose of such a district is \u201cto promote the educational, cultural, economic and general welfare of the public through the preservation and protection of the distinctive characteristics of buildings and places associated with the history of or indicative of a period or style of architecture of the municipality, of the state or of the nation.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 7-147a (b). The statute, consistent with its historic preservation purpose, provides the bases for close control and supervision of the buildings and areas in established historic districts. An enforcement procedure, including monetary fines, is set forth for violations of the statute, of any action or ruling of an historic district commission or of any regulation or ordinance properly adopted. See General Statutes \u00a7 7-147h; see also 2 Rohan, Zoning and Land Use Controls (1984) \u00a7 7.02. State legislation authorizing the adoption of a local historic district ordinance is the usual vehicle for accomplishing these purposes. See, e.g., <em>Penn Central Transportation Co. </em>v. <em>New York, </em>supra; <em>Berman </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>348 U.S. 26, 75 S. Ct. 98, 99 L. Ed. 27 (1959); <em>Maher </em>v. <em>New </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number><em>Orleans, </em>371 F. Sup. 653 (E.D.

L. Rev. 231 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">We must look to the site orientation of an historic district, with its strong preservation mission, for guidance on the problem of who should vote on the question of the establishment of such a district. The thoughtful and comprehensive statutory scheme evidenced on the historic district does, as we have pointed out, subject owners of record of real property within such a district to close controls over use of their property. An historic district ordinance is, in practical effect, in the nature of a zoning ordinance. We note that while the historic district statute predated the condominium act, the former statute was substantially amended in 1980 by Public Acts 1980, No. 80-314. That 1980 amendment introduced that portion of \u00a7 7-147b (g) we have before us.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We deem it no oversight that that comprehensive amendment does not at all refer to condominiums in any respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>It is an accepted tenet of statutory construction that \u201c[t]he General Assembly is always presumed to know all the existing statutes and the effect that its action or non-action will have upon any one of them.

A closer examination of the statutory schemes discloses that the application of common sense in endeavoring to illuminate the legislative intent to bring about a rational result does just that.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\">Although \u201cunit\u201d is generally defined in the definitional section of the condominium act in \u00a7 47-68a, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>nexus between that statute and the voting provisions of the historic district statute is found in \u00a7 47-73 of the condominium statute.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Section 47-73 provides that \u201c[e]ach unit, together with its undivided interest in the common elements, shall for all purposes constitute <em>real property.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> As we pointed out earlier, it was \u201ceach owner of record of <em>real property\u201d </em>to whom ballots are to be sent under \u00a7 7-147b (g).

This is so, they argue, because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>there are sixty-seven separate freeholds at PTC and each unit and its undivided interest in the common elements may be conveyed by \u201can indefeasible title in fee simple absolute\u201d under General Statutes \u00a7 47-73.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> They maintain that 7-9 Park Street contains not one but sixty-seven separate freeholds \u201cand each unit owner possesses his freehold outright, not in common with his fellow unit owners.\u201d In countering the plaintiffs\u2019 argument that each PTC unit owner has \u201can undivided ownership interest in the entire parcel of real estate . . .\u201d (at 7-9 Park Street), the defendants say that the plaintiffs \u201chave overlooked the fact that . . . \u00a7 7-147b (g) does not grant a fractional vote to a tenant in common in land; it grants a fractional vote to a \u2018tenant in common of <em>any freehold interest\u2019 </em>in land.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) We agree with the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that each PTC unit owner is entitled to 1/67 of a full vote under \u00a7 7-147b (g).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">The use of the terms \u201ctenant in common\u201d and \u201cjoint tenant,\u201d in \u00a7 7-147b (g) is a legislative recognition of the manner in which title could be held by those \u201cownerfs] of record of real property\u201d to whom the right to vote was given by statute. The tenancy in common (as also with joint tenants) had to be of \u201cany freehold interest in any land.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 7-147b (g). The noun \u201cinterest\u201d here refers to an \u201cinterest\u201d in \u201cland.\u201d In this context, the noun \u201cinterest\u201d is a word denoting \u201ca legal relation or relations.\u201d See 1 Restatement, Property \u00a7 5, p. 11.

Unlike \u201creal property\u201d as that term is carried over from \u00a7 47-73 and the ownership of record of which is necessary to voter eligibility, \u00a7 7-147b (g) now introduces the term \u201cland.\u201d \u201cLand,\u201d unlike some other terms which may be considered generally of common meaning, is not defined in either the historic district or condominium statutes.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The use of the term \u201cland\u201d is significant especially because of the prior reference to \u201creal property\u201d in \u00a7 7-147b without a single reference to \u201cland\u201d in that statute prior to subsection (g). It is clear that \u201creal property,\u201d quite apart from \u00a7 47-73, as used in the Restatement \u201crefers to land.\u201d <em>Lakeshore Financial Corporation </em>v. <em>Comstock, </em>587 F. Sup. 426, 428 (W.D. Mich. 1984); 1 Restatement, Property \u00a7 8. It thus can fairly be said that \u201cland\u201d as used in \u00a7 7-147b (g) means real property in the conventional sense; this is further supported by the Restatement comment that \u201c[tjhose interests in land designated [in the Restatement] as \u2018real property\u2019 are also referred to as <em>\u2018freehold, interests. \u2019 </em>\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) 1 Restatement, Property \u00a7 8, comment a. It is just not \u201cland\u201d in \u00a7 7-147b (g) that is referred to but <em>\u201cany </em>land.\u201d (Emphasis added.) \u201cThe word \u2018any\u2019 has a diversity of meanings and may be employed to indicate \u2018all\u2019 or \u2018every\u2019 as well as \u2018some\u2019 or \u2018one.\u2019 ... Its meaning in a given statute depends upon the context and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>subject matter of the statute.\u201d <em>Muller </em>v. <em>Town Plan &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>145 Conn. 325, 328, 142 A.2d 524 (1958). We have held it to be too comprehensive a word to receive a narrow construction, and, to find the sense in which it is employed in \u00a7 7-147b (g), we look at the wording of the statute, its legislative history and its basic policy. Id., 329; <em>Donohue </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>155 Conn. 550, 556, 235 A.2d 643 (1967). Given our view of the statutory scheme and the application of the principles to be employed to come to a common sense result, we construe \u201cany\u201d to mean \u201csome\u201d in this case. This is particularly so because what the PTC tenant in common (and the joint tenants) has by virtue of his freehold interest in \u201cland\u201d is an undivided interest therein together with the other \u201cunit owner(s).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">Put another way, because the \u201ccommon elements\u201d are \u201call portions of the condominium other than the units,\u201d and each \u201cunit owner\u201d has \u201can undivided interest in the common elements,\u201d then each unit owner, whether as a tenant in common or joint tenant, has an undivided interest in some \u201cland.\u201d The quality of that undivided interest is freehold in nature, yet each such unit owner owns less than all the freehold at 7-9 Park Street. Each such unit owner is therefore entitled to a vote proportionate to his freehold interest in the \u201cland\u201d there, and that in this case is 1/67 of a vote. The interaction of the historic district and the condominium statutes in this appeal, we point out, will not constrain us in deciding how condominium interests may be characterized in other contexts.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">We are not persuaded otherwise by the claim of the defendants that the legislature intended to make the grand list the \u201cfocal point of the voting franchise.\u201d Although it is true that the legislative preconditions for voting are set out in the statute, the quality of that vote \u2014 be it one full vote per unit owner or a fraction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>of one full vote for each unit owner \u2014 is not. When we balance all the interests, i.e., common sense, a rational result and most of all the carrying out of the statutory purpose, they warrant the result we reach today. As we have said, the interpretation and parsing of terms of common law tenure are not appropriate here in these unprecedented and unanticipated circumstances. While on the New York Court of Appeals, Justice Cardozo said: \u201cLife has relations not capable always of division into inflexible compartments. The moulds expand and shrink.\u201d <em>Glanzer </em>v. <em>Shephard, </em>233 N.Y. 236, 241, 135 N.E. 275 (1922).
