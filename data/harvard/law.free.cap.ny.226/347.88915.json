The clause is not ambiguous, the intent is clear and it cannot be made a reservation by a strained construction or by the mere use of the words <em>\u201c </em>reserves and excepts.\u201d <em>(Clark </em>v. <em>Devoe, </em>124 N.

The grantor\u2019s title as absolute owner in fee of the lime kiln and the land upon which it stood was not changed by the deed to the Marcellus Electric Railroad Company; it was merely qualified by a condition subsequent. <em>(Winthrop </em>v. <em>McKim, </em>51 How.

The grantor, however, \u201c reserves and excepts out of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>aforesaid premises for herself, her heirs, grantees, lessees and assigns, the lime kiln and the land that the same now occupies so long as said lime kiln is occupied and used for the purpose of burning lime.\u201d This parcel was about twenty feet square, and is the land which the plaintiff seeks to recover in ejectment. -</p>\n<p id=\"AE9\">By the words used there was excepted from the grant as to the twenty feet in question a determinable fee subject to a collateral limitation. It follows that what was attempted to be passed to the grantee was a future executory estate in fee which should vest in possession in case the contingency upon which it was limited should ever occurs Originally at common law this could not be done. In equity it was permissible through the device of a use. After the Statute of Uses the equitable was con- - verted into a legal estate. These- rules and the forms of conveyances adapted to them have now been swept away by our Revised Statutes. Such interests defined as future estates may be created by ordinary grant. Certain restrictions, however, are imposed as to the creation of such future estates by our views of public policy. They shall not suspend the absolute power of alienation beyond a time measured by lives. Obviously this is no.t done by the estate we are here considering. There is a vested right to a future contingent estate where the contingency is due only to the uncertainty of the event and, if so, there are always persons in being who might convey an absolute fee in possession. The revisers, however, had something more in mind at least with regard to certain future estates than merely the prohibition of restrictions on alienation. As an illustration a remainder might not be limited on more than two successive life estates. They well knew that every executory device or springing use was then required to be so limited that the contingency upon which they depended must happen within a time measured by fives. They were aware of the definition of a springing use; that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>depended on no prior estate. Yet they intended to cover the entire ground as to the creation and division of estates. Their design was to simplify, not to complicate, the transfer of real estate \u25a0\u2014to restrict, not to extend, the limitations which a grantor might impose upon it. With all this in mind they provided that a freehold estate might be created to commence at a future day and that a fee may be limited on a fee on a contingency which must occur, if ever, within a time measured by livesX Technically a springing use, or what is now its equivalent, does not come within this definition. It does come within its object and purpose. Had the determinable fee been granted, not excepted, no question would arise-. It is inconceivable that the revisers intended to make a distinction between two classes of cases the effect of which is substantially identical. It must be that in speaking of a fee limited on a fee they had not in mind the technical distinction of the early conveyancers. They were considering future estates and their desire was that when such estates depended upon a contingency they should vest in possession within a reasonable period. Their language should, therefore, be so construed as to carry out their intention. When they speak of a fee limited on a fee in this connection they refer to- the grant of any future fee which may arise on a contingency which limits a prior fee however such result is brought about.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">If this is so the attempted conveyance by the plaintiff was void. No valid future estate passed to the grantee. The absolute fee remains in the grantor. It is still in her and she may maintain an action in .ejectment against one wrongfully in possession of the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">The judgment of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">His cock, Ch.
