The plaintiff demurred .to the third separate defense set up in the answer. The Special Term sustained the demurrer, and the Appellate Division, third department, affirmed the order.

It is said that the incompetency charged applies and is restricted to the plaintiff\u2019s learning, knowledge and ability as a teacher of music, whereas the attempted justification only touches upon her temperamental disqualifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">We think that the article has been misconstrued and the justification unduly limited.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">Miss Cafferty was charged with incompetency as <em>supervisor </em>of music and not as a <em>teacher </em>of music. As these words were clear and unambiguous their meaning cannot be extended by an innuendo. The office of an innuendo is to explain what has- already been expressed, but not to enlarge or change the sense of the words used. <em>(Bearce </em>v. <em>Bass, </em>88 Maine, 521; <em>Goodrich </em>v. <em>Hooper, </em>97 Mass. 1, 5; <em>Fleischmann </em>v. <em>Bennett, </em>87 N. Y. 231; <em>McDonald </em>v. <em>Press Publishing Co., </em>174 App. Div. 463.) It is well settled that when the publication complained of is libelous <em>per se </em>no innuendo is necessary and, if the innuendo alleged is not borne out by the words, it may be treated as surplusage and a recovery had on the words themselves. <em>(Gustin </em>v. <em>Evening Press Co., </em>172 Mich. 311, 315; <em>Arnold </em>v. <em>Ingram, </em>151 Wis. 438, 452.)</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">Construed by this rule the complaint alleges that the plaintiff was charged with incompetency as supervisor of music and that the charge meant and was intended to mean (a) that the plaintiff was unqualified and unfitted for supervisor; (b) that she lacked the ability, special education, training and equipment necessary to enable her to perform the duties of a supervisor of music with intelligence and efficiency; (c) that the plaintiff was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>unfitted to retain the position as supervisor of music in the public schools of Binghamton.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">The attempted justification met these charges fully and completely. It stated five things wherein the plaintiff had shown herself to be unqualified, unfitted, without training and equipment to intelligently and efficiently perform her duties as <em>supervisor </em>of music in the public schools.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">These things were (a) that she had a vexatious and perverse temper; (b) that she spitefully and abusively illtreated teachers who were required to work under her direction; (c) that she wilfully antagonized the principal of the high school whom she was to obey; (d) that she wilfully inconvenienced the principal and other teachers; (e) and systematically caused dissensions among the teaching force.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">A supervisor is one having authority over others and to supervise is to superintend and direct. Incompetence, as applicable here, is a general lack of capacity or fitness for directing, controlling and supervising the teaching of music. This is an entirely different matter from incompetence as a teacher or the lack of requisite knowledge, equipment and ability to teach. A peculiar adaptability is frequently necessary to make one fitted for the control and direction of subordinates, and a person perfectly able to do the work himself may be wholly incapable of acting as a superintendent over others. Every business and profession is familiar with this distinction.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">But even if the article means that the plaintiff was incompetent to teach music to children in the public schools we would still be of the opinion that the justification was sufficient. A teacher who had a vexatious and perverse temper, illtreated her associates, antagonized the rules and wilfully inconvenienced superiors could hardly be fitted for her place. Education in part at least consists in knowing how to behave. However this may be, the plaintiff was a supervisor of music and not merely a teacher. So reads the charge. _</p>\n<p id=\"b149-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>If the defendant were able to prove the statements alleged the plaintiff certainly was incompetent as a supervisor or director of music, and the published article was, therefore, true.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">Words are 'to be construed as persons generally understand them and according to their ordinary meaning. <em>(Larsen </em>v. <em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle, </em>165 App. Div. 4; 214 N. Y. 713.) Incompetence, therefore, cannot be limited merely to a lack of mental equipment and knowledge of music or ability to teach. It must have an association with the work and position which the plaintiff was filling \u2014 a lack of fitness for the duties of the office. <em>(Nehrling </em>v. <em>State, </em>112 Wis. 637, 647; <em>People ex rel. Hannan </em>v. <em>Board of Health, City of Troy, </em>153 N. Y. 513, 520.) Teachers and prneipals in our public schools and professors in our colleges require something more than learning to make them efficient. Character, manners and self-control are a part of the qualifications which fit one to be a guide to the young to whom example is as potent as precept.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">The libel law is not a system of technicalities, but reasonable regulations whereby the public may be furnished news and information, but not false stories about any one. When the truth is so near to the facts as published that fine and shaded d stinetions must be drawn and words pressed out of their ordinary usage to sustain a charge of libel, no legal harm has been done. Competency, therefore, as applicab e to the plaintiff\u2019s position would be accepted by the ordinary person as a synonym for fitness and ability to do the work required in the public schools as a supervisor of music and would not be understood or taken to refer to the plaintiff\u2019s learning or culture as a musician. True, some might take her discharge to mean all this, but the law cannot take words from their setting and association; rather it must receive them for what they fairly and reasonably state.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">Whoever may read this opinion, of course, must understand that we are dealing solely with a question of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>law and the sufficiency of the words which the parties have put on paper to make out a defense if proved. \u25a0 The statements must not be accepted as any intimation of the facts for we are dealing solely with a question of pleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">The interlocutory judgment sustaining the demurrer should be reversed, and the demurrer overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">The judgment appealed from should be reversed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">His cock, Ch. J., Collin, Cuddeback and Hogan, JJ., concur; Chase and McLaughlin, JJ., dissent. Judgment reversed, etc.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
