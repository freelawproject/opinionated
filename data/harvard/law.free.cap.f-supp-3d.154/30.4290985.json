FURMAN, United States District Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b70-17\">The first bellwether trial in this multi-district litigation (\u201cMDL\u201d), familiarity with which is presumed, involves claims brought by Plaintiff Robert Scheuer (\u201cPlaintiff\u2019 or \u201cScheuer\u201d) against General Motors LLC (\u201cDefendant\u201d or \u201cNew GM\u201d) stemming from a May 28, 2014 car accident involving Scheuer\u2019s 2003 Saturn Ion. That car was manufactured by General Motors Corporation (\u201cOld GM\u201d) \u2014 which filed for bankruptcy in 2009, a bankruptcy from which New GM emerged. New GM now moves, pursuant to Rule 56 <em>of </em>the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, for summary judgment on all of Scheuer\u2019s claims, contending, first, that he cannot show that an alleged ignition switch defect in the car caused or enhanced his injuries and, second, that all of his claims based solely on New GM\u2019s conduct \u2014 the only claims that could expose New GM to punitive damages \u2014 fail as a matter of law. (Docket No. 1810). For the following reasons, New GM\u2019s motion is almost entirely DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-18\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b70-19\">The following undisputed facts are taken from admissible evidence in the record and the parties\u2019 statements pursuant to Local Rule 56.1. Plaintiff, a resident of Oklahoma, purchased a 2003 Saturn Ion manufactured by Old GM in Nevada in the summer of 2003. <em>(See </em>Pl.\u2019s Local Rule 56.1 Resp. Opp\u2019n New GM\u2019s Statement Undisputed Material Facts <em>&amp; </em>Statement Additional Material Disputed Facts (Docket No. 1880) (\u201cPl.\u2019s 56.1 Statement\u201d) \u00b61\u00b61-2; Third Am. Compl. (Docket No. 1696) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>(\u201cTAC\u201d) \u00b6 9). On February 25, 2014, New GM notified the National Highway Safety Administration (\u201cNHTSA\u201d) of a potentially deadly defect in the ignition switches installed in many GM-brand vehicles, including the 2003 Saturn Ion; and New GM\u2019s determination to conduct a safety recall of the affected vehicles. <em>(See </em>Pl.\u2019s 56.1 Statement \u00b65; Affirmation R. Allan Pixton (Docket No. 1821) (\u201cPixton Dec!.\u201d), Ex. 3). The NHTSA letter stated that \u201c[t]he ignition switch torque performance [in these vehicles] may not meet General Motors\u2019 specification. If the. torque performance is not to specification, the ignition switch may unintentionally move from the \u2018run\u2019 position to The \u2018accessory\u2019 or \u2018off position with a corresponding reduction or loss of power.\u201d (Pixton Decl., Ex. 3, at 1).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">In April and May 2014, Plaintiff received two recall notices from New GM. <em>(See </em>PL\u2019s 56.1 Statement \u00b6\u00b6 12-15; Pixton Decl., Exs. 4-5). The notices advised Plaintiff that replacement parts were being made available and that, in the meantime, he should \u201cremove all items fi\u2019om your key ring, leaving only the vehicle key. The key fob (if applicable) should also be removed from the key ring.\u201d (Pixton Deck, Ex. 4). Following receipt of the May notice, Plaintiff called his local car dealership and was informed that replacement parts were not then available. <em>(See </em>Ph\u2019s 56.1 Statement \u00b6\u00b6 16-18). The dealership also reminded Plaintiff to take everything but his ignition switch key off his key ring, which Plaintiff did. <em>(See id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 18-19).. Plaintiff continued to drive the Saturn Ion. <em>(See id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 19-20).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">On May 28, 2014, Plaintiff was driving on a highway in Oklahoma when he was forced off the road by another car. <em>(See id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 20-22). The precise sequence of what followed is heavily disputed, but Plaintiff\u2019s car ended up crashing head-on into two trees. <em>(See id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 21-22). Plaintiffs frontal airbags, however, did not deploy. <em>(See </em>Deck Robert C. Hilliard Supp. Ph\u2019s Mem. Law Opp\u2019n New GM\u2019s Mot. Summ. J. (Docket No. 1882) (\u201cHilliard Deck\u201d), Ex. 14 (\u201cSclieuer Dep.\u201d), at 126). Shortly after the accident, Plaintiffs insurer, State Farm, \u201cdetermined that the vehicle was a total loss,\u201d and paid him a sum representing \u201cthe value of the vehicle.\u201d (Mem. Law Supp.- PL\u2019s Mot. <em>In Limine </em>No. 4 (Docket No. 1712) (\u201cPL\u2019s Fourth MIL Mem.\u201d) 4; <em>see id., </em>Ex. 1). Thereafter, State Farm transferred title for the car to a salvage yard, and on September 22, 2014, the salvage yard destroyed the car. <em>(See </em>Pl.\u2019s Fourth MIL Mem. 4; <em>id., </em>Ex. 3; New GM\u2019s Combined Opp\u2019n PL\u2019s Mot. <em>In Limine </em>No. 4 (Docket No. 1816) 5). On October 10, 2014, Plaintiff filed this action against New GM, alleging that he suffered various inju-ri\u00e9s as a result of the airbag non-deployment in his crash and that the airbag non-deployment was a result of the widely publicized ignition! switch defect. (Complaint, <em>Fleck, et al. v. General Motors, LLC, </em>No. 14-CV-8176 (JMF) (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 10, 2014), Docket No. 1; <em>see also </em>\u2018TAC \u00b6\u00b67-8). Plaintiffs case' was consolidated with the MDL and eventually selected to be tried as the first of several \u201cbellwether\u201d cases. <em>(See </em>MDL Consolidated Order, <em>Fleck, </em>14-CV-8176 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 20, 2014), Docket No. 4; Order No. 25, 14-MD-2543, Docket No. 422; 14-MD-2543, Docket No. 590; 14-MD-2543, Docket No. 1217).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b71-9\">Before turning to New GM\u2019s arguments for summary judgment, it is necessary to briefly summarize certain proceedings before the Honorable Robert. E. Gerber, United States Bankruptcy Judge for the Southern District of New York, who presided over the bankruptcy of Old GM in 2009. After New GM\u2019s disclosure of the ignition switch defect in early 2014, many claims were filed against New GM \u2014 some alleging economic losses and some alleging <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>personal injuries and wrongful deaths. In April and August 2014, New GM filed motions before the Bankruptcy Court alleging that many of those claims were barred by the 2009 Sale Order through which New GM assumed many of Old GM\u2019s assets and some of its liabilities. In April 2015, Judge Gerber ruled that many of the claims brought against New GM were in fact barred by the 2009 Sale Order. <em>See In re Motors Liquidation Co,, </em>529 B.R. 510 (Bankr.S.D.N.Y.2015). In particular, he determined that New GM could be .held liable for certain assumed liabilities of Old GM (namely, products liability claims that were included in the Sale Agreement), but distinguished between liability based on Old GM\u2019s conduct and liability for \u201cclaims based solely on any wrongful conduct its own part.\u201d <em>Id </em>at 583. A later Order implementing that opinion defined claims \u201cbased solely on New GM\u2019s own, independent, post-Closing acts or conduct\u201d as \u201cIndependent Claims.\u201d <em>See In re Motors Liquidation Co., </em>09-50026 (REG), Docket No. 13177 \u00b64 (Bankr.S.D.N.Y. June 1, 2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">The definition of \u201cIndependent Claims\u201d reemerged as significant-in Judge Gerber\u2019s recent opinion on punitive damages and \u201cimputation.\u201d <em>See In re Motors Liquidation Co., </em>541 B.R. 104 (Bankr.S.D.N.Y. 2015) <em>(\u201cNovember Decision\u201d). </em>There, Judge Gerber made two findings that bear on this bellwether trial. First, he determined that, as a matter of bankruptcy law, knowledge of Old GM personnel or knowledge of information contained in Old GM files could be imputed to New GM only to the extent that it could be shown, as a matter of non-bankruptcy law, that New GM actually had that knowledge (for example, through an Old GM employee who later became an employee of New GM). <em>See November Decision </em>at 108. Second, Judge Gerber ruled that claims for punitive damages could only be \u201cbased on New GM knowledge and conduct alone\u201d because New GM did not assume liability for punitive damages under the Sale Agreement. <em>See id. </em>In light of Judge Gerber\u2019s decisions, there are' three types of -damages available to Plaintiff: (1) compensatory damages for products liability claims based on Old GM conduct, which were assumed by New GM in the 2009 Sale Agreement; (2) compensatory damages for \u201cIndependent Claims\u201d \u2014 that is, claims based solely on New- GM conduct (including any knowledge of Old GM properly, imputed to New GM); and (3) punitive damages for \u201cIndependent' Claims\u201d (again, including- any knowledge of Old GM properly imputed to New GM). In his Third Amended .Complaint, Plaintiff pursues all\" three.-- <em>{See </em>TAC \u00b6\u00b6 418-29).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARDS</p>\n<p id=\"b72-8\">Summary judgment is appropriate where the admissible evidence and pleadings'demonstrate \u201cno genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a); <em>see also Johnson v. Killian, </em>680 F.3d 234, 236 (2d Cir.2012) (per curiam). A disput\u00e9 over an issue of material fact qualifies as genuine if the \u201cevidence is such that \u00e1 reasonable jury could return a judgment for the- 'nonmoving party.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986); <em>accord Roe v. City of Waterbury, </em>542 F.3d 31, 35 (2d Cir.2008). The moving party bears the initial burden of demonstrating the absence of a genuine issue of-material fact. See <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 325 (1986). \u201cIn moving for summary judgment- against a party who will bear the ultimate burden of proof at trial, the movant\u2019s burden will be satisfied if he can point to an absence of evi-dehce to support an essential element of the. nonmoving party\u2019s claim.\u201d <em>Goenaga v. March of Dimes Birth Defects Found., </em>51 F.3d 14, 18 (2d Cir.1995) (citing <em>Celotex, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>477 U.S. at 322-23); <em>accord PepsiCo, Inc. v. Coca-Cola Co., </em>315 F.3d 101, 105 (2d Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">In ruling on a motion for summary judgment,. all evidence must be viewed \u201cin the light most favorable to the non-moving party,\u201d <em>Overton v. N.Y. State Div. of Military &amp; Naval Affairs, </em>373 F.3d 83, 89 (2d Cir.2004), and the court must \u201cresolve all ambiguities and draw all permissible factual inferences in favor of the party against whom summary judgment is sought,\u201d <em>Sec. Ins. </em>Co. <em>of Hartford v. Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc., </em>391 F.3d, 77, 83 (2d Cir.2004). To defeat a motion for summary judgment, the non-moving party must advance more than a \u201cscintilla of evidence,\u201d <em>Anderson, </em>477 U.S. at 252, and demonstrate more than \u201csome metaphysical doubt as to the material facts,\u201d <em>Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., </em>475 U.S. 574, 586 (1986). The non-moving party \u201ccannot defeat the' motion by relying on the allegations in [its] pleading or on con-clusory statements, or on mere assertions that affidavits supporting the motion are not credible.\u201d <em>Gottlieb v. Cnty. of Orange, </em>84 F.3d 511, 518 (2d Cir.1996) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">CAUSATION</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">New GM argues first that .summary judgment is warranted with respect to <em>all </em>of Plaintiffs claims because there is no admissible evidence that the ignition switch defect (a defect that New GM has admitted existed in 2003 Saturn Ions and other GM cars) caused or contributed to his accident or injuries. <em>(See </em>Mem. Supp. New GM\u2019s Mot. Summ. 'J. (Docket No. 1811) (\u201cNew GM\u2019s Mem.\u201d) 5-11). The Court disagrees. Under Oklahoma law\u2014 which the parties agree applies in this diversity action \u2014 \u201c[t]he determination of causation may be removed from the province of the fact-finder only when there is a complete lack of evidence and no reasonable inference tending to link the defendant\u2019s negligence to the plaintiffs harm.\u201d <em>Smith v. Hines, </em>261 P.3d 1129, 1135 (Okla. 2011). Thus, summary judgment is inappropriate when a reasonable jury could infer a causal link between the plaintiffs injury and facts relating to a defendant\u2019s conduct; the plaintiff need not exclude all other possible causes of his injury. <em>See Jones v. Mercy Health Ctr., Inc., </em>155 P.3d 9, 12 (Okla.2006); <em>Dutsch v. Sea Ray Boats, Inc., </em>845 P.2d 187, 191 (Okla.1992); <em>see also Chickasha Cotton Oil Co. v. Hancock, </em>306 P.2d 330, 333-34 (Okla.1957) (holding that \u201cdirect proof\u2019 that pellets manufactured by defendants contained harmful chemical was not necessary where \u201c[t]he same facts were susceptible of proof by circumstantial evidence, making it appear more probable that [the injury] came from this source than from any other\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-9\">Here, in light of the Court\u2019s recent Opinion and Order largely denying New GM\u2019s motion, pursuant to <em>Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., </em>509 U.S. 579, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469 (1993), to exclude Plaintiffs experts (see Op. &amp; Order (Docket No. 1970) <em>(\u201cDaubert </em>Op.\u201d)), the question of causation is plainly one for the jury. Put simply, taken together, Plaintiffs experts on accident reconstruction, airbag design, and the ignition switch provide sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find that the airbags in Plaintiffs car failed to deploy as a result of the ignition switch defect. <em>(See, e.g., </em>Pixton Decl., Ex. 14 (\u201cMcCort Dep.\u201d) 55 (\u201c[T]he airbag didn\u2019t deploy and we had a high Delta-v, and so either something else was going on or the ignition switch failed.\u201d); <em>id., </em>Ex. 32 (\u201cLoudon Report\u201d) 12 (\u201cWhen the ignition switch moves from [run] to [accessory] or [off] mode,'the airbags do not deploy, and the seat pretensioners do not work.\u201d); <em>see also Daubert </em>Op. at 5 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>(\u201cMcCort is qualified to testify both that the front airbag should have deployed in this specific case and that a delta-v of this magnitude is generally above the threshold observed in most reconstructed crashes to cause a front airbag deployment.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted))). And similarly, taken together, Plaintiffs experts on occupant kinematics, crashworthiness, and airbag sensors provide sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find, in turn, that the airbag non-deployment caused, or exacerbated, Plaintiffs injuries. <em>(See, e.g., </em>Pixton Decl., Ex 16 (\u201cCaruso Dep.\u201d) 108 (\u201cI will say based on my 21 years of design experience and development experience that ... these are the types of injuries that airbags will typically protect against.\u201d); <em>id. </em>116 (\u201cI believe I can opine in general terms about what the airbag is supposed to do and the general types of injuries it\u2019s supposed to prevent\u201d); Pixton Decl., Ex. 18 (\u201cMarkiish-ewski Dep.\u201d) 93 (discussing the tests he has done to evaluate injury thresholds); <em>see also </em>McCort Dep. 62 (\u201c[I]n terms of biom-echanics, I certainly can tell the jury what happens when you\u2019re in a frontal crash and which direction the body in general will go.\u201d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">Contrary to New GM\u2019s contentions, Plaintiff need not introduce expert evidence on specific injury causation, as this is a case \u201cwhere the cause of the injury is apparent without the aid of science and the injury is objective rather than subjective in nature.\u201d <em>Orthopedic Clinic v. Hanson, </em>415 P.2d 991, 995-96 (Okla.1966); <em>see also Smith, </em>261 P.3d at 1135-36; <em>Jones, </em>155 P.3d at 12.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The cases New GM cites in its reply brief for the proposition that expert testimony on injury \u201cenhancement\u201d is required are not to the contrary; in each of those cases, there was no expert evidence of <em>either </em>specific or general enhancement of injury due to airbag non-deployment. <em>(See </em>Reply Mem. Supp. New GM\u2019s Mot. Summ. J. (Docket No. 1941) (\u201cNew GM\u2019s Reply Mem.\u201d) 3 n.3). In <em>Battistella v. Daimler Chrysler Motors, Co., </em>for example, there was <em>no </em>expert testimony as to whether or not airbag non-deployment typically caused or exacerbated car crash injuries, as the Court had stricken the proffered expert\u2019s testimony. No. Civ. A 03-2286, 2004 WL 1336444, at *1-2 (E.D.La. June 14, 2004). Similarly, in <em>Caboni v. General Motors Corp., </em>the Court, relying on <em>Battistella, </em>found no evidence to support causation because the plaintiff had not adduced any expert testimony that \u201cthe injuries [he] suffered would have been different or less significant had the air bag deployed.\u201d 398 F.3d 357, 362 (5th Cir.2005). The experts there appear to have testified only that the plaintiff sustained certain injuries as a result of the crash and that airbag deployment would have prevented him from hitting his head on the steering wheel; there was no evidence with respect to airbag non-deployment\u2019s tendency to enhance crash injuries. <em>See id.., see also Stewart v. Gen. Motors Corp., </em>222 F. Supp. 2d 845, 848-49 (W.D.Ky.2002) (same). Here, by contrast, there is expert evidence from which a juror could conclude that airbag non-deployment enhances injuries of the type suffered by Plaintiff and, in turn, from which a juror could infer that the airbag non-deployment in Plaintiffs case enhanced his injuries. It follows that New GM\u2019s motion for summary judgment on all claims based on causation must be and is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">PRODUCTS LIABILITY</p>\n<p id=\"b74-8\">Plaintiff\u2019s first claim is for \u201cOklahoma Manufacturer\u2019s Product Liability,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>which is the common law standard for strict liability in tort. <em>(See </em>TAC- \u00b6\u00b6 342-79). He asserts'two theories of products liability: design defect and post-sale failure to warn. <em>(See </em>Pl.\u2019s Mem. Law Opp\u2019n New GM\u2019s Mot. Summ. J. (Docket No. 1878) (\u201cPl.\u2019s Mem.\u201d) 11). Pursuant to the 2009 Sale Agreement, New GM assumed liability on the first theory from Old GM, the actual manufacturer of the car \u2014 but as noted, only for compensatory damages, not for punitive damages. <em>(See </em>New GM\u2019s Mem. 12-13). By contrast, the latter theory is premised on New GM\u2019s own conduct\u2014 that is, on its failure to warn Plaintiff about the ignition switch defect despite its own conceded knowledge of the defect. Thus, if valid, Plaintiffs ,failure-to-warn products liability claim would constitute an \u201cIndependent Claim\u201d within the meaning of the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s rulings for which Plaintiff could conceivably recover punitive damages. New GM argues that the claim is not valid under Oklahoma law. <em>(See </em>New GM\u2019s Mem. 12-13,19).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">In Oklahoma, the elements of a failure-to-wam claim are: (1) the product caused an injury to the plaintiff; (2) the defect existed in the product when the product left the manufacturer\u2019s possession and control; and (3) the defect made the product unreasonably dangerous. <em>See Kirkland v. Gen. Motors Corp., </em>521 P.2d 1353, 1363 (Okla.1974). The defect can be caused either by a defective design or by an inadequate warning about the product\u2019s dangers. <em>See Braswell v. Cincinnati, Inc., </em>731 F.3d 1081, 1085 (10th Cir.2013) (applying Oklahoma law); <em>Tansy v. Dacomed Corp., </em>890 P.2d 881, 886 (Okla.1994). New GM argues that \u201cOklahoma does not recognize a <em>post-sale </em>duty to warn,, or retrofit a product\u201d (New GM\u2019s Mem. 19 n.54) (emphasis added) (quoting <em>Wicker ex rel. Estate of Wicker v. Ford Motor Co., </em>393 F. Supp. 2d 1229, 1236 (W.D.Okla.2005)), but the weight of authority suggests that the duty to provide adequate warnings is a continuing duty that, exists even after the sale of the product. <em>See, e.g., Smith v. FMC Corp., </em>754 F.2d 873, 877 (10th Cir.1985) (\u201c[A] manufacturer has a responsibility to warn of a defective product at any time after it is manufactured and sold if the manufacturer becomes, aware of the defect.\u201d); <em>Thiry v. Armstrong World Indus., </em>661 P.2d 515, 517 (Okla.1983) (\u201cIt should not be profitable for .a manufacturer to knowingly continue to market a defective product.\u201d); <em>McKee v. Moore, </em>648 P.2d 21, 24 (Okla.1982) (\u201cThe manufacturer has a continuing duty to warn of all potential danger, which it knew, or should have known, in the exercise of reasonable care to exist.\u201d); 8 Vicki Lawrence MacDougall, Oklahoma Product Liability Law \u00a7 7:2 (2015) (\u201cThe warning obligation of the manufacturer is a continuing duty.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-8\">Admittedly, New GM\u2019s argument to the contrary finds some linguistic support in a handful of federal cases. <em>See, e.g., Smith v. Cent. Mine Equip. Co., </em>559 Fed.Appx. 679, 685 (10th Cir.2014) (unpublished); <em>Smith v. Sears Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>No. 04-CV-1271 (HE), 2006 WL 687151, at *6 (W.D.Okla.

But none of them cites Oklahoma decisions on point.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> And in each case, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>court cited the fact that'the product at issue was not alleged to be defective at the time of sale. <em>See Smith, </em>559 Fed.Appx. at 680-81 (noting that the drill rig at issue had been retrofitted and, at the time of the accident, no longer had \u201coperational safety-equipment, making it more dangerous than it would be&gt; otherwise\u201d); <em>Oja v. Howmedica, Inc., </em>111 F.3d 782, 791 (10th Cir.1997) (applying Colorado law) (noting that under a failure-to-warn theory,\u2019 \u201cthe product must have been defective at the time of sale\u201d); <em>Sears Roebuck, </em>2006 WL 687151, at *6 (stating-that \u201cOklahoma does not recognize a post-sale duty to warn\u201d., because, instead, \u201cthe determination of'whether a product is unreasonably dangerous due to a defective design is measured by consumer expectations <em>at the time the product leaves the manufacturer\u2019s control\u201d); Wicker, </em>393 F.

Supp. 2d at 193-94 (listing cases-- from around the country where courts declined to impose a post-sale duty to warn because the product was not shown to be negligently-' designed as originally sold). New GM relies heavily in its rep\u00edy brief on <em>Stokes v. Lake Raider, Inc., </em>No. 13-CV-507 (KEW), 2014 WL 7375576 (E.D.Okla. Dec. 29, 2014), but in that third-party indemnification case there was no allegation that the boat design at issue was defective until a retrofit was developed after the boat .left the manufacturer; furthermore, the plaintiff had not alleged any product liability or negligence claim against the boat seller. <em>Id. </em>at 2. In this case, of course, Plaintiff alleges a defect in -the ignition switch of his car that, if it was present at all (a point that New GM does not concede), was present when the car was manufactured and sold. Under \u25a0those circumstances, the Court concludes, Oklahoma law does recognize a post-sale duty to warn....</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">Somewhat more substantially, New GM -argues that, to the extent a post-sale duty to' warn exists under Oklahoma law at all, it wofild not apply to New GM as a successor corporation that- did not manufacture Plaintiffs' car. <em>(See </em>New GM\u2019s Mem. 12-13; New GM\u2019s Reply 6-7). After all, -the very name of the cause of action is \u201cOklahoma <em>Manufacturer\u2019s </em>Products Liability.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Kirkland, </em>521 P.2d at 1361. <em>(See </em>New GM\u2019s Mem. 12). And, as New GM emphasizes, Plaintiff does not cite-any case applying Oklahoma- law recognizing \u00e1 successor corporation\u2019s post-sale duty to warn a purchaser of the predecessor corporation\u2019s product. <em>(See </em>New GM\u2019s Reply 7-10). With respect to the first point, however, Oklahoma courts have\u2014 despite the name \u2014 extended liability beyond manufacturers to entities that \u201chave some relationship with the product alleged to have caused a.plaintiffs injuries, either through .manufacturing, selling, or distributing the product.\u201d <em>Schrock v. Wyeth, Inc., </em>727 F.3d 1273, 1282 (10th Cir.2013). And <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>with respect to the second point, the lack of precedent is not dispositive, as there appears to be no Oklahoma precedent either accepting <em>or rejecting </em>a successor corporation\u2019s post-sale duty to warn; that is, the question appears to be one of first impression under Oklahoma law. Accordingly, it is the task of the Court, sitting in diversity, to predict what the Oklahoma Supreme Court would decide if presented with the question. <em>See Travelers Ins. Co. v. 633 Third </em>Assocs., 14 F.3d 114, 119 (2d Cir.1994). Based on existing Oklahoma precedent, influential treatises, and persuasive authority from other jurisdictions, the Court concludes that the Oklahoma Supreme Court would hold that a successor corporation, such as New GM, has an independent post-sale duty to warn so long as cert\u00e1in conditions are met.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">First and foremost,-that is the position taken by the influential <em>Restatement (Third) of Torts: Products Liability. </em>Section 13 of the <em>Restatement </em>provides that a successor corporation</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0L\">is subject to liability for harm to persons or property caused by the successor\u2019s failure to warn of a risk created by a product sold or distributed by the predecessor if: (1) the successor undertakes or agrees to provide services for maintenance or repair of the product or enters into a similar relationship with purchasers of the predecessor\u2019s products giving rise to actual or potential economic advantage to the successor, and (2) a reasonable person in the position of the successor would provide a warning.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AB\">Restatement (Third) of Torts: Products Liability \u00a7 13 (1998). Second, many other states and many federal courts have adopted that position. <em>See, e.g., Herrod v. Metal Powder Prods., </em>413 Fed.Appx. 7, 13 (10th Cir.2010) (per curiam) (applying Utah law); <em>Patton v. TIC United Corp., </em>77 F.3d 1235, 1240-41 (10th Cir.1996) (applying Kansas law); <em>Florom v. Elliott Mfg., </em>867 F.2d 570, 577 (10th Cir.1989) (applying Colorado law) (\u201cSuccession alone does not impose a duty to warn the predecessor\u2019s customers of recently-discovered defects. Where such a duty arises, it stems from the existence of the relationship \"between the successor and the customers of the predecessor.\u201d) (citation omitted); <em>Tabor v. Metal Ware Corp., </em>168 P.3d 814, 818 (Utah 2007) (\u201cWe conclude that Utah does impose an independent post-sale duty on successor corporations to warn customers of defects in products manufactured and sold by the predecessor corporation as outlined in section 13 of the Restatement (Third) of Torts.\u201d); <em>Schumacher v. Richards Shear Co., </em>59 N.Y.2d 239, 247, 464 N.Y.S.2d 437, 451 N.E.2d 195 (1983); <em>see also </em>Restatement (Third) of Torts: Products Liability \u00a7 13, Reporters\u2019 Note to. Comment a (1998) (collecting cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-8\">Although Oklahoma courts have not (to the Court\u2019s knowledge) had occasion to consider the Restatement\u2019s position, an Oklahoma products liability treatise suggests that that position is consistent with Oklahonia law. <em>See </em>8 Vicki Lawrence Mac-Dougall, Oklahoma Product Liability Law \u00a7 9:2 (2015) (\u201cCourts may impose a duty to warn on successors based on a reasonableness standard.\u201d). Additionally, .the <em>Restatement </em>has b\u00e9en highly influential in Oklahoma products liability law. <em>See, e.g., Allenberg v. Bentley Hedges Travel Serv., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number><em>Inc., </em>22 P.3d 223, 227 (Okla.2001) (noting that Oklahoma strict products liability is based on Section 402A of the <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts); Tansy, </em>890 P.2d at 884-88 (adopting Comment K to Section 402A of the <em>Restatement (Second) of forts); Kirkland, </em>521 P.2d 1353 (relying on Section 402A in endorsing strict products liability in Oklahoma law). Finally, recognizing a duty to warn on the part of some successor corporations would be consistent with the theory of products liability endorsed by the Oklahoma Supreme Court, which places the duty to protect the public from a dangerous defect on the entity that \u201cis best situated to protect the public against products that are a menace to safety.\u201d <em>Okla. Gas &amp; Elec. Co. v. McGraw-Edison Co., </em>834 P.2d 980, 984-85 (Okla.1992); <em>see Kirkland, </em>521 P.2d at 1362. In the Court\u2019s view, therefore, it is likely that the Oklahoma Supreme Court would adopt the Restatement\u2019s position on whether and when a successor corporation is subject to liability based on a failure to warn with respect to a product sold or distributed by its predecessor. <em>Cf., e.g., Hartford Fire Ins. Co. v. Dent-X Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>No.. 05-CV-1019 (TPS), 2007 WL 911841, at *5 n. 2 (D.Conn. Mar. 23, 2007) (predicting that the Connecticut Supreme Court would adopt a standard set forth in the <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>because the <em>Restatement </em>had been influential in Connecticut products liability law).</p>\n<p id=\"Aq8\">. The pertinent question, therefore, is whether New GM has a sufficient \u201crelationship with the customers of [Old GM]\u201d to trigger an independent post-sale duty. <em>Florom, </em>867 F.2d at 577. The primary factor .courts have looked to in this context is whether the successor corporation assumed service and repair duties to predecessor products. <em>See, e.g., id.; In re Old Carco LLC, </em>492 B.R. 392, 405 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y.2013); <em>Doyle, </em>307 P.3d at 409; <em>see also </em>Restatement (Third) of Torts: Products Liability \u00a7 13, emt. b (1998) (noting that a court should consider whether the successor sells or offers to sell \u201cspare parts to the predecessor\u2019s customers for machinery sold by-the predecessor '... in deciding whether sufficient actual or potential economic advantage has accrued to the successor to warrant the imposition of a- duty to warn\u201d). Here, Section 2.3 of the 2009 Sale Agreement provides that New GM assumed all liabilities under express warranties, even for Old GM cars sold before the bankruptcy; that creates obligations with respect to Old GM vehicles still under warranty, and presumably also means that New GM continued to provide spare parts and services for Old GM vehicles even after warranties expired. <em>(See </em>Pixton Deck, Ex. 22 (\u201cSale Agreement\u201d) 29). The notification and recall obligations under the Safety Act that New GM inherited provide another kind of service and repair duty. Among other things, those obligations put New GM into a position of ongoing communication with Old GM purchasers. <em>See Florom, </em>867 F.2d at 577. <em>Holland v. FCA US LLC, </em>No. 15-CV-121, 2015 WL 7196197 (N.D.Ohio Nov. 16, 2015), cited by New GM, actually supports these conclusions. <em>(See </em>New GM\u2019s Reply Mem. 9 &amp; n.17). The <em>Holland </em>Court found that the plaintiffs (who were alleging economic harm) had failed to establish a sufficient relationship between New Chrysler and purchasers of, the plaintiffs\u2019. Old Chrysler vehicles. <em>Id. </em>at *4. The only evidence in that case was that New Chrysler had issued notices of an extended warranty for a limited class of vehicles, but that class did not include any of the plaintiffs\u2019 cars. <em>Id. </em>at *1-2. And as the Court noted, New Chrysler issued the notices pursuant to a voluntary duty and had no obligation to pay for repairs not covered by the notification. <em>Id. </em>at *4. By contrast, the 2009 Sale Agreement imposed a contractual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>warranty duty on the part of New GM to Old GM vehicles and New GM had a continuing duty to monitor and notify Old GM purchasers of defects. This is the kind of \u201crelationship ... that g[i]ve[s] rise to a duty to warn.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">In short, although New GM\u2019s arguments are not insubstantial and the question is a close one, the Court concludes that, under the circumstances here, New GM had a post-sale duty to warn Plaintiff of the known ignition switch defect. It follows that New GM\u2019s motion for summary judgment on Count I, Plaintiffs product liability claim, must be and is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">FRAUD</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">Plaintiffs fraud claim .(Count II) is exclusively an Independent. Claim \u2014 and, thus, is (and can be) based solely on the conduct and knowledge of New GM. <em>(See </em>New GM\u2019s Mem. 11 n.39). New GM contends that summary judgment is warranted on three grounds: (1) because fraudulent concealment is not a cause of action under Oklahoma law; (2) because the TAC fails to satisfy the pleading requirements of Rule 9(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure; and (3) because Plaintiff cannot establish reasonable reliance. <em>(See </em>New GM\u2019s Mem. 13-16).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-8\">New GM\u2019s first two arguments can be quickly rejected. First, although Plaintiff styles his claim. as one for \u201cDeceit (Fraudulent Concealment),\u201d it is plain that he asserts a claim for deceit or fraud, which is indisputably a cause of action under Oklahoma law. <em>See, e.g., Hitch Enters., Inc. v. Cimarex Energy Co., </em>859 F. Supp. 2d 1249, 1259 (W.D.Okla.2012); <em>Bowman v. Presley, </em>212 P.3d 1210, 1217-18 (Okla.2009). Plaintiff does not actually assert a <em>claim </em>of fraudulent concealment\u2014 which, as New GM correctly points out, , is only a <em>means of tolling </em>a statute of limitations, not a separate cause of action. <em>(See </em>New GM\u2019s Mem. 14 (citing <em>McAlister v. Ford Motor Co., </em>No. Civ-14-1351-D, 2015 WL 4775382, at *3 (W.D.Okla. Aug. 13, 2015))). Second, New GM\u2019s reliance on Rule 9(b) \u2014 which establishes a heightened <em>pleading </em>standard for fraud \u2014 is misplaced at the summary judgment stage and on the eve of trial. At this point, \u201cno purpose would be served by asking Plaintiff! ] to replead\u201d even if the TAC failed to satisfy Rule 9(b). <em>USA Certified Merchs., LLC v. Koebel, </em>262 F. Supp. 2d 319, 333 (S.D.N.Y.2003). Instead, it is appropriate to decide New GM\u2019s motion \u201cunder the summary judgment standard based on the evidence\u201d in the record. <em>Id., accord Caputo v. Pfizer, Inc., </em>267 F.3d 181, 191 (2d Cir.2001); <em>Perry v. Robinson, </em>No. 96-6027, 1996 WL 606380, at *4 (10th Cir. Oct. 23, 1996) (unpublished); <em>Kirk v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>28 F. Supp. 2d 696, 700 (D.Conn.), <em>aff'd </em>164 F.3d 618 (2d Cir.1998). Unfortunately, because the parties largely focus on Rule 9(b)-and the allegations in the TAC <em>(see </em>New GM\u2019s Mem. 14-16; Pl.\u2019s Mem. 13-14), they do not adequately brief the question of whether the evidence in the record is sufficient to survive the summary judgment standard.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It is New GM' that suffers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>the consequences for that failure, as it bears the initial burden of showing the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. <em>See, e.g., Celotex Corp., </em>477 U.S. at 325.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-3\">New GM\u2019s 'third argument \u2014 that Plaintiff cannot establish reasonable reliance on a misrepresentation or omission of New GM in light of the recall notices that he received before the accident warning him of the ignition switch defect \u2014 is much stronger and may ultimately prevail, but does not warrant entry of summary judgment either. For one thing, whether a plaintiff relied on a misrepresentation or omission of the defendant and, even more, whether such reliance was reasonable are questions normally \u201creserved for the trier of fact.\u201d <em>Bowman, </em>212 P.3d at 1222; <em>see also Evers v. FSF Overtake Assocs., </em>77 P.3d 581, 586-87 (Okla.2003). For another, a reasonable jury could find for Plaintiff on these, questions, as he alleges that he purchased and drove his car based on a belief in its safety \u2014 a belief that, to put it mildly, would have been hard to maintain had New GM not concealed the ignition switch defect. <em>(See </em>Scheuer Dep. 89 (Plaintiff bought the car originally because of its reputation for safety); <em>id, </em>at 120 (Plaintiff had followed instructions in a prior recall notice)). Plaintiff; also alleges that the recall notices were not sufficient to overcome that belief \u2014 and arguably fraudulent in themselves. <em>(See </em>Pl.\u2019s Mem. ' 15; TAC \u00b6\u00b6 388-391). With respect to the latter point, for instance, Plaintiff contends that the recall notices were inadequate because they, did not warn about the possibility of single-key rotation <em>(see </em>Pl.\u2019s Mem. 15), and New GM itself admits that there is evidence of \u201csingle-key rotation events\u201d that were reported prior to the recall notice. <em>(See </em>New GM\u2019s Reply Mem. 20; <em>see also Daubert </em>Op. at 6-7; Opinion &amp; Order (Docket No; 1968) at 5-6).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Accordingly, New GM\u2019s motion for summary judgment bn Count II \u2014 Plaintiff\u2019s claim for fraud or deceit \u2014 must be and is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">NEGLIGENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">Next, Plaintiff brings negligence claims against New GM. <em>(See </em>TAC \u00b6\u00b6 392-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>405).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> To show negligence, plaintiffs \u201cmust prove that (1) defendants owed them a <em>duty to protect </em>them from injury, (2) defendants <em>breached that duty, </em>and (3) defendants\u2019 <em>breach ivas a proximate cause </em>of plaintiffs\u2019 injuries.\u201d <em>Iglehart v. Bd. of Cnty. Comm\u2019rs of Rogers Cnty., </em>60 P.3d 497, 502 (Okla.2002); <em>see Martinez v. Angel Expl, LLC, </em>798 F.3d 968, 974 (10th Cir.2015). Here, Plaintiff alleges that New GM is liable for negligence on two independent bases: first, because the company assumed liability under the 2009 Sale Agreement for <em>Old GM\u2019s </em>negligence (that is, to the extent an Old GM car caused personal injury or property damage); and second, based on its <em>own </em>negligence in failing to warn of the defect and in failing \u201cto adequately recall and fix the defect.\u201d (TAC \u00b6\u00b6 400-401). New GM does not appear to take issue with the former basis for liability \u2014 that is, to dispute that Plaintiff can bring claims based on Old GM\u2019s negligence (except to the extent that it argues lack of causation, an argument rejected above). But the company does seek summary judgment with respect to Plaintiffs negligence claims based on its own conduct (which would qualify as \u201cIndependent Claims\u201d and thus could support an award of punitive damages). <em>(See </em>New GM\u2019s Mem. 17-24; New GM\u2019s Reply 12-15).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">More specifically. New GM seeks summary judgment with respect to any \u201cIndependent Claim\u201d of negligence on four grounds: (1) that there is no such thing as a \u201cnegligent recall claim\u201d under Oklahoma law; (2) that, to the extent there is such a claim under Oklahoma law, it would be preempted by federal law; (3) that any negligence <em>per se </em>claim would fail as, a matter of law because the TAC provides inadequate notice of what statute New GM allegedly violated; and. (4) that,- under Oklahoma law, there is-no post-sale duty to warn, particularly for a successor corporation. <em>(See </em>New GM\u2019s Mem. 17-24). The Court addressed the last of these arguments above, in connection with Plaintiffs product liability claim, and that discussion applies here -with equal force. (If anything, it applies with greater force given Oklahoma\u2019s \u201ctraditional common-law [negligence] rule that whenever one. person is by circumstances placed in such a position with regard to another, that, if he (she) did not use ordinary care and skill in his (her) own conduct, he would cause danger of injury to the person or property of the other, a duty arises to use ordinary care and skill to avoid such danger.\u201d <em>Iglehart, </em>60 P.3d at 502.) Accordingly, the Court focuses here only on New GM\u2019s first three arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">A. Negligent Recall</p>\n<p id=\"b81-9\">New GM\u2019s first argument is that there is no such thing as a \u201cnegligent recall claim\u201d under \u2022 Oklahoma' law. <em>(See. </em>New GM\u2019s Mem. 19). The thrust of New GM\u2019s theory is that, just as Oklahoma law does not impose a post-sale duty to warn, neither does it impose a \u25a0 duty to recall defective products, let alone, a duty to do so adequately. <em>(See </em>id.). Plaintiffs, claim does not depend, however, --on a specific \u201cduty to recall\u201d; instead, it is grounded in the duty of ordinary care- that the common law demands from, all actors. <em>.(See, </em>Pl.\u2019s Mem. 16-19). Oklahoma clearly. imposes such a duty, both by statute and common law precedent. <em>See, e.g., </em>76 Okla. Stat. Ann, \u00a7 1 (\u201cEvery person is bound, without contract, to abstain from injuring the person or property of another, or infringing upon any of his rights.\u201d); <em>Beugler v. Burlington </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number><em>N. &amp; Santa Fe Ry. Co., </em>490 F.3d 1224, 1228 (10th Cir.2007) (noting that for a duty-analysis under Oklahoma law, \u201cthe most important consideration is foreseeability\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>Morales v. City of Okla. City ex rel. Okla.

Plaintiff was foresee-ably endangered by New GM\u2019s alleged misconduct \u2014 that is, New GM\u2019s delay in recalling admittedly defective vehicles\u2014 because New GM knew that Plaintiff was driving a defective car by at least 2012. <em>(See </em>Pl.\u2019s Mem. 17-18). <em>See Frey v. AT&amp;T Mobility, LLC, </em>No. 07-CV-468-TCK-FHM, 2008 WL 4415328, at *8 (ND.Okla. Sept. 23, 2008) (finding that a cellular phone services provider owed, a duty of care to the plaintiff because there was evidence in the record suggesting.that the defendant\u2019s employees \u201cwere at least arguably in a position ... such that \u2018ordinary prudent people\u2019 would have recognized that if they did not act with ordinary care and skill' in regard to the circumstances, La, by timely providing the information in their possession, they may cause injury\u201d). And delay of the recall was arguably unreasonably dangerous conduct, as it involved a hidden defect that caused a risk of serious injury or death \u201c\u2018beyond that which would be contemplated by the ordinary consumer who purchases it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kirkland, </em>521 P.2d at 1362 (quoting <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7 402A cmt. g (1965)).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">In any event, New GM also assumed a duty when it instituted the recall. Oklahoma law recognizes that \u201c[o]ne who undertakes, gratuitously or for consideration, to render services to another which he should recognize as necessary for the protection of the other\u2019s person or thing, is subject to liability to the other for physical harm resulting from his failure to exercise reasonable care to perform his undertaking, if (a) his failure to exercise such care increases the risk of such harm, or (b) the harm is suffered because of the other\u2019s reliance upon the undertaking.\u201d <em>Lay v. Dworman, </em>732 P.2d 455, 459 (Okla.1986) (quoting <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7 323 (1965)); <em>see Underwood v. Jensen Farms, </em>No. 6:11-CV-348-JHP, 2013 WL 6903751, at *6 (E.D.Okla. Dec. 31, 2013). Courts have found that this duty applies \u201cwhere the plaintiff and defendant have a relationship that inherently implicates safety and protection.\u201d <em>Frey v. AT&amp;T Mobility, LLC, </em>379 Fed.Appx. 727, 729-30 (10th Cir.2010). Here, New GM had (and still has) a relationship with drivers like Plaintiff \u201cthat inherently implicates safety and protection.\u201d Thus, when the company undertook the ignition switch recall\u2014 which was \u201cnecessary for the protection of [another\u2019s person or thing\u201d \u2014 it exposed itself to liability, if the recall was carried out negligently and caused injury. <em>See Lay, </em>732 P.2d at 459. In short, whether or not Oklahoma courts have specifically recognized a \u201cnegligent recall claim,\u201d Plaintiffs negligence claim with respect to the recall is firmly grounded in Oklahoma law.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">B. Preemption</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">Next, New GM argues that 'any negligent recall claim would be preempted by the Motor Vehicle Safety Act (the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>\u201cSafety Act\u201d), 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 30101 <em>et seq. </em>and applicable regulations. (New GM\u2019s Mem. 17-22). Wisely, New GM does not contend that Plaintiffs claims are expressly or field preempted by the Safety Act. <em>See, e.g., Geier v. Am. Honda Motor Co., Inc., </em>529 U.S. 861, 867-68 (2000) (holding that Congress did not intend to preempt common law tort actions when it enacted the Safety Act); <em>Harris v. Great Dane Trailers, Inc., </em>234 F.3d 398, 400 (8th Cir.2000) (\u201cCongress in the Safety Act plainly did not intend to occupy the field of motor vehicle safety.\u201d). Instead, it relies on the doctrine of conflict preemption, which applies when \u201ccompliance with both state and federal law is impossible, or when the state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution- of the full purposes and objectivefs] of Congress.\u201d <em>Pac. Capital Bank, N.A. v. Connecticut, </em>542 F.3d 341, 351 (2d Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks omitted). It is well established that the \u201cultimate-touchstone\u201d of,any preemption analysis \u2014 including conflict preemption analysis \u2014 is congressional intent. <em>Gade v. Nat\u2019l Solid Wastes Mgmt. Ass\u2019n, </em>505 U.S. 88, 96, 112 S.Ct. 2374, 120 L.Ed.2d 73 (1992). Further, and significantly, there is a presumption that Congress did not intend to preempt state law in areas- traditionally -regulated by the states. <em>See California v. ARC Am. Corp., </em>490 U.S. 93, 101, 109 S.Ct. 1661, 104 L.Ed.2d 86 (1989). That presumption applies here, as \u201c[m]ot'or vehicle safety is an area of law traditionally regulated by the states.\u201d <em>In re Toyota Motor Corp. Unintended Acceleration Mktg., Sales Practices, &amp; Prods. Liab. Litig., </em>754 F. Supp. 2d 1145, 1196 (C.D.Cal.2010); <em>accord Chamberlan v. Ford Motor Co., </em>314 F. Supp. 2d 953, 958-59 (N.D.Cal.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">New GM fails to overcome the presumption against preemption. First and foremost, the Safety Act itself plainly contemplates that it will operate in conjunction with traditional common law tort remedies. See 49 U.S.U \u00a7 30103(d) (\u201cA remedy under [the provisions of the Safety-Act] is in addition to other rights and remedies under other laws of the- United States or a State.\u201d); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 30103(e) (\u201cCompliance with a motor vehicle safety standard prescribed under this chapter does not exempt a person from liability at common law.\u201d). Second,, the flexibility and discretion built into the Secretary of Transportation\u2019s oversight of vehicle recall# make plain that Congress' contemplated some diversity, if not inconsistency, in recall mechanisms. <em>See </em>49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 30118, 30119. <em>{See </em>New GM!s Mem. 21-22). And third,-consistent-with the statutory language and structure, New GM fails to show that, a- claim or finding that it acted negligently with regard to the ignition switch recall would conflict with the Safety Act\u2019s recall requirements. That is, New GM provides no evidence demonstrating that application of the traditional common law, negligence duty would put it in a position where it could not comply with both state and federal duties. <em>Cf. Chamberlan, </em>314 F. Supp. 2d at 963.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\"><em>Geier v. American Honda Motor Co., </em>529 U.S. 861, 120 S.Ct. 1913, 146 L.Ed.2d 914 (2000), and <em>In re Bridgestone/Firestone Inc., Tires Products Liability Litigation, </em>153 F. Supp. 2d 935 (S.D.Ill.2001), upon which New GM principally relies, do not call for a different conclusion. In <em>Geier, </em>the Supreme Court held that a state court lawsuit alleging that failure to include a driver\u2019s side airbag was negligent or a design defect was preempted because the Safety Act gave car manufacturers a choice as to whether or not such airbags were included. <em>See </em>529 U.S. at 866, 120 S.Ct. 1913. The state claim was \u201cpreempted on the basis of an actual conflict with specific, explicitly enunciated safety standards ... [that were] the result of a con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>sidered policy choice.\u201d <em>Chamberlan, </em>314 F. Supp. 2d at 963. That is, the <em>Geier </em>Court found that Congress had intended to leave choices available to car manufacturers with regard to airbag installation, and the state mandate negated those choices. <em>See </em>529 U.S. at 874-75, 120 S.Ct. 1913. Here, by contrast, any allegation that the recall was conducted negligently would impose a separate, but not conflicting, duty on top of the federal requirement that recalls be \u201cadequate.\u201d <em>(See </em>New GM\u2019s Mem. 20-21). <em>Cf. Chamberlan, </em>314 F. Supp. 2d at 963. In <em>Bridgestone/Firestone Inc., </em>on'the other hand, plaintiffs sought a court-ordered recall of allegedly defective tires. <em>See </em>153 F. Supp. 2d at 937. The. Court found, first, that the presumption against preemption did not apply (contrary to the weight of other authority) because states had not traditionally occupied the field, of vehicle recalls; and second, that sudh \u2019 judicially imposed injunctive relief would frustrate the Safety Act regulations that provide when a defect merits a recall. <em>See id. </em>at 942, 945-46. Here,-by contrast,-the presumption against preemption applies; and Plaintiff primarily seeks damages, in no small part on the basis of an <em>admitted </em>Safety Act violation , and completed recall. <em>Cf. Great W. Cas. Co. v. Volvo Trucks N. Am., Inc., </em>No. 08-CV-2872, 2010 WL 4222924, at *5 (N.D.Ill. Oct. 20, 2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">C, Negligence <em>Per Se</em></p>\n<p id=\"AO5\">Finally, New GM contends that Plaintiffs negligence <em>per se </em>claim fails as a matter of law. <em>(See </em>New GM\u2019s . Mem. 22-23; New GM\u2019s Reply 13-14). \u201cWhen courts adopt statutory standards for causes of action for negligence,\u2019the statute\u2019s violation constitutes negligence per se. To establish negligence per se, the plaintiff must demonstrate the claimed injury was caused, by the violation, and was of the type intended to be prevented by the statute. Finally, the injured party must be one of the class intended to be protect-64 by the statute.\u201d <em>Howard v. Zimmer, </em>299 P.3d 463, 467 (Okla.2013) (footnote omitted). Here, although the TAC cites many statutes in support of negligence <em>per se, </em>Plaintiff appears to have abandoned all but one: the Safety Act. That one suffices. The recall provisions of the Safety Act were plainly intended to prevent injuries caused by defective cars, and Plaintiff equally plainly falls within the class of drivers intended to be protected by the statute. <em>See, e.g., Lowe v. Gen. Motors Corp., </em>624 F.2d 1373, 1380 (5th Cir.1980) (holding that the violation -of a similar motor vehicle safety act was evidence of negligence <em>per se </em>under Alabama law). Significantly, New GM does not really argue otherwise, but instead takes issue with the number of other statutes cited by Plaintiff in the TAC, contending that it lacked \u201cfair notice\u201d of the basis of Plaintiffs claim. <em>(See </em>New GM\u2019s Mem. 22-23). Putting aside whether that would be a valid basis for summary judgment (as opposed to allowing Plaintiff to replead), it is disingenuous at best, as the Safety Act is referenced repeatedly in the TAC and has been central throughout this litigation. Moreover, New GM has <em>admitted </em>to violating-the Act. <em>(See, e.g., </em>Hilliard Decl., Ex. 4 (NHTSA Consent Order)).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">ifc sj* 4? $</p>\n<p id=\"b84-8\">In sum, New GM\u2019s arguments with respect to Plaintiffs negligence claims are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>unpersuasive, so summary judgment on that count is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">BREACH OF IMPLIED WARRANTY</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">Next, New GM moves for summary judgment on Plaintiffs claim for breach of implied warranty (Count IV), arguing that it is \u2014 among other things \u2014 time barred. (New GM\u2019s Mem. 24-25). Plaintiff does not respond to the argument and appears to have abandoned the claim. <em>(See </em>Proposed Joint Pretrial Order (Docket No. 1925) 3 n.l (acknowledging that \u201cPlaintiff did not dispute New GM\u2019s motion for summary judgment with respect to Plaintiffs implied warranty claim\u201d)). Accordingly, New GM\u2019s motion for summary judgment is GRANTED with respect to the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">OKLAHOMA CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT</p>\n<p id=\"AL\">Finally, New GM\u2019s sole argument for dismissal of Plaintiffs claim under the Oklahoma Consumer Protection Act (Count V) is that the Act does not apply b\u00e9cause Plaintiff purchased his car outside of Oklahoma. <em>(See </em>New GM\u2019s Mem. 25). But the Act extends to any \u201cmisrepresentation, omission or other practice that has deceived or could reasonably be expected to deceive or mislead\u201d a consumer, and expressly provides that the challenged \u201cpractice may occur before, during or after a consumer transaction is entered into.\u201d Okla. Stat. Ann. Tit.\" 15 \u00a7 752(13). Consistent with that language, the Oklahoma Supreme Court has applied the statute to conduct directed toward a plaintiff in Oklahoma following an out-of-state purchase. <em>See Lumber 2, Inc. v. Ill. Tool Works, Inc., </em>261 P.3d 1143, 1145 (Okla.2011). In this ease, Plaintiff s claim is not (and, in light of Judge Gerber\u2019s rulings, presumably could not be) based on his purchase of the car in Nevada; instead, it is based on New GM\u2019s alleged misrepresentations, omissions, and other practices directed toward him in Oklahoma, where he resided. Accordingly, New GM\u2019s motion for summary judgment with respect to Count V must be and is DENIED.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> .</p>\n<p id=\"b85-10\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b85-11\">For the reasons stated above, New GM\u2019s motion for summary judgment is GRANTED (as uncontested) with respect to Plaintiffs breach-ofdmplied-warranty claim, but is otherwise DENIED. Moreover, because there is sufficient evidence to support several Independent Claims with respect to which Plaintiff seeks punitive damages, New GM\u2019s Amended Seventh Motion <em>in Limine </em>(which asks the Court to exclude all evidence and argument related to punitive damages) must also be DENIED. <em>(See </em>Docket No. 1800). The Clerk of Court is directed to terminate 14-MD-2543, Docket Nos. 1799 and 1810; and. 14-CV-8176, Docket No. 223.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-12\">SO ORDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b74-5\">. On December <em>21, </em>2015, New GM filed a motion to strike the testimony of Dr. John Marouk, Plaintiffs treating physician \u2014 a motion that will become fully briefed on December 31, 2015. (Docket Nos. 1931, 1947). The Court need not, and does not, rely on the testimony of Dr. Marouk in deciding this motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b75-6\">. New GM moves for summary judgment on the design defect product liability claim (for which it assumed liability from Old GM pursuant to the 2009 Sale Agreement) solely on causation grounds, which the Court .addressed above.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b75-9\">. The district courts in <em>Sears Roebuck </em>and <em>Wicker </em>cited two Oklahoma Supreme Court cases as authority for their conclusion that Oklahoma does not recognize a post-sale duty to warn: <em>Lee v. Volkswagen of Am., Inc., </em>688 . P.2d 1283 (Okla.1984) and <em>Kirkland, 521 </em>P.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>1353. <em>See Smith, </em>2006 WL 687151, at *6; <em>Wicker, </em>393 F. Supp. 2d at 1236-37. (Th\u00e9 Tenth Circuit in <em>Smith </em>in turn cited to <em>Wicker </em>and <em>Kirkland. See Smith, </em>559 Fed.Appx. at 685.) Neither case, however, addresses a failure-to-wam theory. In <em>Kirkland, </em>.the Court merely noted that its.ruling did not \"declare manufacturers anil suppliers of defective products absolute insurers of all users' and consumers whom they serve,\u201d because plaintiffs are required to prove, causation and defendants may assert the defenses of unintended use and voluntary assumption of risk. 521 P.2d at 1366; Similarly, the <em>Lee </em>Court noted that a plaintiff \"must prove that the product was the cause of the injury, that the defect existed in the product at the time it left the control of the defendant and that the defect made the product unreasonably dangerous as defined by ordinary consumer expectations.\u201d 688 P.2d at 1285. At most, those decisions suggest only that a post-sale duty to warn does not extend to products' that were not defective at the time of sale.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b77-6\">. The Court; however; agrees with New GM\u2019s argument that a post-sale duty to warn cannot be imposed solely on the basis of the 2009 Sale Agreement pursuant to which New GM acquired Old GM\u2019s assets and a limited number of liabilities. <em>(See </em>New GM\u2019s Mem. 12-13). <em>See, e.g., Doyle v. New Werner Holding </em>Co., 307 P.3d 405, 409 (Okla.Civ.App.2013) (holding that a successor in bankruptcy was not liable for a product liability claim regarding a product manufactured by the bankrupt company).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b79-9\">. The parties\u2019 briefs fall short not only in discussing the evidence in the record, but also in discussing the law. For example, it is unclear' whether Oklahoma recognizes a claim \u25a0 for <em>actual </em>fraud based on the concealment of a material fact, as opposed to a <em>constructive </em>fraud claim, which requires a particular duty to disclose. Some authorities suggest that fraud based on concealment is included within the umbrella of actual fraud. <em>See, e.g., Manokoune v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>145 P.3d 1081, 1086 (Okla.2006) (\u2018\u2018[A]ctual fraud is the intentional misrepresentation or concealment of a material fact which substantially affects another person.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)); Okla.

Other authorities imply that concealment is fraudulent only when the defendant had a duty to disclose the material facts (based on a contractual or fiduciary duty), or that actual fraud does not encompass fraudulent concealment. <em>See, e.g., Myklatun v. Flotek Indus., Inc., </em>734 F.3d 1230, 1234 (10th Cir.2013) (\"Plaintiffs do not contend they presented any evidence of an affirmative misrepresentation. Rather, they argue their fraud claim is based on Defendants\u2019 omissions or failures to speak, <em>i.e. </em>constructive fraud.\u201d (internal, ..quotation marks omitted)); <em>Optima Oil &amp; Gas Co. v. Mewbourne Oil Co., </em>No. 09-CV-145-C, 2009 WL 1773198, at *6 (W.D.Okla. June 22, 2009) (\u201cIn Oklahoma, the elements of actionable fraud are (1) the defendant made a material representation that was false, (2) he knew when he made the representation that it was false, (3) he made it with the intention that it should be acted upon by plaintiff, and (4) plaintiff acted in reliance upon it and thereby suffered detriment.\" (internal quotation marks omitted)); OUIJI-CIV 18.2 (2d ed.)

In its reply brief, New GM argues that there is no evidence in the record that it knowingly or intentionally made misrepresentations or omissions in the recall notices. (New GM\u2019s Reply Mem. 10-12). If true, that would be fatal to any fraud claim based on the notices themselves, <em>See, e.g., Optima Oil &amp; Gas, </em>2009 WL 1773198, at *6 (listing knowledge and intent as two elements of actionable fraud under Oklahoma law). But Plaintiff has not had an opportunity to respond to that argument. Moreover, the argument would not neeessarily defeat a fraud claim based on pre-recall misrepresentations or omissions \u2018by New GM, as a jury could presumably find that Plaintiff's. reliance on - those misrepresentations or omissions was reasonable notwithstanding the notices because the notices were somehow inadequate, whether New GM in- . tended them to be or not.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b81-6\">.
