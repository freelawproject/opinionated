The attorney has submitted an answer, from which it appears that this sum was-paid to him by the client, and that the client was then indebted to him for legal services in an amount exceeding this sum; that he subsequently commenced an action against the client for the legal services,, upon which he credited this amount, and he has obtained judgment for the balance claimed. There having been an adjudication in that action that the amount received by the respondent was applicable to the payment of the amount due to the respondent from his client, the applica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>tion of that amount to the client\u2019s indebtedness was not such misconduct as would justify the court in disciplining the attorney, and therefore this proceeding will be dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
