The defendant denied the material allegations of the complaint, and in a so-called separate and distinct de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>fense alleged that plaintiff was employed by some other party, to-defendant unknown, to obtain defendant\u2019s consent to the lease of the premises, and that in connection with said transaction plaintiff specially waived all claim to commissions -under the contract alleged, in the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">With the pleadings in this situation, defendant moved the court for an order compelling plaintiff to give a bill of particulars stating-the street and number of the place where and the date and month when the alleged agreement was entered into; whether the said agreement was oral or in writing, and, if in writing, a copy of the same the name of the alleged tenant and the nature of plaintiff\u2019s services,, stating in separate items the number of days during which such services were rendered, on which plaintiff bases his claim for reasonable-value. Defendant likewise moved the court for an order directing plaintiff to reply to the alleged new matter. The motion was denied in-all particulars. Subsequently plaintiff voluntarily consented to give a bill of particulars as to all the matters requested in the motion,, with the exception of the number of days, etc., on which he was engaged in procuring the lessee, and the order was modified in this-particular. The defendant appeals from the modified order.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">Passing over any technical consideration of the regularity of the defendant\u2019s proceedings, it may be said that there is no ground for the request for a bill of particulars as to the amount of time used by the plaintiff. The complaint is not based upon the fair value of the-services, but upon a specific contract for 1 per cent, of the aggregate amount of the rentals to be received, and the question of how much, time plaintiff expended has nothing to do with the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">On the question of defendant\u2019s right to a reply, we are clearly of opinion that the order appealed from is right. It is only where the defendant sets up new matter by way of avoidance that the court is given the discretionary power to order a reply (section 516, Code of Civil Procedure), and\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-8\">\u201cavoidance in pleading is defined to be the introduction of new or special matter, which, admitting the premises of the opposite party, avoids or repels-his conclusions.\u201d 3 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law, p. 523.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-9\">In Mahaiwe Bank v. Douglass, 31 Conn. 177, the court say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-10\">\" \u2018Matter of avoidance,\u2019 says Mr. Gould, in his learned and accurate treatise-on Pleading (chapter 2, \u00a7 42), \u2018is new matter which admits the declaration to be true, but shows, nevertheless, either that the defendant was never liable to the recovery claimed against him, or that he has been discharged from his-original liability, by something supervenient.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-11\">The so-called new matter of the answer of defendant is such as-might have .been introduced under the general denial. It seeks to show a state of facts contrary to the allegations of the complaint, and it is not, therefore, new matter by way of avoidance; and the court very properly refused to grant defendant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-12\">The orders appealed from should be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
