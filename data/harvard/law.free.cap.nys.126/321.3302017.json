Lucy During, who was at all such times in possession, occupation, and control of said premises, and was under obligations under the terms of said lease to keep the said premises so leased to her in repair, and that at no time did this defendant have any notice or knowledge that the alleged balcony, porch, or piazza was in anywise defective or unsafe.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">The order required the defendant to give a bill of particulars, giving the full name and present address of one E. Lucy During, a copy of the alleged lease made by the defendant, with date of the execution of the same, with a copy or copies of any lease or leases executed by the defendant to the tenants for said premises, and particularly of the lease or_ leases covering the first and second floors of said premises, and stating the dates of execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">It_is obvious, it seems to us, that the matters required by the bill of particulars- are purely evidentiary, and not proper subject for such an order, which is to obtain a statement of \"the- opposing party\u2019s claim, and not the evidence in support or refutation thereof. We are further of the opinion that the* matters stated in the answer, of which particulars are required, are pure surplusage.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">The order appealed from should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion denied, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
