The evidence shows that, while a conditional order was given to the defendant by Burns Bros, for a truck, the conditions, in connection with the preparation of specifications, were never fulfilled, and there never was an actual sale of a truck by the defendant to Burns Bros, through the plaintiff\u2019s efforts or introduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>There was not sufficient evidence to sustain the verdict, and the judgment should therefore be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event.
