The answer admits the making of the lease, denies that any rent is due, and pleads, as and for a separate defense, the breach, on the plaintiff\u2019s part, of the conditions of the lease, amounting to constructive eviction. The case came on for trial before one of the justices of the Municipal Court and a jury. The stenographer\u2019s minutes show:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-18\">\u201cPlaintiff\u2019s Attorney: The complaint stands admitted. The amount claimed to be due for rent for the three months is $240, and interest on that amount from September 1, 1908.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-19\">\u201cPlaintiff rests.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-20\">\u201cDefendant\u2019s Attorney: The defendant claims here, by reason of the answer, that he has the affirmative in this action, and desires to exercise his right of taking thei affirmative.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-21\">\u201cThe Court: Motion denied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-22\">\u201cDefendant\u2019s\u2019Attorney: Exception.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b112-23\">The defendant having set up an affirmative defense and the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action being admitted, and the whole amount claimed, with interest, being conceded, the defendant had the affirmative of the issue, and the denial by the trial court of defendant\u2019s right to open and close the case is reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-24\">In Hurliman v. Seckendorf, 9 Misc. Rep. 264, 29 N. Y. Supp. 740, it is held that in an action for rent Under a lease, where the complaint alleged the making of the lease, provided for the payment of rent, that accrued rent was due, and the answer admitted the making of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>lease and a refusal to pay the amount demanded, denying all other allegations of the complaint, and setting up affirmative defenses, that no material allegation of the complaint was denied, and that the defendants had a right to the affirmative of the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-3\">In L. O. Bank v. Judson, 122 N. Y. 278, 25 N. E. 367, Bradley, J., writing for the court, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-4\">\u2018\u2018The test is whether, without any proof, the plaintiff, upon the pleadings, is entitled to recover upon all the causes of action alleged in his complaint. If he is, and the defendant alleges any affirmative matter of defense in avoidance of the plaintiff\u2019s alleged cause of action, and which is the subject of trial, the defendant had the right to open and close.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">Conselyea v. Swift, 103 N. Y. 604, 9 N. E. 489, is a case where the judgment appealed from was reversed solely upon the ground that the court below erred in refusing to allow the defendant to hold the affirmative of the issue and open and close the case. Murray v. N. Y. L. Ins. Co., 85 N. Y. 236; Smith v. Sergeant, 67 Barb. 243; Plenty v. Rendle, 43 Hun, 568.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">As, for the error stated, the judgment must be reversed, and as a new trial may present a different state of facts, it is not necessary to \u25a0consider the other questions raised upon the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">Judgment reversed, and new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
