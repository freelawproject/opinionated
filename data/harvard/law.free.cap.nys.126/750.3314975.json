In 1907 a statute was enacted having for its purpose the acquisition of lands therein designated for a town park by the town of Rye, and to provide for the payment of the expenses connected therewith. Laws 1907, c. 711. It created a board of park commissioners to be composed of the supervisor of the town of Rye, the presidents of the villages of Rye and Port Chester, and two other persons; one to be appointed by the board \u00bff trustees of each of said villages, and it being provided that such commissioners shall receive no compensation. The supervisor of the town of Rye is made treasurer of the board. To provide the means for acquiring the money necessary for such improvement, th\u00e9 \"supervisor of the town of Rye\u201d was authorized and directed to borrow, \u00f3n the faith and credit of said town, an amount of money not exceeding 2% per centum of the total assessed valuation of the real and personal property in said town appearing upon the assessment roll of the preceding year, and for that purpose to issue and sell the bonds of said town, signed by himself as supervisor and countersigned by the town clerk, the proceeds of which sale are directed to be paid to \"the supervisor of said town\u201d and paid out from time to time to the persons entitled thereto upon vouchers certified by a majority of the park commissioners. It is provided that the principal and interest of such bonds \u201cshall be a charge upon the taxable property in the Town of Rye.\u201d The proposition to acquire the specified land was adopted by the electors of said town at the general election held in November, 1907. Bonds of the town were issued and sold by the relator, as supervisor, amounting to $440,000. He received the proceeds of such sale amounting to $442,541.48, and later disbursed $402,130.08, and at the end of his term of office, November 8, 1909, paid the balance, $40,411.40, to his successor in office. On November 15, 1909, the relator presented to the respondents for audit a claim against the town of Rye for the sum of $5,408.62, being commissions at the rate of 1 per centum on all town money paid out. by him as supervisor during the year 1909, prior to the date of said claim, the total amount of which was $540,-862.10, of which $402,130.08 was money received from the sale of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>said bonds and paid out for park purposes and $138,732.02, other town moneys disbursed in the payment of other town charges. The relator claims to be entitled to the commissions under the provisions of subdivision 3 of section 85 of the town law (Consol. Laws, c. 62). On or about December 18, 1909, the respondents allowed said claim to the extent of $1,387.82, and disallowed and rejected it as to $4,-201.30, which represented the commissions claimed by the relator for paying out money of the town, as its supervisor, under the provisions of the park act. The contention of the respondents is that, because of the provisions in the statute that \u201csaid commissioners shall receive no compensation,\u201d the relator, being a commissioner, is not entitled to commissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">I think that this contention is unsound. At the time the park act was enacted, the town law provided that the supervisor of a town should be paid a fee of 1 per centum on \u201call moneys paid out by him as such supervisor,\u201d including money paid out for specified purposes, \u201cand all other town moneys paid out by him for defraying town charges, except money expended under the highway law.\u201d The section makes this commission full compensation for all services rendered by the supervisor in respect to money received and paid out by him as such supervisor, and its provisions clearly indicate is in addition to his per diem compensation while sitting in the board of supervisors of the county. By the act in question the Legislature provided for placing in his hands as supervisor moneys of the town of Rye, and required its disbursement by him. There is no question but that the money was town money; that it was received by him as supervisor and paid out by him as such in defraying town charges. For the numerous services performed as a park commissioner the relator makes no claim. It was as supervisor that he received and paid out the money realized on the sale of the bonds. Neither the commissioners nor the relator as such could issue or sell the bonds. They were vested with no power to raise the money required for the improvement, and the services of the relator in the performance of these acts were rendered as supervisor of the town, and were separate and apart from the services he rendered as park commissioner. The Legislature must have intended that the supervisor. of the town of Rye should receive and disburse the money; otherwise they would have directed that the avails of the bonds be paid to the treasurer of the park commission and disbursed by him, or provided that the services rendered by the supervisor pursuant to the requirements of the act should be without compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">The respondents further contend that the relator\u2019s claim is within the inhibition of section 28, art. 3, of the Constitution, and section 67 of the public officers\u2019 law (Consol. Laws, c. 47), formerly section 3280 of the Code of Civil Procedure, in that he is seeking \u201cextra compensation.\u201d This contention is without merit. No such claim is made by the relator. He asks only for the compensation expressly given him by the town law. It is also suggested that section 18 of article 3 of the Constitution, providing that the Legislature shall not pass a private or local bill \u201ccreating, increasing or decreasing fees, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>percentage or allowances of public officers, during the term for which said officers are elected or appointed,\u201d presents a constitutional objection to the allowance of the relator\u2019s claim. The trouble with this contention is that relator\u2019s claim is based upon the provisions of the town law in force when the park act was passed, and long prior to his election as supervisor for the term during which he rendered the services for which he seeks compensation. While the park act provides for the raising of money for park purposes and charges the relator with its custody and disbursement, it is the town law which provides his compensation. The park act contains no provision creating, increasing, or decreasing fees, percentages, or allowances of the supervisor, and presents no constitutional objection to the allowance of the relator\u2019s claim. We have given due consideration to the other questions presented by the learned counsel for the respondents; but we are not convinced that the disallowance of the relator\u2019s claim can be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-4\">The determination of the respondents rejecting that portion of the relator\u2019s claim for commissions, amounting to $4,021.30, is reversed, with $50 costs and disbursements, and the claim is remitted to the board of town auditors of the town of Rye, with instructions to convene in special session and audit and allow the same. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
