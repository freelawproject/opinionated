The husband of the plaintiff testified that, when he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>returned home in the evening, he opened the pipe and failed to find the earring; that next day a plumber was brought in, who opened the pipe on the floor below, and the earring was not found by him. Two witnesses, plumbers, testified for plaintiff that they examined the basin and the pipes in April, 1910, and at that time an earring the size of the one exhibited to them would not pass through the strainer, which was located about <em>2% </em>inches below the bottom of the basin. From these circumstances the plaintiff contended that the earring was stolen by the man Weiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">On behalf of the defendant, a plumber named Max Sandzich testified that he was called to the plaintiff\u2019s house on July 15, 1906, the day of the alleged loss, and in the presence of the plaintiff examined the basin and the waste pipe; that the strainer was broken, and that a marble about three-fourths of an inch in diameter could go through the hole; that the plaintiff told him she had let the water run for about 10 minutes after the earring had slipped from her hand. The witness also testified that there was nothing in the pipe to prevent the earring from going into the trap, and that the water running for about 10 minutes would create sufficient pressure to carry the earring through _the trap into the sew\u00e9r pipe; that after examining the basin and trap'he did not find the earring. The man Weiss died subsequent to the occurrence. Upon all this evidence the court rendered judgment in favor of the defendant. The plaintiff has failed to prove the larceny of the earring, and she has established, at most, only the loss of an earring. This would not render the defendant liable under the terms of the policy, which-provides that, in order to entitle her to recover, she must prove a burglary, theft, or larceny.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">The judgment should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
