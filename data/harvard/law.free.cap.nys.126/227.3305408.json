From an order revoking the certificate, Siems appeals.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"A8d\">Affirmed.</disposition>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b248-6\">Argued- before HIRSCHBERG, P. j., and WOODWARD, JENKS, THOMAS, and RICH, JJ.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b248-7\">Jerry A. Wernberg (Jacob\" Brenner, on the brief), for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b248-8\">Herbert H. Kellogg (Robert S. Conklin, on the brief), for respondent.</attorneys>\n<footnote data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b247-15\"> For other cases see same topic &amp; \u00a7 number in Dec. <em>&amp; Am. </em>Digs. 1907 to date, &amp; Kep\u2019r Indexes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b248-9\">WOODWARD, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AaA\">The evidence of the special agents of the excise department, who are in no sense interested witnesses, clearly establishes that on the 24th day of February, the 5th day of March, and the 17th day of March, 1910, the premises at 26 Myrtle avenue, borough of Brooklyn, were occupied by the appellant under liquor tax certificate No. 9,672; that in a room just in the rear of the barroom, and connected therewith by a door, tables were provided for drinking, and that the special agents, visiting this room in the performance of their duties, were approached by lewd women and solicited to go with them to a neighboring hotel for immoral purposes; that these women approached the special agents immediately upon entering the place; that they joined with the witnesses in drinking; that they made vulgar and indecent exposures of their persons to the witnesses, the waiter joining in the drinking and in exposing the persons of these women, and assuring the witnesses that these women would \u201cgive them a good time.\u201d The saloon is not a large one, the evidence is that one waiter only was employed, and the transactions above mentioned took place after midnight, and the drinking in each instance was protracted until after 1 o\u2019clock; drinks being served after that hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-10\">This is certainly not an orderly condition. It is not such a condition as the holder of a liquor tax certificate covenants with the state to preserve as a condition of retaining his license. One isolated case might not be sufficient to establish the existence of a disorderly place. Such a thing might occur once in even the best-regulated places; but here were three occasions, about two weeks apart, the witnesses being different men in each instance, and practically the same thing occurred on each occasion, the appellant\u2019s waiter acting in conjunction with the women, and participating in the lascivious exhibitions. To question that this constituted the premises a disorderly place would be to affront intelligence and the instincts of common decency, and we fully concur in the conclusion reached by the learned court at Special Term.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-11\">We are unable to discover in chapters 144 and 350 of the Laws of 1908 any violation of any of the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights. The case of People ex rel. Bernard v. McKee, 59 Misc. Rep. 369, 112 N. Y. Supp. 385, affirmed 126 App. Div. 954, 111 N. Y. Supp. 1135, seems to have properly disposed of this question.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-12\">The order appealed from should be affirmed, with costs. All concur except JENKS, J., who dissents.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
