The judgment of conviction shows that appellant was charged with and \u25a0convicted of abandoning relator, his wife, and leaving her without proper means of support, so that she was liable to become a burden upon the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-14\">The evidence before the city magistrate showed clearly that it was the wife who abandoned the husband, that the latter always had been .and still was able and willing to support her, and that she was in no \u2022danger of becoming a public charge. The case falls precisely within the rule declared by this court in People v. Demos, 115 App. Div. 410, 100 N. Y. Supp. 968.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-15\">The order appealed from was erroneous, and both it and the judgement of conviction must be reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
