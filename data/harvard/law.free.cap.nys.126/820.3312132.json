It is not contended by the plaintiff that the allegations sought to be stricken out are necessary to a statement of the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action. The most that is claimed is \u201cthat the facts alleged may be or become relevant.\u201d Ultimate, not evidentiary, facts are to be pleaded. Possibly the plaintiff may be permitted to prove on the trial the truth of the averments, sought to be stricken out, although it may be difficult now to understand how such proof can become relevant, but such possibility does not justify the retention of redundant matter in the complaint. If said facts ever can become relevant, they can be proved without being specifically averred in the complaint, and the defendants should not be compelled to plead to evidence. Shroeder v. Post, 3 App. Div. 411, 38 N. Y. Supp. 677; Hamilton v. Hamilton, 124 App. Div. 619, 109 N. Y. Supp. 221; Cleminshaw v. Coon, 136 App. Div. 160, 120 N. Y. Supp. 181.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-16\">The orders should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursem\u00e9nts, and the motions granted, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
