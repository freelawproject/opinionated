The action is for damages for fraud and false representations, and the amended complaint states with reasonable fullness the grounds of the action. The bill of particulars required by the order appealed from is much more specific than is usually required in such cases, and we think that in some respects it is open to fair criticism.</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-11\">The words, \u201cand, further, that the nature, manner, and character thereof be specified,\u201d should be stricken out of subdivision \u201cb.\u201d These matters are sufficiently set forth in the amended complaint. The same is true of the words, \u201cand the nature, manner, and character thereof,\u201d in subdivision \u201cf,\u201d and these words must accordingly be stricken out. There should be stricken out of subdivision \u201ce\u201d the words, \u201cby which of the defendants said stock was sold to said William M. Greenwood, and also that plaintiff specify when, where, and how he procured said William M. Greenwood as a purchaser.\u201d These matters, if material at all, are merely matters of evidence. The same objection applies to the words, \u201cand the nature, manner, and character thereof be specified,\u201d in subdivision \u201ch,\u201d and they must be stricken out.</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-12\">The whole of paragraph \u201ci\u201d must be stricken out. The defendants either did or did not invest in the notes referred to. If they did not, they can deny the allegation. If they did, they must know all the matters concerning which they ask plaintiff to particularize. Subdivision \"k\u201d must also be stricken out. If the plaintiff acquiesced in the sale of the stock and the purchase of the notes, it is immaterial how his acquiescence was evidenced. So, also, subdivision \u201cm\u201d must be stricken out, as must subdivisions \u201cn,\u201d \u201co,\u201d and \u201cq,\u201d as to all of which the particulars are sufficiently stated in the amended complaint or are immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-13\">The defendants are entitled to the particulars required by subdivision \u201cp,\u201d in order that they may be protected! against surprise at the trial. If the plaintiff is unable with his present knowledge to specify the \"wash sales\u201d which he charges, his remedy is an examination of defendants before trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1105\">*1105</page-number>Since the defendants are entitled to so much less by way of particulars than they demanded, the award of costs of the motion should be stricken out.</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-5\">The provision for a stay of all proceedings on plaintiff\u2019s part pending the service of the bill of particulars is unauthorized. Prym v. Peck &amp; Mack Co., 136 App. Div. 566, 121 N. Y. Supp. 57. If defendants cannot answer until the bill of particulars is served, that fact, if shown to the satisfaction of the court, might justify an extension of the time to answer, but cannot justify an absolute stay of all proceedings, which might operate to prevent plaintiff from ascertaining some of the very matters which he is required to include in the bill of particulars.</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-6\">To the extent indicated, the order must be modified, with $10 costs and disbursements to the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-7\">Settle order on notice. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
