Laws 1898, c. 312, \u00a7 14, provides that appeals may be taken from the City Court of Albany to the County Court in the same manner as appeals taken from judgments obtained in justices\u2019 courts, and that costs required to be paid for perfecting an appeal under section 3047 shall not include the costs awarded on motions under section 12 of this act. <em>Held </em>that, to perfect an appeal in summary proceedings in the City Court of Albany, costs must be paid.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b1109-5\">[Ed.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"A9X\">This appeal raises two questions. First, whether in an appeal from the final order of dispossession in summary proceedings granted by the City Court of Albany the appellant to perfect his appeal is required to pay any costs. The second question goes to the power of the County Court on motion to dismiss an appeal not perfected.</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-13\">The second question requires little discussion. If the appeal be not perfected, it is not in County Court for argument. Nevertheless it is in form in County Court' until dismissed, and the County Court alone has power in the first instance to determine whether it is properly there as incidental to its power to review by appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-14\">Upon the first question raised we are also of opinion that the County Court was clearly right. By section 3360 of the Code of Civil Procedure appeals in summary proceedings are to be taken \u201cwithin the same time, and in the same manner, as where an appeal is taken from a judgment rendered in the court, of which the judge or justice is the presiding officer, and with like effect.\u201d By section 14 of chapter 313 of the Laws of 1898 it is provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1109-15\">\u201cAppeals may be taken from any judgment rendered in said court [City Court of Albany] to the County Court of the county of Albany, in the same manner and with like effect as appeals are taken from judgments obtained in justice\u2019s court, except as otherwise provided herein.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1109-16\">By section 3047 of the Code of Civil Procedure an appeal from a judgment in justice\u2019s court is only perfected by payment of costs of the action included in the judgment and $3 as fee for the justice for making the return. -</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1090\">*1090</page-number>By chapter 438 of the Laws of 1881 it is provided that neither the justice\u2019s court of the city of Albany nor the justices of said court shall be allowed any fees for services rendered in said court, except that either of the said justices \u201cshall be entitled to receive such fees in summary proceedings to recover the possession of real property as are now allowed by law to justices of the peace for like services.\u201d By section <em>2 </em>of that act certain attorney fees are allowed in the trial of actions in said court. In 1884 (Laws 1884, c. 122) the name of this court was changed to \u201cCity Court of Albany.\u201d In 1892 the question came before the General Term of the Third Department as to whether, upon an appeal from the said court,' it was necessary to pay the allowances provided for by the second section of the act, and it was held that such costs must be paid before an appeal could be taken. Schwemmer v. Stratton, 22 N. Y. Supp. 523.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> Apparently to avoid the effect of this holding, by chapter 312 of the Laws of 1898 it was provided in section 14 that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1110-5\">\u201cCosts required to be paid for perfecting an appeal under section 3047 of the Code of Civil Procedure shall not include the costs awarded a party under section 12 of this act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1110-6\">This provision of section 14 of the act of 1898 would seem to be a recognition, if such were necessary, of an existing rule that in summary proceedings, where the fees still existed as originally in justice\u2019s court, an appeal could only be perfected by the payment of those fees, and such is the only rule deducible from the statutes above cited. \u2022 The appeal, therefore, was properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-7\">Order affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"AYxC\"> Reported in full in the New York Supplement; reported as a memorandum decision without opinion in 66 Hun, 629.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
