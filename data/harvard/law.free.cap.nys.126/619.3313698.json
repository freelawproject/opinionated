After, careful' examination of the record, we see no reason for disturbing the trial, justice\u2019s determination of these disputed questions of fact. But as-it appears from the undisputed evidence that only 1,000 feet of lumber were ordered, although 1,375 feet were delivered, the defendant: should not be charged with the excess, since he has refused to keep it.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">The judgment should therefore be modified, by deducting the sum-of $13.75, representing the \u00e9xcess, as measured by the contract price of $50 for 1,000 feet, thus reducing the plaintiffs\u2019\"damages to $50, and making their total recovery $63, which includes costs and extra costs, and, as so modified, affirmed, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
