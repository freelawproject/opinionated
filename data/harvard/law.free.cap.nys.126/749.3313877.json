The plaintiff, taking the notes from Hyman after their maturity, stood in Hyman\u2019s shoes, and any defense good as against Hyman was good as against the plaintiff. There was evidence to sustain this defense, and the court below consequently committed no error in denying the plaintiff\u2019s motion for a direction in its favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">As this is the only claim of error urged in support of the appeal, the judgment and order must be affirmed with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-8\">Judgment and order affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
