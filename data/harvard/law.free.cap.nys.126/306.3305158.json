The court having exercised that discretion, the validity of the appointment and the power of the trustee under it was not open to collateral attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-15\">We think, therefore, that the title tendered by deed from the substituted trustee was a marketable title, and the plaintiff was bound to. accept it.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-16\">Judgment ordered for defendants, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
