The case was tried at the Special Term, and the learned court in its opinion, after correctly stating the rules of law, said as to the facts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1129-17\">\u201cThe particular acts of disorder must be such as to justify a finding that the premises have become an habitual resort of those engaged in criminal, illegal, or immoral practices, and that those in charge must be presum'ed to have had knowledge thereof. In this proceeding the petitioner\u2019s agents testified that on above five occasions a rear room in respondent\u2019s liquor saloon was patronized by prostitutes, varying from one to four in number, and who, while engaged in drinking and conversation with the agents, solicited the latter for immoral purposes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1130-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1110\">*1110</page-number>But he concluded that \u201cunder all these circumstances I have come to the conclusion that the proofs just fall short of establishing the fact that the respondent has suffered or permitted his premises to become \u25a0disorderly,\u201d and denied the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-5\">We have carefully examined the entire record, and have failed to discover wherein the proofs fell short. Without going into detail, it seems to us that the proofs overwhelmingly establish that the premises were the nightly resort of prostitutes engaged in plying their trade by solicitation of the men whom from time to time they found there.'</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-6\">The order appealed from should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the application for revocation granted, with costs and disbursements at the Special Term,</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
