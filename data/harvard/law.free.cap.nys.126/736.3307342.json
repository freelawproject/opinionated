The defendants asked and obtained the affirmative, without objection. They read thn note in evidence, and then offered testimony in their defense. When the defendants rested, plaintiff moved for judgment\u2014for a direction of a verdict in favor of plaintiff. The court then asked, \u201cAre there any other motions ?\u201d Thereupon the defendants moved that the court direct a verdict for them on the evidence. The court then said, \u201cI direct a verdict for the defendant.\u201d Plaintiff then asked to go to the jury on the question of fact. The court said, \u201cYou are too late, now.\u201d Plaintiff then asked permission to take the witness stand. The court said: \u201cYou are too late, now. You should have withdrawn your motion.\u201d Plaintiff then aslced if he might withdraw the motion, and the court replied, \u201cNot now, the case is disposed of,\u201d and, addressing the jury, \u201cYou may go home now, gentlemen.\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s counsel then excepted and asked the court for permission to go to the jury on the question of fact. The court replied: \u201cThe case is disposed of; it is not before me now.\u201d The return shows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-13\">\u201cCase tried. Counsel for plaintiff asks court for direction of verdict. Counsel for defendant asks court for direction of verdict. Court directs verdict in favor of defendant. Judgment is rendered for the defendant dismissing the complaint on the merits, with costs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b757-14\">The proper practice in such a case is a direction of a verdict for the defendant. Niagara F. Ins. Co. v. Campbell Stores, 101 App. Div. 400, 92 N. Y. Supp. 208, affirmed 184 N. Y. 582, 77 N. E. 1192; Stumpf v. Hallahan, 101 App. Div. 383, 91 N. Y. Supp. 1062, affirmed 185 N. Y. 550, 77 N. E. 1196. A party who requests a direction of a verdict is not thereby precluded from a request for submission of a question of fact to the jury. Shultes v. Sickles, 147 N. Y. 704, 41 N. E. 574; Clark v. Clark, 91 Hun, 295, 36 N. Y. Supp. 294; Switzer v. Norton, 3 App. Div. 173, 38 N. Y. Supp. 350: I think that the plaintiff was entitled to a ruling upon his motion, whereupon he might have had an opportunity to request a submission to the jury. Carr v. Sullivan, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>68 Hun, 248, 22 N. Y. Supp. 972. As it was, the court entertained his motion without disposition of it, and thereupon in a breath granted the motion of the defendants. ,</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">Without any expression as to the merits, I advise that the judgment and order be reversed, and that a new trial be ordered; costs to abide the event. All- concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
