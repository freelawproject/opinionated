It alleges that on a certain date the plaintiff was standing upon the sidewalk at the corner of Grand and Christie streets in the city of New York. It then alleges, in numerous numbered paragraphs, that the defendant Schwarzschild &amp; Sulzberger Company owned, operated, and controlled a certain truck and the horses attached thereto, and that the said horses and truck were in the possession of and under the control of the servant, agent, or employ\u00e9 of said company, who was then driving the same, and that said company, its agent, servant, or employ\u00e9, so carelessly drove and managed said horses and truck, or vehicle, that by reason of its negligence said wagon struck the plaintiff with great violence. Intermingled with these allegations,- undertaking to state a cause of action against the Schw\u00e1rzschild &amp; Sulzberger Company, are precisely similar allegations respecting one Nicholas J. Schnepp, and undertaking to state a like cause of action against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-11\">The motion appears to have been granted upon the ground that the complaint alleges the joint negligence of both defendants; but we cannot so read it. There is no single allegation which serves to link the defendants together as joint tort-feasors. It may be read as alleging that the plaintiff was struck by two trucks owned by different persons; or, what is more probable, the plaintiff was struck by only one truck, but is uncertain to whom it belongs. In either case the complaint improperly combines two separate and distinct causes of action. The motion for judgment should' have been denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-12\">Order reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and motion denied, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
