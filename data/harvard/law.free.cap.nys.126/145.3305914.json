I make that tender into court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-4\">The plaintiff\u2019s counsel then said:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-5\">\u201cIt is too late entirely for a tender. It is a question for a jury to say,.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-6\">\u201cDefendant\u2019s counsel: I pay it into court to make out tender, good.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-7\">\u201cPlaintiff\u2019s counsel: I ask the jury to be directed not to pay any attention to this sort of thing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-8\">\u201cThe Court: This is simply a legal question with which the jury have nothing to do.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b166-9\">During the charge the defendant\u2019s counsel said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-10\">\u201cI ask your honor to charge the jury that, if the jury find that the landlord is only entitled to $26.68 and the interest thereon, then their verdict must be for the defendant because the money has been paid into court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-11\">\"The Court: That is so.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b166-12\">To this plaintiff\u2019s counsel excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-13\">The only question which need be considered on this appeal is the effect of this so-called tender and the charge of the learned trial justice relative thereto. The only statutory provision regarding an offer of judgment or payment of money into court, for the purpose of satisfying a plaintiff\u2019s claim and avoiding the payment of cqsts, is contained in section 148 of the Municipal Court Act (Laws 1902, c. 580). That section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-14\">\u201cThat the defendant may, upon the return of the summons, and before answering, file with the court a written offer to allow judgment to be taken against him for a sum of money. * * * If the plaintiff thereupon * * * files with the court a written acceptance of the offer the court must render judgment accordingly. If the acceptance is not filed, the offer cannot be given in evidence upon the trial. * * * But a defendant may, instead of such written offer, deposit the amount of his offer, if a sum of money, with the clerk of the court with like effect.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b166-15\">As early as the case of Ellenstein v. Klee, 12 Misc. Rep. 112, 33 N. Y. Supp. 94; Mr. Justice Daly, in speaking of the practice regarding tenders in the then District Courts, said that the provisions of section 731 et seq. of the Code had no application to those courts, and the Appellate Term has frequently so held. Levy v. Loew, 107 N. Y. Supp. 620; Public Bank v. Birnbaum, 117 N. Y. Supp. 237.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-16\">Undoubtedly a defendant can avail himself of a common-law tender, which to be sufficient requires an offer before suit of a sum of money sufficient to equal the plaintiff\u2019s claim, payment of that sum into court, an answer' setting up such tender and payment, and proof thereof, if issue of that fact is tendered by the plaintiff. There is no authority, to which our attention has been called, applicable to the Municipal Court permitting the deposit of money in that court after answering \u25a0 in the action, and the only statutory right the. defendant has to deposit money in court to satisfy a plaintiff\u2019s claim is before answering and in lieu of an offer of judgment. This offer of judgment or deposit, unless accepted by the plaintiff, cannot be proven upon the trial; the reason therefor, evidently, being to keep the minds of the jury free <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>from any prejudice that might arise in favor of the party making the offer. Even if we assume that the defendant may tender to the plaintiff, at any time, a sum equaling his claim, such tender, it has been held, does not permit a! verdict other than for the plaintiff for the amount of the tender if no other amount is in dispute. Cleveland v. Toby, 36 Misc. Rep. 320, 73 N. Y. Supp. 544. The defendant\u2019s offer, made at the time it was, and the judge\u2019s charge relative thereto, was error which calls for a reversal of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
