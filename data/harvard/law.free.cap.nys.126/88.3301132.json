At the close of the plaintiff\u2019s case, upon motion of the defendant\u2019s attorney, the complaint was dismissed, and judgment was entered accordingly. Subsequently the plaintiff moved for an order vacating the judgment and setting the case down for trial, which motion was granted, and from the order thus made this appeal is taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-19\">The Municipal Court is a court of limited jurisdiction. Its powers are purely statutory, and if it transcends the jurisdiction conferred by statute its judgments or orders will be void. \u201cIn their organic power they take nothing by implication.\u201d Gillin v. Canary, 19 Misc. Rep. 594, 596, 44 N. Y. Supp. 313, 315. The only power given to a justice of the Municipal Court to \u201cvacate, amend, or modify any judgment\u201d rendered by him is conferred by section 254 of the Municipal Court act (Laws 1902, c. 580). Ryan v. Brown, 51 Misc. Rep. 67, 99 N. Y. Supp. 868. The provisions of section 999 of the Code of Civil Procedure cannot be made applicable, as that section applies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>only to actions in the Supreme Court, the City Court of the City of New York, or a County Court. Section 3347, subd. 7, of the Code. By virtue of the provisions of section 354 of the Municipal Court act, a justice of that court may set aside the verdict of a jury, or he may vacate, amend, or modify any judgment rendered upon a trial by the court without a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">The act of the justice in this case granting the order aforesaid comes within neither of the above enumerated cases. If the dismissal of the complaint was improper, the plaintiff\u2019s remedy was to have appealed from the judgment entered upon such'dismissal. The order vacating the judgment was unauthorized, and the court below was without jurisdiction to make it. It is not, however, reviewable upon an appeal taken directly therefrom, as it is not one of the orders mentioned in sections 353, 354, 355, or 356 of the Municipal Court act, and only such orders as those specified therein are appealable.
