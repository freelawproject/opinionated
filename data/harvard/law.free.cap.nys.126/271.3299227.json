The contract between the parties is evidenced by a number of papers including the application, the bond, and several riders or schedules. It would seem that the terms of the contract must have been the result of negotiations, for what appears to be the regular printed forms ordinarily used by defendant are much interlined and otherwise modified by the attached riders, so that the precise contract is to be ascertained only by careful reading. The application signed by the plaintiffs is for a credit indemnity bond to commence on the 1st day of January, 1903, and to terminate at the end of one year therefrom. It provided for what is called an initial loss to be borne by the insured before any liability should attach to the insurer in the following terms:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-8\">\u201cWhen the losses covered under the terms and conditions of said bond shall exceed $5,000 on sales and shipments not exceeding $1,500!,000, and the same proportion for sales and shipments in excess thereof, the bond is to cover excess losses not exceeding $20,000.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-9\">The amount of initial loss was afterwards fixed at $5,100' on sales' and shipments not exceeding $1,750,000. Then followed the following clause, which, with the corresponding and relevant clauses in the bond and attached rider-s, has raised one of the questions to be determined upon this appeal, viz.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-10\">\u201cExperience shall be the basis for credit under the bond as specified in Schedule A with a single account limit not exceeding $10,000 shall be covered by the bond.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-11\">Then followed a statement, said to be madie to enable defendant to determine as to whether the amount of loss to be first borne by plaintiffs, before defendant\u2019s liability commences is a sufficient sum, that plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cnet losses for the past five years have not exceeded an \u25a0 average of $5,000.\u201d There was exhibited to plaintiffs at the time the application was signed a paper, called \u201cSchedule A,\u201d which contained a list of some 13 acts on the part of or with reference to a debtor which will be accepted as evidence of insolvency upon the part of a debtor. The schedule containing this list does not appear to have been physically attached to either the application or the bond, but it is signed! by defendant, and undoubtedly is one of the papers constituting the contract between the parties. It is provided in this schedule that the fact indicating insolvency shall be mentioned on the preliminary proof of loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>The bond itself is stated to be made in consideration of the application and of the payment of the premium, and by its terms the defendant agrees to indemnify plaintiffs to an amount not exceeding $20,000, \u201csubject to the following limitations, conditions and agreements.\u201d The term of the bond and the amount of the initial loss to be borne in the first instance by defendants follow the terms of the application. The indemnity is said to be made subject to two provisos designated \u201ca\u201d and \u201cb.\u201d The proviso designated \u201cb\u201d has to do with what shall be deemed evidence of insolvency, and was superseded by the Schedule \u00c1, above referred to, and is not important upon this appeal. The proviso designated \u201ca\u201d reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-3\">\u201cThat such losses shall have been sustained on claims against debtors covered by Schedule A attached hereto signed by the company and which is made a part hereof.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-4\">Then follows a clause of the bond denominated \u201cSecond,\u201d which evidently refers to the above-quoted proviso \u201ca,\u201d and which reads as follows: 1</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-5\">\u201cThe amount set opposite a rating on said Schedule A, shall be the largest sum for which a debtor possessing such rating is covered, but in no event shall such sum exceed $10,000 hereinafter called the single account limit. Should the claim of the indemnified against a debtor exceed the sum covered by said Schedule A only a pro rata part of any amount collected or made secure on such claim shall be deducted from the amount covered by the bond.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">Some apparent confusion has arisen because several of the riders going to make up the contract are denominated Schedule A, but it is quite evident that the paper referred to by that designation is one attached to the bond, and which consists of a printed form on which most of the printed! matter has been stricken out, and written or typewritten matter filled in. The paper is headed with the name of a well-known mercantile agency, below which is the legend: \u201cRatings of first and second grades with the amount of credit for each respective rating.\u201d After the statement that no single account shall be covered for more than $10,000, there appeared in print, but was stricken out, a list of 19 ratings, with a sum of money opposite each. It is not difficult to understand how and why these ratings came to be erased. It is apparent from the printed forms used for the application, bond, and Schedule A attached that they were prepared with a view to basing the defendants\u2019 liability, as to any debtor who might default, upon that debtor\u2019s rating with one of the mercantile agencies. In the case of these plaintiffs, it was agreed that \u201cexperience\u201d should be the test, instead of rating, and it was attempted by erasure and interlineation to adapt the forms appropriate to a limitation of liability by \u201crating\u201d to a limitation by \u201cexperience.\u201d It is unnecessary to go in detail into the changes which were made to effect this purpose. That has been carefully done by the learned referee. The result is that the defendant undertook to indemnify or insure plaintiffs against loss by a customer to \u201can amount not exceeding the highest previous indebtedness for goods shipped by the indemnified to the debtor within 24 months prior to shipping the first item of the goods included in the account upon which the loss occurred, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>not exceeding $10,000.\u201d The defendants\u2019 appeal raises the question as to the proper construction andl true intent of this limitation of liability. It arises with respect to a loss caused by the insolvency of one of plaintiffs\u2019 customers named the Consumers\u2019 Coffee Company, which the referee has held to be a recoverable claim under the terms of the bond. The Consumers\u2019 Coffee Company had been purchasing goods from plaintiffs since December, 1901, on 60 days\u2019 credit. Almost from the beginning this company had fallen behindhand in its payments, and on Starch 2, <em>1902, </em>it owed a balance of $4,554.50, which was afterwards paid, and which was the highest indebtedness previous to the issuance of the indemnity bond! which had been paid when that bond was taken out. Between September 1, 1902, and January 1, 1903, when the bond was issued, the plaintiffs sold goods to the Consumers\u2019 Coffee Company, amounting to $11,211.40, all of which remained unpaid on said January 1, 1903. Other sales were made after January 1, 1903, bringing the amount up to a figure which realized a loss - of $14,102.97. If the \u201chighest previous indebtedness\u201d specified in the contract as the limit of defendants\u2019 liability means the highest indebtedness which had been paid) previous to taking out the bond, the plaintiffs can recover nothing on account of the Consumers\u2019 Coffee Company\u2019s loss, for, as already said, that indebtedness was $4,554.-50, which was less than the initial loss, which, by the terms of the contract, was ho be borne by plaintiffs before any liability attached to defendant. The plaintiffs claim, however, and so the referee has held, that the highest previous indebtedness as used in the contract means the largest amount for which the customer was ever indebted prior to taking out of the bond, whether that indebtedness was ever paid) or not. It will be observed that in this particular instance the defendant, at plaintiffs\u2019 request, substituted \u201cexperience\u201d as the test of the liability for any customer, in place of the arbitrary, -but certain, liability based upon the customer\u2019s rating with the commercial agencies. This, of course, means the plaintiffs\u2019 experience with the several customers. In other words, the defendant was willing to insure the credit of each of plaintiffs\u2019 customers to an amount that plaintiffs\u2019 experience with such customers indicated would be a reasonably safe credit. Experience, as commonly understood, means the knowledge gained by observation or trial, andl it is in that sense that it must be deemed to have been used in the present instance. When therefore, the contract made the plaintiffs\u2019 experience with their customers the test of defendant\u2019s liability, it meant the plaintiffs\u2019 knowledge of the financial responsibility of these customers gained by actual trial. The only experience that would be valuable upon such a subject would be that derived from a knowledge of the financial responsibility of the customers proven by the amount of indebtedness that they had shown themselves able to meet and pay. The amount that they had incurred and not paid would afford) no guide to a knowledge of their financial ability. The words in the application, \u201cExperience shall be the basis for credit under this bond as specified in Schedule A,\u201d and the words in Schedule A, \u201cAn amount not exceeding the highest previous indebtedness for goods shipped by the indemnified to the debtor within 24 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>months prior to shipping the first item of goods included in the account upon which the loss occurred,\u201d must be read together, as meaning that defendant would insure plaintiffs against such an amount as their previous experience with each customer indicated was an amount for which the customer could probably be allowed to become indebted with a reasonable assurance that he would be able to pay. The best test of this was the amount that he had previously proven himself able to pay. Furthermore, the language speaks of the past and refers to a \u201cprevious\u201d indebtedness, while, strictly speaking, an indebtedness which was still unpaid when the bondl was issued was a \u201cpresent,\u201d and not a \u201cprevious,\u201d indebtedness. An experience which would justify a prudent creditor in again extending credit to a debtor must be a satisfactory experience, and an experience cannot be said to be satisfactory which simply indicates the extent of a debtor\u2019s willingness to incur debts, and does not show his ability to pay (Philadelphia Casualty Co. v. Cannon, 133 Ky. 745, 118 S. W. 1004). Our conclusion, therefore, is that the \u201chighest previous indebtedness\u201d referred! to in the contract means the highest indebtedness which any debtor had paid before the execution of the bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">There is still another reason why the plaintiffs may not recover for their loss by the failure of the Consumers\u2019 Coffee Company. As has been said, more than $11,000 of this indebtedness was incurred after September 1, 1902, and before January 1, 1903. The bond as originally drawn covered only losses incurred between January 1, 1903, and December 31, 1903, and applied only to goods shipped after January 1, 1903. Under this provision, the defendant would not have been liable for the loss on the goods shipped to the Consumers\u2019 Coffee Company between September 1, 1902, and January 1, 1903. By one of the riders, however, it was provided that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-5\">\u201cOutstandings on the books of the indemnified January 1st, 1903, shipped since September 1st, 1902, shall be covered upon the same conditions and shall be included in the same manner as if the goods had been shipped since January 1st, 1903.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">The effect of this clause was to stretch the bond backward and make it effective as if it had been executed September 1, 1902. When we refer back to the clause limiting liability, we find that the highest previous indebtedness therein referred to is to be one within 24 months \u201cprior to shipping the first item of the goods \u25a0 included in the account upon which the loss occurred.\u201d The account upon which the loss occurred obviously means the account covered by the bond, so that the clause last quoted must be read as meaning the highest previous indebtedness within 24 months prior to the first item of' the account covered by this bond. As originally drawn, the period was 24 months prior to January 1, 1903. When the liability upon the bond was stretched backward so as to cover shipments after September 1, 1902, the 24 months were also pushed back, and the limit of indebtedness was fixed at the highest previous indebtedness within 24 months prior to September 1, 1902. This, as has been said, was only $4,554.50, which was less than the initial indebtedness agreed to be borne by plaintiffs. On the defendant\u2019s appeal, therefore, we are constrained to overrule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>the referee, and to hold that no liability attached to the defendant in respect of the loss by reason of the insolvency of the Consumers\u2019 Coffee Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">The plaintiffs\u2019 appeal calls in question the disallowance by the referee of certain claims, based upon losses arising from the insolvency of James P. Bennett, Edward G. Byrnes, and Samuel Wilde\u2019s Sons. The reason for rejecting these claims was that to none of the preliminary notices of loss by these debtors was there attached any copy of the account of the plaintiffs \u2018showing their prior experience with the debtor. In thus rejecting these claims the referee kept strictly within the lines of the contract. The rider, Schedule A, attached to the bond, and which contains most of the special clauses rendered necessary by the substitution of experience for rating as the limit of defendants\u2019 liability, contains this provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-6\">\u201cBut the loss on any such customer (that Is one with whom plaintiffs had had previous experience) shall not be covered unless the preliminary notice thereof has attached to it, a copy .of the account showing the prior experience with such debtor.\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">Nothing can be more specific than this language, and the reason for its insertion is manifest. Defendant was about making a contract rendering itself liable for losses incurred by plaintiffs limiting its liability, however, to what might be deemed a reasonably safe limit of credit based upon plaintiffs\u2019 previous experience with its several customers and limited as to each customer by his highest previous indebtedness. It was clearly within defendant\u2019s rights, and to its interest, to require that, with a notice of loss, should be supplied a copy of the defaulting customers\u2019 account, to the end that defendant could at once determine to what extent it had become liable. The referee has dealt satisfactorily with the questions raised by plaintiffs\u2019 appeal, and we find no reason to differ from the conclusions he has reached on this subject. All the necessary facts are found by the referee to enable us to modify the judgment in accordance with the foregoing opinion, and it will therefore be unnecessary to put the parties to the delay and expense of a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">The judgment will accordingly be modified by deducting therefrom the sum allowed on account of the loss by reason of the Consumers\u2019 Coffee Company\u2019s insolvency, being $3,664.55, with interest from February 19, 1904. The extra allowance must also be stricken out, as-there- is no longer a basis for estimating it.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-9\">As so modified, the judgment will be affirmed, with costs to the defendant-appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-10\">MCLAUGHLIN, CLARKE, and DOWLING, JJ., concur.</p>\n<author id=\"b296-11\">INGRAHAM, P. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AGoP\">I do not agree with Mr. Justice SCOTT in his construction of this policy concerning the loss to the Consumers\u2019 Coffee Company. It seems to me that what the parties intended was that the plaintiffs should not incur indebtedness after the policy was granted to a greater extent than they were willing to grant without the security of the policy. The various modifications of this policy by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>the defendant have rendered its construction difficult. _ These plaintiffs were in the business of selling merchandise to its customers. They had refused to take out a policy in the ordinary form, based upon the rating given by commercial agencies, but were willing to take out a policy which would insure them against loss to their customers, based upon their experience with their customers, but not based upon the customers\u2019 rating with the commercial agencies. That experience depended, not upon the amount that the customers had been able to pay, but upon the amount of credit that they had been willing to allow their customers when not insured. Mr. Justice SCOTT says in his opinion that \u201cthe amount that they had incurred and not paid would afford no guide to a knowledge of their financial ability.\u201d That may he true, but it was what the plaintiffs in the usual course of business had thought it was safe to sell to a particular customer that was substituted for a rating; and it was then stated that the insurance was to cover an amount \u201cnot exceeding the highest previous indebtedness for goods shipped by the indemnified to the debtor within <em>2i </em>months prior to-shipping the first item of goods included in the account upon which the loss occurred.\u201d It seems to me that it was intended to cover a sale based upon the previous indebtedness which the plaintiffs were willing to extend to a particular customer when they were not insured, and not the highest previous indebtedness of the customer that had been paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">I therefore dissent from the modification; but, as to the other questions discussed by Mr. Justice SCOTT, I concur with him.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
