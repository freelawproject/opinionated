The plaintiff testified that in alighting from one of defendant\u2019s cars, on which he was a passenger, he slipped upon a coating of ice that had formed on the edge of the platform of the station. At this station the platform is elevated. The station platform was closed on three sides, and roofed over at the place where the plaintiff alighted.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-12\">The principal question at issue was whether the' defendant was negligent in allowing the ice to form and continue to exist upon the platform. The evidence shows it had been raining arid sleeting during the day, and had hailed during the evening, and that this rainy and sleeting condition continued until about the time of the accident. There was evidence that employ\u00e9s of the defendant scattered sand and ashes on the platform during the course of the evening, but that the prevailing wind blew them away. In submitting the case to the jury, the court charged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-13\">\u201cIt was the duty of the company within a reasonable time to make that platform safe for its passengers.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b205-14\">To this charge the defendant excepted. The court also charged, and defendant excepted to the charge, \u201cthat if the testimony of plaintiff\u2019s witnesses was true that the storm had practically abated, and the company did not do something to remedy the conditions there, or protect its passengers by throwing something on the platform, whereby it would make the platform safe for people to alight from the trains,\u201d -then, of course, they were careless or negligent in not properly protecting the people who were their passengers. The practical effect of this charge was that the defendant would be liable for the slippery condition of the platform, unless they did something within a reasonable time to remedy the condition, \u201cby throwing something on the platform whereby it would make the platform safe for people to alight from the trains.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b205-15\">This was reversible error. The question of negligence should have been left to the jury, under a proper charge that defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>was bound to exercise reasonable care, such care as an ordinarily prudent person would use under all the circumstances of the case, to render the platform reasonably safe for its passengers. A railroad company is not an insurer of the safety of its passengers, and while it is held to a very high degree of care in properly equipping its system for operation, it is only required to exercise ordinary care in the operation of the road, \u201cin view of the dangers attending its use, to make it, reasonably adequate for the purpose to which it was devoted.\u201d See Lafflin v. E. S. R. R. Co., 106 N. Y. 136, <em>12 </em>N. E. 599, 60 Am. Rep. 433; Stierle v. Union Ry. Co., 156 N. Y. <em>72, </em>50 N. E. 419; Rusk v. Manhattan Ry. Co., 46 App. Div. 103, 61 N. Y.

Co., 121 App. Div. 487, 106 N. Y. Supp. 128.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">Applying the rule laid down in Davenport v. Prentiss, 126 App. Div., at page 457, 110 N. Y. Supp., at page 1061, quoting from Green v. White, 37 N. Y. 405, that \u201cif it is possible that the defendant was injured by this error, the verdict must be set aside,\u201d the judgment should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
