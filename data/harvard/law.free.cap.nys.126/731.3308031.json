By such assignment and occupation the defendant became liable to the plaintiff for rent for the period of her occupation (Sayles v. Kerr, 4 App. Div. 150, 38 N. Y. Supp. 880; Dassori v. Zarek, 71 App. Div. 538, 75 App. Div. 841), and the only question in the case is whether the plaintiff, by prosecuting an action against his lessee to judgment, has precluded himself from the right to sue the assignee for rent for the same period for which he had previously recovered judgment against his lessee. The contrary appears to have been held as to the commencement of an action merely in People v. German Bank, In re Bettinger, 126 App. Div. 231, 110 N. Y. Supp. 291, and there seems to be no reason for a different rule where the action was prosecuted to judgment so long as the judgment remained unsatisfied, which is the situation here.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-18\">The judgment should therefore be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-19\">BRADY, J., concurs. GAVEGAN, J., concurs in the result.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
