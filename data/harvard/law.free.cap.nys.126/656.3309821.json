Several and successive actions may frequently be brought upon the same contract. It is only when the later action involves matters already adjudicated in the earlier action, or where the plaintiff has split up demands which were in existence and ought to have been sued for at the same time, that the former judgment is a bar to the subsequent action. Perry v. Dickerson, 85 N. Y. 345, 39 Am. Rep. 663. It does not appear from the facts pleaded that the former judgments were in any way a bar to the maintenance of the present action.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-20\">The judgment must therefore be reversed, with costs, and the demurrer sustained, with costs, with leave to the defendant to amend within six days upon payment of all costs awarded against it.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-21\">BRADY, J., concurs. GAVEGAN, J., dissents.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
