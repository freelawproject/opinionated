Doherty, special guardian of plaintiff\u2019s assignors, paid his personal debt, amounting to $169.95, not connected in any manner with his guardianship, or the estate of the infants he represented, to the defendant, with the money coming into his hands as such guardian, the defendant knowing at the time he received such payment that it was made from guardianship funds, and that such guardian never accounted to the infants, or paid over the money he had so wrongfully and without authority paid to the defendant. These facts entitled the plaintiff, as assignee of the minor wards, to maintain an action at law against the defendant for money had and received, which is the cause of action alleged in the amended complaint. Roberts v. Ely, 113 N. Y. 128, 20 N. E. 606; Town of Bleecker v. Balje, 138 App. Div. 706, 123 N. Y. Supp. 809; Weston v. Brown, 158 N. Y. 360, 368, 53 N. E. 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-22\">The check with which Doherty paid his personal debt to defendant is signed by him as \u201cSpecial Guardian,\u201d which brings the case within the rule declared in First Nat. Bank v. Broadway Bank, 156 N. Y. 459, 467, 468, 51 N. E. 398, 42 L. R. A. 139; Rochester &amp; Charlotte Turnpike Road Co. v. Paviour, 164 N. Y. 281, 286, 287, 58 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>N. E. 114, 53 L. R. A. 790; Ward v. City Trust Co., 193 N. Y. 61, 69, 84 N. E. 585, and Gerard v. McCormick, 130 N. Y. 261, 29 N. E. 115, 14 L. R. A. 234. It is immaterial that Doherty gave a bond for th\u00e9 faithful performance of his duties (Fellows v. Longyor, 91 N. Y. 324, 331), or whether the money in the possession of the defendant is impressed with a trust (Merino v. Munoz, 99 App. Div. 201, 90 N. Y. Supp. 985, 986).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-3\">The action, being one for money had and received, is one of which the Municipal Court had jurisdiction. Dechen v. Dechen, 59 App. Div. 166, 68 N. Y. Supp. 1043; Pache v. Oppenheim, 93 App. Div. 221, 87 N. Y. Supp. 704; Devery v. Winton Motor Carriage Co., 49 Misc. Rep. 626, 97 <em>N. Y. </em>Supp. 392; Cohn v. Small, 120 App. Div. 211, 105 N. Y. Supp. 287.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\">The judgment must therefore be reversed, with! costs, with the right to defendant, upon the payment of such costs within 30 days, to answer upon the merits. All concur, except BURR, J., who did not vote.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
