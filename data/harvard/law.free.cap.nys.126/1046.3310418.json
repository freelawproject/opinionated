From a judgment for plaintiff, after both parties had moved for a directed verdict at the close of the evidence, defendant named appeals.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"Ai3A\">Reversed, and new trial granted.</disposition>\n<headnotes data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1067-9\">The bankrupts, Ralph S. Bevins, George W. Smith, and Mary A. Smith, made up the membership of the partnership firm of Ralph S. Bevins &amp; Co., which on and prior to December 22, 1906, was doing a retail grocery business in the city of Niagara Falls. On that day the firm made a general assignment of its property to Walter W. Chamberlain for the benefit of its creditors without preferences. He accepted the trust, took charge of the assigned property, and the defendant Philip Becker &amp; Co. had notice of the assignment. On the same day this defendant, a creditor of the firm, obtained a warrant of attachment issued in an action brought by it against the firm, and in the evening of that day levy thereunder was, as directed by defendant\u2019s agent, made by the sheriff\u2019s deputy, and notice given the assignee\u2019s agent in charge of the assigned property that all of it was taken under the attachment. One Prime was placed in charge of the property as the sheriff\u2019s agent, who remained in charge of the property and conducted the business at the store, making sales of stock therefrom, for about one week. On December, 24th Chamberlain, the assignee, demanded of the sheriff\u2019s agent return of the property, which was refused. On December 27th the warrant of attachment was vacated for irregularity. December 29th three creditors of the firm of Bevins &amp; Co., one of whom was the defendant Philip Becker &amp; Co., filed a petition with the District Court of the United States having jurisdiction of the proceeding thereby begun praying adjudication that the members of the firm of Bevins &amp; Co. were bankrupts. One Wood was thereupon by the District Court appointed receiver in the bankruptcy proceedings of all the property of the copartnership; and he was by the order appointing him directed to take into his custody and control all the property of the copartnership. Having filed the required bond, the receiver on the same day of Ms appointment received from the sheriff\u2019s agent and took actual possession of all the property of the firm then remaining in the possession of the latter, including cash received for sales of property by him and accounts where credit had been given purchasers, together with all other accounts due the firm. An appraisal was made of some part of the property taken, and the receiver, as directed by a subsequent order of the District Court, sold perishable property, a part of the stock taken by him, and ultimately sold the remainder of it. He also collected some accounts due the firm when it made the general assignment. He received in cash from the sale of stock and collection of accounts $4,865.-09. From these funds he has as directed by orders made in the bankruptcy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1048\">*1048</page-number>proceedings retained as his fees as receiver allowed by the court, and has paid appraiser\u2019s fees and disbursements as receiver sums aggregating $1,303.51.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1068-5\">On December 31st, two days after the receiver had taken over the sheriff\u2019s agent possession of the firm assets, Chamberlain, as assignee, began an action in conversion against Philip Becker &amp; Co. and Eckensperger, the sheriff, to recover as damages the value of the property taken under the warrant of attachment. Owing to the fact that the bankruptcy proceedings were contested by Bevins &amp; Co., the order adjudicating its members bankrupts was not' made until December 7, 1908. On February 12, 1909, plaintiff was duly elected trustee of the bankrupt estate. He duly qualified and has since been acting as such trustee. The conversion action brought by Chamberlain was then pending. He assigned this cause of action to the trustee. By an order made in the bankruptcy proceedings substitution of the trustee as plaintiff in place of the assignee and continuance of the action by the trustee for the benefit of the bankrupt estate was authorized. The trustee was thereafter substituted as plaintiff in the action by order of the Supreme Court. At the close of the evidence, the complaint was dismissed as to the defendant Eckensperger, the sheriff.</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b1068-6\">Argued before McLENNAN, P.

Leggett v. Baker, 13 Allen (Mass.) 470. Its answer properly presents this partial defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-10\">The act of bankruptcy, upon which the application for adjudication of Bevins &amp; Co. as bankrupts was predicated, was the making of the general assignment to Chamberlain. This within the decisions, though made with no fraudulent intent, was a constructive fraud upon the bankruptcy act itself, and was an available act of bankruptcy, if made within four months before the petition was filed. Cohen v. American Surety Company, 192 N. Y. 227, 236, 84 N. E. 947. Matter of Gray, 47 App. Div. 554, 62 N. Y. Supp. 618. The effect of a general assignment, considered in relation to the bankruptcy law, is thus stated in Collier on Bankruptcy (7th Ed.) 814:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1068-11\">\u201cA general assignment, being not only a fraud on the act, but an act of bankruptcy, seems to stand on a different footing from fraudulent transfers per se. The assignment being void by operation of law, no title passes, and the general assignee does .not become an adverse claimant, but at most a mere agent of the assignor. Property of the bankrupt in his possession, or that of Ms agent, can therefore be reached summarily by the method suggested in Bryan v. Bernheimer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1068-12\">Citations of authorities, upon which this generalization of the author is based, are given, and seem to support this statement of the law. Ti-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1049\">*1049</page-number>tie to the property of Bevins &amp; Co. never having passed to Chamberlain as assignee as against the right of the bankruptcy court through its authorized officer in the bankruptcy proceeding to take possession and control of it, when such control and possession were taken, the taking was not of property of the assignee, but of the bankrupt estate unaffected by the assignment. It is doubtless true that the trustee may for the benefit of the bankrupt\u2019s estate avail himself of rights and interests accruing to the advantage of the estate by reason of the effect of the assignment itself or of acts done by the assignee in protecting the assigned property, its possession or the title thereto. In re Fish Bros. Wagon Company, 164 Fed. 553, 90 C. C. A. 427, 26 L. R. A. (N. S.) 433. It would appear, therefore, that, had the receiver in bankruptcy not taken possession of the bankrupt\u2019s assets, the trustee when appointed could at his option, exercised for the advantage of the bankrupt estate, either have recovered of the defendant the property taken under the attachment, or have recovered its value in the conversion action as assignee of the right of action, which had accrued to Chamberlain the general assignee. But it clearly appears and the court has expressly found that the receiver took possession of such property of the bankrupts as was left on the date of his appointment as receiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-5\">We are now brought to a consideration of this action of the receiver in taking possession of the property of the bankrupts as affecting, if at all, the right of the trustee to recover damages to the full value of the property taken by defendants from the assignee. Immediately upon filing the petition in bankruptcy, the whole assets of the bankrupt came within the jurisdiction and control of the bankruptcy court, to be applied and disposed! of as directed by the bankruptcy act for the benefit of the bankrupts\u2019 creditors, provided the bankruptcy proceedings should result in an adjudication of bankruptcy. Asserting and effectuating its control of the bankrupts\u2019 assets, the court appointed the receiver its officer to take possession of the bankrupts\u2019 assets. It may be true that the receiver is a mere custodian, or caretaker, of the bankrupts\u2019 property of which he takes possession. Collier on Bankruptcy, 30; Matter of Oakland Lumber Company, 23 Am. Bankr. Rep. 181, 185, 174 Fed. 634, 98 C. C. A. 388. Pending and prior to the adjudication in bankruptcy, title to the bankrupts\u2019 property still remains in him. But the court may take into its custody and control this property pending an adjudication. As against the rights represented in the bankruptcy proceeding the assignee had no title to the bankrupts\u2019 assets. The possession of the bankrupts\u2019 property taken by the receiver is unaffected by any claim which the assignee could make under the general assignment, for that gives him no title and no right of possession as against the receiver, who it seems may summarily take the property from his possession. Bryan v. Bernheimer, 181 U. S. 188, 21 Sup. Ct. 557, 45 L. Ed. 814. If the receiver had the right summarily to take the bankrupts\u2019 property from the possession of the assignee, it would seem to follow that he had at least an equal right to take from one who had tortuously taken the bankrupts\u2019 property from the assignee, such taker making no adverse claim to the prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1050\">*1050</page-number>erty. The receiver in the latter case takes not the property of the assignee, but the property of the bankrupt with the title unaffected! by the assignment or by the subsequent unauthorized attack upon the possession of the assignee by the tortuous taker of the property from him. It follows that to the extent of the bankrupts\u2019 property received from the tortuous taker and taken possession of by the receiver the bankrupts\u2019 property has been restored to, and taken possession of by, the legal custodian, who was entitled to accept return of the property by the tortuous taker. The receiver took possession of all the property unlawfully taken by defendants from the assignee under the warrant of attachment which remained in the hands of the sheriff\u2019s agent at the date of the receiver\u2019s appointment, which with the cash realized on the sales made from stock by the agent and collections of accounts for stock sold on credit thereafter made by the receiver comprised nearly all of the property originally taken by them. From the proceeds of' the property, which the receiver thus took from defendants, considerable sums have actually been used as directed by subsequent orders of the bankruptcy court, made in the bankruptcy proceedings, in payment of fees and expenses allowed and incurred in the due administration of the bankrupts\u2019 estate by the receiver before the appointment of plaintiff as trustee. It would! seem that these facts conclusively establish a return of this portion of the property to one legally entitled to accept for the rightful owner return thereof and a subsequent legal exercise by him of dominion over it by selling it and disbursing part of the proceeds. It is true that the trustee\u2019s title to the bankrupts\u2019 property \u201cgoes back by relation to the date of the commencement of the proceeding\u201d in which he is appointed trustee. Collier on Bankruptcy, 808. But, when before his appointment a receiver duly appointed has taken possession of some part or all of the bankrupts\u2019 assets, the trustee must necessarily accept those assets from the receiver in the form which they have legally assumed in the former\u2019s hands. It follows that defendant was entitled to an allowance in mitigation of damages of the value of the bankrupts\u2019 property returned to and taken by the receiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-5\">Respondent further insists that appellant cannot shield itself from liability to plaintiff for the full value of the property taken from the assignee under the warrant of attachment'by showing in mitigation of damages that some part of the property taken has been again taken into the legal possession of an officer of the court acting in a proceeding begun by it after the conversion was accomplished. In support of this position, our attention is directed to the case of Wehle v. Butler, 61 N. Y. 345. In this case the court says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1070-6\">\u201cIt lias been considered in the courts how far property illegally taken and subsequently seized and sold under process by a third party who was a creditor of the owner might be used as a defense in an action for the wrong. If the wrongdoer was not in connivance with the third party, it has been held that the fact of the taking by the third party might be used in mitigation of damages. [Citing cases.] But, where the party who wrongfully takes the property procures, it to be afterward seized and sold under process in his own favor it affords him no protection in any form, and in this case that fact was made sufficiently apparent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1071-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1051\">*1051</page-number>Though appellant was a petitioning creditor, the proceeding instituted was not in effect in its behalf, or for its benefit, but was one directed not against Chamberlain the general assignee, in whose right this action is brought, but against Bevins &amp; Co. only, its ultimate object being to have the bankrupts\u2019 property applied ratably in satisfaction of the claims of all creditors of the firm. It is not a proceeding the purpose of which primarily at least is as in the case last above cited to destroy the title to property of one from whom it has been illegally taken, or render it ineffectual in support of his cause of action against the wrongdoer; but it is to have all the property of the real owners, the bankrupts, including the property taken from the assignee, applied in the orderly course of bankruptcy proceedings in payment of the claims against the bankrupts. There would seem to be no reason why the fact that appellant joined in such a petition should pre- \u2022 elude its right to set up the facts, already fully set out above, in mitigation of damages in this action any more than it would in a similar case where it appeared an administrator of an estate had been appointed on its petition. It would hardly be reasonable to hold* that such fact would preclude the wrongdoer from showing in mitigation of damages the fact that he had returned to the administrator the-property which he had wrongfully taken from the intestate\u2019s agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-4\">Judgment reversed, and new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
