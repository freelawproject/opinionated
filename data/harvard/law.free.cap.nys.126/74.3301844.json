The complaint speaks entirely in the present tense, and alleges only the provisions of the by-laws when the action was commenced, which was more than a year after the husband\u2019s death. Non constat the by-laws may have been effectively amended in the meantime.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-16\">The interlocutory judgment is therefore affirmed, with costs and disbursements, with leave to plaintiff to amend her complaint within 20 days, upon payment of costs in this court and in the court below.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
