On the opening his counsel said that the action was to recover a balance on a building contract, which contained provisions that the work was to be completed on the 1st of January, 1907, and that if the plaintiff did not furnish at that time he was to pay $50 for each day \u201che ran over the contract.\u201d He further said that the plaintiff was delayed so that the time was exceeded, that the building was finally completed, that the architect so certified, that, under the terms of the contract, the plaintiff was entitled to $3,800 balance due, that the defendant demurred to the demand and wanted to pay less, arid \u201cclaims to deduct from the $3,800 not only the full amount, but claims a counterclaim of $2,200. He wants to recover * * * $50 a day for 120 days overtime. I take it that will be the real question in the case, whether he is entitled to that or not.\u201d Thereupon, \u201con the opening of counsel,\u201d the defendant moved to dismiss \u201cthe complaint on the ground that the cause of action stated by the counsel in his opening is entirely different from that stated in the complaint.\u201d This motion was granted, the plaintiff was dismissed, and he now appeals from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-17\">The count of indebitatus assumpsit sufficed to recover for work done under a contract not under seal, unless the plaintiff had failed to fulfill the contract. Hosley v. Black, 28 N. Y. 438; Far- ron v. Sherwood, 17 N. Y. 227; Higgins v. Newtown &amp; Flushing Railroad Co., 66 N. Y. 604; Hurst v. Litchfield, 39 N. Y. 377; Publishing Co. v. Steamship Co., 148 N. Y. 39, 42 N. E. 514. The fact that the plaintiff did not complete the work by the stipulated time did not necessarily show that the contract had not been performed. That would depend upon the construction of the contract by the parties thereto. Anson\u2019s Law of Contracts, p. 344. If the contract provided for liq<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>uidated damages for noncompletion within the time limit, it could be held that this provision contemplated performance at a later date than the stipulated period (Murphy v. United States Fidelity Co., 100 App. Div. 93, 91 N. Y. Supp, 582), and hence, notwithstanding the vitality of the provision- for damages, the plaintiff could have performed his contract by a later date. In Lennon v. Smith, 124 N. Y. 578, 37 N. E. 243, the contract contained a provision for a penalty for time delay, and the defendant made claim therefore. The court said that the defendant could not repudiate the contract and at the same time rest Aa claim for damages upon it for the reason that in such case the contract is permitted to remain operative for the remedy and relief of both parties, and that any other view might work injustice. Under the complaint the contract could be used on the trial to determine the rights of the parties. Hartley v. Murtha, 5 App. Div. 408, 39 N. Y. Supp. 212, citing Hogan v. Laimbeer, 66 N. Y. 604; Shirk v. Brookfield, 77 App. Div. 299, 79 N. Y. Supp. 225; Boyd v. Vale, 84 App. Div. 416, 82 N. Y. Supp. 932. I do not gather from the opening that the- plaintiff abandoned his theory of action. He referred to the contract that had existed between the parties, stated the particulars of the claim and of the opposition thereto; and his position was that the contract had been performed, and that naught remained, so far as the plaintiff\u2019s claim was concerned, but to recover the consideration therefor. The practice of the defendant, although of course recognized, is perilous, and the basis thereof is clearly defined. Hoffman House v. Foote, 172 N. Y. 348, 65 N. E. 169.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">I think that the plaintiff\u2019s exception was well taken, and that the judgment must be reversed, and a new trial must be granted; costs to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">HIRSCHBERG, P.
