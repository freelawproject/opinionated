Y., Blay 29, 1909.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b376-4\">\u201cThe Hon. George B. BfeClellan, Bfayor of New York\u2014Sir: I had written a letter to the Governor of the state to get redress for the scoundrelism hereinafter mentioned through the power of removal of city officials which he possesses, but on second thought I concluded to withhold it, and first ask for such redress through you.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b376-5\">\u201cOn June 16, 1907, George B. Duffy, 19 years old, son of George E. Duffy, of 237 Wyekoff street, Brooklyn, was arrested near his home by a police officer without a warrant and locked up overnight. No charge of any criminal offense was made against him, but only that he was \u2018a suspicious person.\u2019 He liad never been arrested before. He had lived at home in the neighborhood all his life, and could be found or identified at any hour.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b376-6\">\u201cThe next morning he was taken to Police Headquarters, or Central Office, and subjected to the routine and indignities of a felon. He was stripped, measured and photographed, and his picture was hung up in the Bogues\u2019 Gallery, and his name entered in the index.of felons. The next day he was taken before a magistrate and discharged. No complaint of any kind was made against him. It seems that the glass of a saloon had been broken some days before and some whisky taken out. The saloonkeeper, who was brought to court by the police to look at him, could make no complaint against him, and disavowed having anything to do with the arrest.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b376-7\">\u201cIt was not long before it spread abroad that his picture was in the Bogues\u2019 Gallery, and he was gibed and twitted of. it in the streets. I-Iis father tried every way to have the picture taken down and the record destroyed, and failing he came to me. I wrote several friendly letters to the Police Commissioner calling his attention to the illegality \u25a0 of the matter and asking, that he cause the picture to be taken down and the record to be erased, but he finally refused. Instead of helping the boy, my efforts only hurt him, as you will see presently.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b376-8\">\u201cThe object of putting a person in the \u2018Bogues\u2019 Gallery\u2019 and recording him as a criminal is to have the police force familiarized with his personal appearance, name and residence, in order to watch and hunt him as one who has settled on a life of crime, and become a pest to society. The natural result follows, and followed in-this boy\u2019s case. He was marked by the police. After being put in the \u2018Bogues\u2019 Gallery\u2019 and indexed as a felon, he was arrested again and. again on sight and without warrant or cause, except that he was in the \u2018Bogues\u2019 Gallery,\u2019 and therefore to be hunted.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b376-9\">\u201cOn November 26, 3907, he was arrested in the street near his home of an evening, and locked up overnight in a cell with filthy persons. When taken before the magistrate next day no criminal charge could be made against him. He was, therefore, charged by the police with violating an ordinance by obstructing the street, and discharged with a suspended sentence. He did not obstruct the street except by being on it. The charge is a stock one, used for lack of a truthful one. It is neither a felony nor a misdemeanor, but one of those small things not included among crimes at all which magistrates are allowed to summarily dispose of, and the boy felt it was useless to contest it. After being locked up all night he was glad to get away without any dispute.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b376-10\">\u201cJust think of the boys of the city being locked up, and brought into court with felons on such a charge, and trumped up at that! What effect must such an experience have on the future of the average boy?</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b376-11\">\u201cOn September 22, 1908, he was again arrested in the street and locked up overnight on the terrible charge by the police of assault and highway robbery. 1-Iis parents,were shocked. Two days later he was brought before a magistrate. The man who claimed to have been assaulted and robbed was brought there to identify him, but immediately said on seeing him that he was not the culprit; that he was robbed by a man, not by a boy; and he was discharged.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b376-12\">\u201cThe fact was then revealed there that the police had taken the complainant through the \u2018Bogues\u2019 Gallery\u2019 and pointed out this boy\u2019s picture to him, and got from him that the photograph resembled the person who had robbed him, and on that alone, without taking the complainant to see this boy or going before a magistrate or using any precaution whatever, they arrested him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>and locked him up with felons. He was again arrested in a similar way and discharged.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b377-5\">\u201cOn last Sunday morning he got home from his work at about 7 o\u2019clock. He works on a milk route delivering milk, which is night and early morning work, as you know. He washed and dressed and went to church. Afterward he went to bed, as he has to sleep some part of the day on account of his night occupation. In the evening he went out to visit a young lady.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b377-6\">\u201cHe was arrested at 8 o\u2019clock p. m\u201e on the street in the sight of many by a Headquarters detective, in plain clothes, who told him his picture was in the \u2018Rogues\u2019 Gallery,\u2019 and who took him to the police station and locked him up in a cell overnight. The false and malicious charge of vagrancy was entered on the station blotter against this boy, who works every day of his life and has a refined and good home with his parents.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b377-7\">\u201cMonday morning he was taken to Police Headquarters, or Central Office. A squad of about fifteen detectives, with their faces masked, were called in to look at him. They yelled at him and shoved him about. The officer at the desk told them his name, and that he was a well-known thief, and added with a sneer, that \u2018he thought he had pull enough to get his picture out of the Rogues\u2019 Gallery,\u2019 and, turning to the boy, told him he might as well get that idea out of his head at once.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b377-8\">\u201cThis had reference to my poor efforts with the Police Commissioner which I have already stated. I am fully conscious of my lack of power to put a stop to the outrageous violations of our laws and system of free government which occur unchecked in this city daily and are fast debasing us. Such occurrences often make me wish that I had the power even for a month or two. In that time official lawlessness could be stopped and Anglo-Saxon government restored to the city, at all events.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b377-9\">\"I give the words as the boy gives them to me. After this outrageous treatment he was taken to court before magistrate Furlong at 10 o\u2019clock. No charge whatever was made against him there, and he was discharged. Meanwhile he had been absent from his work. A messenger came to his father's house for him from his employer at 3 o\u2019clock in the morning. He should have been at work at 2 o\u2019clock. He could not be found and was unable to send any word home.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b377-10\">\u201cNeed I say that this boy must get redress from this criminal official wrongdoing and oppression or be ruined for life? He has a position in which he earns $18 a week, but he and his parents have lived in daily dread of the day his employer would learn that his picture is in the \u2018Rogues\u2019 Gallery\u2019 and discharge him. Do you not know how hard life is, and how most of the people of this great city, over which in God\u2019s providence you rule, have to struggle to live or make both ends meet?</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b377-11\">\u201cThis boy\u2019s family is a most excellent one, and the anxiety of his father and mother for his future, pilloried and disgraced as he now is, can be understood by every good father and mother. The Police Commissioner is doing all he can to make it impossible for him to lead an honest life and make an honest living, and to force him instead to a life of crime.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b377-12\">\u201cMany thousands of false arrests are being made here annually, and many boys begin their downward career from the humiliation and debasement of being locked up in a cell overnight without any cause or for some trifle. The men on the police force do not want to do these and like things, but are forced to by the incompetents, corruptionists, and sometimes buffoons who are put in rulership over them and suffered to run their course unchecked.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b377-13\">\u201cNo free people can be ruled in a lawless manner. Those put into office and authority should first of all obey the laws which regulate and limit their official conduct and powers. In that way only can they effectively enforce the laws against others. Ours is a government of laws and not of men. But it depends on freedom from unlawful official interference and freedom of lawful speech which are guaranteed by our Constitution and cannot exist without both.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b377-14\">\u201cMay I remind you of some pertinent things which you already know, but which have, it would seem, escaped your attention. In November, 1907, the police authorities lawlessly seized persons who were at large, under bail on indictment in Kings county and had them photographed and measured and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>their pictures hung in the Bogues\u2019 Gallery. There was a wide protest against this open and defiant assault and violation of law. A citizen, Mr. Charles N. Hyde, wrote a letter to your honor, pointing out its illegality, except in the case of convicted persons, and asked you to stop the Police Commissioner, as you have ample power to do. May I remind you that you only acknowledged receipt of his letter and stated that it had been referred to the Police Commissioner, who was the offender, and that the same illegal conduct has gone on openly and notoriously from day to day to this hour.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b378-5\">\u201cMoreover, the next month (in December, 1907) our Supreme Court here, Mr. Justice Burr presiding, decided that the police officials have no authority to measure and photograph persons and put their pictures in the Bogues\u2019 Gallery, unless on conviction of crime and sentence to prison, as the statutes expressly provide. Daws 1896, c. 440; Daws 1889, c. 882, \u00a7 40. The case is Gow v. Bingham, reported in 57 Miscellaneous Beports, at page 66.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b378-6\">\u201cThe matter was thus put beyond dispute, for the police and all executive officers have to conform to the decisions of the courts. But it is an ordinary thing for the Police Commissioner to refuse to obey the decisions of the courts and compel the police force to disobey them. Many instances can be cited. In this case he openly and ostentatiously set himself above the law. The next day after the decision he made the public announcement that he would not obey it, and he has continued to this hour to disobey it, without reprimand or check, much less removal.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b378-7\">\u201cHe is possessed of the most dangerous and destructive delusion that officials can entertain in a free government, namely, that he is under no legal restraint whatever, but may do as he wills, instead of only what the law permits, and that only in the manner it prescribes.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b378-8\">\u201cBespeetfully yours, ' TV. J. Gaynor.\u201d</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b378-9\">For a second cause of action, the complaint alleges that the defendant maliciously composed and furnished to the public press copies of the following:</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b378-10\">\u201cI have no reply to make to the Police Commissioner and none is required. He publishes the letters showing that I have exhausted every effort with him to have this boy\u2019s picture (referring to the said George B. Duffy) taken quietly out of the Bogues\u2019 Gallery, and that he refused. The whole matter is one of record and plain to any one. Not only has this boy not been convicted, of any crime, which is a prerequisite by law to his being put in the Bogues\u2019 Gallery, but they are unable to even make a charge against him in the police court.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b378-11\">\u201cBut this boy\u2019s case is only that of thousands and thousands. The despotism and lawlessness of the Police Commissioner is shocking to every American who knows what free government means and what it cost -in property and blood of our ancestors to acquire it. Bussian methods will not be further tolerated here. They have been so long practiced that we are losing all sense of the dignity of free men and are becoming debased. Mayors and Police Commissioners are no more above the law than is any one else. The law sets limits to the powers of public officers, and the first thing of all is for them to obey the law and keep within such limits. Officials under a free government cannot do as they please. This is a government of law and not men, and an official who sets himself up above the law is more dangerous to the perpetuity of our institutions and to public order and happiness than the worst criminal.\"</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b378-12\">\u201cSuppose all public officials, from the President down, should kick aside the restraints put upon them by law and do as they pleased; do you not see that that is despotism? Ours is a government of carefully limited powers to every official. The contrary is despotism. Despotism is that officials do as they please, instead of only as the law limits and prescribes their conduct and powers. It is a sad thing to see a great and intelligent city in the rulership of persons who think they have us all by the back of the neck.\u201d.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b378-13\">The answer, besides denials and matter in mitigation, sets forth two defenses, to which the plaintiff demurred on the ground of insufficiency.

Upon demurrer, therefore, each must be treated as a complete defense to the entire complaint and its sufficiency determined when tested in that way. Thompson v. Halbert, 109 N. Y. 329, 16 N. E. 675; Lapetina v. Santangelo, 124 App. Div. 519, 108 N. Y. Supp. 975; Price v. Derbyshire Coffee Co., 128 App. Div. 472, 112 N. Y. Supp. 830. The defenses are not aided in any way by the allegation that the articles complained of are true, because no facts are stated in such allegation. It is a conclusion, and nothing more. Wachter v. Quenzer, 29 N. Y. 552. The first defense was evidently intended as a plea of qualified privilege, and the second as a justification. Many of the same questions arise in each case, and the defense of justification <em>may </em>conveniently be considered first.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">It is fundamental, that a plea in justification must be as broad as the charge. Xavier v. Oliver, 80 App. Div. 292, 80 N. Y. Supp. 225; Young v. Fox, 26 App. Div. 261, 49 N. Y. Supp. 634. In determining what the charge is, the scope and object of the whole-article must be considered,' and such a construction put upon the language used as would naturally be given to it. More v. Bennett, 48 N. Y. 473. In the articles here complained of, many abusive terms are used; but, in the absence of innuendoes, only such \u2018statements as I consider libelous per se and refer unequivocally to the plaintiff will be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">1. The first libelous charge is one of \u201cscoundrelism.\u201d It is true the plaintiff is not mentioned by name in connection with the use of this term, but reference to him is so plain and unmistakable that \u201che who runs may read.\u201d I do not see how one can read the letter without being irresistibly led to the conclusion that the word \u201cscoundrelism\u201d is directed towards the plaintiff and no one else. What the writer had in mind and what he was complaining of is evident from the first sentence in the letter:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-8\">\u201cI had written a letter,\u201d he says, \u201cto the Governor of the state to get redress for the scoundrelism hereinafter mentioned through the power of removal of city officials which he possesses, but on second thought I concluded to withhold it and first ask such redress through you.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-9\">What is the \u201cscoundrelism hereinafter mentioned\u201d? The refusal of the plaintiff as police commissioner to remove the photograph and record of the Duffy boy from the Rogues\u2019 Gallery. The plaintiff is the only one the writer is complaining of, and it is his removal that is referred to. The word \u201cscoundrel\u201d is libelous per se. 35 Cyc. 260, 261; Loveland v. Hosmer, 8 How. Prac. 215. There is no attempt to justify this charge in the defense pleaded, and if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>conclusion be correct, that the charge unmistakably refers to the plaintiff, then the defense is insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">2. There is no justification of the charge that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-6\">\u201cThe police commissioner is doing all he can to make it impossible for him to lead an honest life and make an hohest living, and to force him instead to a life of crime.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">This expressly refers to the plaintiff, is libelous per se, and proof of all the facts alleged in the defense would not justify a jury in finding that the charge was true. Indeed, the only charge against the plaintiff, so far as the Duffy boy is concerned, was his refusal to remove his photograph and measurements from the Rogues\u2019 Gallery and by reason thereof his arrests followed. I take it no one would seriously contend that proof of that fact would justify a finding that the plaintiff was doing all he could to make it impossible for Duffy to lead an honest life or make an honest living, but instead to lead a life of crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">3. The charge that \u201cincompetents, corruptionists, and sometimes buffoons who are put in rulership over\u201d the men on the police force, and compel them against their wish to make false arrests, while it may refer to others, unquestionably refers to and includes the plaintiff, and because it may refer to others is none the less a libel upon him. The charge is that arrests \u201care being made\u201d\u2014the present\u2014\u2022 at which time the commissioner was at the head of the police department. Now, can it be said that this did not refer to him? He was the one, as already indicated, of whom the writer was complaining and whose removal from office was sought. If these epithets refer to and include him, as I think they do, then there is no attempt at justification, and this I understand the respondent concedes.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-9\">4. \u201cIt is an ordinary thing for the police commissioner to refuse to obey the decisions of the courts and compel the police force to disobey them.\u201d No attempt is made to justify the charge, certainly not in so far as it states that the police commissioner compels the police force to disobey the decisions of the courts. Nor do I think facts are stated which justify the charge that \"the despotism and lawlessness of the police commissioner is shocking,\u201d or that \u201che is possessed of the most dangerous and destructive delusion that officials can entertain in a free government, namely, that he is under no legal restraint whatever, but may do as he wills, instead of only what the law permits, and-that only in the manner it prescribes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b381-10\">It is, however, urged by the respondent-that, if the defense is a complete justification of any of the libelous charges, it is not demurrable. This is not a correct statement of the law, as I understand it. The justification must be as broad as the libel itself; that is, of all of the libelous charges made. The authorities referred to (Lanpher v. Clark, 149 N. Y. 472, 44 N. E. 182; Gressman v. Morning Journal Ass\u2019n, 197 N. Y. 474, 90 N. E. 1131), and others, involved a question of proof and not pleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-11\">It seems to me, therefore, that the answer does not justify, at least so far as the charges' above specified are concerned; and, if that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>be true, then a complete defense is not set forth. The plaintiff\u2019s demurrer to the second defense pleaded should have been sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">The sufficiency of the first defense remains to be considered. The court at Special Term seems to have been of the opinion that the letter to the mayor was privileged as a confidential communication, written by a citizen having an interest in the matter discussed to a superior officer having the power of removal. But whatever privilege might otherwise have attached to the communication was destroyed when the defendant gave the same out for publication before it was received by the mayor. It is suggested by respondent\u2019s counsel that the publication is denied. It is denied in another part of the answer, but not in the defense under consideration. Moreover, there was, in any event, no such privilege attaching to the statement constituting the second cause of action. The real question presented by this defense is whether the articles were privileged as fair comments on the act of a public official. If the statements of facts were true, and the criticism fair and honest, without malice, the defense of privilege would be good. Hamilton v. Eno, 81 N. Y. 116; Mattice v. Wilcox, 147 N. Y. 624, 42 N. E. 270; Hoey v. N. Y. Times Co., 138 App. Div. 149, 122 N. Y. Supp. 978. But under the guise of privilege the character and motives of the official criticized may not be attacked. As was said in Hamilton v. Eno, supra:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-6\">\u201cWe are of the opinion that the official acts of a public functionary may be freely criticised and entire freedom of expression used in argument, sarcasm, and ridicule upon the act itself, and that then the occasion will excuse everything but actual malice and evil purpose in the critic. We are of the opinion that the occasion will not, of itself, excuse an aspersive attack upon the character and motives of the officer; that to be excused the critic must show the truth of what he has uttered of that kind.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">Whether the bounds of fair criticism have been exceeded or not is a question of law for the court. Hoey v. N. Y. Times Co., supra. Instances have already been pointed out where the statements made were not fair comments on the acts of the plaintiff, but were defamatory of his character\u2014i. e.: (1) Charging him with scoundrelism; (2) with'being incompetent, corrupt, and a buffoon; (3) being a despot and lawless; (4) possessed of the most dangerous and destructive delusion that an official can entertain in a free government.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">My conclusion, therefore, is that neither of The defenses demurred to is a complete defense to the cause of action set out in the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-9\">It follows that the interlocutory judgment appealed from should be reversed, with costs, and the demurrer sustained, with costs, with leave to thg. defendant to serve an amended answer, upon payment of costs in this court and in the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-10\">INGRAHAM, P. J., and LAUGHEIN, J., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-5\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b382-11\">MILLER, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A0Y\">I dissent. The complaint is that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-12\">\u201cThe alleged libelous articles were maliciously made, composed, and published concerning the plaintiff in his said office of police commissioner.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b383-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>The first plea in defense states the occasion for writing said letters\u2014i. 'e., the refusal of the plaintiff to take the photograph and measurements of the Duffy boy from the so-called \u201cRogues\u2019 Gallery\u201d; .the continued practice of the police to take photographs and make measurements of persons arrested, but not convicted, after Mr. Justice Burr had decided, in a proceeding to which the plaintiff was a party, that that practice was illegal; and the advice given by the plaintiff to one Kuhne, who had been convicted of contempt of court, to resist the court orders and to refuse to apologize and thereby purge himself of said contempt. The plea then avers that the matters of fact stated in the letter ar\u00e9 true\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-5\">\u201cand the opinions therein fair comment on the said acts of the plaintiff, and only such as to bring properly before the mayor the official misconduct of the plaintiff, and are without malice, and the said statement and the said letter were privileged.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">Strictly speaking, the claim of qualified privilege only applies to the communication to the mayor, and the plea is in complete defense of all the publications. However, I think it is good as a complete defense. The subject of the articles\u2014i. e., the official conduct of the plaintiff and of the police\u2014was a matter of public concern. The press and any citizen had the right, fairly and in good faith, to comment upon it. If the statements of fact were true, the comments thereon fair, and the defendant\u2019s motives honest, the publications were not libels; and the plea demurred' to presents those issues. Entire freedom of discussion of the public conduct of public men is permitted in this state. Fair and honest criticism is not defamation. The only limitation is that the occasion must not be used to gratify malice or to assail private character. Cooper v. Stone, 24 Wend. 434; Fry v. Bennett, 5 Sandf. 54; Reade v. Sweetzer, note 6 Abb. Prac. (N. S.) 9; Hamilton v. Eno, 81 N. Y. 116; Mattice v. Wilcox, 147 N. Y. 624, 42 N. E. 270; Triggs v. Sun Printing and Publishing Ass\u2019n, 179 N. Y. 144, 71 N. E. 739, 66 L. R. A. 612, 103 Am. St. Rep. 841; Hoey v. N. Y. Times Co., 138 App. Div. 149, 122 N. Y. Supp. 978. Whether the deductions from a given state of facts are fairly drawn and honestly asserted must ordinarily be questions for the jury. Vide cases cited supra and Fay v. Harrington, 176 Mass. 270, 57 N. E. 369.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">As I read the articles, there is not a word in them, unequivocally referring to the plaintiff, which imputes bad motives or evil designs to him or in any way reflects upon his moral character; and the complaint itself negatives the claim that the plaintiff\u2019s private character has been aspersed. Under the plea in question, the defendant will be permitted to give evidence of the truth of the specific statements of fact in the articles and the honesty of his purpose, and thereupon will be entitled to go to the jury on the question of the reasonableness and fairness of his inferences. The plea, therefore, cannot be bad. For a case sustaining almost precisely such a plea, see Kane v. Mulvains, 2 L. R. (C. L. S.) 402.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">It is to be noted that the articles are pleaded as a whole, without innuendo. Considered as a whole, they are an attack tipon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>practice of the police in measuring and photographing persons arrested, but not convicted, and upon the plaintiff\u2019s official conduct in approving and continuing that practice in the face of a decision of a justice of the Supreme Court, and in refusing to take the photograph of the boy, Duffy, from the so-called \u201cRogues\u2019 Gallery.\u201d The plea in justification alleges that the statements, matters, and things contained in said alleged libels are true, and supports that by specific averments of every fact therein stated, and of many not stated, to wit, that in November, 1907, the police, under the command of the plaintiff, seized, photographed, and measured one Frank Jenkins, who was at large on bail; that, after Mr. Justice Burr had decided, in a case in which the plaintiff was a party, that the police have no authority to measure and photograph persons, and put their pictures in the \u201cRogues\u2019 Gallery,\u201d unless on conviction of crime and sentence to prison, the police, under the command of the plaintiff, with his knowledge, and in many cases under his personal advice and direction, \u201ccontinued to photograph, and to strip, measure and index as felons, many hundreds of persons, not convicted and sentenced to prison\u201d; that the plaintiff counseled and advised the officers under him to disregard said decision, and advised one Kuhne to defy the judgment of the Supreme Court, convicting him of contempt of court, and to refuse to apologize, and agreed to and did' pay his fine, gave him a leave of absence while he was serving a term in jail, and promised to reward him by a promotion; that, with full knowledge of the decisions of the courts on the subject and the records, the plaintiff refused to remove the photograph and measurements of the Duffy boy, and stated openly and publicly that the treatment of him, as set forth in the alleged libelous articles and in the plea, was justified; that, with full knowledge of, and in violation of, an injunction, granted about February 6, 1906, the plaintiff and his subordinates, acting under his direction and control, without a warrant or other legal process, entered certain premises named, and' annoyed, harassed, and oppressed the occupants thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">It cannot be doubted that every statement of fact in the alleged libels is met by the plea. The characterizations and the general observations remain to be considered. The ones pointed out by the-learned counsel for the appellant may be divided into two classes: (a) Those of doubtful application; (b) those unequivocally referring to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">(a) Those of doubtful application are the following: \u201cScoundrel-ism, hereinafter mentioned;\u201d \u201coutrageous violations of our laws- and system of free government;\u201d \u201ccriminal official wrongdoing and oppression;\u201d and the paragraph beginning \u201cMany thousands of false arrests are being made here annually.\u201d I think that all but the last refer to the treatment of the Duffy boy by the police, which is narrated. At any rate, a jury would be justified in so finding. The plaintiff is charged with having refused to direct the removal pf the boy\u2019s photograph, and with thereby allowing such treatment to' continue. In effect, the defendant said that he had applied to the plaintiff on -behalf of the boy for relief from what is characterized as</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>\u201cscoundrelism,\u201d \u201coutrageous violation of our laws and system of free government,\u201d \u201ccriminal official wrongdoing and oppression on the part of the police,\u201d and that, haying met with a refusal, he asked the mayor for relief, intimating that he might ultimately go to' the -Governor. \u25a0 The \u201cmany thousands of false arrests\u201d are not specifically, or even inferentially, charged as having been caused by the plaintiff, and the epithets \u201cincompetents, corruptionists, and buffoons\u201d do not necessarily refer to him. Of course, if they do, there is no attempt at justification. But the plural is used\u2014a class referred to, which may include any number of the plaintiff\u2019s predecessors and any number of subordinate officers, who are, or have been put, in rulersliip- over the men on the force, and, may or may not include the plaintiff. Certainly we cannot say as matter of law whether the ordinary reader would understand that all or any particular one of those terms referred to the plaintiff. The expression \u201cmen on the police force,\u201d as commonly understood, does not include all the men in the department under the commissioner. An interesting nisi prius case, which happens to be at hand, may be cited for the proposition that the application of those words is for the jury. Seymour v. Butter-worth, 3 F. &amp; F. 372.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">(b) The statement, \u201cThe Police Commissioner is doing all he can to make it impossible for him to lead an honest life and make, an honest living, and to force him instead to a life of crime,\u201d is not to be construed apart from its context. It is merely the writer\u2019s conclusion as to the effect of the plaintiff\u2019s refusal to remove the boy\u2019s photograph, and of the continued police persecution in consequence. I do not now think of any course of conduct which would be more likely to ruin a lad of 19 than that detailed in the letter and in the plea demurred to.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">The reference to the plaintiff as the \u201coffender\u201d relates to the seizure in November, 1907, of persons at large under bail, and is specifically met by the plea. The only other references to the plaintiff, requiring notice, are the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-7\">\u201cBut it is an ordinary thing for the Police Commissioner to refuse to obey the decisions of the courts and compel the police force to disobey them. Many instances can be cited.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-8\">\u201cHe is possessed of the most dangerous and destructive delusion that officials can entertain in a free government, namely, that he is under no legal restraint whatever, but may do as he wills, instead of only what the law permits, and that only in the manner it prescribes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-9\">\u201cThe despotism and lawlessness of the Police Commissioner is shocking to every American who knows what free government means and what it cost in property and blood of our ancestors to acquire it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-10\">At least four specific instances are averred in justification of the first charge, last above quoted. Moreover, it was not necessary to specify every one of the \u201cmany hundreds\u201d of cases in which men were photographed in disregard of Mr. Justice Burr\u2019s decision. The The paragraph next quoted does not import a charge of insanity, as is said, nor does it reflect upon the plaintiff\u2019s private character. It is the concluding observation of the writer upon the plaintiff\u2019s -official acts, previously narrated. The words \u201cdespotism and law<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>lessness\u201d in the last quotation do not import a charge of general lawlessness, but refer to the specific acts under discussion. The defendant defined what he meant by \u201cdespotism,\u201d and obviously the word \u201clawlessness\u201d was used much in the same sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">The plaintiff has limited his complaint to the publications as a whole, and therefore cannot require the defendant to plead to his construction of isolated words and phrases. The charge consists of statements of fact and of comments thereon. The plea fairly meets all of said statements, and avers other facts in further justification of the comments. It will be for the jury to determine the meaning and application of the comments, and to say whether they were justified. We cannot rule that the plea is not as broad as the charge, simply because we may think some of the defendant\u2019s animadversions too severe, though I am far from suggesting that the facts averred did not justify vigorous comment, or that they do not justify the charg\u00e9, even upon the plaintiff\u2019s own construction, except as to the words \u201cincompetents, corruptionists, and buffoons.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">It follows that the pleas in defense are not open to attack by demurrer; indeed, I think they were scientifically drawn to meet the complaint, and therefore vote to affirm the interlocutory judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">DOWLING, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
