The conviction was had upon the testimony of these two boys, which is contradictory, -evasive, and improbable; indeed, it is so unsatisfactory that the conviction ought not to stand, and this is especially true when we take into consideration the evidence of the five disinterested citizens, who were eyewitnesses, and who corroborate the testimony of the relator himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-9\">The testimony so clearly establishes that the findings and determination of the respondent are against the weight of the evidence that it is not necessary to consider or to express our views upon the other questions presented by the learned counsel for the relator. As was \u25a0 said in People ex rel. McAleer v. French, 119 N. Y. 502, 507, 508, 23 N. E. 1061, 1062:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-10\">\u201cIt is a mistake to suppose that, if there is any evidence in the record brought to the Supreme Court by certiorari sustaining the determination of the commissioners, the court has no right to interfere therewith. * * * In all this class of eases, it is the duty of the Supreme Court, not only to inquire whether there is any competent proof tending to establish the guilt of the accused officer, but it must look into the evidence, and if it finds that there fs a preponderance of evidence against the determination of the commissioners, then it has the same jurisdiction to reverse the determination that it has to set aside'the verdict of a jury as against the weight of evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b696-11\">The determination of the commissioner must be reversed and annulled, with $50 costs and disbursements, and the relator reinstated. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
