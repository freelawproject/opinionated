J.</author>\n<p id=\"AiAV\">The plaintiff has recovered a judgment for the sum of $175 as the value of a wall or show case and 70 yards of cloth, which he alleges the defendants converted. The plaintiff\u2019s title to the property is by virtue of a chattel mortgage in the sum of $1,000 executed by Yetta Fleischner to him covering the articles in question and other goods which were in her husband\u2019s store. The defendants recovered a judgment against the husband, and the articles were levied upon by virtue of an execution, and were sold at public sale for the sum of $38.35.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-15\">The good faith of the mortgage was assailed upon the trial, and the plaintiff, when asked about the consideration for it, testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-16\">\u201cQ. Did you pay any money towards the mortgage? A. I don\u2019t remember. Q. Was it $200? A. I don\u2019t remember. Q. Was it $100? A. I don\u2019t remember. Q. Was it $50? A. I don\u2019t remember. Q. Was it $10? A. I don\u2019t remember. ' Q. <em>Was it anything at all? </em>A. I don\u2019t remember.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-17\">On the question of the value of the property, aside from the price brought at the public sale, the only evidence offered was that of a witness on behalf of the plaintiff, who testified that the cloth was of the value of $66.09, but whose testimony was at once struck out by the court, as without foundation.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-18\">The judgment being unsupported by proof, either of the good faith of the claim or the value of the articles alleged to have been converted, is without legal basis, and must be reversed. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
