Decedent was a foreman in defendants\u2019 employ, having charge and superintendence of the factory in which he was killed. He had been in defendants\u2019 service for 17 years, and during the greater portion of the time had been the foreman in charge. The accident occurred while he was engaged in adjusting a rope upon a moving wheel connected with a machine known as \u201ccalendar No. 3,\u201d by slipping upon a greasy floor, or because of losing his balance in handling the rope-\u2014one or both\u2014and he fell into an opening or pit in the floor in which the wheel revolved, and which was in the same condition in which it had been used by himself or under his direction for more than 13 \u00b0 years. The finding of the jury that plaintiff\u2019s intestate did not assume the risk incident to his employment is so clearly against the weight of evidence as to require a reversal. Baker v. Empire Wire Co., 102 App. Div. 125, 129, 92 N. Y. Supp. 355; Vaughn v. Glens Falls Portland Cement Co., 105 App. Div. 136, 93 N. Y.
