The complaint states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-18\">\u201cThe guard which protects the operator and guards the knives of the machine, in consequence of defendant\u2019s negligence, became detached, and plaintiff\u2019s hand was drawn into the machine.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b591-19\">Upon the trial it was claimed on the part of the plaintiff that the guard, on account of the vibration of the machine while in operation, moved away from the knives, whereby plaintiff\u2019s hand was allowed to come in contact with them, and that such motion was permitted by the absence or defect of the set screw, which, as claimed, was needed to keep the guard in its place. This question was litigated upon the trial, but, in view of error in admitting evidence and presenting to the jury a quite distinct issue, need not be discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-20\">As the trial proceeded, the plaintiff gave evidence tending to prove that plaintiff had not been properly instructed, that he was under the age of 16, and that by reason of the labor law (section 81, as in force .at that time [Laws 1904, c. 291]) he should not have been permitted \u201cto operate or assist in operating dangerous machines of any kind.\u201d The defendant did not object to the admission of evidence relative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>to improper instruction, but did object to testimony relative to the violation of the statute. The court, upon the trial, seems to have permitted an amendment to the complaint by alleging a violation of the statute, and thereupon allowed evidence in that regard. The defendant excepted to the allowance of the amendment, and objected to the evidence, but did not except thereto. But, when the. plaintiff rested, the defendant moved to strike out \u201cthe evidence given as to the amendment,\u201d and excepted to the denial. The court instructed the jury that the principal charge made by the plaintiff\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-5\">\u201cis that the defendant employed this plaintiff to work for it when he was under the age that the law permits a youth to work in a factory. The law ins effect says that a boy under 14 shall not work about a factory anywhere. It says that a boy between <em>14 </em>a\u00f1d 16 may be permitted to work in and about a factory\u2014nothing said about machinery\u2014if certain things are done by the officers of the board of health of the village, town, or city in which the boy lives. There must be satisfactory proof of his age, as to his schooling and .other conditions, with which I will not trouble you. If that is done, then a boy between 14 and 16 may work in a factory. Then there is another provision of law which says that a person under 16 years of age shall not be permitted to work in and about dangerous machinery.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">The court then more specifically charged the jury respecting the statutory regulation and prohibition. The court should not have permitted an amendment of the complaint introducing an entirely new cause of action or issue. The defendant was notified in the complaint of one specific negligent act or omission, and that related to the guard. The new issue, emphasized by the charge, related to his wrongful employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">There should be a reversal of the judgment and order, and the granting of a new trial; costs to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">JENKS and CARR, JJ., concur. HIRSCHBERG, P. J., and WOODWARD, J., dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
