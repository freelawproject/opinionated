The defendant is voluntarily in New Jersey to avoid complying with the jurisdiction of the courts of the state of New York, and the fact that such voluntary residence is injurious to his health is no reason why the orders and judgments of the Supreme Court of the state of New York should be treated with contempt. There is nothing to prevent the defendant from returning to New York, except his refusal to comply with the judgments of the Supreme Court of the state of New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-18\">It also appears that, on a motion at the Special Term to stay the proceedings, the defendant\u2019s then counsel entered into a stipulation by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>which he was to pay $1,000 a month to a receiver appointed by this-court, to be applied upon the amount adjudged due to the plaintiff, but that he has refused to comply with that stipulation, and now alleges that his counsel was not authorized to make it. He now offers-to pay $333.33 a month until the decision of the appeal, but there is no reason to suppose that he would not repudiate this promise with the same alacrity as was shown regarding his past obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-3\">There was no justification for the application for a stay of proceedings, and the motion is denied, with $10 costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
