That hole had remained there for 11 months, when, on a dark night, the plaintiff stepped into it and received injuries from the fall thus caused, for which this action is brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">Unless municipalities are to be absolutely immune from damages, caused by defective streets and sidewalks, the questions in this case were for the jury. It seems to me that, as a matter of fact, the negligence of the defendant is not even debatable; but, if it were, the plaintiff supplied the necessary proof by showing that similar accidents were of daily occurrence. The learned trial court dismissed the complaint on the authority of Gastel v. City of New York, 194 N. Y. 15, 86 N. E. 833, 128 Am. St. Rep. 540; but, so far from supporting the nonsuit, the opinion of Judge Hiscock in that case-shows that this case should have been submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">The judgment should be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
