Y. Supp. 93. It is claimed upon the present appeal that there was a conflict of evidence upon this point in the last trial, and that the verdict of the jury in favor of the plaintiff should be sustained. It seems that Moore street comes down to and is merged in Middleburg avenue, without crossing the same; that the infant plaintiff in this action came down Moore street and attempted to cross over Middleburg avenue, passing over the defendant\u2019s temporary track; that the train of dirt cars stood with its rear end near the Moore street line; and that the same started <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>suddenly and ran over the infant plaintiff, then only five years of age, doing some damage to the child\u2019s hands. The present trial appears-to have proceeded upon the theory that this court had laid down the rule that there must have been some one stationed upon the rear car to give warning, in order to absolve the defendant from the charge of negligence, and the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses testify with this end in view. One of them, who claims to have been an eyewitness, was asked in reference to the rear car,- \u201cWill you state what you saw on that car as to whether or not there was anybody on that car at the rear of it?\u201d This was objected to as leading, and, on the objection being overruled, the witness answered, \u201cThere was a man on the third car.,\u201d and, being further interrogated, answered that in so far as he saw there was no one on the rear car. One other eyewitness testified, \u201cI don\u2019t look much at that train,\u201d and, in answer to the question, \u201cWas there anybody, so far as you could see, on the back of the train ?\u201d answered: \u201cOn the back ? No. Nobody was back of the train. Nobody was on the back.\u201d- A third witness, and this completes the list, testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-5\">\u201cWhen I saw it standing still, I did not see anybody on the rear o\u00ed it. I couldn\u2019t tell whether there was anybody on the rear of it.\u2019\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">Obviously the testimony of this last witness is not of consequence. She merely says that she did not see any one on the rear; that she could not tell whether there was any one there. Moreover, this court did not lay down the rule that it was necessary to have any one on the rear car; it was merely suggested that \u201cthere was no evidence that there was any one at the crossing, or at the rear of the train, or anywhere, to look out for people crossing, or any evidence on that head.\u201d That is, there was no evidence that the defendant had operated its dirt cars in a quasi public place with care. On the present trial the defendant introduced evidence, not that there was some one on the rear car, or at the rear of the car, but that the engineer, who-was one of the witnesses, had directed the brakeman, known as ' \u201cSteve,\u201d to \u201cgo ahead and get a block, and when we stop be ready to- . block the wheels where they won\u2019t move,\u201d and that the brakeman did go ahead, and that \u201cI got on the engine, and when he (the brakeman) was away out at the other end he gave me a signal \u2018Go' ahead,\u2019 and I moved the cars ahead\u201d; that he moved them <em>25 </em>or 30' feet, and then some one called to him and he stopped the train, when it developed that the child had been injured, he being found in a ditch or culvert under the train with his hands lacerated. On cross-examination the engineer testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-7\">\u201cSo the brakeman ran ahead to the end of the cars and I got up on the engine. * * * I looked ahead of me. 1 had to wait there until I got the signal from him before I could move. When he gave the signal to move, he was away at the front end of the train. I guess he was out at the first car. He might be standing between the first and second car; yes, I will swear to that. I never did say he was between the second and third car at the last trial in this case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">The witness then described the situation, and indicated that the brakeman was standing about four or five feet away from the car, and about half of the length of a dirt car, which is described as about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>nine feet and six inches long, so that it appears from the evidence brought out by the plaintiff on cross-examination that the defendant\u2019s brakeman, at the time of giving the signal to start, was in a position to see the track in the rear of the train up to very near to tibe back end of the car, and that he was there for the purpose of giving the signal to move the cars. The defendant\u2019s brakeman fully corroborates the engineer as to what was done in reference to moving the train and the position which he occupied, and the brakeman says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-4\">\u201cI was some few feet away from the side of the cars as they were standing upon the track. I was about opposite the first and second ears. There is an open space between the first and second car where you can look right through and watch the men working at the steam shovel. After I got to that point, I took a look along the track and saw nobody around the track or on it and gave the engineer a \u2018Go ahead\u2019 signal, and he came ahead and went, I guess, about two cars\u2014and I heard a scream,\u201d etc.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">There was no dispute about this; the evidence was wholly uncontradicted, and is not inconsistent with the testimony of the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses that there was no one on the rear, or at the rear, of the train. It is entirely clear that a man standing four or five feet away from an ordinary dump car ten feet long could see the track in the rear of the train well up to the end of the car. An examination from that point, at a time and under circumstances which did not call for the highest possible degree of care, would constitute that reasonable degree of care which the law requires in a case of this character, and, there being no dispute as to the facts, it became the duty of the learned court to grant the motion to dismiss the complaint, or to set aside the verdict, as being contrary to law. The undisputed evidence is that the train was not negligently moved; that it was not moved until the defendant\u2019s employ\u00e9s had made a reasonable examination of the track and had duly signaled for the movement which had been directed by the superintendent of the work. Reasonable care was the duty owed to the plaintiff under the circumstances disclosed by the evidence, and the defendant\u2019s evidence shows this degree of care.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">The judgment and order appealed from should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">RICH and CARR, JJ., concur; BURR, J., concurs in result. HIRSCHBERG, P. J., dissents.</p>\n<author id=\"b455-8\">BURR, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A6n\">I think that there was a conflict of evidence in this case, and that under the rule of law as laid down in our previous decision it would have been error for the trial court to have granted the motion to dismiss the complaint or to have set aside the verdict as contrary/, to law. But in view of the vague and conflicting testimony given by plaintiff\u2019s witnesses, which was opposed by the strong and convincing evidence of defendant consisting of testimony of defendant\u2019s engineer and brakeman, and the inferences to be draw from the physical fact of the position of decedent\u2019s body after the accident, I \"think that the verdict is against the weight of the evidence and should \u25a0be set aside upon that ground, and I therefore concur in the result.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
