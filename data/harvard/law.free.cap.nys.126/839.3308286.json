It was proven that the automobile in question was driven by one Bing, the secretary and treasurer of the defendant corporation, and that accompanying him was the niece of its president, while the president himself, with his wife and a clergyman, occupied the second car. Both parties were on their way to Rockaway Beach or Far Rockaway. This was established,, not only by the testimony of defendant\u2019s president, but by that of his. wife and of his guest.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">The case as submitted to the jury is devoid of any suggestion contradicting defendant\u2019s witnesses; nor is it even indicated upon what the contention may be based that the automobile, at the time of the-accident, was being used about the business of the defendant. The verdict in favor of plaintiff was against the weight of evidence, and the judgment and order must therefore be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.
