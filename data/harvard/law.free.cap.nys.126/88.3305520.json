Schnaier v. Grigsby, 132 App. Div. 854, 117 N. Y. Supp. 455.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-15\">At the trial defendant offered to prove by expert testimony that the work performed was \u201cplumbing\u201d work, but the trial judge refused to receive the evidence. It is impossible to determine, from the items sought to be proved, what is and what is not plumbing work, and it was error to exclude evidence on that point; it being a question of fact. Johnston v.
