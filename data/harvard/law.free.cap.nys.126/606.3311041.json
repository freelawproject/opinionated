Macmonnies, 138 App. Div. 319, 122 N. Y. Supp. 1087. The Court of Appeals has now reversed the order in the Von Bremen Case, in so far as it\" failed to enjoin the defendant therein from soliciting the customers of his formen firm (200 N. Y. 41, 93 N. E. 186), and has in this respect gone the full length of Trego v. Hunt, L. R. 1896 App. Cas. 7, upon which plaintiff relied in his argument before us. Under this most recent authoritative declaration of the law .of this state the plaintiff is entitled to the relief which was denied him upon our former decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-15\">The order appealed from, with the modification in plaintiff\u2019s favor granted upon the former argument, must therefore be affirmed, and, as the plaintiff has been wholly successful, he is entitled to $10 costs and the disbursements of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-16\">The order denying a motion for a rehearing, from which defendant appeals, is affirmed, with $10 costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-17\">Settle order on notice.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
