Rodriguez, 139 App. Div. 755, 124 N. Y. Supp. 529, decided in this court in July, 1910.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-17\">The appellant has not such interest in this case as permits her to litigate the various constitutional questions raised by her. This conclusion is supported by the cases cited by Rich, J., in our judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>in Duffy\u2019s Case, supra, particularly that of Tyler v. Judges of Court of Registration, 179 U. S. 405, 21 Sup. Ct. 206, 45 L. Ed. 252. It does not appear that her rights are in any way affected, or that she has asserted any interest pursuant to the requirements of section <em>389 </em>of the real property law (Consol. Laws, c. 50). She is evidently brought into the case, as the complaint shows, for the sole reason that she is an owner of part of the surrounding contiguous property, referred to in section 380 of the said law.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">The interlocutory judgment must be reversed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
