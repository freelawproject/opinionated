The ground of this motion is that after the judgment was rendered a certified copy was duly served on the defendant, and after the order was made committing him for contempt for refusing to comply with this judgment he left this state, and has since resided in the state of New Jersey. The effect of granting this motion would be to prevent the defendant from having the judgment and the order to enforce the same reviewed, because he has failed to comply with the judgment and has left the jurisdiction, so that the order committing him for contempt for failing to comply with the judgment could not be executed.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-16\">So far as appears from the papers before us, the defendant has proceeded regularly with his appeals; and we do not think he should be-deprived of his right to review the judgment because he has failed to-comply with its terms, nor that the court is justified in dismissing an appeal because of a failure of the defendant to obey it. Undoubtedly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>the court would, be justified in refusing to grant to the defendant any favor that he should ask while he is in contempt and refuses to submit to the jurisdiction of the court; but he has an absolute right to review the judgment and order appealed from, and that right should not be taken away because he has failed to obey the judgment sought to be reviewed.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">The motion to dismiss the appeal or stay the defendant\u2019s proceedings is therefore denied, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
