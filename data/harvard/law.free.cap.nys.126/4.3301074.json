And for the purpose of ascertaining what amount, if anything, is now due, the court properly directed an accounting of the moneys loaned by the defendant to the plaintiff, the amounts repaid, and also the moneys received by the defendant from the property conveyed and transferred to him by the plaintiff, including that from the business of the two liquor saloons located respectively at the southeast corner of Ninth avenue and Seventeenth street and No. 14 Spring street, and the O\u2019Reilly property at 215 West Seventeenth street.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-15\">As to who constituted the firm of Tuttle, Fogarty &amp; Co., and P. A. Fogarty &amp; Co., or the accounts of such firms were issues not before the court. There is not a reference in the pleadings to such subjects, and the court could not, against defendant\u2019s objection, make a binding adjudication as to such firms or direct them to account. And the same is equally true as to the property located at 423 West street, N. Y., and the alleged agreement as to the division of profits of the business there carried on. The findings as to all of such matters were irrelevant and must be disregarded, and the judgment modified by striking from it any and all adjudication or reference to such subjects.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-16\">The judgment is,.therefore, modified as indicated in the foregoing memorandum, and as thus modified affirmed, without costs to either party.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
