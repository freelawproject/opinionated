The tenth count is based upon an ordinance of the city of Chicago, within which the accident occurred, then and long previously in force; and after the proper inducement showing the relative situation of the premises of plaintiffs and defendants, and describing the personal property, the count avers the existence of such ordinance, and incorporates it by reference to another count, into which it is copied as follows:</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Az3S\" pgmap=\"435\">\u201c It shall be unlawful for any person or persons or corporation to store or keep for sale, within the corporate limits of the city of Chicago, any crude petroleum, gasoline, naphtha, benzine, camplie: e, spirit gas, burning fluid, or spirits of turpentine, exceeding a quantity of five barrels of forty-five gallons each; and it shall be unlawful to keep for sale or on storage, any refined carbon oil, kerosene or other products \u2014 for illuminating purposes \u2014 of coal, rock or earth oils, excepting such refined oil as will stand a fire-test of one hundred degrees of Fahrenheit, according to the method and direction of John Tagliabue; and it shall be unlawful to keep any quantity of said articles, exceeding one barrel of forty-five gallons, in any part of a building, excepting a cellar, the floor of which shall be-five feet below the grade of the adjacent streets; and no crude petroleum, gasoline, naphtha, benzine, carbon oil, camphene, spirit gas, burning fluid, or-spirits of turpentine, shall be kept or stand in' front of any building, or any street, alley or wharf lot or sidewalk, for a longer time than is sufficient to receive in store or in delivering the same: Provided, such time shall not exceed six hours.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b435-8\" pgmap=\"435\">The count then proceeds as follows:</p><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b435-9\" pgmap=\"435(41) 436(335)\">\u201cYet the defendant, not regarding its duty in that behalf, nor the said ordinance, did, on, to wit: the seventh day of October, 1871, have, and store, in its said building, large quantities of divers inflammable and dangerous liquids, to wit: ten barrels (each containing forty-five gallons) of each of the following liquids, to wit: crude petroleum, gasoline, naphtha, benzine; and also of each of the following liquids, to wit: refined carbon oil, kerosene, gasoline, naphtha and benzine, products \u2014 for illuminating purposes' \u2014 of coal, rock or earth oils, which could not stand a fire test of one hundred Fahrenheit, according to the method and directions of John Tagliabue, and from and after the said seventh day of October, 1871, up to and till the time of their destruction by fire, as hereinafter mentioned, continued to have the said liquids in its said building, and there to keep the same on storage, the place in the said building where the said liquids were kept not being a cellar the floor of which was five feet below the grade of the adjacent streets. And plaintiffs aver that afterward, to-wit: on the ninth .day of October, 1871, while the defendant did so have the liquids in its said building, and did so keep the same on storage, its said building and the liquids therein took firOj and the flames therefrom spread so rapidly, on account of the very inflammable nature of the said liquids, to the said building and chattels of the plaintiff that the same were wholly destroyed, and lost to the plaintiffs. And the plaintiffs further aver that but for the extra rapidity with which the flames spread from the defendant\u2019s to the plaintiffs\u2019 building, on account of the said inflammable materials, the building, and the goods and chattels of the plaintiffs would not have been destroyed and lost to them. And the plaintiffs further aver that by reason, and on account of the said unlawful acts of the defendant in so having the inflammable liquids in its building, and in so keeping the same therein on storage, said buildings and chattels of \"the plaintiffs were then and there wholly destroyed and lost to the plaintiffs, to their damage,\u201d etc.</p><p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b436-5\" pgmap=\"436(73) 437(88)\">There was a trial upon the remaining five counts under the general issue thereto, and plaintiff\u2019s evidence showed that their building and its contents were in fact burned at the time of the great fire in Chicago, October 9, 1871, which swept over the locality where the premises of both plaintiffs and defendant were situate; but the plaintiffs\u2019 case -was presented on the theory that they could and would have saved a large portion of their horses, carriages, harness, etc., belonging to their livery business, and at the time in said building but for a sudden explosion which occurred on defendant\u2019s premises by reason of dangerous and explosive substances being negligently or unlawfully kept therein.

J.</author> <p id=\"Ae8\" pgmap=\"441\">This case was before us at the last previous term, and an opinion was concurred in by the whole court, reversing the judgment below, on the grounds that there was evidence upon the trial, tending to support all the necessary elements of the plaintiffs\u2019 cause of action; and that it was therefore erroneous for the court, by peremptory instructions, to withdraw the case from the consideration of the jury. Also, that the court below had erred in sustaining a demurrer to the tenth count of the plaintiffs\u2019 declaration. Upon petition by defendant, a rehearing was allowed; and the case has been elaborately re-argued at the present term, by counsel for both parties, and reconsidered by the court. Upon such reconsideration, the court was divided in opinion, as to the question, whether the court below erred in giving such peremptory instructions to the jury, as the case then stood, and upon the evidence introduced. But it agreed in the opinion, that the court erred in sustaining the demurrer of defendant to plaintiffs\u2019 tenth count.</p> <p id=\"b441-4\" pgmap=\"441\">In order to test the sufficiency of the matters set out in the tenth count, it will be well to consider the nature of the action on the case. \u201c It is founded,\u201d says Chief Baron Comyns, upon a wrong. In all cases, where a man has a temporal loss or damage by the injury of another, he may have an action on the case.\u201d Com. Dig. Tit. Action on tile case, A. This injury may be caused by the unlawful act of another, or from the careless and negligent manner, in which a lawful act is performed. It is not every act productive of injury to another, that lays the foundation of this action; for, says the same eminent judge, \u201cit does not lie for a reasonable use of my right, though it may be to the annoyance of another.\u201d Com. Dig. Tit. Action up in the case for a Nuisance, C; Burroughs v. Housatonic Railway Co. 15 Conn. R. 124.</p> <p id=\"b441-5\" pgmap=\"441\">\u201c Actions on the case are founded on the common law, or upon acts of parliament, and generally lie to recover damages for torts not committed with force, actual or implied.\u201d 1 Chit. Plead. 132.</p> <p id=\"b441-6\" pgmap=\"441(23) 442(47)\">To constitute a tort, two things must concur \u2014 actual or legal damage to the plaintiff\", and a wrongful act committed by the defendant. Bayley, J., in Bex. v. Papham Commissioners, etc., 8 B. C. 862; or, as observed by Hobart, Ch. J., in Waterer v. Freeman, Hob. 266: \u201c There must be a damage already fallen upon the party, or inevitable; there must also be a thing done amiss.\u201d</p> <p id=\"AilH\" pgmap=\"442\">By injuria is meant a tortious act; it need not be willful and malicious, for, though it be accidental, if it be tortious, an action will lie. Willes, Ch. J., in Winsmore v. Greenbank, Willes\u2019 B. 581. The only basis of recovery in this case upon any of the counts of the declaration must, therefore, be either that the damages to plaintiffs were the result of an unlawful act on the part of defendant, or negligence in the performance of a lawful act; for, however grievous the damage may be which one man may sustain at the hands of another, yet if such damage be the result of inevitable accident, or a lawful act done in \u2022 a lawful manner, without any carelessness or negligence, there is no legal injury and no tori giving rise to an action for damages. These principles were recognized and applied by the Supreme Court of the United States in the Hitro-glycerine case, Parrott v. Wells, Fargo &amp; Co. 15 Wallace, 524.</p> <p id=\"b442-6\" pgmap=\"442\">It can not be doubted that it is competent for the legislature of this State to delegate to municipal corporations, like Chicago, the power to pass ordinances; and jt is well settled that such ordinances, when within the legislative authority given, have the force, as to all persons bound by them, of laws passed by the legislature of the State.

Sec. 245, arid cases cited in note 2.</p> <p id=\"b442-7\" pgmap=\"442(127) 443(52)\">The second clause of the ordinance set out in the said tenth count declares: \u201c And it shall be unlawful to keep for sale, or on storage, any refined carbon oil, kerosene, or other products \u2014for illuminating purposes \u2014 of coal, rock or earth oils, excepting such refined oil as will stand a fire-test of one'liundred degrees of Fahrenheit, according to the method and directions of John Tagliabue; and it shall not be lawful to keep \u201d [for sale or on storage] \u00a3\u00a3 any quantity of said articles exceeding one barrel of forty-five gallons, in any part of a building, excepting a cellar, the floor of which shall be five feet below the grade of the adjacent streets.\u201d The first clause of that ordinance is expressly applicable to any person or persons or corporation; the clauses are connected by a copulative conjunction, and there being nothing contained in them tending to show a contrary intention, they must be construed as applying to and binding upon the defendant corporation, the same as if it were a natural person.</p> <p id=\"b443-4\" pgmap=\"443\">Although it is not averred in so many words that the defendant wrongfully, and contrary to said ordinance had and kept the prohibited articles on storage upon its premises, yet it is averred that the defendant, not regarding its duty in that behalf, nor the said ordinance, did, on, etc., have, and store in its said building large quantities, etc., then specifying the prohibited articles and quantities, so as to bring the act within the prohibition of such ordinance. These averments, we must hold as sufficient to show that the act of having such articles in store upon tho defendant\u2019s premises at the time in question was unlawful. The act being unlawful, the count then showing with reasonable certainty that plaintiffs sustained actual damage as a proximate result of such unlawful act, cannot be regarded otherwise than as stating a cause of action within the rules of law, above laid down. The court below, therefore, erred in sustaining the defendants\u2019 demurrer to it, for which reason the judgment must he reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings.</p> <p id=\"b443-5\" pgmap=\"443\">Reversed and remanded.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
