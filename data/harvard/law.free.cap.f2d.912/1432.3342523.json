The leases were awarded to United through competitive bidding, and the Secretary of the Interior approved the leases, as well as United\u2019s exploration plans for the leased land. United\u2019s explorations, for which United spent more than $5 million, uncovered valuable uranium deposits. United then prepared a mining plan, which it submitted to the Secretary for approval, such approval being necessary before United could begin mining.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-10\">Although United\u2019s mining plan satisfied all of the requirements of the Secretary\u2019s regulations, the Secretary refused to approve it without tribal approval. During the next three years United unsuccessfully attempted to obtain tribal approval or to persuade the Secretary to approve the mining plan without tribal approval. The result was that United\u2019s leases terminated because United failed to begin mining within the period the lease specified. United then filed the present suit in the United States Claims Court alleging that the Secretary\u2019s refusal to approve the mining plan constituted a taking of its leases, for which it was entitled to just compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-12\">The Claims Court dismissed the suit, holding that United had no \u201clegally protected property right to approval of its mine plan\u201d that was \u201cthe subject of a Fifth Amendment taking.\u201d <em>United Nuclear Corp. v. United States, </em>17 Cl.Ct. 768, 777, 775 (1989). We hold, however, that there has been a taking of United\u2019s property interest in the leases, and remand the case to the Claims Court to determine the amount of just compensation to which United is entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-13\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b863-14\">A. The basic facts, as found by the Claims Court and as shown by the record, are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b863-15\">The Navajo Reservation is located in the Grants Mineral Belt, \u201cthe premier uranium-producing area\u201d in the United States. 17 Cl.Ct. at 769. Three hundred and thirty million pounds of uranium (approximately 55 percent of all uranium produced in the United States) has come from this area. The potential for uranium mining in this area has been generally recognized since at least the late 1960\u2019s, when the Kerr-McGee Corporation had obtained uranium leases from the Tribal Council and conducted substantial exploration. These and other exploratory efforts \u201cstrongly suggested that there was a significant potential for uranium to be discovered on areas of the Navajo reservation not covered by the Kerr-McGee leases.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b863-16\">The Tribal Council in 1970 unanimously authorized the Secretary of the Interior to conduct public bidding for uranium mining of this area. In sealed bidding, United, a large domestic producer of uranium with extensive mining experience, was the successful bidder for the mining rights on two tracts of the reservation.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-17\">On June 29, 1971, United entered into two ten-year leases with the Navajo Tribe (Tribe). The leases were for \u201ca term of 10 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1434\">*1434</page-number>years from the date of ... approval and as long thereafter as the minerals specified are produced in paying quantities.\u201d The leases provided for annual rent, a minimum annual royalty and additional royalties based upon the amount of minerals mined. United paid the Tribe a bonus of $79,000 upon signing the leases, and also paid total rent and royalties of more than $220,000. 17 Cl.Ct. at 770. The Tribe has retained all this money.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-4\">On July 7, 1971, the Secretary approved the leases. Such approval was necessary for them to become effective. 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 396a (1970); 25 C.F.R. \u00a7 171.2 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">The Secretary subsequently approved United\u2019s exploration plan, which approval was necessary before United could begin exploration. 25 C.F.R. \u00a7 177.6 (1970) (now designated 25 C.F.R. \u00a7 216.6 (1989)). United spent $5,366,835 for exploration and related activities. Through this exploration, United discovered more than 20 million pounds of uranium on explored portions of the leased land, and believed there was a potential for 20 million additional pounds on unexplored portions.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-6\">Prior to commencing mining operations on the leased lands, United was required to obtain the Secretary\u2019s approval of its mining plan. 25 C.F.R. \u00a7 177.7 (1971). On February 4, 1977, United submitted its mining plan to the United States Geological Survey (the \u201cSurvey\u201d), a Bureau of the Department of the Interior. The Claims Court found that \u201c[t]he mining plan satisfied each of the requirements set forth in the mining plan regulations,\u201d 17 Cl.Ct. at 770, and the government concedes that United\u2019s \u201cplan satisfied the technical requirements of the Department\u2019s regulations.\u201d The Regional Mining Supervisor, an Interior Department official who had served in that position since 1960, testified that he had never disapproved any of the hundreds of exploration or mining plans submitted for his approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-7\">The Claims Court found that although United\u2019s mining plan met all the regulatory requirements, the Department \u201cwithheld approval of the mining plan for a period of more than 4 years, deferring to the Navajo Tribe approval of the plan.\u201d 17 Cl.Ct. at 770. In April 1978, at a meeting between United and Departmental officials, the latter informed United that the Department \u201cwas giving the Navajo Tribe a veto power over the mining plan and that the Department and the [Survey] were refusing to take any action on the mining plan until the Tribe approved it.\u201d 17 Cl.Ct. at 771.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-9\">Tribal approval of mining plans never had been required previously. Only a few months earlier, when Kerr-McGee had sought the Secretary\u2019s approval for a mining plan on tribal land that it had leased, the Acting Director of the Survey wrote the Tribal Council that if the Survey did not receive tribal comments regarding Kerr-McGee\u2019s plan by a stated date, the Survey would \u201cassume that the [Tribe] concurs with the plan as submitted and [the Survey] will proceed with administrative processing of the mine plan.\u201d Letter of the Acting Director of the Survey to Peter McDonald, Chairman, Navajo Tribal Council, dated Feb. 3, 1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-10\">In a meeting on October 13, 1978, among tribal representatives, Department officials, and United, the General Counsel of the Tribe indicated that a \u201c$10,000,000 adder might be needed\u201d and a member of the Tribe indicated that \u201cit was not enough.\u201d It was stated that the Tribe was \u201c[concerned about the depletion of Tribal water resources.\u201d The Claims Court found, however, that United \u201chad met necessary environmental impact requirements.\u201d 17 Cl.Ct. at 771 n. 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-11\">The government itself recognized that the Tribe was using its veto power either to require United to pay more money or to cause the leases to lapse. The Chief of the Survey\u2019s Branch of Mining Operations wrote in the fall of 1978:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b864-12\">The tribe is withholding comments and concurrence on approval of [United\u2019s mining] plan[] in hopes of forcing the lessees to take the tribe on as a partner in the operations. This is real leverage since the tribal leases will expire on July 7, 1981, unless production has commenced in paying quantities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b865-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1435\">*1435</page-number>Moreover, there is testimony indicating that the Bureau of Indian Affairs also was aware that the Tribe was withholding approval because \u201cthe tribe wanted more bucks, more money.\u201d From the time of the April 1978 meeting, when United first was informed of the tribal approval requirement, United \u201cmade repeated and continuous efforts to gain such tribal approval ... [and] sought to convince the Secretary to withdraw the requirement of tribal approval of the mining plan.\u201d 17 Cl.Ct. at 771. Neither endeavor succeeded.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">Following an unsuccessful judicial attempt by United to compel the Secretary (1) to approve or act upon the mining plan, or (2) to extend the leases, <em>United Nuclear Corp. v. Watt, </em>17 ERC 1643 (D.D.C.1982), the leases expired as of July 7, 1981, because of United\u2019s failure to begin mining.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-6\">B. On May 4, 1984, United filed a complaint in the United States Claims Court alleging that the Secretary\u2019s failure to approve the mining plan constituted a taking of United\u2019s property without just compensation, in violation of the fifth amendment, and seeking damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-7\">After a trial, the Claims Court dismissed the complaint. The court first held that the suit was timely filed within six years of the alleged taking. It ruled that the date of the alleged taking was October 1, 1978, which it found was the date on which under normal conditions United\u2019s mining operations would have commenced. 17 Cl.Ct. at 772.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-8\">On the merits, the court held that the property right which is the subject of this taking claim is not the leases. What is the subject property is UNC\u2019s expectation that it would be permitted by defendant to engage in mining the leased tracts. According to <em>Allied-General [Nuclear Services, Inc. v. United States, </em>839 F.2d 1572 (Fed.Cir.1988) ], this is not a legally protected property right which can be the subject of a Fifth Amendment taking.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-9\"><em>Id. </em>17 Cl.Ct. at 775.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-10\">The court concluded that United had no legally protected property right to approval of its mining plan as against the declaration of policy to assure maximum participation by Indians in their affairs where the federal Government is involved.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b865-12\">17 Cl.Ct. at 777.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-13\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b865-14\">The determination whether government action constitutes a taking of property under the fifth amendment rather than a mere exercise of the government\u2019s regulatory authority frequently is a close, difficult, and complex process. In <em>Connolly v. Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., </em>475 U.S. 211, 106 S.Ct. 1018, 89 L.Ed.2d 166 (1986), the Supreme Court noted that while its cases \u201chave eschewed the development of any set formula for identifying a \u2018taking\u2019 forbidden by the Fifth Amendment, and have relied instead on ad hoc, factual inquiries into the circumstances of each particular case,\u201d there are \u201cthree factors which have \u2018particular significance\u2019 \u201d \u201c[t]o aid in this determination\u201d: (1) \u201cthe economic impact of the regulation on the claimant\u201d; (2) \u201cthe extent to which the regulation has interfered with distinct investment-backed expectations\u201d; and (3) \u201cthe character of the governmental action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 224-25, 106 S.Ct. at 1025-26. <em>See also Atlas Corp. v. United States, </em>895 F.2d 745, 756-57 (Fed.Cir.1990); <em>United States v. One (1) 1979 Cadillac Coupe de Ville, </em>833 F.2d 994, 1000 (Fed.Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b865-15\">1. <em>The Economic Impact of the Regulation on the Claimant. </em>As the Claims Court found, the economic impact of the regulation (giving the Tribe a veto power over the mining plan) upon United \u201chas been severe.\u201d 17 Cl.Ct. at 773. United has paid the Tribe approximately $300,000 as a bonus for the leases and as rent and minimum royalties. It also expended more than $5 million in exploration and related activity. It is unlikely that United will be able to recover any of this money.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-16\">Equally or perhaps more significant, United\u2019s exploration indicated that a substantial amount of uranium existed on the leased land. The extraction and sale of this uranium by United presumably would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1436\">*1436</page-number>have produced significant profits for the company. The Secretary prevented United from commencing mining operations by refusing to approve United\u2019s mining plan, thus causing the leases to expire. As a result, United lost whatever profits it would have made had it been permitted to mine the leased land.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-4\">2. <em>The Extent to Which the Regulation Has Interfered With Distinct Investment-Backed Expectations. </em>United invested more than $5 million in the project and presumably expected to derive substantial profits from the venture. Prior to the April 1978 meeting with Departmental officials, United had no indication or even suggestion that tribal approval of the mining plan would be required before the Secretary would approve it. Indeed, previously tribal approval of mining plans had not been required. United\u2019s mining plan concededly satisfied the requirements of the applicable regulations. Prior to the meeting, United justifiably believed and expected that if its mining plan met the requirements, the Secretary would approve it \u2014 as he had done for United\u2019s exploration plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">Although the Claims Court recognized that United had these expectations, it held that the expectations were not reasonable because \u201c[i]t would have been reasonable and prudent for [United] to question at the outset whether rules, regulations and requirements under the existing scheme, to which it voluntarily submitted itself, would change during the 10-year term of its lease.\u201d 17 Cl.Ct. at 775. The court referred to a provision of the leases that required United to abide by and conform to the leases \u201cand all regulations of the [Secretary] now or hereafter in force and relative to such leases____\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b866-6\">The Secretary\u2019s new requirement of tribal approval of the mining plan was not adopted or included in any regulation of the Secretary. If the Secretary had proposed such a regulation, United would have had the opportunity to oppose it. Indeed, at one point the Secretary had proposed (although never adopted) a regulation, applicable only to future and not to existing leases, Proposed \u00a7 177.2(c), that required only that the \u201cMining Supervisor shall be available to consult with the Indian mineral owner before acting to approve or disapprove any such plan,\u201d Proposed \u00a7 177.5, and not that the plan be approved by the tribe. Dep\u2019t of Interior, <em>Mining on Indian Lands, Proposed Rules, </em>42 Fed.Reg. 18,-083, 18,088-89 (Apr. 5, 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b866-9\">The fact that United agreed that the leases would be subject to future regulations does not indicate that United fairly can be said to have anticipated that the Secretary would apply a new policy requiring tribal approval of mining plans to leases entered into almost six years earlier, in reliance on which United had expended some $5 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-10\">The Claims Court held, however, that the Secretary\u2019s decision had not interfered with United\u2019s investment-backed expectations because the property \u201cright\u201d that United alleges was taken was \u201cnot the leases,\u201d but United\u2019s \u201cexpectation that it would be permitted by defendant to engage in mining the leased tracts.\u201d 17 Cl.Ct. at 775. Relying upon <em>Allied-General, </em>the court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b866-11\">It was not a reasonable investment-backed expectation that merely achieving technical adequacy of the mine plan under the regulations automatically <em>required </em>Secretarial approval of [United\u2019s] mine plan ministerially. A sophisticated company like [United], schooled in the vicissitudes of Government, should have reasonably contemplated the possibility of Government inaction and delay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b866-12\">The Court believes it was reasonable for [United], in dealing with the Navajos and the Government, to assume that there would be tribal involvement in the mine plan decisionmaking process when weighed against the trust responsibilities of the Secretary created by the Indian Mineral Leasing Act of 1938 (25 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 396a-396f) and the Government\u2019s policy of Indian Self-Determination which had its origins in a policy statement by President Nixon in 1970 which, in turn, culminated in the enactment of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act, 25 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 450, <em>et seq., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1437\">*1437</page-number>some 2 years before [United] submitted its mine plan to [the Survey] for approval.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b867-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 776 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b867-7\">In part 3 below, we explain why <em>Allied-General </em>is significantly different from, and therefore does not control, this case. Here we note only that the property interest that is the subject of the taking claim is United\u2019s leasehold interest in the minerals, which the government took by preventing United from mining under the leases, and not the mere expectation that United would be permitted to engage in mining. Contrary to the ruling of the Claims Court, we hold that the Secretary\u2019s refusal to approve the mining plan seriously interfered with United\u2019s investment-backed expectations by destroying them.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-8\">3. <em>The Character of the Governmental Action. </em>When the Interior Department officials first informed United that tribal approval was required for the mining plan, they gave no reason for or explanation of that decision. The Claims Court specified two factors that it believed explained the Secretary\u2019s decision: \u201c[T]ribal concerns about potential reduction of scarce drinking water supplies in an arid region and the addition of another major uranium mining operation to an already large number of such mines operating in an area which could not handle the burgeoning population and increased traffic that would impact the area.\u201d 17 Cl.Ct. at 777. The court also noted that United \u201chad met necessary environmental impact requirements,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 771 n. 10 \u2014 a finding that seemingly undercuts and perhaps vitiates the court\u2019s speculation regarding the reasons for the Secretary\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-10\">The record leaves no doubt that the real reason for the Tribe\u2019s refusal to approve United\u2019s mining plan was an attempt to obtain substantial additional money from United. The general counsel of the Tribe indicated at a meeting that an additional $10 million would be necessary. Interior Department officials were aware that the Tribe\u2019s true motive for refusing to approve the mining plan was that the Tribe \u201cwanted ... more money.\u201d This fact, which the Claims Court did not mention, is inconsistent with that court\u2019s view that the reason the Tribal Council would not approve the mining plan was \u201ctribal concerns regarding potential loss of the Tribe\u2019s drinking water supplies and the cumulative effects of the proliferation of uranium mines in the area,\u201d 17 Cl.Ct. at 777, since these concerns apparently would have disappeared if United had paid the Tribe substantial additional money.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-12\">In its brief before us, the government asserts that the Secretary\u2019s requirement of tribal approval of the mining plan was intended to promote the Indians\u2019 right to and development of self-determination. It is difficult to understand, however, how encouraging the Indians not to live up to their contractual obligations, which they entered into freely and with the Secretary\u2019s approval, could be said to encourage self-determination. To the contrary, one would think that the best way to make the Indians more responsible citizens would be to require them to live up to their contractual commitments.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-13\">The present case is very different from <em>Allied-General. </em>In that case a company had constructed a plant for reprocessing used nuclear fuel. While the Nuclear Regulatory Commission was considering the company\u2019s application for an operating permit for the plant, the President barred the operation of any reprocessing plants because of concern that permitting the plant to operate could lead to a proliferation of nuclear weapons that could threaten the safety of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-14\">The Claims Court dismissed a suit for just compensation based on the government\u2019s alleged taking of the plant. This court affirmed, holding that \u201cthe claimant had no legally protected property right to operate the plant, which could have been the subject of a fifth amendment taking, as against the fear it would injure the national security.\u201d 839 F.2d at 1573. This court applied \u201cthe basic rule ... that as against reasonable state regulation, no one has a legally protected right to use property in a manner that is injurious to the safety of the general public.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1576 (citing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1438\">*1438</page-number><em>Mugler v. Kansas, </em>123 U.S. 623, 8 S.Ct. 273, 31 L.Ed. 205 (1887)).</p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\">The Secretary\u2019s requirement of tribal consent in the present case is a far cry from the kind of Presidential power invoked in <em>Allied-General. </em>The Secretary\u2019s action reflects not concern over national safety, but an attempt to enable the Tribe to exact additional money from a company with whom it had a valid contract, which the government euphemistically describes as an attempt to encourage and promote Indian self-determination. The considerations upon which the court based its decision in <em>Allied-General </em>are inapplicable here. <em>See also Atlas Corp., </em>895 F.2d 756-58 (federal statute requiring uranium producers to take costly action to decontaminate production sites and stabilize residue from uranium production known as \u201ctailings,\u201d not a taking where Congress determined that the tailings were \u201cpotentially hazardous to the public health\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b868-6\">We hold that there was a taking, and accordingly reverse the judgment of the Claims Court dismissing the complaint. The case is remanded to that court to determine the just compensation to which United Nuclear Corporation is entitled. In so remanding, we indicate no views concerning the basis upon which just compensation is to be determined or the amount to be awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-7\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b868-8\">NIES, Chief Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AnH7\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-9\">I respectfully dissent. In my view, the alleged appropriation of United Nuclear Corporation\u2019s mining rights (1) is not the responsibility of the United States, and (2) does not constitute a regulatory \u201ctaking\u201d under the standard of <em>Connolly v. Pension Benefits Guaranty Corp., </em>475 U.S. 211, 106 S.Ct. 1018, 89 L.Ed.2d 166 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b868-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b868-11\">\n<em>United\u2019s Dispute Is With The Navajos</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b868-12\">Stripped of irrelevancies, the facts are that United Nuclear Corporation entered into leases with the Navajo Tribe which entitled United to enter on certain tribal lands and to mine uranium. United\u2019s \u201crights\u201d in such leases vis-a-vis the Navajos, are enforceable, according to United\u2019s counsel, only in Navijo Tribal Courts. <em>See Santa Clara Pueblo v. Martinez, </em>436 U.S. 49, 65-66, 98 S.Ct. 1670, 1680-81, 56 L.Ed.2d 106 (1978) and cases cited therein. (\u201cTribal courts have repeatedly been recognized as appropriate forums for the exclusive adjudication of disputes affecting important personal and property interests of both Indians and non-Indians.\u201d) United first attempted to litigate this dispute in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against the United States and the Navajo Tribe seeking an extension of the lease term and damages. The tribe asserted sovereign immunity. The court concluded, <em>inter alia, </em>that United could not \u201cdefeat the Navajo\u2019s sovereign immunity,\u201d particularly with respect to \u201ccontrol of its natural resources,\u201d by \u201creliance on a commercial exception, due process or compensation principles.\u201d <em>United Nuclear Corp. v. Clark, </em>584 F.Supp. 107, 110-11 (D.D.C.1984). Accordingly, the case was dismissed. No appeal was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-15\">United totally ignores tribal laws although such law is the fundamental basis for United\u2019s asserted property rights. As the Supreme Court has said, \u201cProperty interests, of course, are not created by the Constitution. Rather, they are created and their dimensions are defined by existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent source such as state law.\u201d <em>Ruckelshaus v. Monsanto, </em>467 U.S. 986, 1001, 104 S.Ct. 2862, 2872, 81 L.Ed.2d 815 (1984) <em>Cf. Langenegger v. United States, </em>756 F.2d 1565, 1572-73 (Fed. Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>474 U.S. 824, 106 S.Ct. 78, 88 L.Ed.2d 64 (1985) (\u201cIt is our view that one who owns land in a foreign country looks to the laws of that country to determine his incidents of ownership including his rights in the event of expropriation.\u201d) Here, United\u2019s leasehold rights are dependent on tribal law. United has not established what is the scope of leasehold rights that the Navajos recognize in a private non-Indi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1439\">*1439</page-number>an party as against the sovereign Tribe. If United\u2019s rights were defeasible, for example by reason of legitimate Tribal concerns for the environment, United may have no <em>property rights </em>that could be taken.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">Unlike the majority, I do not know the reasons the Navajos did not approve the mining plan. It could have been because the Tribe wanted more money, as the majority finds, or its concern for its water supply and fear of the hazards of uranium mining, as the Claims Court suggested <em>(United Nuclear Corp. v. United States, </em>17 Cl. Ct. at 768, 771 n. 10 (1989)), or simply a desire to preserve its patrimony. The leases, for example, were renewable in perpetuity.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The reason is immaterial to a taking claim against the United States, and in any event, the tribe\u2019s motive is beyond judicial inquiry. As stated in <em>Langenegger:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-6\">Consideration of El Salvador\u2019s motives for expropriation is not the central focus of a claim alleging a taking by our country. To the extent that such motivation may be pertinent, we find that the relevant facts reside in what that government \u201cpurported\u201d to do. If the \u201cpurported\u201d reasons for action are not the real reasons, we think the matter is not one the judicial bench can correct; a subjective determination of a government\u2019s motive is beyond judicial inquiry.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b869-12\">756 F.2d at 1569-70.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-13\">What is material here is that any claim that United may have is against the Navajos in accordance with the law recognized in their tribal courts.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> United has not pursued that avenue. Its excuse for not doing so is that it does not wish to sue the Navajos in tribal courts. United prefers to sue the United States in its \u201ctribal court,\u201d the U.S. Claims Court, on a strained theory that the United States has \u201ctaken\u201d its leasehold interest by \u201cgiving\u201d the Navajos a \u201cveto\u201d power over mining plans proposed for the Navajo\u2019s sovereign lands.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-14\">At most, the Secretary facilitated the Navajo\u2019s exercise of inherent sovereignty. Because of the Secretary\u2019s deference, the Navajos, simply by doing nothing, effectively prevented United from obtaining approval of its mining plan from the Secretary. However, there is no evidence that \u201cbut for\u201d the Secretary\u2019s deference to the Tribe, mining would have proceeded. Ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1440\">*1440</page-number>proval of the mining plan was required <em>before </em>mining, but whether <em>a tribal court </em>would have held United was entitled to mine once it obtained the Secretary\u2019s approval, we have no idea.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\">In any event, after securing mining plan approval, United had to obtain approval <em>from the Navajos </em>to build roads, put in power lines, and construct other necessary production facilities. It is difficult to rationalize in a real world setting that the <em>Secretary </em>\u201cdestroyed\u201d the leasehold and caused United\u2019s loss of profit by not approving United\u2019s mining plan. If the Navajos wanted to stop mining or make it unprofitable <em>{e.g., </em>by taxing United), they had the power to do so, regardless of what the Secretary did with respect to the mining plan. <em>See Washington v. Confederated Tribes of the Colville Indian Reservation, </em>447 U.S. 134, 152, 100 S.Ct. 2069, 2080, 65 L.Ed.2d 10 (1980) (power to tax is \u201cfundamental attribute of sovereignty which the tribes retain.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">The point of this analysis is that exploitation of United\u2019s leasehold interest was dependent on the cooperation and law of the Navajos. That the consent of the Secretary was necessary to obtain the lease and to proceed at various stages does not change the fact that United\u2019s lease is with the Navajos and concerns tribal lands. <em>Poafpybitty v. Skelly Oil Co., </em>390 U.S. 365, 372, 88 S.Ct. 982, 985, 19 L.Ed.2d 1238 (1968) (although approval of Secretary is required, \u201che is not the lessor\u201d of Indian lands). United\u2019s dispute, like its lease, is with the Navajos. The acts, or more precisely inaction, which directly caused United\u2019s leasehold interests to become valueless were those of the Navajo Tribe.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-6\">I recognize that precedent does support the proposition that the United States may be held responsible for a taking even where its acts are not the final direct cause of the property loss. <em>Langenegger, </em>756 F.2d at 1570; <em>Aris Gloves, Inc. v. United States, </em>190 Ct.Cl. 367, 372, 420 F.2d 1386, 1391 (1970), <em>Turney v. United States, </em>126 Ct.Cl. 202, 115 F.Supp. 457 (1953). However, in a comparable situation, the Supreme Court has said, \u201c[A] determination must be made whether the [federal] government involvement in the deprivation of private property is sufficiently direct and substantial to require compensation under the Fifth Amendment,\u201d <em>National Bd. of YMCA v. United States, </em>395 U.S. 85, 93, 89 S.Ct. 1511, 1516, 23 L.Ed.2d 117 (1969). In this case, there is no justification for attributing the acts of the Tribe to the United States. The record is wholly devoid of evidence that the United States encouraged or even suggested, much less required, that the Navajo Tribe should withhold approval of the mining plan. <em>Cf. Fern v. United States, </em>908 F.2d 955 (Fed.Cir.1990) (United States not liable for action taken by states following enactment of statute removing preemption).</p>\n<p id=\"b870-8\">In <em>Langenegger, </em>no taking by the United States was found upon expropriation of property of U.S. citizens by El Salvador despite the active encouragement of such action by the United States. There, this court held that its determination of whether the United States\u2019 involvement was \u201csufficiently direct and substantial\u201d to warrant fixing responsibility on the United States must be \u201cpremised upon the sum of two factors: (1) the nature of the United States\u2019 activity, and (2) the level of the benefits the United States has derived.\u201d <em>Langenegger, </em>756 F.2d at 1572. The \u201cactivity\u201d \u00f3f the United States in <em>Langenegger </em>was a change in our foreign policy towards El Salvador which encouraged land reform; here, it was a change in our policy towards Indian tribes which encouraged their self-determination. In both cases, the United States derived no actual benefit from the \u201ctaken\u201d property itself. Rather, it merely enjoyed a nebulous improvement in relations with another sovereign.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-9\">Judged by the <em>Langenegger </em>two-part standard, the nature of the acts of the United States and the level of benefits it accrued do not rise to the level of a \u201csubstantial and direct\u201d involvement in the appropriation of United\u2019s lease by the Navajos. Under these circumstances, the United States is not responsible for the acts of the Tribe, and thus, there is no taking of United\u2019s property <em>by </em>the United States. <em>Accord Erosion Victims of Lake Superior Regulation v. United States, </em>833 F.2d 297 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1441\">*1441</page-number>(Fed.Cir.1987) (no \u201cdirect or substantial involvement\u201d under <em>Langenegger </em>test by United States where international organization exercised own discretion in action which injured landowners).</p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b871-6\">\n<em>No Regulatory Taking</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b871-7\">If one adopts the view of the majority that the United States is the responsible party for causing United\u2019s loss here, I would nevertheless hold that United has failed to meet the legal standard set forth by the Supreme Court for determining that a governmental action has transgressed the boundaries of an uncompensable \u201cregulation\u201d and, therefore, must be viewed as a compensable \u201ctaking.\u201d As set forth by the majority, the factors to be weighed in determining a taking are the character of the governmental action, its economic impact and its interference with reasonable investment-backed expectations. <em>Connolly, </em>475 U.S. at 224-25, 106 S.Ct. at 1025-26; <em>PruneYard Shopping Center v. Robins, </em>447 U.S. 74, 83, 100 S.Ct. 2035, 2041, 64 L.Ed.2d 741 (1980); <em>United States v. (1) 1979 Cadillac Coupe de Ville, </em>833 F.2d 994, 1000 (Fed.Cir.1987). It is to the last of these three factors that I principally direct this part of my opinion because the weight of this factor is so overwhelming here that it controls the taking issue. <em>See Ruckelshaus v. Monsanto Co., </em>467 U.S. at 1005, 104 S.Ct. at 2874; <em>United States v. (1) 1979 Cadillac Coupe de Ville, </em>833 F.2d at 1000. In contrast to the majority, I agree with the Claims Court that the Secretary\u2019s failure to approve the mining plan unless the Tribe also approved did not interfere with any reasonable investment-backed expectation of United.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-8\">The majority holds that United had distinct investment-backed expectations in that \u201c[pjrior to the April 1978 meeting with Departmental officials, United had no indication or even suggestion that tribal approval of the mining plan would be required before the Secretary would approve it.\u201d Even assuming United had no prior indication or suggestion, the inquiry does not end there. The circumstances surrounding this case provide no basis for United to have had reasonable investment-backed expectations that it would be able to mine uranium under its leases with the Navajo Tribe merely because its mining plan was technically adequate under applicable regulations. The regulation with respect to mining plan approval, 25 C.F.R. \u00a7 177.7 (1978), did not guarantee <em>mining. See Ruckelshaus v. Monsanto Co., </em>467 U.S. at 1008, 104 S.Ct. at 2875 (no investment-backed expectation that data submitted to EPA would remain confidential absent explicit assurance). Any expectation under the circumstances was precatory at best.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-10\">Nor did the United States guarantee or give assurance of the Tribe\u2019s performance under the leases. In <em>Monsanto, </em>the Court held that a governmental action does not interfere with a reasonable investment-backed expectation if the party claiming the taking was aware of and subject to a statutory scheme that did not provide any assurance that such expectations were reasonable. 467 U.S. at 1007, 104 S.Ct. at 2875. The majority does not address what in the record here establishes that the United States accepted the burden of the uncertainty which United assumed by contracting with another entity. <em>Cf. Allied-General Nuclear Servs. v. United States, </em>839 F.2d 1572, 1573-74 (Fed.Cir.) <em>cert. denied, </em>488 U.S. 819, 109 S.Ct. 61, 102 L.Ed.2d 39 (1988) (\u201c[W]e note an entire absence of any evidence that the government in any manner, express or implied, contracted to share whatever risks there might be in the venture, to warrant that it would succeed, or otherwise shield it against vicissitudes.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b871-11\">Moreover, the regulations on which United relies as the basis for its investment-backed expectation were subject to change. Specifically, the express language of paragraph XVII of the leases required United to abide by and conform to \u201call regulations of the Secretary of the Interior now or hereafter in force and relative to such leases.\u201d As the Claims Court pointed out, \u201c[t]he express language of paragraph XVII makes it clear that the Secretary as trustee for the lessor expressly reserved the right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1442\">*1442</page-number>to make changes, additions or modifications to the existing regulations which could affect the leases.\u201d <em>United, Nuclear Corp. v. United States, </em>17 Cl.Ct. at 775-76. The Secretary did not adopt the change in policy here by formal rulemaking procedures. That was deemed not necessary because the regulations at all times required the Secretary \u201cto consult\u201d with the Tribe. <em>See </em>25 C.F.R. \u00a7 177.12 (1978). The Secretary merely expanded that consultation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The point is, however, that these regulations provide a shaky foundation for United\u2019s assertion of a reasonable investment-backed expectation.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-4\">Further militating against the existence of a reasonable investment-backed expectation is the longstanding statutory, regulatory, and jurisprudential backdrop concerning Indian affairs within which United placed itself by leasing rights on tribal lands. Under the Mineral Leasing Act of 1938, 25 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 396a-396g, Congress entrusted the Secretary of the Interior with the responsibility of considering the best interests of the Indians when making any decision involving leases on tribal lands. <em>See United Nuclear Corp. v. United States, </em>17 Cl.Ct. at 776; <em>see also, </em>43 U.S.C. \u00a7 1457(10) (1982); 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 2 (1988); 25 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 171-77. In effectuating the trust responsibilities, the Secretary has broad discretion in choosing the manner in which to protect the best interests of Indian lessors. <em>See Kenai Oil &amp; Gas, Inc. v. Department of the Interior, </em>671 F.2d 383, 387 (10th Cir.1982). Also having potential effect on Indian mining activity was the government\u2019s policy of fostering Indian self-determination which predated United\u2019s signing of the leases. That policy began with an announcement by President Nixon and was effectuated in the passage of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act, Pub.L. No. 93-638, 25 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 450 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b872-5\">I find the present complaint of a taking much less persuasive than that made in <em>Allied-General Nuclear Servs. </em>Allied-General had invested $200 million in building a reprocessing plant for processing spent fuel from nuclear power facilities under a construction license from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. President Carter concluded that the foreign policy position of the United States against nuclear proliferation was undermined if the United States built such plants which produced plutonium, a component of nuclear weapons. Thus, the United States denied Allied-General an operating license and made its plant worthless. This court found that no taking of property occurred, <em>inter alia, </em>because Allied-General accepted the regulatory scheme under which the licensing agency was \u201crequired to take into account the common defense and security of the nation.\u201d <em>Allied-General Nuclear Servs., </em>839 F.2d at 1577.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-9\">The majority distinguishes <em>Allied-General </em>on the basis that the governmental action there was tied to concern over \u201cnational safety\u201d whereas here the Secretary\u2019s action was \u201can attempt to enable the Tribe to exact additional money from a company with whom it had a valid contract.\u201d Not only is this original factfinding by the majority based on snippets of testimony that the Tribe had this motive, but also there is no evidence that the Secretary\u2019s intent was so sinister. In any event, the particular purpose of the governmental action is not of legal import. In both cases the governmental action was permissible, being rationally related to a legitimate government interest, and in both cases a reasonable investment-backed expectation was lacking because of the regulatory scheme. <em>See Ruckelshaus v. Monsanto Co., </em>467 U.S. at 1007, 104 S.Ct. at 2875. Moreover, <em>Allied-General </em>makes clear that United\u2019s ability to foresee the specific approval requirement is not dispositive. <em>Allied-General Nuclear Servs., </em>839 F.2d at 1577.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-10\">The majority presumes that United has suffered a severe economic impact which is not otherwise compensable. Again, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1443\">*1443</page-number>simply do not know. United failed to pursue a breach of contract or unjust enrichment claim against the Navajo Tribe. United counsel\u2019s assumption that suit in a Navajo Tribal Court would have been a futile gesture is untenable. As held by the district court in prior proceedings between these parties, due process is not violated by this being the sole remedy. <em>United Nuclear Corp. v. Clark, </em>584 F.Supp. at 110. Moreover, the exhaustion of United\u2019s Tribal Court remedy is required before a claim that it has suffered a loss has any credibility. <em>Cf. National Farmers Union Ins. Co. v. Crow Tribe, </em>471 U.S. 845, 105 S.Ct. 2447, 85 L.Ed.2d 818 (1985). It is worth noting that other lessees who entered into uranium mining leases with the Navajos were able to work out settlements of similar problems with the Tribe.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b873-8\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">The Supreme Court reaffirmed in <em>Connolly </em>that the purpose of forbidding uncompensated takings of private property for public use is to bar government from forcing some people alone to bear public burdens which, in all fairness and justice, should be borne by the public as a whole. 475 U.S. at 227, 106 S.Ct. at 1027. I am unpersuaded that United has shown any reason to receive compensation from the people of the United States because the Navajos frustrated United\u2019s desire to secure permanent mining leases on Navajo lands.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-6\">For all the above reasons, I would affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b869-7\">. The fact that United submitted an environmental impact statement which the Secretary approved does not restrict the Tribe from imposing stricter environmental standards than federal standards. <em>See </em>F. Cohen, <em>Handbook of Federal Indian Law, </em>p. 538 (1982 ed.).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b869-8\">. The terms of the lease provided a fixed rate schedule for royalties and for renewal so long as the lessee produced \u201cthe minerals specified in paying quantities.\u201d The record also indicates that United did not attempt to work matters out with the Tribe and that the Tribe took offense at United \"going to Washington\u201d rather than dealing directly with the Tribe.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b869-9\">. <em>Montana v.
