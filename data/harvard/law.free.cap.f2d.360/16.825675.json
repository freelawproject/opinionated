The facts have been stipulated. Atlas Supply Company is a corporation established to acquire and maintain the \u201cAtlas\u201d trademark for automobile tires, batteries and accessories, referred to in the industry as \u2018T.B.A.\u2019 Atlas accessories included brakes. The corporation licenses several Standard Oil companies throughout the nation to use the Atlas trademark on these products. In the Cincinnati, Ohio area only the Sohio corporation is licensed to use the Atlas trademark on these products, which are sold by its service station outlets. Atlas Supply Company neither manufactures nor sells the products which bear its trademark. It has sixty-eight registrations in the United States Patent Office for its Atlas trademark as applied to T.B.A.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-11\">Appellant, Atlas Brake Shops, Inc., is engaged in the Cincinnati, Ohio area in the retail sale and installation of brakes and parts therefor, at three garages. Appellant sells relined brakes which are made up of new brake lining bonded on used brake shoes. They are purchased from various independent rebonders.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-12\">Appellee\u2019s licensees sell only new brakes.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-13\">The brakes, parts, and packages sold by appellant do not bear the \u201cAtlas\u201d designation ; however, its identifying and advertising signs at its three garage locations are labelled \u201cAtlas Brake Shops, Inc.\u201d In addition, it advertises its products in the local newspaper as \u201cAtlas Brakes,\u201d and it is listed in the local telephone book as \u201cAtlas Brake Shops.\u201d Appellant also carries an \u201cAtlas Brake\u201d designation on its customer receipts and guarantee certificate forms.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-14\">Appellant began selling its service and products in the Cincinnati area in 1959. Sohio service stations started selling T.B.A. trademarked \u201cAtlas\u201d in the Cincinnati area in 1930, but did not commence selling brakes trademarked \u201cAtlas\u201d until May, 1961.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-15\">Two of appellee\u2019s registrations are involved here: a 1932 registration, No. 293,307, renewed in 1952, covering the word \u201cAtlas\u201d as applied to brake linings; and a 1949 registration, No. 511,816, issued to Atlas Asbestos Company and assigned to appellee in October, 1960, covering a design with a caricature of a man holding the globe on his shoulders, and the words \u201cIt Holds The World \u2014 Warranted Atlas Brake Lining\u201d. In the assigned registration the words \u201cIt Holds The World \u2014 Warranted\u201d and \u201cBrake Lining\u201d in the trademark are expressly disclaimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-16\">It was stipulated that these two registrations, as well as the other sixty-six registrations relating to T.B.A., \u201cwere duly and lawfully issued, are in full force and effect * *</p>\n<p id=\"b71-17\">On June 18, 1962 appellee first learned of appellant\u2019s use of the designation \u201cAtlas\u201d in connection with its sale and in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>stallation of brakes, and based on the above registrations it notified appellant to cease and desist from using the designation \u201cAtlas Brakes.\u201d No action was taken by appellant to comply with this notice and the present suit for an injunction resulted.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">The District Court found that appellant\u2019s use of the \u201cAtlas\u201d designation in its corporate title and in conjunction with its automotive brake business was unfair competition and infringed appellee\u2019s validly registered trademark, No. 293,-307. The Court ordered appellant to cease using the designations \u201cAtlas\u201d, \u201cAtlas Brakes\u201d, \u201cAtlas Brake Shops\u201d and \u201cAtlas Brake Shops, Inc.,\u201d in connection with the sale or installation of automotive products or goods of a similar nature, and ordered that appellant delete the word \u201cAtlas\u201d from its corporate name.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">Appellant first argues that appellee\u2019s registered trademark, No. 293,307, for \u201cAtlas\u201d as applied to brake lining, is not valid because it has been abandoned by nonuse. The Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1127, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-6\">\u201cA mark shall be deemed to be \u2018abandoned\u2019 \u2014 (a) When its use has been discontinued with intent not to resume. Intent not to resume may be inferred from circumstances. Nonuse for two consecutive years shall be prima facie abandonment/</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b72-7\"> Abandonment of a trademark is an affirmative defense which must be pleaded; otherwise it is deemed waived. Rule 8(c) F.R.Civ.P.; 3 Call-man, Unfair Competition and Trademarks (2nd ed.) \u00a7 79.3. Appellant did not plead this defense in its answer. Moreover, the claim of abandonment is inconsistent with the stipulation that the registration of the trademark was in full force and effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-8\">The claim of laches has no merit. It was not pleaded. The Stipulation of Facts stated that appellee\u2019s first notice of appellant\u2019s use of the Atlas designation was on June 18, 1962, and that on June 22, 1962 appellee mailed a letter to appellant demanding that it cease using the Atlas designation.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-10\">The next question is whether or not the trademark has been infringed. The test of liability under the Lanham Act is whether the defendant\u2019s mark \u201cis likely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-11\">Appellant argues that there is no competition between its product and service and the appellee\u2019s licensed product. It claims that it sells only a relined brake in connection with its primary function to provide a complete brake service and installation, and that appellee\u2019s licensees sell a new brake.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-12\">In our opinion there is competition. The products are interchangeable; that is, purchase of one product by a customer would eliminate the need for purchase of the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-13\">Also, the trademark is not limited to the goods specified in the registration, but goes to any goods which are \u201clikely to cause confusion\u201d in the public\u2019s mind. Pure Foods, Inc. v. Minute Maid Corp., 214 F.2d 792 (5th Cir. 1954); Admiral Corp. v. Penco, Inc., 203 F.2d 517 (2nd Cir. 1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-14\">Here both products are sold to the same customers; they are interchangeable; and the fact that appellant provides a service apart from the sale of the brakes greater than that provided by ap-pellee, is not so distinguishing as to defeat the likelihood of confusion. Admiral Corp. v. Penco, Inc., supra; Dwinell-Wright Co. v. National Fruit Products Co., 140 F.2d 618 (1st Cir. 1944).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-15\">There is evidence in the record that the name \u201cAtlas\u201d is used by approximately thirty-five business concerns in the Cincinnati area. This indicates that \u201cAtlas\u201d is a rather \u201cweak\u201d mark. Accordingly, the Courts have been less inclined to extend protection to unrelated products not specifically named in the registration. Dwinell-Wright Co. v. National Fruit Products Co., supra. However, even assuming that the products <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>are different here (new brakes vs. relined brakes), there is in our judgment enough similarity between the two to cause confusion in the mind of the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">The District Court\u2019s order prohibited appellant\u2019s use of the name \u201cAtlas\u201d and directed that \u201cAtlas\u201d be deleted from its corporate name. This part of the order is too broad. It should be limited so as to prohibit only the use of the name \u201cAtlas\u201d in combination with the words brakes and brake linings in the corporate name, and the use of \u201cAtlas\u201d in connection with the sale of brakes or brake linings. Since the name Atlas is in common use in the Cincinnati area, and probably throughout the nation it \u201ccannot be completely removed from the public domain.\u201d Sunbeam Furniture Corp. v. Sunbeam Corp., 191 F.2d 141, 145 (9th Cir. 1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">That others would use the word \u201cAtlas\u201d in connection with unrelated products and businesses is the risk which appellee assumed when it adopted the name \u201cAtlas\u201d as a trademark.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">As modified herein, the judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
