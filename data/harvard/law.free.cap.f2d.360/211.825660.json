Bowman, his stockholder\u2019s derivative action against several defendants on behalf of Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Railway Co., in which case motions by each of the defendants-appel-lees for dismissal of the complaint and for summary judgment pursuant to Rules 12(b) and 56(b) F.R.Civ.P. were granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-24\">In No. 30147, plaintiff Annenberg, who had brought her stockholder\u2019s derivative action on behalf of Alleghany Corporation, appeals from the granting on the same day by the same court of a similar motion made in her ease by defendant Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Railway Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-25\">The motions were disposed of together, counsel for the plaintiffs in the two actions submitting joint papers in opposition to the motions. The motions were granted as to defendants-appellees in both cases on the ground that as to them the court had no subject-matter jurisdiction over the two complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>Judge Bryan rendered an opinion in Schwartz v. Bowman, reported at 244 F. Supp. 51 (S.D.N.Y.1965), and filed a memorandum opinion the same day in <em>Annenberg, </em>in which he stated he was dismissing the latter complaint entirely for the reasons expressed in his opinion in Schwartz v. Bowman.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">We affirm the judgments below dismissing the complaint in <em>Annenberg </em>and the complaint as to the defendants-appel-lees in <em>Schwartz </em>on the exhaustive and learned opinion below of Judge Bryan in Schwartz v. Bowman and on his unreported memorandum opinion in Annenberg v. Alleghany.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
