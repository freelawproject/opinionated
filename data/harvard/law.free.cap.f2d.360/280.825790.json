A jury convicted him on all three counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-18\">In this appeal he contends (1) that the evidence introduced at his trial did not support either the information or the conviction that he was an \u201cacceptor\u201d of wagers; (2) that 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7203 applies neither to violations of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4411, nor 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4412; and (3) that there was insufficient evidence of willfulness.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-19\">We' have found that the evidence before the District Court was sufficient to sustain the information and to warrant the jury\u2019s verdict, both as to appellant being an \u201cacceptor\u201d of wagers and his acting in a willful manner. Nor are we persuaded by appellant\u2019s argument that the penalty provisions of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7203 should not apply to violations of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4411 and 4412. See United States v. Goldman, 352 F.2d 263, 265 (3 Cir. 1965); United States v. Shaffer, 291 F.2d 689 (7 Cir.), cert. denied, 368 U.S. 915, 82 S.Ct. 192, 7 L.Ed.2d 130 (1961), rehearing denied, 368 U.S. 962, 82 S.Ct. 392, 7 L.Ed.2d 393 (1962); Contreras v.
