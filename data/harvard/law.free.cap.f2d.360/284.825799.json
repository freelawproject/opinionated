Respondent has moved that the appeal be dismissed because the notice of appeal was not filed until some nineteen days after the judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-25\">The order of the district court, entered April 15, 1965, summarizes the pertinent facts as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-26\">\u201cOn March 24, 1965, the defendant, Joe R. Collier, was convicted by a jury of violation of the White Slave Act, Title 18, U.S.C. Section 2421, and a sentence of one year and one day was imposed, with the defendant to serve five (5) months and being placed on probation for the balance of the sentence. A motion for a new trial was filed on April 2, 1965, and a motion in arrest of judgment was filed on April 9, 1965. A notice of appeal with a motion for bail pending appeal was filed on April 12, 1965.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-27\">\u201cAs provided by Rule 37(2) Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, an appeal must be taken within ten (10) days of entry of judgment of conviction, unless a motion for new trial or a motion in arrest of judgment has been made within the ten (10) day period, in which event the appeal may be taken within ten (10) days after the denial of such motion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>\u201cIn this case, neither the motion for a new trial was timely, see Rule 33 Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, nor was the motion in arrest of judgment timely, see Rule 34 Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The filing of a motion for a new trial and motion in arrest of judgment within the time prescribed by the Rules is mandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">Under the holdings of this court and Rules 33, 34 and 37 (2) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the appeal was not timely. United States v. DeRoc-co, 320 F.2d 58 (C.A.6).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">It is ordered that the petition for writ of mandamus be and hereby is overruled, the motion to dismiss the appeal is sustained and the appeal is dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
