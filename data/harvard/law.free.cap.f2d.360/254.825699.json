The previously regis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>tered mark<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of another is \u201cCHAMPION\u201d for \u201cwhiskey, brandy, gin, rum, and alcoholic cordials.\u201d The respective goods are conceded to be similar.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\">The Trademark Trial and Appeal Board, in affirming the examiner\u2019s refusal to register appellant\u2019s mark, stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-5\">* * * the word \u201cCHAMP\u201d, which constitutes the sole feature of applicant\u2019s mark capable of identifying its goods as to source, is a recognized abbreviation for and hence the legal equivalent of the word \u201cCHAMPION\u201d * * * [citing Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary, 372 (1961)] which constitutes the entire mark of the reference registration. In view thereof, we are clearly of the opinion that the contemporaneous use of these marks for the specified goods would be likely to cause confusion or mistake or to deceive; and this notwithstanding the inherent laudatory connotation of the word \u201cchampion\u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">The solicitor in his brief adopts the reasoning of the board and adds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-8\">As recognized by appellant, its use of \u201cCANADIAN\u201d is merely descriptive of Canadian whiskey * * *. This leaves \u201cCHAMP\u201d as the dominant and suggestive portion of the mark. There is also agreement that \u201cCHAMP\u201d is a slang abbreviation of \u201cCHAMPION\u201d * * *. Such identification, of course, would spontaneously occur to sports \u201cfans,\u201d many of whom drink whiskey. Such a purchaser might well mistakenly assume that \u201cCANADIAN CHAMP\u201d was merely a Canadian whiskey marketed by the \u201cCHAMPION\u201d people.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b309-17\">The theory of appellant\u2019s case is that the board has placed undue emphasis on the term \u201cCHAMP\u201d and has failed to decide the issue of likelihood of confusion considering the respective marks as a whole. Further, appellant argues \u201cCHAMPION\u201d is a weak trademark (citing National Biscuit Co. v. Princeton Mining Co., 137 USPQ 250. 253 (TTAB 1963)),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> self-laudatory in nature, and entitled to but a very limited scope of protection which should not bar appellant\u2019s mark from registration.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-18\"> Where the mark so to be registered has a portion thereof disclaimed, \u201cthose words cannot be ignored in determining the question of confusing similarity.\u201d May Dep\u2019t Stores Co. v. Schloss Bros. &amp; Co., 234 F.2d 879, 881, 43 CCPA 980, citing cases. The marks must be considered in their entireties. Murray Corp. of America v. Red Spot Paint &amp; Varnish Co., 280 F.2d 158, 47 CCPA 1152. The issue of likelihood of confusion must be resolved by comparing \u201cCANADIAN CHAMP\u201d to \u201cCHAMPION.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b309-19\">It is apparent that the only similarity between the above marks resides in a comparison of \u201cCHAMPION\u201d and \u201cCHAMP.\u201d The latter is recognized as a slang term for the former which connotes quality or superiority over like things. \u201cCHAMPION\u201d is, as the board admits, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>self-laudatory term as applied to goods. Considering appellant\u2019s composite mark, it may well be that \u201cCANADIAN,\u201d standing alone, is descriptive when applied to the goods, Canadian whiskey; and that \u201cCHAMP,\u201d like \u201cCHAMPION,\u201d is self-laudatory of the goods. However, considering the composite mark as a whole against the registered mark we do not find a likelihood of confusion between the marks. We think the board erred in placing too much emphasis on \u201cCHAMP\u201d and too little emphasis on the composite mark as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">For the above reasons, the decision of the board is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">Reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">KIRKPATRICK, J., dissents.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b308-31\">.

Aff\u2019d, 338 F.2d 1022, 52 CCPA 844.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b309-12\">. In American Brewing Co. v. Delatour Beverage Corp., 100 F.2d 253, 256, 26 CCPA 778, it is stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-13\">* * * [I]t can not be that an applicant, by combining a technical trademark and descriptive words, neither of which alone would be registrable to him, can produce a composite mark which is registrable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b309-14\">The above statement appears to be somewhat broad in light of the facts of that case. Therein registration was sought for a mark consisting of a representation of the Statue of Liberty and certain words, \u201cno claim being made to the printed words.\u201d 100 F.2d at 254. Cancellation was sought on the basis of a mark consisting of a representation of the Statue of Liberty and certain words. The court, in finding that \u201cconcurrent use of the marks would be likely to deceive purchasers,\u201d expressly considered that the disclaimed words were part of the applicant\u2019s mark. 100 F.2d at 255. The above statement by the court appears to be directed to a particular fact situation not present here and the marks must be looked at as a whole in determining the likelihood of confusion. See Vandenburgh, Trademark Law and Procedure 131, 228 (1959).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b310-7\">ALMOND, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AB-\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">For the reasons stated by the tribunal below, I would affirm its decision finding likelihood of confusion between the subject marks within the meaning of section 2(d) of the Trademark Act of 1946 (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1052(d)).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
