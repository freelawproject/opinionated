Plaintiffs, appellants here, claim rights under state law to use Kings River water on their riparian and overlying lands. Four of the defendant-appellees are employees of the Bureau of Reclamation and Corps of Engineers and are responsible for storing and releasing waters <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>at Pine Flat dam. The remaining defendant-appellees claim rights under state law to use Kings River water on non-riparian lands on the basis of appropriation. Appellants alleged that the appellee government employees and appel-lee water appropriators stored and released water at Pine Flat dam in such a way as to interfere with appellants\u2019 riparian water rights. They sought an injunction. The district court dismissed the action on the complaint alone. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">Appellants attempted to state three causes of action.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">The first cause of action named only the appellee government officials as defendants. It alleged that Pine Flat dam was owned by the United States and was operated by the defendant officials. It alleged that these officials \u201cwrongfully and unlawfully\u201d diverted waters of Kings River to storage in Pine Flat reservoir for irrigation purposes, thus reducing the flow of the river, presenting waters of the river from flowing as they had in a state of nature, and depriving appellants of the reasonable and beneficial use of the waters in violation of their rights as riparian and overlying landowners. Appellee officials were alleged to have exceeded their authority in the following respects: First, it was alleged that they interfered with appellants\u2019 vested water rights under state law contrary to section 8 of the Flood Control Act of 1944, 58 Stat. 891, 43 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 390. Second, it was alleged that they stored water in Pine Flat reservoir for purposes other than flood control without a permit required by sections 225 and 1252 of the Water Code of California, in violation of section 8 of Reclamation Act of 1902, 32 Stat. 390, 43 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 383. And, third, it was alleged that they diverted water to lands held in private ownership by a single owner in excess of 160 irrigable acres, in violation of section 5 of the Reclamation Act of 1902, 32 Stat. 389, 43 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 431, and of section 46 of the Omnibus Adjustment Act of May 25, 1926, 44 Stat. 650, 43 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 423e.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-11\">Appellants\u2019 second cause of action added as defendants the appellee water appropriators and the Kings River Water Association. It alleged that a contract to store and release water at Pine Flat dam was entered into between appellee Dugan, who was \u201cpurporting to act\u201d as Regional Director of the Bureau of Reclamation, and appellee Kings River Conservation District, which was representing the appellee water appropriators. Certain provisions of the contract were alleged in the complaint and are set out below.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It was alleged that pursuant to this con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>tract, the Kings River Water Association voir, and that appellee officials stored notified the United States of the quanti- and released water accordingly. The ties of water the Association desired to second cause of action repeated the al-be stored and released in Pine Flat reser- legation that these diversions adversely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>affected appellants\u2019 water rights. The diversions were alleged to be beyond the authority of the appellee officials for the three reasons stated in the first cause of action, and for the additional reason that the appellee officials were prohibited from contracting with local interests for operation of the reservoir by section 10 of the Flood Control Act of 1944, 58 Stat. 901.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">Appellants\u2019 third cause of action was one to quiet title to their water rights under state law. It was alleged to be within the district court\u2019s pendent jurisdiction.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">The district court dismissed the complaint because the United States was an indispensable party, and because it had not consented to be sued in the district court for injunctive relief. Leave was granted to file an amended complaint under the McCarran Act, 66 Stat. 560, 43 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 666, joining the United States as a defendant and seeking an adjudication of all water rights in the Kings River. Appellants declined to replead, and the action was dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">The district court did not determine whether the alleged acts of appellee officials were within their authority. Instead, the court stated that even if their conduct were unauthorized the suit could not be maintained in the absence of the United States because the injunction which the appellants sought \u201cwould inevitably restrain the Government from acting or require [it] to act in such a way as to deprive it of the full use and control of its facilities at the dam.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">The United States urges us to affirm on the same basis. It relies upon Chief Justice Vinson\u2019s statement in footnote 11 of his opinion in Larson v. Domestic &amp; Foreign Commerce Corp., 337 U.S. 682, 691, 69 S.Ct. 1457, 1462, 93 L.Ed. 1628 (1949), that \u201ca suit may fail, as one against the sovereign, even if it is claimed that the officer being sued has acted unconstitutionally or beyond his statutory powers, if the relief requested cannot be granted by merely ordering the cessation of the conduct complained of but will require affirmative action by the sovereign or the disposition of unquestionably sovereign property.\u201d The government argues from this, and from its reading of Dugan v. Rank, 372 U.S. 609, 83 S.Ct. 999, 10 L.Ed.2d 15 (1963), that there exists a broad rule that a suit may not be maintained against government officers for unauthorized or unconstitutional acts if the relief would \u201cexpend itself on the property of the United States\u201d or would \u201crequire affirmative action by the sovereign.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b243-12\">Giving full scope to Justice Vinson\u2019s statement, it does not control this case. Appellants\u2019 water rights could be fully protected simply by enjoining the government officials from interfering with the natural flow of the river to the extent necessary to satisfy those rights. And such an injunction would not involve \u201cthe disposition of unquestionably sovereign property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b243-13\">Moreover, we think the Supreme Court\u2019s more recent statement of the rule in Dugan v. Rank, 372 U.S. 609, 83 S.Ct. 999 (1963), casts doubt upon Justice Vinson\u2019s formulation, at least as broadened by the government\u2019s argument here. In Dugan v. Rank Justice Clark said, \u201cThe general rule is that a suit is against the sovereign if \u2018the judgment sought would expend itself on the public treasury or domain, or interfere with the public administration,\u2019 or if the effect of the judgment would be \u2018to restrain the Government from acting, or to compel it to act.\u2019 \u201d 372 U.S. at 620, 83 S.Ct. at 1006.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Justice Clark analyzed the decree entered by the district court in Dugan v. Rank in the light of this \u201cgeneral rule\u201d and concluded that the decree \u201coperates against the United States.\u201d He then continued, \u201cNor do we believe that the action of the Reclamation Bureau officials falls within either of the recognized exceptions to the above general rule * * *. Those exceptions are (1) action by officers beyond <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>their statutory powers and (2) even though within the scope of their authority, the powers themselves or the manner in which they are exercised are constitutionally void. In either of such cases the officer\u2019s action \u2018can be made the basis of a suit for specific relief against the officer as an individual.\u2019 \u201d 372 U.S. at 621-622, 83 S.Ct. at 1007 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">We conclude from this that although the relief sought may be such that under the \u201cgeneral rule\u201d a suit would appear to be one against the sovereign, the action is nonetheless maintainable against government officers under the two \u201cexceptions\u201d to the \u201cgeneral rule\u201d if the acts of the officers were prohibited by statute or the Constitution. See also Malone v. Bowdoin, 369 U.S. 643, 647-648, 82 S.Ct. 980, 8 L.Ed.2d 168 (1962); Boesche v. Udall, 373 U.S. 472, 476-477, 83 S.Ct. 1373, 10 L.Ed.2d 491 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">We would hesitate the more to bar this suit on the ground urged by the government in view of the recent history of Ickes v. Fox, 300 U.S. 82, 57 S.Ct. 412, 81 L.Ed. 525 (1937). That case held that the United States was not an indispensable party to a suit to enjoin the Secretary of Interior from enforcing an allegedly unauthorized order interfering with plaintiffs\u2019 vested rights to water from a reclamation project. Some doubt was cast upon this holding in Larson v. Domestic &amp; Foreign Commerce Corp., supra, 337 U.S. at 702, n. 26, 69 S.Ct. 1457. But as recently as Arizona v. California, 373 U.S. 546, 585, 83 S.Ct. 1468, 10 L.Ed.2d 542 (1963), Ickes v. Fox again was cited by the Supreme Court in support of a broad power of judicial review of unauthorized acts of the Secretary of Interior in contracting for the distribution of water. See also State of Nebraska v. State of Wyoming, 325 U.S. 589, 612-616, 65 S.Ct. 1332, 89 L.Ed. 1815 (1945).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-13\">We must therefore decide whether the alleged acts of appellee officials exceeded their statutory authority in the respects alleged by appellants.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b244-14\"><em>First </em>Appellants\u2019 most impressive contention is that the statute providing for the construction and operation of Pine Flat dam did not authorize the taking of appellants\u2019 water rights, but, on the contrary, imposed an affirmative duty upon government officials to refrain from interfering with those rights. We reject the argument \u2014 though not without doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-15\">Appellants rely upon language in the preamble and in section 8 of the Flood Control Act of 1944, 58 Stat. 887. The preamble of the Act announces that it is the policy of Congress to recognize state interests in water utilization and to protect \u201cestablished and potential uses\u201d of the nation\u2019s rivers. It provides that use of water \u201cfor navigation\u201d shall not conflict with \u201cpresent or future\u201d use \u201cfor domestic, municipal, stock water, irrigation, mining, or industrial purposes.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Section 8 of the Act is set out in full below.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number><footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Appellants rely upon a clause appearing in the third sentence, which reads \u201cbut the foregoing requirement shall not prejudice lawful uses now existing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">Appellants argue that this language of the preamble and section 8 of the Flood Control Act of 1944 means that appellee officials were not to interfere with appellants\u2019 water rights in the construction and operation of projects authorized by the Act, including Pine Flat dam.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">Appellants point out that extensive reports on the proposed Pine Flat project were submitted to Congress by the Corps of Engineers (H.R.Doc. No. 630, 76th Cong., 3d Sess.) and the Bureau of Reclamation (H.R.Doc. No. 631, 76th Cong., 3d sess.). These reports informed Congress that Kings River basin was highly developed; that an elaborate and substantially complete irrigation system, constructed and operated by private local interests, was already in existence; and that water rights in the area were complex and involved, and covered all available water.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Bureau of Reclamation recommended that these water rights \u201cremain unchanged and unaffected\u201d (H.R. Doc. No. 631, 76th Cong., 3d sess., p. 12). The Corps of Engineers recommended that responsibility for the operation of irrigation aspects of the project be placed in the hands of the \u201clocal interests.\u201d H. R.Doc. No. 630, 76th Cong., 3d sess., p. 4). Neither report proposed (expressly, at least) that water rights be acquired by the United States; nor did later reports, containing cost estimates for the project. See H.R.Doc. No. 367, 81st Cong., 1st sess., p. 4, and H.R.Doc. No. 136, 80th Cong., 1st sess., p. 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-11\">Appellants also point out that the contract between the United States and Kings River Water District (note 2, supra) required the district to recognize existing water rights and agree \u201cnot to interfere therewith or do anything in prejudice thereof.\u201d Par. 8(d). They call attention to a letter addressed to appellants by the Secretary of Interior on November 21, 1962, referring to this provision of the contract, and stating, \u201cThe law under which these contracts are authorized does not contemplate interference with valid and existing rights of non-contracting parties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b245-12\">Finally appellants suggest that the present case differs in a number of respects from Dugan v. Rank, 372 U.S. 609\u201e 83 S.Ct. 999 (1963), the government\u2019s; principal authority. They argue that in <em>Rank </em>the need to acquire private water rights was more obvious, and, unlike the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>present case, the government had requested and obtained appropriations from Congress to acquire private water rights, 372 U.S. at 613-614, 83 S.Ct. 999. Moreover, the statutory authorization for physical seizure of private water rights was substantially clearer in <em>Rank </em>than in the present case.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">As persuasive as these factors may appear to be, on balance we think they are outweighed by those which support the conclusion that appellee officials were authorized to interfere with appellants\u2019 rights in the manner alleged in the complaint, and that appellants\u2019 remedy was not an action in the district court for an injunction but a suit in the Court of Claims for damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">Section 8 of the Flood Control Act of 1944 authorizes the Secretary of Interior to operate and maintain structures such as Pine Flat dam \u201cunder the provisions of the Federal Reclamation laws (Act of June 17, 1902, 32 Stat. 388 and Acts amendatory or supplementary thereto),\u201d thus making section 7 of the Reclamation Act of 1902, 32 Stat. 389, 43 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 421, applicable to the irrigation features of the Pine Flat project. See 41 Op.A.G. 377; Inter-University Case Program Committee on Public Administration Cases, The Kings River Project in the Basin of the Great Central Valley 44-47 (1949); Maas, 38 Calif.L.Rev. 666, 688 (1950); Taylor, 46 Colum.L.Rev. 153, 166-70 (1958); see also Graham, 38 Calif.L.Rev. 588, 629-30 (1950). Section 7 of the Reclamation Act of 1902, 32 Stat. 389, 43 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 421, provides that in carrying out the Federal Reclamation laws the Secretary of the Interior may \u201cacquire any rights or property,\u201d \u201cby purchase or by condemnation under judicial process.\u201d We held in State of Cal. v. Rank, 293 F.2d 340, 354-355 (9th Cir. 1961), that this authorization extends to the taking of private water rights by physical seizure as well as by purchase or formal condemnation.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Appellants concede as much. Their argument, in effect, is that the preamble and section 8 of the Flood Control Act of 1944 are savings clauses intended to except the Pine Flat dam and other projects authorized by the Flood Control Act of 1944 from the grant of eminent domain in section 7 of the Reclamation Act of 1902.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-11\">The provision of the preamble upon which appellants rely (58 Stat. 887, 33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 701-1) would appear to mean only \u201cthat in the operation of * * [projects authorized by the Act] the use of water for navigation will be subordinate to present and future beneficial consumptive uses \u2014 in other words, irrigation ditches will never be closed to supply water to float barges.\u201d Trelease, 69 Wyo.L.J. 189, 196 (1965) <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Appellants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>do not allege that Pine Flat water is being used in aid of navigation. Use for this purpose was not contemplated. See S.Doc. No. 113, 81st Cong., 1st sess., p. 169; H.R.Doe. No. 631, 76th Cong., 3d sess., p. 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">While the words of the preamble of the Act may indeed reflect a concern that state-created private water rights be protected, the hazard sought to be avoided was not that federal officers would take such rights by eminent domain, in return for just compensation. Rather, the language was intended to prohibit destruction of state-created water rights without any compensation at all, by the assertion of an overriding federal easement for navigation. See Trelease, 69 Wyo. L.J. 189, 196, 198-99, 200-02, 1965. See also United States v. Gerlach Live Stock Co., 339 U.S. 725, 731-742, 70 S.Ct. 955, 94 L.Ed. 1231 (1950); see generally, Morreale, 3 Natural Resources Jnl. 1 (1963); Trelease, 10 Buffalo L.Rev. 399, 405-06 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">The language of section 8 of the Flood Control Act of 1944 is also inappropriate to express the purpose that private water rights were not to be taken. As appears from the context, the clause, \u201cbut the foregoing requirement shall not prejudice lawful uses,\u201d refers to existing uses to which War Department projects were being devoted at the time the Act was passed. The clause was intended to relieve these arrangements for use, which antedated the Act, from the new requirement that \u201cDams and reservoirs operated under the direction of the Secretary of War may be utilized hereafter for irrigation purposes only in conformity with the provisions of this section.\u201d This language does not suggest that Congress had in mind protection of individual water rights as such,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> nor that Congress intended to prohibit the taking of private water rights by eminent domain if that became necessary in the operation of a project.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-10\">Moreover, the natural reading of the language limits its application to dams and reservoirs in existence when the Act was passed. This would exclude the Pine Flat project without more, for it had not then been built. The legislative history supports this construction. As it originally passed the House, the provision of the Flood Control Act of 1944 which became section 8 did not contain the eleven-word clause upon which appellants now rely. Instead, it ended with a proviso reading \u201cThat this section shall not apply to any dam or reservoir <em>heretofore </em>constructed which supplements any existing locally operated irrigation districts.\u201d See Hearings Before Senate Subcommittee on Commerce on H.R. 4485, 78th Cong., 2d sess., p. 2. (Emphasis added.) The present language, including the words \u201cbut the foregoing requirement shall not prejudice lawful uses now existing,\u201d was substituted at the suggestion of the Secretary of Interior, for \u201ctechnical\u201d reasons, and not to alter the section\u2019s meaning. Hearings Before Senate Committee on Commerce on H.R. 4485, 78th Cong., 2d sess., pp. 313, 458.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Thus, the disputed clause was intended to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>have the same effect as the earlier language, which was to exclude from the operation of the section dams and reservoirs constructed before the Act was adopted.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> This interpretation is further supported by the fact that the Senate specifically rejected an amendment which would have made the section inapplicable to any dam <em>\u201cheretofore or hereafter </em>constructed which supplements any existing locally operated irrigation system or other locally operated water facilities * * 90 Cong.Rec. 8550 (1944). (Emphasis added.)<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">Appellants argue that a construction which limits application of the clause in question to dams in existence when the Act was passed would render the present proviso of section 8 superfluous. But the proviso and the disputed clause do not say precisely the same thing. As we have seen, the clause applies to \u201cuses now existing\u201d of an existing dam and reservoir. The proviso, on the other hand, applies to an existing dam and reservoir \u201cwhich provides conservation storage of water for irrigation purposes\u201d \u2014 without regard to whether this storage space was actually committed to a particular use at the time the Act was passed. The present proviso was added as a floor amendment for the express purpose of assuring that section 8 would not apply to the Caddoa project on the Arkansas River, where the dam was in existence and storage space for conservation purposes had been built into the project, but the particular use of this space had not been finally determined because of a dispute between the states of Kansas and Colorado.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b248-12\">Finally, we note that the Supreme Court refused to read a prohibition against taking private water rights by eminent domain into much stronger language. Section 8 of the Reclamation Act of 1902, 32 Stat. 390, 43 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 383, provides that \u201cnothing in this act shall be construed * * * to in any way interfere with the laws of any State or Territory relating to the * * * distribution of water used in irrigation, or any vested right acquired thereunder and the Secre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>tary of Interior * * * shall proceed in conformity with such laws, and nothing herein shall affect any right * * * of any landowner, appropriator, or user of water in, to, or from any interstate stream or the waters thereof.\u201d The Supreme Court held that this language requires federal officers to recognize state-created water rights and pay for them if taken, but that it did not limit the authority of federal officers to take such rights for just compensation. City of Fresno v. State of California, 372 U.S. 627, 629-630, 83 S.Ct. 996, 10 L.Ed.2d 28 (1963); Ivanhoe Irr. Dist. v. Mc-Cracken, 357 U.S. 275, 291, 78 S.Ct. 1174, 2 L.Ed.2d 1313 (1958), and, by implication, Dugan v. Rank, 372 U.S. 609, 619-623, 83 S.Ct. 999, 10 L.Ed.2d 15 (1963), and United States v. Gerlach Live Stock Co., 339 U.S. 725, 739-740, 70 S.Ct. 955 (1950). See also State of Arizona v. State of California, 373 U.S. 546, 586-587, 83 S.Ct. 1468, 10 L.Ed.2d 542 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">Turning from the statutory language, we think the reports which the Corps of Engineers and Bureau of Reclamation submitted to the Congress proposing the Pine Flat project (H.R. Docs. Nos. 630 and 631, 76th Cong., 3d sess.) support the conclusion that Congress intended appellee officials to operate the Pine Flat facilities essentially as they are alleged to have operated them \u2014 by way of contracts with local water users; and we find no convincing evidence that Congress intended to prohibit absolutely any interference by appellee officials with downstream riparian rights incident to such operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">As we have said (note 9 and related text), both reports informed Congress that all available Kings River water was in use by local irrigation interests; and both reports advised Congress to entrust control of irrigation to local interests, and leave local water rights unaffected. The Corps of Engineers report stated, \u201cWater of the Kings River is completely appropriated and is used by controlling interests in accordance with a well-established agreement administered by a watermaster. Years of litigation prior to the establishment of this agreement demonstrated the virtual impossibility of an adjudicated settlement of conflicting rights and therefore its provisions have practically the effect of law.\u201d H.R. Doc. No. 630, 76th Cong., 3d sess., p. 7. The agreement referred to was described in great detail in the Reclamation Bureau Report. H.R. Doc. No. 631, 76th Cong., 3d sess., pp. 12-14.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Both reports recommended that this agreement, and the formula and mechanism which it established for the distribution of Kings River water, be utilized in the operation of the Pine Flat project. H.R. Doc. No. 630, p. 10; H.R. Doc. No. 631, pp. 11-12. See also Hearings Before House Committee on Flood Control on H.R. 4485, 78th Cong., 2d sess., p. 739. The contract between the United States and the Kings River Conservation District (note 2 and related text) follows this recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">It was clear from both reports that claims based upon interference with the right of downstream riparian owners to use of the natural flow of the river were to be expected. The Corps of Engineers pointed to \u201ca definite need for regulating stream flow in the interests of irrigation\u201d as well as for flood control; and set out a detailed plan for operation of the proposed reservoir which contemplated marked alteration of the normal regime of the river. H.R. Doc. No. 630, pp. 8-9. The Bureau of Reclamation report advised Congress that some water rights were in dispute, that not all claimants had assented to the indenture agreement among the local interests, and that a part of the flow was simply left unappor-tioned to be utilized by non-participating claimants \u201cin a hit or miss fashion.\u201d H.R. Doc. No. 631, pp. 12-15. It was contemplated that water releases would conform to vested irrigation rights, not invariably, but \u201cexcept in rare cases.\u201d H.R. Doc. No. 631, p. V.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>Admittedly, appellee officers were authorized to operate the irrigation phases of the project. We conclude from the contents of the two reports that they were also authorized to contract with the appellee local irrigation interests as they did. We think it must follow that they were authorized to act despite claims of interference with downstream riparian rights which were an inevitable consequence of the exercise of their authority.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">There is no doubt that the reports of both the Corps of Engineers and the Bureau of Reclamation indicated that private water rights were to be recognized and, so far as possible, left undisturbed. As Congress was aware, this much was required by both agencies as a matter of administrative policy. H.R. Doc. No. 367, 81st Cong., 1st sess., p. 5 (Corps of Engineers policy). Hearings Before House Committee on Flood Control on H.R. 4485, 78th Cong., 1st sess., p. 642; 90 Cong. Rec. 4133-34 (1944); United States v. Gerlach Live Stock Corp., 339 U.S. 725, 734-736, 70 S.Ct. 955, 94 L. Ed. 1231 (1950) (Bureau of Reclamation policy). Reaffirmation of this policy as applied to Pine Flat could not reasonably be taken as a recommendation by these agencies that they be absolutely prohibited from interfering with private water rights where, as here, that course might be necessary, indeed inevitable, in operating the project as planned.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Power to take private water rights was found in <em>Gerlach </em>(339 U.S. at 739-740, 70 S.Ct. 955) despite similar assurances to Congress that private water rights would be protected.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">We find support for the conclusion that Congress did not intend to deny the power of inverse condemnation to appellee officers by the consequences of a contrary holding. If the officers had no authority to take downstream water rights it might be doubtful whether claimants injured in the daily operations of the project would have a remedy in damages against the United States. Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 585, 72 S.Ct. 863, 96 L.Ed. 1153 (1952). Suits for injunctive relief, such as this, would be proper, and might be expected to arise with some frequency in connection with the operation of a project like Pine Flat dam. Determining whether the remedy for official interference with property in particular situations shall be by way of suits for damages, or by way of \u201cdirect judicial interference\u201d with government operations, \u201cis a function of Congress.\u201d Larson v. Domestic &amp; Foreign Commerce Corp., 337 U.S. 682, 705, 69 S.Ct. 1457 (1949); Jaffe, 77 Harv.L.Rev. 1, 39 (1963). It seems unlikely that Congress preferred the latter remedy in the present situation. Strong policy considerations favor the damage remedy (337 U.S. at 704, 69 S.Ct. 1457), particularly where, as in this case, the right to compensation would appear to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>be an adequate remedy (United States v. Gerlach Live Stock Co., 339 U.S. 725, 752, 70 S.Ct. 955 (1950)), and injunctive relief might interfere with a continuing government program and impede the accomplishment of important government ends. Larson, 337 U.S. at 704, 69 S.Ct. 1457; Hurley v. Kincaid, 285 U.S- 95, 104, 52 S.Ct. 267, 76 L.Ed. 637 (1932); 3 Davis, Administrative Law \u00a7 27.01, p. 146 (1965 Supp.)</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">The adoption of the McCarran Amendment, 66 Stat. 560, 43 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 666, consenting to the joinder of the United States as a defendant in an equitable action \u201cfor the adjudication of rights to the use of water of a river system or other source,\u201d indicates that Congress did not intend to expose government irrigation projects to the possibility of interruption by individual private injunctive suits to determine water rights. As we noted in State of Cal. v. Rank, 293 F.2d 340, 347 (9th Cir. 1961), the pertinent Senate report reproduces an exchange of correspondence between Senators Magnuson and McCarran which is explicit on this point.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b251-17\">Second. We turn to the second ground upon which appellants urge that appellee officers acted without authority: namely, that they stored water in Pine Flat reservoir for irrigation purposes without first obtaining a permit required by state statute. Appellants recognize that \u201cnothing in \u00a7 8 [of the Reclamation Act of 1902] * * * compels the United States to <em>deliver </em>water on conditions imposed by the State\u201d \u2014 a concession required by Ivanhoe Irr. Dist. v. McCracken, 357 U.S. 275, 292, 78 S.Ct. 1174, 1184, 2 L.Ed.2d 1313 (1958). See also State of Arizona v. State of California, 373 U.S. 546, 585-588, 83 S.Ct. 1468, 10 L.Ed.2d 542 (1963). They contend, however, that the language used by the Court in <em>Ivanhoe </em>indicates that the government is required to comply with state law in <em>acquiring </em>water rights.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Appellants suggest no reason for the distinction they urge. In any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>event, if there was doubt it is dispelled by the Court\u2019s statement in City of Fresno v. State of California, 372 U.S. 627, 630, 83 S.Ct. 996, 998, 10 L.Ed.2d 28 (1963), that <em>Ivanhoe </em>settled the proposition that section 8 of the Reclamation Act of 1902 \u201cdoes not mean that state law may operate to prevent the United States from exercising the power of eminent domain to acquire the water rights of others.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">We must agree with the government that \u201creason precludes an interpretation of the general provisions of Section 8 of the Reclamation Act [of 1902] and Sections 1 and 8 of the Flood Control Act [of 1944] which would impute to Congress an intention to frustrate its plans for this project by subjecting it to the risk that it might never be used for some of the authorized purposes, should a state permit not be forthcoming.\u201d Compare Anderson v. Seeman, 252 F.2d 321, 324 (5th Cir. 1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\"><em>Third. </em>Appellants\u2019 third contention is that appellee officials acted unlawfully in delivering water from Pine Flat project before contracts were executed with recipients of the water providing for repayment of construction costs and for sale of lands in excess of 160 acres owned by a single recipient, as required by section 46 of the Omnibus Adjustment Act of 1926, 44 Stat. 649, 43 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 423e, and section 5 of the Reclamation Act of 1902, 32 Stat. 389, 43 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 431. Assuming that these statutes imposed the limitation upon the authority of appellee officials which appellants suggest and that appellee officials failed to comply, appellants cannot assert a right in themselves to injunctive relief on this ground. The injury which appellants claim was not caused by a violation of this limitation. The officials might have complied fully with the statutes, yet continued to store and release water from Pine Flat reservoir exactly as appellants allege they did, and with precisely the same injury to appellants\u2019 water rights. Moreover, the statutes imposed a duty upon the Secretary of Interior in the interest of the public at large, and there is nothing in the statutes to indicate that Congress intended to confer a litigable right upon private persons claiming injury from the Secretary\u2019s failure to discharge his duty to the public. Compare Perkins v. Lukens Steel Co., 310 U.S. 113, 125-127, 60 S.Ct. 869, 84 L.Ed. 1108 (1940). See generally, Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee v. McGrath, 341 U.S. 123, 150-153, 71 S.Ct. 624, 95 L.Ed. 817 (1951) (Justice Frankfurter concurring) .<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b252-9\"><em>Fourth. </em>Finally, appellants challenge the contractual arrangements for the operation of Pine Flat dam between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>appellee officials and local irrigation interests. See note 2. They recognize that the execution of such a contract was contemplated by H.R. Doc. No. 630 \u2014 the Corps of Engineers report. However, they point to the language of section 10 of the Flood Control Act of 1944, 58 Stat. 901, which authorizes construction in accordance with the plans contained in H.R. Doc. No. 630, \u201cProvided, That the conditions of local cooperation specified in said document shall not apply.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Passing appellants\u2019 standing to raise the issue, it seems clear that they misread the proviso. A reading of H.R. Doc. No. 630, 78th Cong., 3d sess., p. 5, indicates that \u201cthe conditions of local cooperation,\u201d which were not to apply, related to obtaining assurances from state or local agencies for initial financing of the project and for maintenance and operation of the facility after completion as a condition precedent to the commencement of construction. The two subsequent provisos confirm the conclusion that this was the subject Congress had in mind. See 41 Op.A.G. 377, 382 (1958). It would be surprising indeed if Congress meant to bar use of the type of contractual arrangement involved here. Contracts of this type are expressly authorized by the Federal Reclamation laws,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> and are common. Maass, 38 Calif.L.Rev. 666, 671 (1950).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">Appellants argue that in any event their second cause of action (and the third cause of action pendent to it) should not have been dismissed as to the defendants other than appellee officials. We are satisfied that there was no basis for federal jurisdiction of appellants\u2019 second cause of action which did not require the presence of the United States: diversity of citizenship was lacking; and the interests of the United States were inextricably involved in all of appellants\u2019 claims arising under federal statutes.

The legislative history of this and other amendments is reviewed in 41 Op.A.G. 377, 389-94, with the following conclusion: \u201cIt will be recalled that these amendments had as one of their purposes exemption from the reclamation laws of projects in areas where private irrigation systems already existed. At no point in the discussion of those amendments was it ever suggested that this proposal was in fact incorporated in the bill, and the subsequent statements of Senator Over-ton, made in the course of the discussion of the Murray amendments, are clearly to the contrary.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b248-14\">. Senator Millikin, who proposed the amendment, explained his purpose in these words (90 Cong.Rec. 8552 (1944)):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-15\">\u201cI should like to explain the purpose of that amendment. It is in the O\u2019Maho-ney amendment, but was not in the bill as it came from the House. In the late 1930s an able Representative from Colorado initiated the steps which resulted in a so-called Caddoa Dam on the Arkansas River. It was an odd project, in which irrigation storage was planned and built into it from the beginning, but there were no provisions in the enabling law as to how that storage should be financed, or how it should be handled. Since then there has been a water dispute between the State of Kansas and the State of Colorado involving, among other things, the waters stored in that reservoir. So we do not wish to do anything here that could possibly prejudice these situations. The language which I have proposed will protect them.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b249-9\">.

Rep.No.755, 82d Cong., 1st sess., p. 6):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-14\">\u201cSenator Magnuson raised the question as to whether S. 18 could be used for the purpose of delaying or blocking a multiple-purpose development such as proposed for the Hells Canyon project on the Snake River in the Columbia Basin or other similar projects, stating that there was a possibility of an individual or group having water rights on that stream bringing suits to adjudicate their respective rights and therefore preventing the Bureau of Reclamation from going ahead with the Hells Canyon project while litigation is in process or pending. The committee, for the legislative history of this bill, definitely desires to repudiate any such intent which may be deduced from S. 18 and states that this is not the purpose and the intent of this legislation. Where reclamation projects have been authorized for the benefit of the water users and the public generally, they should proceed under the law as it exists at the present time and should the Government have reason to need the water of any particular user on a stream, that water should be obtained by condemnation proceeding as is already provided for by law.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b251-19\">. \u201cAs we read \u00a7 8, it merely requires the United States to comply with state law when, in the construction and operation of a reclamation project, it becomes necessary for it <em>to acquire </em>water rights or vested interests therein. But the acquisition of water rights must not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>be confused with the operation of federal projects. As the Court said in State of Nebraska v. State of Wyoming, supra, 325 U.S. at page 615 [65 S.Ct. 1332, 89 L.Ed. 1815] : We do not suggest that where Congress has provided a system of regulation for federal projects it must give way before an inconsistent state system.\u2019 Section. 5 is a specific and mandatory prerequisite laid down by the Congress as binding in the operation of reclamation projects, providing that \u2018 [n] o right to the use of wafer * * * shall be sold for a tract exceeding one hundred and sixty acres to any one landowner * * *.\u2019 We read nothing in \u00a7 8 that compels the United States <em>to deliver </em>water on conditions imposed by the State. To read \u00a7 8 to the contrary would require the Secretary to violate \u00a7 5, the provisions of which, as we shall see, have been national policy for over balf a century.\u201d (Emphasis added.)

Iowa State Commerce Commission, 253 Iowa 1143, 114 N.W.2d 622, 625 (1962)), and certainly the property owner, has standing to raise.
