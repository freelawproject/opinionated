The action was clearly referable to arbitration under an agreement incorporated by reference into the contract between the parties. The only issue is whether the District Court erred in holding appellant \u201cin default in proceeding with such arbitration.\u201d 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 3. We think not.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-11\">The right to arbitration, like any other contract right, can be waived.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A party waives his right to arbitrate when he actively participates in a lawsuit or takes other action inconsistent with that right.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Once having waived the right to arbitrate, that party is necessarily \u201cin default in proceeding with such arbitration.\u201d <footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b567-16\">Before filing the present motion, appellant (1) moved for a transfer of venue to the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, (2) filed an answer to appellee\u2019s complaint and a counterclaim, and (3) filed notice of depositions, took the deposition of an official of appellee, and procured the production of various records and documents. As the District Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-17\">[T]he litigation machinery had been substantially invoked and the parties were well into the preparation of a lawsuit by the time (some four months after the complaint was filed) an intention to arbitrate was communicated by the defendant to the plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b567-18\">Appellant claims, however, that it did not learn of the arbitration clause until the above-mentioned production of documents. Absent fraud or concealment, which are not asserted here, appellant must be charged with knowledge of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>the terms of its own agreement. Otherwise, lack of diligence would become an excuse for the \u201cdilatoriness or delay\u201d which Congress meant to discourage.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b567-12\">. \u201cIf any suit or proceeding be brought in any of the courts of the United States upon any issue referable to arbitration under an agreement in writing for such arbitration, the court in which such suit is pending, upon being satisfied that the issue involved in such suit or proceeding is referable to arbitration under such an agreement, shall on application of one of the parties stay the trial of the action until such arbitration has been had in accordance with the terms of the agreement, providing the applicant for the stay is not in default in proceeding with such arbitration.\u201d 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 3 (1964).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b567-13\">.
