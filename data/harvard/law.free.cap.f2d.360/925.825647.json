Townsend v. Ogilvie, 334 F.2d 837 (7th Cir. 1964), cert. denied, 379 U.S. 984, 85 S.Ct. 683, 13 L.Ed.2d 574 (1965). Following the denial of certiorari by the Supreme Court, the mandate of this court issued directing the district court to dismiss the petition. The petitioner subsequently sought leave in the district court to amend his petition to set forth grounds not theretofore presented. The district court refused to permit amendment, stating that it had no power with respect to the petition before it to deviate from the mandate issued by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-24\"> The district court was correct. E. g., Briggs v. Pennsylvania R. R., 334 U.S. 304, 306, 68 S.Ct. 1039, 92 L.Ed. 1403 (1948). Therefore, regardless of the views we might have concerning the merits of the new grounds advanced or whether another petition might be con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"926\">*926</page-number>sidered an abuse of the writ, we are limited to determining whether the district court complied with the mandate. Since its order was entered in exact accordance with the mandate, this appeal cannot be maintained. Stewart v. Salamon, 97 U.S. 361, 24 L.Ed. 1044 (1878); Lack v. Western Loan &amp; Bldg. Co., 155 F.2d 1020 (9th Cir. 1946).</p>\n<p id=\"b980-4\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b979-16\">.
