The contract recited that it was subject to the purchasers\u2019 being able to obtain a first deed of trust of One Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars, with an interest rate of 6 per cent, within thirty days of ratification of the contract. The contract was not consummated, and a civil action was instituted to recover the deposit. After trial, the District Court found that the defendants had not exerted reasonable efforts under all the circumstances to secure a first trust loan of $150,000. Upon that basis the court ordered that the deposit be turned over to the proposed sellers. We think the finding is not clearly erroneous and the conclusion based thereon is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-24\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
