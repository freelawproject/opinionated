BROWN, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b775-14\">The question here is whether the previous timely filing of a creditor\u2019s claim in a Chapter XI proceeding for an arrangement constitutes a filing within the time prescribed in the Judge\u2019s subsequent order under \u00a7 196, 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 596, upon the proceeding being transmuted into one under Chapter X for corporate reorganization. The District Court held in the negative. Rejecting the claims of appellants as not timely filed and allowed, the result was that the approval of the plan by this particular class of creditors exceeded the statutory two-thirds. The plan was approved. We agree and affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b775-16\">As the whole problem is one of timeliness, dates, although the subject of no dispute, do count. On July 31, 1961, Equitable,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> as debtor, filed a voluntary petition for an arrangement under Chapter XI.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> By proper notice, \u00a7\u00a7 334-336, 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 734-736, the meeting was fixed for August 18,1961, for creditors to \u201cattend, prove their claims, nominate a trustee, * * *, present written acceptances of the proposed arrangement, and transact * * * other business.\u201d Simultaneously, application to confirm the arrangement was to be filed by and heard on August 23, 1961. Although Chapter XI contemplates a \u201cplan of a debtor for the settlement, satisfaction, or extension of the time of payment of his <em>unsecured debts,\u201d </em>\u00a7\u00a7 306(1), 307, 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 706(1), 707, appellants Avery and Stoy each filed on August 18 a formal verified proof of claim stating the debt was \u201c * * * evidenced by a (note) * * * attached and made a part\u201d thereof which, with other attachments, revealed that the debt on its face was secured, certainly in substantial part.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b776-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>Subsequently, on the hearing February 19, 1962, the Referee found that while a majority in amount and number of creditors voted for the proposed Chapter XI plan of arrangement, the debtor had failed to file an application to confirm and had now announced that it could not dp. so .since \u201cit did not have sufficient <em>money to so do.\u201d </em>Cf. \u00a7 337(2), (3), 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 737(2), (3). Consequently, the Referee concluded it was in the best interest of the creditors that the matter proceed \u201cpursuant to the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act.\u201d See \u00a7 376(2), 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 776(2). On February 23, 1962, Equitable was adjudged a bankrupt. The first creditors\u2019 meeting was held March 12, 1962.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\">On July 6, 1962, an order was entered authorizing Equitable to proceed as a petitioning corporation under Chapter X. And here of crucial importance there was also entered the July 6 \u201cOrder Fixing Time and Manner Approving Claims and Interest\u201d.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The order required that by September 15,1962, claims be filed with the Referee, with a copy sent to the Trustee at the Trustee\u2019s office. Also pursuant to the order, notice was given<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> to all creditors and interest holders.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-14\">Notwithstanding the order and notice, these appellants did nothing It rounds out the picture to state that on October 21, 1964, a Special Master in the Chapter X proceedings reported that the Third Amended Plan of Reorganization was accepted by the required number of class <em>7</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>creditors. Not counted were the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>claims of these appellants. On review the District Court overruled appellants\u2019 objections and entered the order confirming the Plan of Reorganization.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">Of course the statute is as plain as it could be. It directs that \u201cthe judge shall prescribe the manner in which and fix a time within which the proofs of claim of creditors * * * may be filed and allowed.\u201d \u00a7 196,11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 596.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">To overcome this positive language and the uncontradicted fact that between the date of the order (July 6, 1962) and the cutoff date (September 15, 1962) no proof of claim was filed with the Referee, the Trustee or both, the appellants assert that \u00a7 196 authorized the Judge to prescribe the <em>termination </em>date of the September 15, 1962, but not the <em>commencement </em>date. For this theory they rely on West Hills Memorial Park v. Doneca, 9 Cir., 1942, 131 F.2d 374, and In re Keller, N.D.Cal., 1954, 120 F.Supp. 275, construing the phrases \u201cwithin six months\u201d and \u201cwithin thirty days\u201d of \u00a7 57 (n), 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 93(n).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In <em>West Hills </em>the Court states that \u201c[w]hile the statute specifies the outer limit of time within which a claim must be filed * * *, it does not specify the earliest time when a claim can be filed,\u201d and consequently, \u201ca claim may be filed whenever the proceedings are pending but within the statutory limitation above indicated.\u201d 131 F.2d at 377. In <em>Keller </em>the District Court phrased it this way: \u201cThe term \u2018within\u2019 as defined in numerous cases set forth in 45 Words and Phrases, Cumulative Pocket Part, means \u2018not longer in time than\u2019 or \u2018not later than.\u2019 \u2018Within\u2019 does not fix the first point of time, but the limit beyond which action may not b\u00e9 taken.\u201d 120 F.Supp. at 275. Thus, the Court allowed a claim, filed more than six months after the first creditors\u2019 meeting and <em>prior </em>to the order avoiding the claimant\u2019s lien, as being \u201cfiled within thirty days from the date of such * * * avoidance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b777-13\"> Reflecting as they do the general policy of the law to find a way in which to prevent the loss of valuable rights, not because something was done too late but rather because it was done too soon,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> these cases, even if approved, do not, upon a consideration of all factors, justify the failure to file and prove the Chapter X claims here. As one might expect in an area as complex as bankruptcy the signs do point both ways and in the end the conceptual structure is not altogether symmetrical. But on balance \u00a7 196 reflects the intrinsic need for the formal filing (and proof) of claims after the commencement of the Chapter X proceeding quite without regard to what may have been filed previously. Consequently, \u00a7 196 should be constructed to achieve that end.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>At the outset, cases construing \u00a7 57 (n), 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 93(n), are of dubious value since \u00a7 102, 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 502, makes \u00a7 57 (n) expressly inapplicable to Chapter X proceedings.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> But many more significant reasons sustain our views. They come readily to mind if we put it in the form of a question: Why is it important that claims be formally filed in the Chapter X proceedings as such ?</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\">There is, to begin with, the marked difference in the nature and character of claims encompassed within a Chapter X reorganization. Unlike ordinary bankruptcy in which claims are confined to those specified in \u00a7 63,11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 103, a reorganization covers creditors claims of every conceivable kind. \u00a7 106(1), 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 506(1).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> See 6 Collier #2.-05, at 369, #2.08, at 384 #2.10, at 385, ##9.05, 9.06, at 2795-2804. Besides those of all kinds of creditors are the claims of stockholders. See, e. g., \u00a7 106 (12), 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 506(12); \u00a7 179, 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 579; \u00a7 216(6), (8), 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 616(6), (8); \u00a7 224(1), 11 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 624(1); 6 Collier #2.16, at 391.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">There is thus the likelihood, if not certainty, that once the Chapter X reorganization proceeding commences the interest of many new parties, creditors or stockholders, will be at stake. Nowhere is the contrast more vivid than in our situation where the Chapter X reorganization grows out of an abortive Chapter XI arrangement which covers unsecured debts only (see statute quoted in text accompanying note 4, supra) .<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b778-15\">More than that, the claims as filed and proved have a special significance in this statutory structure which envisages a reorganization and continuity of the economic enterprise. This objective is to be achieved through the adoption and confirmation of a plan of reorganization. But this cannot be accomplished unless there is precise knowledge about the nature and kind of claims of creditors and interest holders.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-16\"> Thus, the Trustee is required to prepare and file a list of the creditors of each class and a list of the debtor\u2019s stockholders of each class. \u00a7 164, 11 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 564.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The Trustee\u2019s duty is mandatory. The list, as filed and prepared, has extraordinary value since it is available for inspection and use by creditors, stockholders and interested parties in the organization of creditors committees or other concerted activity. See 6 Collier, #7.14, at 2017.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>Armed as he is with traditional powers, \u00a7 187, 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 587, the Trustee has duties which transcend those of his counterpart in ordinary bankruptcy. Following traditional lines, he is, of course, required to examine all proofs of claim and interest and object to the allowance of those that may be improper. See 6 Collier, #9.04, at 2786. But one of the most significant things the Trustee must do is to prepare and file a plan of reorganization. \u00a7 169, 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 569; see 6 Collier, #7.25, at 2054. The statutory structure \u201cmakes the trustee the moving force in the formulation and preparation of reorganization plans,\u201d 6 Collier, #7.23, at 2046. He is actively to solicit from creditors and stockholders suggestions for the formulation of a plan or proposals in the form of plans. \u00a7 167 (6), 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 567(6). And after the plan is proposed, the hearing thereon held, \u00a7 171, 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 571, cleared by the SEC, \u00a7 172, 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 572, and approved by the Court, \u00a7\u00a7 173, 174, 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 573, 574, it must be submitted by the Trustee with appropriate information, \u00a7 175, 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 575, to all affected creditors and stockholders for approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">At this juncture the formal filing of claims becomes distinctively significant. For only creditors holding \u201cclaims filed and allowed\u201d are permitted to vote. \u00a7 179, 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 579 ;<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> see 6 Collier #7.36, at 2099. \u201cAcceptances, therefore, are to be computed only on the basis of proofs of claim * * * actually filed and allowed in the proceeding.\u201d 6 Collier #7.36, at 2099.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> And this holds true to the end. Following this same approach, \u00a7 224(4), 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 624(4), restricts distribution under the confirmed plan to creditors (a) who have filed claims and made proof prior to the date fixed by the judge or (b) if not so filed, whose claims have been listed by the Trustee (see note 16, supra) \u201cand are not contingent, unliquidated or disputed.\u201d See 6 Collier #11.14 [2], at 3913.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-7\">This whole structure reveals why it is so important that the Court, and the Trustee, as well, have specific knowledge not only as to those who might have, or might have had at one time, claims against the debtor, but more so as to those who are presently asserting them. The reorganization looks to the future. How many of the past creditors are willing to go along? What concessions need be made? What inducement is offered? These are all questions which the Trustee ought not to be required to speculate on. If the Trustee is to do his job properly, if a plan is to be hammered out, he and all others need to know, not what might have been claimed in the past, but what it is that is now asserted. This is the approach reflected by the Eighth Circuit in its now famed <em>Henwood </em>decision.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-8\">\u201cRights of creditors and stockholders may be altered by the plan, property that is encumbered may be sold free of liens, and distribution must be made to those having an interest in the proceeds. * * * The question that will confront the court in many respects will be a business question. Equitable adjustments and proper recognition of conflicting interests can be made only if the investments of stockholders and the amounts of claims of creditors are before the court. It is beside the question to contend that the court should consider the extent of the lien whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>the claim or claims are filed or not. If the creditor in fact has a right, he should not have substituted for it the mere possibility that it will be protected without his active participation in the proceedings.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b780-4\">Guaranty Trust Co. of New York v. Henwood, 8 Cir., 1936, 86 F.2d 347, 354, 108 A.L.R. 1020, cert. denied, 1937, 300 U.S. 661, 57 S.Ct. 492, 81 L.Ed. 870.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">These, and many other factors demonstrate why acknowledged scholars in this field give an expanding, not niggardly, reading to the full scope of the judge\u2019s power, indeed his duty, to \u201cprescribe the manner in which and fix a time within which\u201d claims of creditors and interest holders are to be filed and allowed. Thus 6 Collier #9.02, at 2772, broadly states: \u201cThe section leaves this determination entirely to the discretion of the judge.\u201d This covers method, manner, and place of filing<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> as well as the time within which it is to be done. See 6 Collier #9.03, at 2779. Considerable flexibility remains, for the judge, except, perhaps, as to claims then legally extinguished, does have the power upon cause shown to extend the time. \u00a7 119,11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 519.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> And where \u201cthere is placed on record in the proceeding within the time fixed anything sufficient to show the existence, nature and amount of a claim or interest,\u201d the Court may permit the filing of an amendment \u201ceven though the time has expired.\u201d 6 Collier #9.03, at 2783.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-11\">Of course, the force of this argument is dissipated in part if one were to assume, as appellants assert, that whatever is in the file as the proceeding goes through the metamorphoses from XI\u2014 to bankruptcy \u2014 -to X is to be regarded as \u201cfiled\u201d in the eventual proceeding. But only partly so. For this is to suggest a disorderly, not an orderly, procedure \u2014 one in which the rights of parties are exposed to substantial peril depending on what attitude a Judge or a Court, trial or appellate, might or will take toward some paper physically tied down by an acco fastener in a manila folder bearing the same docket number which must carry through to the Chapter X proceeding as well.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b780-12\">This leaves only the tag end suggestion <footnotemark>20</footnotemark> which urges essentially that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>this intricate structure we have attempted to delineate lacks symmetry. Thus, with some appeal, it is urged that the planned parallelism of Chapter XI and X (see note 13, supra) and the successor-nature of any Chapter X proceeding which follows an earlier bankruptcy proceeding (see note 19, supra) suggests that whatever is in the earlier \u201cfile\u201d should be deemed automatically in the later one. More persuasive, perhaps, is the related fact that the <em>right </em>to file a claim in the manner, time and place specified in a successor Chapter X order may depend on whether as required by \u00a7 57(n), 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 93(n), a claim was filed within the six-months period.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Thus, it is urged, it is ironic that the pri- or filing of a claim may \u2014 and perhaps must \u2014 be looked to in order to determine whether the required new filing is permissible and yet that earlier filing is no substitute for the later one. Convincing as these arguments may be, they are not sufficient to overcome the factors demonstrating that there is a real, practical need for the formal filing of the claims in the reorganization proceedings in both the time and manner prescribed by the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">The result is that the District Court\u2019s order rejecting these claims as not timely filed and disregarding them in determining approval of the plan, was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">Affirmed and Remanded.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b775-18\">.

This note points out that in a situation where the reorganization petition is filed in the pending bankruptcy proceeding <em>prior to </em>the expiration of the six-month period, the requirements of \u00a7 57 (n), 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 93 (n), are presumably superseded by those of \u00a7 196, 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 596. However, where the Chapter X petition is filed <em>after </em>the expiration of the six-month period as a successor to a bankruptcy proceeding, a more difficult problem is raised.
