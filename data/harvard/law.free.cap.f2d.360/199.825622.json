He was sentenced, as a third offender, to a term of one year and was fined $400. The Supreme Court of Connecticut affirmed the conviction, and in so doing,, rejected the reasons advanced by the defendant for the insufficiency of the affidavit supporting the search warrant ob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>tained by the State Police.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> State v. DeNegris, 153 Conn. 5, 212 A.2d 894 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"az-dedup-0\">On the present appeal the respondent claims that the trial court was in error</p>\n<p id=\"b256-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>(a) in concluding that the petitioner had exhausted his state remedies and (b) in holding that the affidavit, in reliance on which the magistrate had issued the search warrant, was insufficient to meet the requirements for a showing of probable cause under the Fourth Amendment to the Federal Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">With regard to the exhaustion of state remedies, Judge Blumenfeld\u2019s discussion of the point correctly analyzes the controlling cases and the principles involved, and properly applies them to the facts of this case. 247 F.Supp. 826, 828-829 (D.Conn.1965). It is necessary only to mention the appellant\u2019s complaint, strongly urged on this appeal, that the trial judge ignored the case of United States ex rel. Whiteside v. Slavin, 309 F.2d 322 (2d Cir. 1962). The <em>Whiteside </em>case is clearly distinguishable from the present case, however, because White-side had never, in his appeal to the Supreme Court of Connecticut, raised the federal constitutional issues which were the bases of his habeas corpus petition in the United States District Court. In the present case, DeNegris, in his direct appeal to the Supreme Court of Connecticut, fully presented four of the five reasons which he claimed demonstrated that the affidavit, used as the basis for the finding of probable cause, was inadequate, and that, therefore, the issuance of a search warrant was invalid under the Fourth Amendment to the Federal Constitution. The other ground of attack was presented to the Supreme Court of Connecticut in DeNegris\u2019 brief and on oral argument, so that the constitutional claim was before that court, which refused to consider it for procedural reasons. It is undoubtedly because of this significant difference that Judge Blumenfeld omitted reference to the <em>Whiteside </em>case.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">As to the insufficiency of the affidavit, the trial court\u2019s holding concerned the conclusory nature of the informant\u2019s statement to the police officers and the fact that the magistrate concluded, not that <em>he himself </em>was satisfied that the affidavit showed the existence of probable cause, but that the <em>police officers </em>had adequate cause to believe there was probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-9\">The portion of the affidavit which mentioned the informant and what he had to say is not distinguishable in nature and scope from that held to be insufficient in Aguilar v. State of Texas, 378 U.S. 108, 84 S.Ct. 1509, 12 L.Ed.2d 723 (1963).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Neither affidavit gave any of the underlying facts on which the informant had based his belief so that the magistrate could have made an independent judgment. In <em>Aguilar </em>the Supreme Court said, however, that if in addition the affidavit had included a report that the premises sought to be entered and searched had been kept under surveillance, the results of which had been disclosed, the case would have been entirely different. The affidavit in the present case fairly implies that there had been some such surveillance which had revealed that there was an automobile in the yard registered in the name of petitioner\u2019s wife, and that another car, operated by an unknown white male, registered in her name came into the yard. It also disclosed that someone, presumably the police, observed a black Cadillac, owned by a third person and driven by one Russo, arrive at the house \u201cat a time when gaming operations are normally conducted.\u201d It reported that the house was the middle one of three identical houses with two telephone wires running to it, and that it was a \u201cone-family combination ranch and split level, color red and white, with a stone front.\u201d It is our opinion that the fruits of this surveillance were not, standing by themselves, sufficient to support a finding of probable cause; nor were they, considered in connection with the informant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>statements, enough of a confirmation of the reliability of those statements to furnish a substantial basis for the existence of probable cause. Of course, other matters set forth in the affidavit might be used to support and to some extent explain and justify the informant\u2019s conclusions. The Connecticut court laid considerable emphasis upon the unusual circumstance that two telephone lines ran to \u201can apparently modest dwelling.\u201d But the description of the single family dwelling in the affidavit does not show it to be so cheap and small and in such a poor neighborhood or surrounded by other circumstances that make it obviously incongruous for two telephone lines to be connected with it. There are innocent reasons why even a modest house may have such telephone connections.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\"> The only other facts mentioned in the affidavit are that the house charges for electricity were billed to the petitioner and his wife under pseudonyms; and that the water bill for the house was under another name at a different address. It is not clear what inference can be drawn from this in view of the fact that petitioner was listed in the city directory and with the telephone company (although with unlisted numbers) as living in the searched premises, and the automobiles were plainly registered in the wife\u2019s name. The affidavit also disclosed that the petitioner and his wife had been listed in the police records as having been \u201ccharged\u201d with pool selling in 1960. There is no mention of the disposition of the charge and, as the record stands, it cannot be taken as even hearsay evidence that petitioner actually engaged in gambling activities in 1960. At best, it only implies that the police suspected them of gambling activity at that time. It may be noted that the petitioner in the present case was charged as a third offender; why the two prior convictions were not mentioned in the affidavit is not clear. This would have given support to inferences to be drawn from other statements contained in it. But we cannot consider these prior convictions because \u201cthe reviewing court may</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\">consider only information brought to the magistrate\u2019s attention.\u201d Aguilar v. State of Texas, supra, at 109, 84 S.Ct., at 1511, footnote 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">None of the factual recitations of the affidavit, therefore, redeem the informant\u2019s statement from its obvious insufficiency in the light of the <em>Aguilar </em>case; none of them furnish a substantial basis for confirming the conclusions which the informant expressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-9\"> The other difficulty with the affidavit and the magistrate\u2019s finding concerning probable cause is the assumption that the essential prerequisite to the issuance of a search warrant is that the <em>police officers </em>must be satisfied that there is probable cause, when the clear, mandatory constitutional requirement is that the search must be based upon the <em>magistrate\u2019s </em>determination of probable cause and not on that of the police officers.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-10\">\u201cThe point of the Fourth Amendment, which often is not grasped by zealous officers, is not that it denies law enforcement the support of the usual inferences which reasonable men draw from evidence. Its protection consists in requiring that those inferences be drawn by a neutral and detached magistrate instead of being judged by the officer engaged in the often competitive enterprise of ferreting out crime.\u201d Johnson v. United States, 333 U.S. 10 at 13-14, 68 S.Ct. 367, 369, 92 L.Ed. 436 (1948).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-11\">\u201cThe purpose of the complaint, then, is to enable the appropriate magistrate * * * to determine whether the \u2018probable cause\u2019 required to support a warrant exists. The Commissioner must judge for himself the persuasiveness of the facts relied on by a complaining officer to show probable cause. He should not accept without question the complainant\u2019s mere conclusion * * Giordenello v. United States, 357 U.S. 480 at 486, 78 S.Ct. 1245, 1250, 2 L.Ed.2d 1503 (1958), cited in Aguilar v. State of Texas, supra, 378 U.S. at 112, 84 S.Ct. 1509.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b258-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>The appellant argues that in the present case the magistrate actually did make his own finding that there was probable cause, because after stating that the police officers \u201cmade solemn oath * * * that they have probable cause * * * \u201d he went on to say, \u201cand said court finds that said complainants have adequate cause for such belief.\u201d It may well be that the magistrate was himself satisfied that probable cause existed and maybe that is what he meant; but he never said so in explicit terms. He never said that on the basis of the affidavit <em>he, </em>the magistrate, found probable cause. What he did say makes it clear that it is the <em>police officers\u2019 </em>finding of probable cause that he is talking about; and, although by saying that they had adequate cause for their belief, he may have also been expressing his own belief that probable cause existed, that is far from certain. In fact, the more likely interpretation of the wording used is that the magistrate was satisfied that there was, at the time within the knowledge of the policemen, enough basic evidential material for <em>them </em>to draw certain inferences which justified the <em>policemen\u2019s </em>conclusion of probable cause.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The magistrate nowhere says he would have drawn the same inferences, or would have reached the same conclusion. This failure to comply with the requirements of the Fourth Amendment renders the search warrant invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">We are not unmindful that search warrants often have to be prepared and issued on very short notice and each one cannot be a model of theoretical perfection. It is also usually true that highly skilled and experienced police officers, such as those in the present case, after investigating suspicious activity, have in their minds innumerable intangible evidential threads, not easily expressed or described, which convince them that particular criminal activity is going on. Their conclusions as to the defendant in the present case was amply confirmed by the subsequent search, and it may appear to be a blow to law enforcement and the public interest that clear evidence, though illegally obtained, should be excluded. But that is the rule, and it has been adopted as the only effective means of protecting the rights of individuals under the Fourth Amendment, made applicable to the States through the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U.S. 643, 81 S.Ct. 1684, 6 L.Ed.2d 1081 (1961) and Ker v. State of California, 374 U.S. 23, 83 S.Ct. 1623, 10 L.Ed.2d 726 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-10\">The Connecticut legislature, after repealing a statute which authorized the issuance of a search warrant on a sworn statement of suspicion alone, has sought to conform the statute on the issuance of a search warrant (General Statutes \u00a7 54-33a, as amended in 1963) to these decisions. The interpretation and application of the amended statute must strictly comply with the standard enunciated by the Supreme Court of the United States in Aguilar v. State of Texas, supra, and the cases cited therein. Although the Supreme Court of Connecticut, in a lucid exposition of its holding, has reached a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>conclusion in this ease which is the opposite of our own, we must, nevertheless, for the reasons stated, adhere to our opinion that the facts set forth in the affidavit were not sufficiently substantial, that it is extremely uncertain that the magistrate himself found probable cause to exist, and that a search warrant should not, therefore, have issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">The order of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b255-4\">.
