Only one question is presented for review: Does petitioner qualify for a second preference immigration visa under Section 203(a) (2) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1153(a) (2), as amended September 22, 1959 (73 Stat. 644) ? The facts and the posing of that question are correctly stated in the decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-21\">\u201cThe record relates to a native and citizen of Lebanon, 30 years old, male, who last entered the United States at the port of New York on January 31, 1956. He was then admitted as a nonimmigrant student, authorized to remain in such status until January 5, 1963. The respondent was granted un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>til February 10, 1963, within which to effect voluntary departure but remained thereafter without authority. Deportability on the charge stated in the Order to Show Cause is established.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-5\">\u201cThe case was previously before us on appeal from an order of the special inquiry officer entered on March 27, 1963, granting voluntary departure with the alternate order that if he failed to depart as required, he be deported to Lebanon. The appeal was dismissed. On August 7, 1964, we ordered proceedings reopened for the purpose of considering the respondent\u2019s request for adjustment of status under Section 245 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended, or for such other relief as might be appropriate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-6\">\u201cThe record shows that the respondent on September 5, 1963, in the Parish of East Baton Rouge, Louisiana, married Shirley Claudia O\u2019Hara Mulligan, a native-born citizen of the United States. On April 19, 1964, at Omaha, Nebraska, the respondent\u2019s wife gave birth to a citizen child. The day after the marriage she completed a visa petition to accord the respondent non-quota status. In her sworn statement of April 20, 1964, the wife asked that the visa petition be revoked and on May 19, 1964, the District Director at New Orleans denied the visa petition. On May 29, 1964, the respondent filed a petition for separation a <em>mensa et thoro </em>in the Family Court for the Parish of East Baton Rouge, Louisiana in which respondent asserted under Louisiana law he was the legal father of the child and was awarded the temporary care, custody and control of the minor child (Ex. R-4). (A final decree in this matter was rendered on September 9, 1964). There is some evidence in the file of a sham marriage for the purpose of avoiding deportation. There is also evidence that the respondent is not the natural father of the child (Ex. R-4; Ex. R-6, p. 5; Ex. R-7). However, we need not at this point consider whether the relief of Section 245 of the Act is warranted as a matter of discretion. For the purpose of this discussion we shall also assume, without conceding, that under the laws of the State of Louisiana the respondent is recognized as the legal father of the child, Darlene Rachael, born in Nebraska, despite his admission that he is not the biological or natural father of the child and despite the statement by the mother that there was never any intercourse between herself and the respondent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">\u201cThe critical question in the case is whether the respondent can meet the requirement of Section 245(a) (3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 USC 1255(a) (3)) that an immigrant visa be immediately available to the alien. Section 203(a) (2) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 USC 1153(a) (2)) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-9\">\u201c \u2018The next 30 per centum of the quota for each quota area for such year, plus any portion of such quota not required for the issuance of immigrant visas to the classes specified in paragraphs (1) and (3), shall be made available for the issuance of immigrant visas <em>to qualified quota immigrants who are the parents of citizens of the United States, such citizens being at least twenty-one years of age or who are the unmarried sons or daughters of citizens of the United States.\u2019 </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-10\">Counsel construes the italicized portion of this section as though the language thereof reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-11\">* * * to qualified quota immigrants who are the parents of citizens of the United States, such citizens being (a) at least twenty-one years of age; or (b) who are the parents of unmarried sons or daughters of citizens of the United States.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-13\">Counsel argues that inasmuch as the respondent is the parent of a citizen who is the unmarried daughter of his citizen wife, he is therefore entitled to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>second preference quota status under the statute as he interprets it.\u201d \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">More specifically, the question presented is what subject is modified by the last clause, \u201cor who are the unmarried sons or daughters of citizens of the United States\u201d ? Does that clause modify \u201cqualified quota immigrants,\u201d or does it modify \u201ccitizens of the United States\u201d as used in the phrase \u201cparents of citizens of the United States\u201d? The Special Inquiry Officer and the Board of Immigration Appeals held that the last clause of the subsection modifies \u201cqualified quota immigrants.\u201d The Special Inquiry Officer noted that petitioner\u2019s construction does riot meet the elementary rule of English grammar that the coordinating conjunction \u201cor\u201d links two parallel and equal sentence elements.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">That logical and grammatical construction is required by the legislative history of Section 203(a) of the Act, 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1153(a). The clause \u201cwho are the unmarried sons or daughters of citizens of the United States\u201d was added to Section 203(a) (2), 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1153(a) (2), by the amendatory Act of September 22, 1959 (73 Stat. 644). Prior to the adoption of that Act, subsection (4) of Section 203(a), 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1153(a), granted <em>fourth </em>preference visas to immigrants \u201cwho are the brothers, sisters, sons or daughters of citizens of the United States.\u201d Section 3 of the Act of September 22, 1959 (73 Stat. 644) amended subsection (4) by granting fourth preference visas only to immigrants \u201cwho are the brothers, sisters, married sons or married daughters of citizens of the United States,\u201d thus eliminating unmarried sons and daughters from the <em>fourth </em>preference category.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">At the same time, Section 1 of the Act of September 22, 1959 (73 Stat. 644) added the clause in controversy to subsection (2), which grants second preference visas to immigrants \u201cwho are the unmarried sons or daughters of citizens of the United States.\u201d The obvious intention of Congress in this amendment to raise unmarried sons and daughters from fourth to second preference is illustrated by S.Rep.No. 962, 86th Cong., 1st Sess., which accompanied H.R. 5896, which became the Act of September 22, 1959 (73 Stat. 644). Senate Report No. 962 states that one purpose of the bill was to \u201cimprove the quota immigrant status of the unmarried sons or daughters, over 21 years of age, of citizens of the United States by moving them from the fourth to the second preference.\u201d The Senate Report also contains a letter from the Department of Justice, which similarly explained that the purpose of the accompanying bill was to raise adult unmarried sons and daughters of United States citizens from the fourth to second preference category. U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News (1959), p. 2803, et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-11\">The 1965 amendments to the Immigration and Nationality Act<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> further demonstrate the continued policy of Congress to withhold preference visas from aliens in petitioner's status, namely, a parent of a United States citizen minor. The 1965 amendments create a special non-quota category for \u201cimmediate relatives,\u201d Section 1(a) and (b) amending Section 201 of the Act, 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1151. These relatives who may enter free of numerical limitation are defined as follows: \u201cThe children, spouses, and parents of a citizen of the United States: <em>Provided, </em>[t]hat in the case of parents, such citizens must be at least twenty-one years of age.\u201d The reports of both houses of Congress specifically note that only the parents of <em>adult </em>United States citizens will be permitted to enter without numerical limitation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Petitioner clearly does not qualify as an \u201cimmediate relative\u201d under the new amendment because his alleged daughter is not \u201cat least twenty-one years of age.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b360-12\">In addition, the leading treatise in this area of the law, Gordon and Rosenfield, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>Immigration Law and Procedure (1964), at pp. 200-01, notes that before the 1959 amendment second preferences under Section 203(a), 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1153(a), were limited to parents of United States citizens and comments that \u201cthe latter phase of the second preference classification, added in 1959, deals with the unmarried sons and daughters of American citizens.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">In summary, the rules of grammar, the administrative interpretation, the legislative history, and the leading commentators, all without exception, require the af-firmance of the finding that the petitioner is statutorily ineligible for a preference under Section 203(a) (2) of the Immigration and N\u00e1tionality Act of 1952, as amended September 22, 1959 (73 Stat. 644). The final order of deportation under review is therefore affirmed. 8 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 1105a.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b360-7\">. See H. W.
