The Estate paid a tax of $1,031.06. The District tax authorities assessed a deficiency of $588,-355.82 with a resulting deficiency in tax of $31,805.03, plus interest. The District of Columbia Tax Court on September 30, 1963 upheld the District, and these review proceedings followed. The facts are not in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-8\">Until the death of the decedent Uline on February 22, 1958 he owned all outstanding shares<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> *of M. J. Uline Company, an Ohio corporation. The company as of December 31, 1959, consummated a sale of its business and all of its tangible assets to a new corporation for $725,000, payable partly in cash, and partly in notes having a stipulated value equal to the balance due on the notes. From the proceeds of that sale, M. J. Uline Company made a partial liquidating distribution on May 3, 1960, and a final distribution on December 14, 1960. The Estate thereupon, as sole stockholder, delivered its stock certificates to the corporation for cancellation. On December 28, 1960 a certificate of dissolution of M. J. Uline Company was filed in Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-9\">The petitioners had alleged in the Tax Court that prior to the liquidating distributions, \u201cthe capital account and the earned surplus account on the books of M. J. Uline Company as of December 14, I960 * * * were as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b875-15\">Capital $105,300.00</p>\n<p id=\"b875-16\">Earned Surplus 588,355.82</p>\n<p id=\"b875-17\">Total $693,655.82\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b875-18\">After certain adjustments of $3,819.35, not in issue, the net capital account representing the amount originally paid in by the decedent was seen to be $101,480.-65. That figure was then deducted by the District tax authorities from the total net distribution of $689,836.47 to arrive at the earned surplus of $588,355.82. That amount when distributed to the Estate constituted a dividend and was income subject to tax, the District asserted.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Tax Court agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-19\">The petitioners in 1960 income tax return reported as ordinary dividend income to the Estate subject to tax only $32,764.47, arrived at by deducting from the total net distribution of $689,836.47, the amount of their claimed \u201cbasis\u201d of $657,072.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Estate argues here that the statute<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> does not tax dividends, per se, but only income, and the Estate could have no income by way of gains or profits until or unless the Estate recouped the \u201cbasis\u201d of the stock which it had surrendered for cancellation. But the statute relied upon does not in the circumstances of this case involve gains or profits; rather, it specifies that \u201cgross income\u201d <em>shall </em>include income derived from <em>dividends. </em>And the term \u201cdividend\u201d clearly is defined to mean</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b875-20\">\u201cany distribution made by a corporation * * * to its stockholders * * out of its earnings, profits, or surplus (other than paid-in surplus), <em>whenever earned by the corporation </em>* * * <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>whether distributed prior to, during, upon, or after liquidation or dissolution of the corporation.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b876-4\">Over and above the capital which the decedent had paid in, an amount which was not taxed at all, the company\u2019s books showed the entire remaining account to be \u201cearned surplus.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus, when that earned surplus was distributed to the Estate, it became a dividend, and hence was income subject to tax. Such \u201ca distribution is not a payment in exchange for or <em>in extinguishment of the stock upon which it is declared.\u201d </em><footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) Earlier, in Berliner,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the court rejected the taxpayers\u2019 contention that such a transaction as this should be held to be an exchange. There can be no question as to the facts here for the parties expressly stipulated<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> in writing that M. J. Uline Company \u201csold all of its tangible assets\u201d in a transaction which was consummated on December 31, 1959; in return, the corporation received $725,000 in cash or its equivalent; the net proceeds of the sale were reflected on the company\u2019s books as earned surplus. When distributed in the course of liquidation, both by statutory definition and by our decisional law, the Estate received a taxable dividend. There is no circumstance <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> shown on this ree-ord to predicate the Estate\u2019s claim that it need pay income tax only on the difference between the amount of the total net distribution and the fair market value of the stock. The Estate here stood in no different position than if the decedent Uline during his lifetime had caused his corporation to enter into the same transaction and thereafter to distribute the net earned surplus to himself as sole stockholder.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-15\">The Estate argues further that if the entire amount distributed is to be included \u201cto the full extent of the corporation\u2019s accumulated earnings, regardless of the Estate\u2019s basis for its cancelled stock, it was entitled to offset against this amount the loss which it sustained in the disposition of the stock.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b876-16\"> That is another way of saying that the Estate should be entitled somehow to achieve a stepped-up basis. This court has held that unrealized appreciation in the value of the assets of a corporation will not become a dividend when the corporation on dissolution distributes those assets to its stockholders.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> But that principle has no application here for M. J. Uline Company received full value upon the sale of its assets. When that realized value was distributed as earned surplus upon dissolution of the corporation, the Estate as sole stockhold<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>er received a taxable dividend. The decedent Uline had invested his capital of $101,480.65. On that investment, his Estate received a return of $588,355.82. There was no loss.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> That is all there is to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b875-10\">. For federal estate and inheritance tax purposes, it was determined that those shares had a fair market value of $624 per share, or a total of $657,072.
