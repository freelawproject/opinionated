The appeal has become moot and is, accordingly, dismissed.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> See Janousek v. Doyle, 313 F. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>2d 916 (8th Cir. 1963); Dempsey v. Guaranty Trust Co. of N. Y., 131 F.2d 103 (7th Cir. 1942); but cf. Stell v.

Accordingly, we suggest to the parties and the District Court that they proceed promptly with the prior pending case and to a determination of which agreement between Pan American and the Air Line Pilots Association, International, or between Pan American and the Plight Engineers\u2019 International Association, PAA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>Chapter, is controlling on the question of whether the so-called \u201cnew hires\u201d are required to pay dues to FEIA, as a condition of remaining in the employ of Pan American as flight engineers. Once this question is resolved, if a \u201cminor\u201d dispute still remains in the case over the interpretation of the language of the governing agreement, it should be settled by the System Board of Adjustment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
