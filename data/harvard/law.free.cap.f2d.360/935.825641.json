The transcript was signed and approved by the attorneys who represented the petitioner and the respondent in the state habeas corpus proceeding. This is a sufficient guarantee of its accuracy and we find no error in its receipt and use by the District Court. It is not contended here that the transcript is incomplete or inaccurate in any respect. The Rules of the Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia are applicable to appeals to that court but a failure to follow such technical requirements does not render the transcript inadmissible in the federal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-16\">Petitioner argues that the District Court should have held a plenary hearing on the issue of the voluntariness of his confession since the state court did not consider this point. Even if Walton\u2019s present petition'/ had clearly raised this issue,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> his own/argument is fatal to his claim. The state court did not inquire into the voluntariness of his confession since the petition to that court did not present a claim that the confession was involuntary. The presiding judge expressly stated that the validity of the confession was not in question. Thus, it is clear that petitioner has not exhausted his state remedies and there was no error in dismissing the petition without a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-17\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b990-13\">. He alleges a denial of due process of law-in tlie following respects: (1) lie was interrogated while lie was held incommunicado and (2) he was not allowed to select an attorney of his own choosing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b990-18\">. The petition could be said to present this issue only hy a strained construction.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
