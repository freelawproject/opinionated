Brown, hereinafter referred to as appellant, instituted this action in the United States District Court to enjoin the collection of additional income taxes for the years 1952, 1953 and 1954. The district court (Honorable Edward J. Devitt), after a hearing, concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to grant the injunction, and dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. Appellant has appealed from the judgment of dismissal. We concur in the court\u2019s conclusion and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">The sole question for determination is whether the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, acting through the District Director of Internal Revenue, District of Minnesota, appellee, complied with the statute requiring notice of the determined deficiencies in appellant\u2019s income tax for the years in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">Section 6212(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended, (26 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 6212(a)), provides that if the Secretary or his delegates determine that there is a deficiency in respect of any income tax, he is authorized to send notice of such deficiency to the taxpayer by certified or registered mail; that notice of deficiency in respect of an income tax, if mailed to the taxpayer at his last known address, shall be sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-9\">Under \u00a7 6213(a) of the 1954 Code (26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 6213(a)), appellant had ninety days after the notice of deficiency authorized in \u00a7 6212 was mailed, to file a petition with the Tax Court for a redeter-</p>\n<p id=\"b615-11\">mination of the deficiencies. Section 7421 of the 1954 Code (26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 7421) provides: \u201cExcept as provided in sections 6212(a) and (c) and 6213(a), no suit for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax shall be maintained in any court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b615-12\">The facts are undisputed and establish that notice of the determined deficiencies was sent by certified mail on October 20, 1961, to appellant\u2019s home at 4820 Willis-ton Road, Hopkins, Minnesota (concededly appellant\u2019s proper address). An employee of the United States Post Office attempted to deliver the notice but could find no one at the address and delivery was not completed. According to normal post office procedure, the employee left a slip in appellant\u2019s mail box requesting him to call for the certified mail. There was no response to this request. Thereafter, the certified letter was returned to appellee unopened and marked \u201cUnclaimed\u201d. Appellant did not receive the certified letter notifying him of the determined deficiencies and did not file petition with the Tax Court within ninety days of the date the notice was mailed.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-14\">Appellee, proceeding under \u00a7 6213(c) of the 1954 Code (26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 6213(c)), assessed the deficiencies on February 16, 1962, for the three years, in the total amount of $19,736.95. Efforts to collect the deficiencies prompted appellant to bring this action to enjoin the collection.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-16\">Appellant concedes here, as he did in the district court, that the notice of the determined deficiencies was sent to him by certified mail. He contends, however, that such mailing did not constitute the giving of notice as contemplated by law. Appellant\u2019s theme, in effect, proposes the theory that the return of the certified letter created a duty on the part of the appellee \u201cto find some other means of giving notice or sending certified letters until he is sure that the taxpayer has been notified.\u201d Having thus reasoned that a breach of this duty rendered the notice inadequate, appellant argues that the statutory bar to the granting of in-junctive relief, \u00a7 7421(a), supra, has been removed.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>Appellant\u2019s position is contrary to the plain and meaningful provisions of the applicable statutes, discussed, supra, and has been soundly rejected by the courts. Cohen v. United States, 297 F.2d 760, 772 (9 Cir. 1962), cert. den. 369 U.S. 865, 82 S.Ct. 1029, 8 L.Ed.2d 84; Luhring v. Glotzbach, 304 F.2d 556, 558-559 (4 Cir. 1962); Boccuto v. Commissioner, 277 F.2d 549 (3 Cir. 1960); Williams v. United States, 264 F.2d 227 (6 Cir. 1959), cert. den., 361 U.S. 862, 80 S.Ct. 118, 4 L.Ed.2d 102; Pfeffer v. Commissioner, 272 F.2d 383 (2 Cir. 1959); Dolezilek v. Commissioner, 94 U.S.App.D.C. 97, 212 F.2d 458 (1954); Commissioner v. Rosenheim, 132 F.2d 677 (3 Cir. 1942); Ryan v. Alexander, 118 F.2d 744 (10 Cir. 1941), cert. den., 314 U.S. 622, 62 S.Ct. 72, 86 L.Ed. 500. See, Anno. 24 ALR 2d 800.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">Thus, in <em>Luhring, </em>the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-5\">\u201cThe statute, however, does not require service of actual notice upon the taxpayer but merely the mailing of the notice to him by certified or registered mail at his last known address. * * * No one questions the power of Congress to make this provision in consideration of the administrative difficulties involved in the discharge of the Commissioner\u2019s duties * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">The Ninth Circuit recognized the same rule in <em>Cohen, </em>stating;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-7\">\u201cWe think it clear that the Congress when it \u2018authorized\u2019 service by registered mail, did not intend to require actual receipt by the addressee of the letter. Rather, it permitted the use of a method of giving notice that would ordinarily result in such receipt.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">It is an undisputed fact that the appellee mailed the notice of deficiency by certified mail in full compliance with the statute. There is, therefore, no basis for injunctive relief. See, Enochs v. Williams Packing &amp; Nav. Co., 370 U.S. 1, 82 S.Ct. 1125, 8 L.Ed.2d 292 (1962); and cf., Flora v. United States, 357 U.S. 63, 78 S.Ct. 1079, 2 L.Ed.2d 1165 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-9\">The failure of the appellant to receive actual notice or to seek timely review of the assessment by the Tax Court is not relevant. Appellant is not without adequate remedy nor is he deprived of his constitutionally protected right of due process. Phillips v. Commissioner, 283 U.S. 589, 596, 51 S.Ct. 608, 75 L.Ed. 1289 (1931). He can pay the additional amount assessed, file a claim for refund and, if the claim is denied, institute an action in the United States District Court under \u00a7 7422 of the 1954 Code (26 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 7422) for recovery of any amount paid in excess of the lawful tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-10\">We affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
