After Peerless had conceded that the bond had been breached, the district court concluded that the provision in the bond for the payment of five thousand dollars in the event of breach \u201cwas, in [its] opinion, a reasonable forecast of just compensation * * * \u201d and granted the government\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-16\">Though Peerless raises several issues before us, the essential question is whether the district court erred in concluding as a matter of law that the provision was not penal, and therefore, enforcible. We think that the district court committed no error in holding that five thousand dollars properly constituted liquidated damages. See 5 Corbin, Contracts \u00a7 1062 at 355-356; 3 Williston, Contracts \u00a7\u00a7 775 et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-17\">The judgment of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
