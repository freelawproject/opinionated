The district court on July 10, 1963 sentenced Weed to concurrent terms of five years on each count of the indictment and to ten years on the information to run concurrently with the other sentences. At the time Weed pleaded guilty, he was represented by court-appointed counsel who then retired from the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">Subsequently the court appointed new counsel for Weed, and a motion for reduction of sentence was filed and denied. Several months after his motion to reduce sentence was denied, Weed,=pm- se, filed a motion to vacate his sentence under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255. He alleged' that his guilty plea was not voluntary, having been induced by threats from State and Federal authorities. The district court denied Weed\u2019s motion without a hearing and this Court reversed. Weed v. United States, 5 Cir. 1965, 342 F.2d 971.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">This Court noted that although \u201cthe movant is entitled to a hearing * * * the district court in its discretion may find that the motion can be heard and disposed of without requiring the prisoner to be present at the hearing.\u201d The district court, however, chose to hold a full hearing with Weed present. After the hearing the court entered its findings of fact and conclusions of law denying Weed\u2019s motion to vacate his sentence. Weed now appeals to this Court. The district court\u2019s conclusions are clearly supported by the record and we, therefore, affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">The record developed in this case during the habeas hearing amply justifies Judge Thomberry\u2019s determination that Weed intended to plead guilty because he actually was guilty. There is no showing of coercion. What is shown is that Weed believed that he had received a more severe sentence than did a similarly situated prisoner. If any \u201cdeal\u201d as to dropping a State prosecution was made, it was one Weed affirmatively sought and was pleased to accomplish. Judge Thornberry was justified in finding that the motivating factor in Weed\u2019s plea of guilty was his actual guilt and not the hope that he would reap the reward of a bargain as to the State\u2019s charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-11\">Weed raises two new issues for the first time on this appeal. He asserts that the information and indictment placed him in double jeopardy. He, also, now challenges the adequacy of his prior counsel. At the hearing below, Weed\u2019s counsel stated: \u201c * * * this hearing is limited to any matters which might have coerced in any way \u2014 threats, promises, or other such matters.\u201d As to adequacy of prior counsel, Weed\u2019s counsel below stated: \u201cNow, it\u2019s not contended that his counsel was inadequate. He doesn\u2019t base his motion on inadequate counsel.\u201d Issues not raised in the district court cannot be raised here.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-12\">The judgment is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"b623-13\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
