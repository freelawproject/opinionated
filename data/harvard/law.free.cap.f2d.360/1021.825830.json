Subsequently, appellant made a motion for a preliminary injunction restraining the sale of two dolls, \u201cRandy,\u201d a teenage fashion doll, and \u201cMary Lou,\u201d a pre-teen fashion doll, by appellees, on the grounds that (a) appellees\u2019 dolls infringed appellant\u2019s copyright on two dolls, \u201cTammy,\u201d a teenage fashion doll, and \u201cPepper,\u201d a pre-teen fashion doll, in violation of 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 101, and (b) that appellees were using reproductions of appellant\u2019s \u201cTammy\u201d doll in advertising the \u201cRandy\u201d doll in violation of Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125(a). The district court issued an order restraining the sale of the \u201cRandy\u201d doll based on the claim of unfair competition. It refused, however, to grant a preliminary injunction based on the claim of copyright infringement finding that \u201calthough the accused dolls are similar to * * * (appellant\u2019s) dolls in size and shape, and indeed some features (such as hands and arms) are virtually identical, we think the total effect of the image conveyed to an ordinary observer by the accused dolls is quite distinct from that of * * * (appellant\u2019s) dolls.\u201d Thereafter, the court granted a motion for reargument<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> concerning the infringement claim and, in an order dated March 17, 1965 it adhered to its original decision. This appeal concerns the propriety of the court\u2019s disposition of the infringement claim. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-9\">\u201cThis court\u2019s function in reviewing the grant or denial of a preliminary injunction is a limited one. A motion for such relief is directed to the sound discretion of the district judge whose decision will not be reversed unless an abuse of discretion is apparent.\u201d Joshua Meier Co. v. Albany Novelty Mfg. Co., 236 F.2d 144, 146 (2d Cir. 1956); see American Visuals Corp. v. Holland, 261 F.2d 652 (2d Cir. 1958); Nimmer, Copyright \u00a7 157.1 (1964). Moreover, we cannot lose sight of the fact that \u201cthe test for infringement of a copyright is of necessity vague * * * (and) decisions must therefore inevitably be <em>ad hoc.\u201d </em>Peter Pan Fabrics, Inc. v. Martin Weiner Corp., 274 F.2d 487, 489 (2d Cir. 1960) (L. Hand, J.); see Uneeda Doll Co. v. P &amp; M Doll Co., 353 F.2d 788 (2d Cir. 1965). It is well established, however, that in order to sustain a claim of copyright infringement the claimant is required to demonstrate a substantial similarity between the copyrighted work and the alleged copy. American Visuals Corp. v. Holland, 219 F.2d 223 (2d Cir. 1954); Ideal Toy Corp. v. Adanta Novelties Corp., 223 F.Supp. 866 (S.D.N.Y.1963); see Comptone Co. v. Rayex Corp., 251 F.2d 487 (2d Cir. 1958); Nimmer, supra \u00a7 143. This is a factual question and the appropriate test for determining whether substantial similarity is present is whether an average lay observer would recognize the alleged copy as having been appropriated from the copyrighted work. See, e. g., Peter Pan Fabrics, Inc. v. Martin Weiner Corp., supra; Arnstein v. Broadcast Music Co., 137 F.2d 410 (2d Cir. 1943) ; Life Music Inc. v. Wonderland Music Co., 241 F. Supp. 653, 655 (S.D.N.Y.1965). The district court correctly employed the ordi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1023\">*1023</page-number>nary observer test<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and, on the basis of the evidence before it, we cannot say that the denial of appellant\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction as to the infringement claim constituted an abuse of discretion. See Uneeda Doll Co. v. P &amp; M Doll Co., supra; Ideal Toy Corp. v. Adanta Novelties Corp., supra. An examination of the dolls reveals that, while similarities exist as to standard doll features such as the full faces; pert, upturned noses; bow lips; large, widely spaced eyes; and slim figures, distinct differences exist with respect to the neck structures and hair styles, and to a lesser extent with respect to the chin structures and the over-all craftsmanship of the dolls. Moreover, it is interesting to note that the gravamen of appellant\u2019s infringement claim, as it appears in the complaint, is that the \u201cTammy\u201d and \u201cPepper\u201d dolls are unique in that they are \u201cparticularly characterized by an original and distinctive doll head\u201d and that appellees improperly copied that design. The most apparent differences between the dolls, however, relate to the head design which indicates that \u201cwhatever unique quality * * * (appellant\u2019s) doll may have * *, (appellees have) not appropriated it.\u201d Ideal Toy Co. v. Sayco Doll Corp., 302 F.2d 623, 627 (2d Cir. 1962) (Clark, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-8\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1076-7\">. The motion for reargument was granted to permit appellant to introduce additional evidence that appellees had access to at least one of appellant\u2019s dolls prior to manufacturing the \u201cRandy\u201d and \u201cMary Lou\u201d dolls. The court, however, did not eon-sider the evidence persuasive since it had no bearing on its prior finding that appellant had failed to show substantial similarity between its dolls and those of appel-lees.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1077-5\">. Contrary to appellant\u2019s urging, the district court did not err in relying in part on this court\u2019s statement in Arnstein v. Porter, 154 F.2d 464 (2d Cir. 1946) that to sustain an infringement claim it must be shown that \u201ccopying (assuming it to be proved) went so far as to constitute improper appropriation.\u201d Id. at 468. The above-quoted statement in <em>Arnstein </em>was merely an alternative way of formulating the issue of substantial similarity. This is evident from the court\u2019s further comment that \u201con that issue * * * (i. e., improper appropriation) the test is the response of the ordinary lay hearer * * ibid., although the use of the term \u201cimproper appropriation\u201d somewhat obscures the issue, gee Nimmer, Copyright \u00a7 143.53 (1964).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
