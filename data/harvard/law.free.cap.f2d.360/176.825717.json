This court granted enforcement of the prior order in 325 F. 2d 68 (C.A. 6, 1963). In turn the NLRB petitions for enforcement of its supplemental back wage order.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-15\">The only issue presented to us now pertains to the fact that the NLRB Trial Examiner (with subsequent affirmance of the Board) quashed a subpoena <em>duces tecum </em>previously obtained from the Board and served upon the Michigan Employment Security Commission by petitioners. By this subpoena petitioners sought to obtain records of unemployment compensation claims made by the employees involved in this case. An Assistant Attorney General, representing the State of Michigan, appeared at the hearing and moved to quash the subpoena on the ground that under Michigan Compiled Laws \u00a7 421.11(b) (Mason Supp.1961), Mich.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 17.511(b), these records were confidential and could not be produced under subpoena in open court. Petitioners claim prejudicial error in the quashal.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-16\">The case raises two questions. The first is procedural- \u2014 -whether or not the Trial Examiner had the power to quash the subpoena. Petitioners rely in this regard upon language somewhat favorable to their position in N. L. R. B. v. Cashman Auto Company, 223 F.2d 832 (C.A. 1, 1955), while the NLRB relies upon General Engineering, Inc. v. N. L. R. B., 341 F.2d 367 (C.A. 9, 1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-17\">We deal herein with \u00e1 subpoena <em>duces tecum. </em>The National Labor Relations Act specifically sets forth power in the Board to revoke such a subpoena. 61 Stat. 150 (1947), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 161(1) (1964).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>Board has established a rule delegating the exercise of this power to the Trial Examiner <footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and setting standards for his doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">Petitioners, however, point out that the statute authorizes revocation where the document sought \u201cdoes not relate to any matter under investigation\u201d or the subpoena is lacking in \u201csufficient particularity,\u201d while the rule adds the general language \u201cor if for any other reason sufficient in law the subpoena is otherwise invalid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">It should be noted that the statute is mandatory in its language, while the Board rule is discretionary. The United States Supreme Court in construing Section 11(1) approved the Board\u2019s action extending the power specifically granted in this section to issue a subpoena <em>duces tecum </em>to a subpoena <em>ad testificandum. </em>Lewis v. N. L. R. B., 357 U.S. 10, 78 S.Ct. 1029, 2 L.Ed.2d 1103 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">In the <em>General Engineering </em>case, in a well-reasoned opinion interpreting Section 11(1), the Ninth Circuit said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-7\">\u201cThe statute in question does not state that petitions to revoke subpoenas can only be made on the two grounds therein stated, or that the trial examiner or Board may revoke only on those grounds. It does provide that a person served with such a subpoena may petition for revocation of the subpoena and the Board <em>shall </em>revoke it if one of the two specified circumstances exist. Insofar as that statute is concerned, the Board may also revoke a subpoena on any other ground which is consonant with the overall powers and duties of the Board under the Act considered as a whole.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-11\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-12\">\u201cIn short, section 11(1) is not intended as a complete and inclusive catalogue of all grounds upon which a Board subpoena may be revoked.\u201d (Emphasis in original) General Engineering, Inc. v. N. L. R. B., supra 341 F.2d at 372-373.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-13\">Still another section of the NLRA grants general rule-making power to the NLRB to make \u201csuch rules and regulations as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this subchapter.\u201d 61 Stat. 140 (1947), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 156 (1964). The Board has exercised this power in issuing the rule referred to above.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-14\">We hold that the language of the Board rule relied upon here by the Trial Examiner represents a reasonable employment of the rule-making power con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>veyed upon the Board by Congress. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 161(1) (1964); 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 156 (1964); Lewis v. N. L. R. B., supra at 14, 78 S.Ct. 1029. See also N. L. R. B. v. Duval Jewelry Co., 357 U.S. 1, 78 S.Ct. 1024, 2 L.Ed.2d 1097 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\">To the extent that N. L. R. B. v. Cash-man Auto Co., supra, may be read as contrary to this holding, we decline to follow it in the light of the subsequent United States Supreme Court holdings cited above.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">As its second issue, appellant contends that the Michigan Statute, M.S.A. \u00a7 17.511(b),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> relied upon by the Trial Examiner in quashing this subpoena did not prevent the production of the records at the NLRB hearing. We recognize that this question is not without difficulty since the statutory language as of the date with which we are concerned made no specific reference to legal proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"AN7\">Nor can we find any assistance in interpretations of this statute by the Michigan Supreme Court. None are cited to us, nor does our research discover any. Michigan has, however, followed a strict construction policy pertaining to confidentiality or privilege provisions in other statutes. Bowman v. Montcalm Circuit Judge, 129 Mich. 608, 89 N.W. 334 (1902); Williams v. Brown, 137 Mich. 569, 100 N.W. 786 (1904); People v. Atwood, 188 Mich. 36, 154 N.W. 112 (1915) [dictum]; In re Reid, 155 P. 933 (E.D. Mich.1906) <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> But cf. Bell v. Bankers Life &amp; Casualty Co., 327 Ill.App. 321, 64 N.E. 2d 204 (1945); Annot., 165 A.L.R. 1302 (1946).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-14\">The only specific interpretation of the instant statute is that given by the Michigan Attorney General<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> in an opinion dated March 2, 1945. That opinion, referring to the statute now under dispute, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-15\">\u201cThe statute in question, (being Mich.Stat.Ann. 17.511, Sec. 11(b)), clearly provides that any information obtained from any employing unit or individual pursuant to the administration of the Unemployment Compensation Act shall be held confidential and shall be a privileged communication; except as such information, under Commission regulations, may be made available to certain agencies for certain purposes. The Department of Revenue is not such an agency.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-16\">\u201cIt follows that the Legislature intended that information gained from an employer in the course of the statutory administration by the Michigan Unemployment Compensation Commission was to be privileged from a use such as has been attempted in the appeal before the State Board of Tax Appeals.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-17\">X\u2019 X X X X X</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-18\">\u201cThe right to examine the records and reports in possession of the Michigan Unemployment Compensation Commission by another governmental agency does not waive the confidential and privileged provisions of the statute in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>behalf of the informant when he is involved in a proceeding with another governmental agency foreign to the administration of the Unemployment Compensation Act.\u201d Ops. Att\u2019y General, 253-54 (1945).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">In the absence of more persuasive authority, we choose to follow the reasoning and interpretation of the Attorney General\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">It might be well to note that subsequent to the proceeding below (and hence not relied upon for our decision) the Michigan Legislature amended the disputed statute to make its confidentiality in the sort of situation we now deal with crystal clear for the future by adding the following sentence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-6\">\u201cExcept as hereinafter provided, such information and determination shall not be used in any action or proceeding before any court or administrative tribunal unless the commission is a party or complainant therein.\u201d Mich. Stat.Ann. \u00a7 17.511(b) (Current Material Supp.1966).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">The petition for review is dismissed. The cross-petition for enforcement is granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b231-9\">. \u201cSec. 11.
