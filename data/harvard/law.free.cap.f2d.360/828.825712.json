Federal Power Commission in its memorandum submitted its reasons for believing that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>the instant proceedings had been \u201cinstituted\u201d subsequent to a proceeding seeking review of the same order in the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, instanced by Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America, Inc. The above-named petitioners in compliance with our Rules and practice had filed their petition for review in this court on August 11, 1965 at 9 A.M., E.D.S.T.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America, Inc. on August 10, 1965 had mailed its petition for review to the Clerk of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. An exhibit before us reveals that the clerk of that court had informed the Federal Power Commission that a \u201cdocket number was assigned, and the receipt for the clerk\u2019s fees completed at 10:20 A.M.\u201d E.D.S.T. The clerk further informed the Commission that its counsel \u201cwill probably have to determine whether within the meaning of the statute a proceeding is \u2018instituted\u2019 when the clerk receives the petition in the mail, or when he assigns a docket number to the case and signs a receipt for the clerk\u2019s fees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b883-6\">In light of the materials now before this court it would appear that a proceeding should be deemed \u201cfirst instituted\u201d within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2112(a) when in accordance with the applicable rules of court and its practice, a petition shall have been accepted for filing by the clerk of the court. On that basis it would appear that the petitioners had first instituted the instant proceeding in this circuit. Accordingly, the Commission would seem to be required by section 2112(a) to file the record here.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-7\">In this view, issuance of a writ of mandamus is not presently warranted. Cf. International Union of Electrical R. &amp; M. Wkrs. AFL-CIO v. N. L. R. B\u201e 120 U.S.App.D.C. 45, 343 F.2d 327 (1965). The Commission has not yet filed the record elsewhere, and indeed has asked this court to enlarge the time in which to file a certified index of the record, pending the present decision. Therefore, the Commission may still file the record here, in conformity with the views we have expressed. Moreover, should the Commission for some reason file the record in the Third Circuit, presumably it would be open to the petitioners upon proper showing to urge that court to transfer Natural\u2019s petition to this Circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-9\">The motion for leave to intervene is granted. The petition for an order directing the Federal Power Commission to file in this court the record in F.P.C. docket No. RP 61-8 is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-10\">McGOWAN, Circuit Judge, did not participate in the consideration or decision in this matter.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
