Exclusive right to use the word \u201cpill\u201d apart from the trademark as presented is disclaimed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b705-23\">The issue is whether the above term is registrable on the Principal Register under the provisions of the Trademark Act of 1946 (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1051 et seq.). Appellant argues that \u201cthe pill\u201d has become distinctive of its goods and is therefore registrable under section 2(f) of the Trademark Act of 1946 (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1052(f)). The solicitor argues that the term is the \u201ccommon descriptive name\u201d of the <em>product, </em>an oral contraceptive, and does not in fact \u201cdistinguish Appellant\u2019s goods from the goods of others.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b705-24\">The Trademark Act of 1946 provides for federal registration of both \u201ctrademarks\u201d and \u201cmarks.\u201d These terms are defined in section 45 as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-25\"><em>Trademark. </em>The term \u201ctrademark\u201d includes any word, name, symbol, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>device or any combination thereof adopted and used by a manufacturer or merchant <em>to identify his goods and distinguish them from those manufactured or sold by others.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ajf-dedup-0\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A08\"><em>Mark. </em>The term \u201cmark\u201d includes any trademark, * * * <em>entitled to registration </em>under this Act whether registered or not. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">Thus, to qualify for registration the asserted mark must be a \u201ctrademark\u201d in the two-fold sense of (a) identifying the user\u2019s goods and (b) distinguishing such goods from those of others. Such a \u201ctrademark\u201d becomes registrable on the Principal Register only as it meets the conditions of section 2, as stated in the following applicable provisions :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-6\">\n<em>Sec. 2. Trademarks registrable on the principal register</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-7\">No trademark <em>by which the goods of the applicant may be distinguished from the goods of others </em>shall be refused registration on the principal register on account of its nature unless it\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-8\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AMP\">(e) consists of a <em>mark </em>which, (1) when applied to the goods of the applicant is <em>merely descriptive </em>* * * of them * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-15\">(f) [e]xcept as expressly excluded in paragraphs (a)-(d) of this section, nothing in this chapter shall prevent the registration of a <em>mark </em>used by the applicant which has become <em>distinctive of the applicant\u2019s goods </em>in commerce. * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b706-16\">From the foregoing it will be seen that section 2 limits registration on the Principal Register to \u201ctrademarks\u201d and \u201cmarks,\u201d and in its preamble repeats the restriction found in section 45 that a trademark must serve to <em>distinguish </em>applicant\u2019s goods from those of others. Subsection (e) prohibits the registration of a \u201cmark\u201d which is \u201cmerely descriptive\u201d of the goods while subsection (f), upon which appellant relies, provides the exception that nothing in Sec. 2 shall prevent the registration of a \u201cmark\u201d which has become \u201cdistinctive\u201d of the applicant\u2019s goods in commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-17\">The positions of the parties may be stated in additional detail in the terms of the statute.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Appellant argues that the term \u201cthe pill\u201d qualifies as a \u201ctrade<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>mark\u201d under section 45 and, while it might be said to be \u201cmerely descriptive\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> under section 2(e), the proofs of record show that it has become \u201cdistinctive\u201d of appellant\u2019s goods, section 2(f), and therefore registrable under section 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">The solicitor does not concede that the term \u201cthe pill\u201d distinguishes appellant\u2019s goods from those of others, as required by section 45 and the preamble in section 2. The solicitor\u2019s position is that the term does not qualify as a \u201ctrademark,\u201d section 45, <em>because </em>it is the \u201ccommon descriptive name\u201d of the <em>product </em>and therefore does not \u201cidentify\u201d or \u201cdistinguish\u201d appellant\u2019s goods from those of others, section 45 and preamble, section 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">The term, \u201ccommon descriptive name\u201d is found in section 14(c) (15 U. S.C. \u00a7 1064) which provides that a registered mark may be canceled \u201cif the registered mark becomes the common descriptive name of an article or substance.\u201d It expresses principles long recognized in trademark law that not <em>every </em>term can function as a trademark, e. g., common descriptive names. See Vandenburgh, Trademark Law and Procedure 4, 26, 60-62 (1959). Cf. J. Kohnstam v. Louis Marx &amp; Co., 280 F.2d 437, 440, 47 CCPA 1080, 1084. Where the term identifies <em>the product </em>to the public, it cannot serve to identify appellant\u2019s goods <em>or </em>distinguish them from those of others. When this occurs, the term is the \u201ccommon descriptive name\u201d or, if not \u201cdescriptive,\u201d the \u201ccommon name\u201d or \u201cgeneric\u201d name of the product and hence is incapable of serving as a trademark. If for such reason the term is subject to cancellation, it should not be registered.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-11\">If the solicitor\u2019s position is correct there is no need to reach the further inquiry as to whether the term per se is a combination of words which may <em>properly serve </em>as a trademark, sections 45, 2, or whether it is \u201cmerely descriptive\u201d under section 2(e) or whether from the evidence it is \u201cdistinctive\u201d of appellant\u2019s goods in commerce under section 2(f). See In re Meyer <em>&amp; </em>Wenthe, Inc., 267 F. 2d 945, 46 CCPA 919.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-12\">Appellant argues \u201cthe pill\u201d is not the common descriptive name of an oral contraceptive and thus that it qualifies as a \u201ctrademark\u201d or \u201cmark,\u201d since it includes a combination of \u201cwords\u201d and a \u201csymbol.\u201d Appellant states in its brief;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-13\">* * * the trademark \u201cthe pill\u201d comprises a unitary totality of three elements:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-15\">1\u2014 The article <em>the;</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-16\">2\u2014 The noun <em>pill, </em>which word has been disclaimed; and,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-17\">3\u2014 Quotation marks before and after the words <em>the pill </em>forming an in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>tegral part of the trademark and not merely employed to set off those two words.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">Appellant reasons that this \u201cunitary totality of three elements\u201d qualifies the term as a \u201ctrademark\u201d or \u201cmark\u201d which is registrable.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">Appellant argues that the evidence of record shows \u201cpublic recognition * * * of \u2018the pill\u2019 as a nominative pertaining only to Appellant,\u201d which \u201ccontinued subsequent to and notwithstanding F&amp;DA [Food and Drug Administration] approval of other manufacturers\u2019 oral contraceptive products and the commercial marketing of such competitive products.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">As background, appellant states in its brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-7\">The unitary expression \u201cthe pill\u201d originated, in peculiarly appropriate circumstances, as a nickname * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A3A\">-\u00bb -x * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-8\">Appellant\u2019s norethynodrel-eontain-ing product was the original and continues to be an outstanding member of its class. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-9\">-x -x -x -x -x *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-10\">This product, in the most formal sense, is distinguished by the famous trademark Enovid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-11\">*X* \u25a0X' \u2022Jv</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-12\">By late 1961, Appellant knew that hundreds of thousands of women were using the Enovid product. Most significantly, Appellant came also to know that many of these women, as well as physicians, retail pharmacists, wholesale drug employees, and other interested persons, had conferred the nickname \u201cthe pill\u201d on the product. Precisely when or how this soubriquet had its genesis cannot be documented 'with pinpoint precision. Nevertheless, the nickname stuck. When the public heard or said or wrote or read \u201cthe pill\u201d, it meant Appellant\u2019s Enovid product. And the expression, with the same meaning, likewise became current in the medical profession and the drug trade. Indeed, as other similar products have been developed by other manufacturers, these have sometimes been referred to as \u201canother\u201d pill or (manufacturer\u2019s name) pill.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-20\">But \u201cthe pill\u201d has specific and continuing meaning. Appellant\u2019s nor-ethynodrel-containing product is not this pill or that pill or indefinitely a pill or generally any pill. It is \u201cthe pill\u201d. To preserve this unique iden-tificatory significance, Appellant utilized \u201cthe pill\u201d extensively in its advertising, adopted the expression as a trademark, and filed the application which led eventually to this Appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b708-21\">We find, however, there is substantial evidence of record in support of the solicitor\u2019s position that the term \u201cthe pill\u201d serves merely to identify an oral contraceptive.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>In the foregoing we have set forth much of the evidence which supports the solicitor\u2019s position and, while we have not set forth the evidence supporting appellant\u2019s position, we have carefully considered it as it relates to the issue before us. We recognize also that not all of the evidence above referred to shows the exact term which appellant seeks to register. We consider it pertinent that a considerable amount of the evidence of record shows use of the words, the pill, <em>absent </em>quotation marks when these words are used in the context of meaning an oral contraceptive. There is considerable evidence which shows the term \u201cthe pill\u201d as it is sought to be registered having been used in connection with appellant\u2019s goods. At best, the evidence of record simply does not support appellant\u2019s position that the addition of quotation marks to an otherwise common descriptive name <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>converts it into a trademark. To the contrary we find substantial evidence that the term is the common descriptive name of an oral contraceptive pill at the time the issue of registrability was under consideration in the Patent Office. Roselux Chemical Co. v. Parsons Ammonia Co., 299 F.2d 855, 49 CCPA 931, 942.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">Under appropriate circumstances, we agree with appellant that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-5\">The acquisition of a nickname, by the original or an outstanding member of a class, is a familiar incident of American life. In politics and public affairs, in sports and entertainment, and in commerce and business, nicknames perform the important function of singular and specific identification.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-6\">A commercial nickname, applied by the trade and the general public to a product, is entitled to trademark status, Callmann, The Law of Unfair Competition and Trademarks (Second Edition, 1950):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-7\">\u201cIf the public calls a product by other than its tradename, this nickname may become a trade symbol entitled as such to protection against unfair competition. Whether or not, it is similar to the original trademark, the soubriquet is protected as an independent trademark if the owner formally adopts it as such or unprotestingly allows its continued use.\u201d (Page 1233)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b710-8\">Callmann, in support of the proposition that a nickname applied to a product by the public may become a trade symbol, cites such examples as \u201cBud\u201d for \u201cBudweiser,\u201d \u201cCoke\u201d for \u201cCoca-Cola,\u201d and the \u201cMet\u201d for the \u201cMetropolitan Opera Association.\u201d Such trade symbols clearly serve to identify the trademark owner and distinguish his goods from those of others and are not \u201cnicknames\u201d given by the public to identify a product per se. Callmann also states, at page 1232:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ADn\">* * * a mark may be so inescapably descriptive that it will defeat all attempts to transform it into a mark of identification and, in such a case, even long-continued use and large expenditures for advertising will not aid in the search for secondary meaning.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AC6\">Whether the objection to registration of \u201cthe pill\u201d is phrased as \u201chighly descriptive\u201d or \u201cinescapably descriptive\u201d or \u201ccommon descriptive name,\u201d or \u201ccommon name,\u201d or \u201cgeneric name,\u201d on the facts of record the basis for the objection is the same: the term \u201cthe pill\u201d here functions to identify the product to the public rather than to identify and distinguish appellant\u2019s goods from those of others and cannot be appropriated as a trademark. Where it appears from the evidence that registrability of the term is precluded under sections 45 and 2, inquiry under sections 2(e) and 2(f) is not necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-11\">The decision of the board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"Aovt\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b705-26\">. Application serial No. 142,567. First use in interstate commerce alleged as March 30, 1962.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b705-27\">. The disclaimer is made on the stated condition that it \u201cshall not prejudice to [sic] Applicant\u2019s rights in such trademark at common law.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b706-9\">. The precise grounds of the rejection which was affirmed by the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board are somewhat obscure.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-10\">The examiner in his letter of Sept. 11, 1963 in response to appellant\u2019s communication filed Jan. 7, 1963 stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-11\">The notation \u201cThe Pill\u201d is so <em>highly descriptive </em>and so commonly used to designate an oral medicinal preparation that <em>no amount of evidence </em>could convince the Examiner that the mark presented serves to <em>distinguish </em>applicant\u2019s goods in commerce.\u201d [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b706-12\">The examiner here used the phrase \u201chighly descriptive\u201d as apparently meaning that the term could not function as a trademark and therefore would not be \u201ccapable of distinguishing applicant\u2019s goods,\u201d sections 2, 45. On this basis it is not seen how the term would be eligible for registration on the Supplemental Register, section 23, Trademark Act of 1946, 15 ESC 1091.</p>\n<p id=\"ACf\">However, there is evidence that the examiner at one time considered the term to be \u201cmerely descriptive,\u201d section 2(e), in view of the earlier history of the prosecution. Appellant submitted evidence to prove distinctiveness under section 2(f) and this evidence was considered by the examiner but he then stated that \u201cno amount of evidence could convince the Examiner that the mark presented serves to distinguish applicant\u2019s goods in commerce.\u201d Thus, in terms of the statutes, it appears that the examiner\u2019s position was that the term was not a trademark as defined in section 45, and could not distinguish appellant\u2019s goods in commerce, sections 2, 45.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-19\">In the Examiner\u2019s Answer of Apr. 6, 1964 he stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-20\">Registration is refused for the reason that it is not believed that the mark presented serves or would be looked upon as a mark <em>indicating a source of origin in the applicant. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b706-21\">The examiner appears to have receded from his previous position. In terms of the statute, the term was not registrable because it did not \u201cidentify [appellant\u2019s] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>* * * goods,\u201d section 45, and was not therefore a trademark registrable on the Principal Register. Apparently the examiner considered the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-8\">The board, in affirming the examiner, relied on several grounds. It stated that the <em>evidence </em>show the term did not <em>identify </em>appellant\u2019s goods; further, that the <em>evidence </em>did not show that the term <em>distinguished </em>appellant\u2019s goods from those of another. Apparently the board reached this conclusion by comparing appellant\u2019s goods, an oral contraceptive, to other methods of contraception as at the time registration was sought appellant was the sole producer of an oral contraceptive in pill form which had received FDA approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-9\">The board also held the term \u201cthe pill\u201d was not such a combination of words which could be registered as a trademark, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-18\">* * * Manifestly, the utilization of the article \u201cthe\u201d and of the quotation marks cannot convert a simple notation comprising ordinary words of the English language used in their ordinary sense into a registrable trademark.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b707-20\">Thus apart from the evidence, the board seems to have found the term was not registrable as it could not serve as a trademark, section 45.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-21\">Finally, the board considered that the evidence showed that the term was the \u201ccommon descriptive name\u201d of an oral contraceptive which could not be registered for appellant\u2019s own exclusive use. Cf. section 14(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b707-23\">. Appellant does not argue the technical differences between a \u201cpill\u201d and a \u201ctablet.\u201d \u201cThe pill\u201d is apparently conceded to be descriptive of the nature of the goods, a pharmaceutical tablet.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b708-13\">.
