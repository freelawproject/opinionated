UNITED STATES of America, Appellee.</parties>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b558-5\">No. 19281.</docketnumber>\n<court data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b558-6\">United States Court of Appeals District of Columbia Circuit.</court>\n<otherdate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b558-7\">Argued Jan. 17, 1966.</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b558-8\">Decided March 31, 1966.</decisiondate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b558-14\">Mr. Edward P.

United States, and Edelin v. United States, 123 U.S.App.D.C. -, 359 F.2d 245, decided March 28, 1966.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-21\">In trials without a jury, with a court reporter in attendance, appellant was found guilty on six charges involving three alleged instances of unlawful .entry and petit larceny, and was sentenced to a total of 1620 days. On March 10, 1965, the D. C. Court of Appeals granted appellant leave to appeal <em>in forma pau-peris </em>and appointed counsel to represent him on appeal. On March 18, appointed counsel filed a very brief \u201creport\u201d to the D. C. Court of Appeals, setting forth appellant\u2019s contentions, and concluding, in language identical to that used by appointed counsel in <em>Edelin, </em>that there had been no denial of a \u201cfair and impartial trial\u201d to appellant. That report contains no analysis of any points that might be raised on appeal. On the same day the D. C. Court of Appeals, with no transcript or statement of proceedings and evidence before it, granted appointed counsel leave to withdraw, and revoked leave to appeal <em>in forma pauperis. </em>We granted appellant\u2019s motion for leave to appeal to this court on October 6, 1965.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-22\">The case is on all fours with <em>Edelin, </em>where, as here, appellant did not have the benefit of a transcript of trial pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>ceedings on appeal, and did not receive adequate representation by appointed counsel acting as advocate rather than amicus curiae.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">The judgment of the D. C. Court of Appeals must be reversed and the case remanded for appointment of new counsel and preparation of a transcript of trial proceedings at the expense of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-9\">It is so ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
