It appears by stipulation of the parties, that at the time the information was filed, appellants were operating a. ferry across said river, from Florence, in Pike county, to Harris Landing, in Scott county, claiming to be the legal owners and holders of a certain charter granted to one George W. ' Babbitt by an act of the General Assembly of the State of Illinois, entitled an act to establish a ferry across said river at Florence, approved February 9, 1867, and that Theodore W. \u25a0Bechdoldt also claimed to be the legal owner of said charter, and was attempting to operate a ferry between said points. Said stipulation then proceeds: \u201cAnd whereas, by reason of the conflicting claims of said parties, and their efforts to operate two different ferries between the same points and under the same charter and franchise, numerous difficulties and disturbances have taken and are now continually taking place, and the proper operation of said ferry interrupted and interfered with, and thereby the rights and interests of the public greatly prejudiced, it is therefore hereby agreed that the State\u2019s attorney of said Pike county, Illinois, shall file an information in the nature of a quo warranto, at the relation of the said Theodore W. Bechdoldt, against the said James Gunter man and Elizabeth Mitchell, for the purpose of determining the rights in the premises; and it is further agreed, that the presentation of a petition for leave to file such information is hereby waived, and the court or the judge thereof in vacation, may, without further or other proceedings, order the information to be filed and process to issue.\u201d In pursuance of this stipulation an information was filed, charging appellant with usurping and unlawfully holding said ferry franchise, setting up the grant of the charter mentioned in the stipulation, and a conveyance of the same by Babbitt, through a regular chain \u25a0 of title, to the relator, Bechdoldt.</summary><summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b519-5\" pgmap=\"519\">Motion to quash the information, and a demurrer thereto, both being overruled, several pleas were filed by the defendants, all of which were disposed of on demurrer except the second \u25a0and fifth. The second avers that the respondents are the legal owners of said ferry franchise, while the fifth makes the same claim, but sets up a transfer of the charter from Babbitt to them through intervening parties, by a sale and delivery of possession, and the successive parties to whom the transfers were made, operated said ferry for more than twenty years, continuously, prior to the filing of the information, claiming and holding themselves out to the public to be the absolute owners of the same. To these pleas general replications were filed, and a hearing had before the court without the interven-, Mon of a jury.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b520-4\" pgmap=\"520\">Messrs.

It is always transferred by grant, and not-by livery. It is an incorporeal hereditament, and must be transferred by deed. Dundy v. Chambers, 23 Ill. 369; Bridge Co. v. Lonergan, 91 id. 508; 3 Kent\u2019s Com. 468; 1 Hilliard on Real Prop. 1.</p> <opinion data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b522-5\" pgmap=\"522\">Mr. Justice Wilkin</author> <p id=\"AOb\" pgmap=\"522\">delivered the opinion of the Court:</p> <p id=\"b522-6\" pgmap=\"522\">In our view of the law applicable to this case, there is no substantial conflict in the evidence as to the controlling facts. It is admitted by all parties, that by act of the legislature George W. Babbitt became seized of a charter authorizing him to established and operate the ferry in question for a period \u25a0of thirty years, from February 9, 1867, and that, by valid \u25a0deeds of conveyance from him through other parties, one Peter Van Meter became the legal owner thereof in 1879, who was then exercising the privilege granted by said charter by operating said ferry. It is not claimed that Van Meter conveyed the franchise by deed to respondents, or other persons under whom they claim, nor that he even delivered to them or such other parties the original charter or title papers held by him \u2022conveying said property. It is also conceded that possession under whatever transfer was made by Van Meter to those under \u25a0 whom the respondents claim title, did not begin until the year 1879, and hence no prescriptive right can be maintained on that possession. Appellants are therefore driven to the position, that by proof of a verbal contract of sale by Van Meter, payment of the purchase money and delivery of possession under such contract, an equitable title to said ferry franchise passed to them, and those from whom they purchased, which will in law protect them in their present possession and use \u25a0of said ferry privilege.</p> <p id=\"b522-7\" pgmap=\"522(52) 523(99)\">This is not, as contended by counsel, a controversy between individuals, merely. The stipulation of the parties as to the object of the proceeding, as well as the information itself, dearly shows that it is the public right which is sought to be , protected. The defendants are charged with unlawfully usurping a public franchise. They could only successfully defend against that charge by showing that they were not using a franchise, or that they had a legal right to use it. (Illinois Midland Ry. Co. v. People ex rel. 84 Ill. 427; Holden v. People ex rel. 90 id. 434.) They have attempted to do the latter by showing that they were the rightful owners of said franchise, and the burthen of proof was upon them to show a valid title. Clark v. People ex rel. 15 Ill. 217; People ex rel. v. Ridgley et al. 21 id. 65.</p> <p id=\"b523-5\" pgmap=\"523\">In Dundy v. Chambers et ad. 23 Ill. 369, this court expressly held that a ferry franchise like the one in question could only be conveyed by deed. The correctness of that decision has not, so far as we know, been questioned, but was approved in Mississippi River Bridge Co. v. Lonergan, 91 Ill. 508. It is true that it was held in the latter case, that one who had purchased such property and entered into the possession thereof could maintain an action for an injury to such property against a trespasser; but that holding does not aid the defendants on the issues in this case. Here the question is, have the defendants shown a valid title. A defective title will not do,\u2014much less a mere equitable right to a title. It is said in People ex. rel. v. Ridgley, supra, a defective title is understood to be, and is, in contemplation of law, the same as no title whatever, and\" a party exercising an office or franchise of a public nature is considered as a mere usurper unless he has a good and complete title in every respect. Giving appellants, then, the full benefit of all they claim, they have wholly failed in their defense.</p> <p id=\"b523-6\" pgmap=\"523\">What is here said disposes of the substantial objections raised to the judgment of the circuit court, and other questions discussed in the argument become unimportant.</p> <p id=\"b523-7\" pgmap=\"523\">The judgment will be affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b523-8\" pgmap=\"523\">' Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
