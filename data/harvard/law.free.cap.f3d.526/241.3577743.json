SMITH, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b266-15\">The defendant, \u201cSealed Appellant,\u201d pleaded guilty of using a minor to engage in sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of creating visual depictions, contrary to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2251(a),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and possessing child pornography, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(a)(5)(B).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On appeal, he argues that \u00a7 2251(a) exceeds Congress\u2019s Commerce Clause authority and that the district court erred in failing to suppress evidence from an unlawful search, thus calling into question the applicability of \u00a7 2252A(a)(5)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-16\">The defendant, however, did not reserve any right to appeal the denial of his motions to quash the indictment and to suppress evidence. \u201cIt is well settled that by entering a plea of guilty, a defendant ordinarily waives all non-jurisdictional defects in the proceedings below,\u201d <em>United States v. Bell, </em>966 F.2d 914, 915 (5th Cir.1992), and \u201cif the record contains no manifestation of a reservation of appellate rights, the plea is presumptively mconditional and an appellate court may not reach the merits of the defendant\u2019s appeal,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 917. We have repeatedly held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>that this doctrine applies to denials of motions to suppress.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Defendant, consequently, has waived his \"suppression argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">The doctrine of waiver-by-guilty plea also afflicts defendant\u2019s constitutional challenge to \u00a7 2251(a). He argues that Congress acted <em>ultra vires </em>in enacting that provision, but his contention does not implicate the jurisdiction of the district court to accept his unconditional guilty plea. The \u201cnon-jurisdictional defects\u201d language in <em>Bell </em>does not refer to legislative jurisdiction, but only to judicial jurisdiction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-6\">[T]he nexus with interstate commerce, which courts frequently call the \u201cjurisdictional element,\u201d is simply one of the essential elements of [a federal criminal statute]. Although courts frequently call it the \u201cjurisdictional element\u201d of the statute, it is \u201cjurisdictional\u201d only in the shorthand sense that without that nexus, there can be no federal crime under the ... statute. It is not jurisdictional in the sense that it affects a court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction, <em>ie., </em>a court\u2019s constitutional or statutory power to adjudicate a case ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b267-12\"><em>United States v. Martin, </em>147 F.3d 529, 531-32 (7th Cir.1998).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b267-13\">Because defendant unconditionally pleaded guilty, he has waived the arguments that he now presses on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b266-11\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2251(a) (\u201cAny person who employs, uses, persuades, induces, entices, or coerces any minor to engage in, or who has a minor assist any other person to engage in, or who transports any minor in interstate or foreign commerce, or in any Territory or Possession of the United States, with the intent that such minor engage in, any sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of producing any visual depiction of such conduct, shall be punished ... if such person knows or has reason to know that such visual depiction will be transported in interstate or foreign commerce or mailed, if that visual depiction was produced using materials that have been mailed, shipped, or transported in interstate or foreign commerce by any means, including by computer, or if such visual depiction has actually been transported in interstate or foreign commerce or mailed.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b266-18\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(a)(5)(B) (\"Any person who ... knowingly possesses any book, magazine, periodical, film, videotape, computer disk, or any other material that contains an image of child pornography that has been mailed, or shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce by any means, including by computer, or that was produced using materials that have been mailed, or shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce by any means, including by computer ... shall be punished____\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b267-7\">. <em>See, e.g., United States v.

This ... claim also must fail, however, because the \u2018jurisdictional element\u2019 is merely one element of the criminal activity .... The interstate commerce element ... implicates the power of Congress to regulate tire conduct at issue, not the jurisdiction of the court to hear a particular case.
