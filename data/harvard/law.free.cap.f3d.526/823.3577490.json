He also pled guilty to two counts of aiding and abetting the possession with intent to distribute MDMA, violating 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) &amp; (b)(1)(C), and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2. He was sentenced to concurrent sentences of eighty-seven months of imprisonment and three years of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-26\">On appeal, Tushnet accepts the district court\u2019s factual determination that he was accountable for 45,331 MDMA pills. He argues, though, that the court improperly calculated the weight of the pills. Tushnet contends that the court erred by using the \u201cpresumed weight\u201d of 250 mg per MDMA pill suggested by the Typical Weight Per Unit Table contained in the application notes of the United States Sentencing Guidelines, Section 2D1.1. He argues that the district court should have used the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>figure of 100 mg per pill because each of the approximately 5000 pills analyzed by the Drug Enforcement Administration\u2019s (DEA) lab report contained 100 mg of MDMA. Had the district court used the lesser weight, Tushnet\u2019s base offense level would have been two levels less.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\">This Court reviews the district court\u2019s interpretation and application of the Sentencing Guidelines <em>de novo\\ </em>the district court\u2019s factual findings are reviewed on appeal for clear error. <em>United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 202, 203 n. 9 (5th Cir.2005). Contrary to Tush-net\u2019s contention, the relevant weight is not the actual weight of MDMA detected in each pill, but rather \u2014 as the indictment charges \u2014 the entire weight of any \u201cmixture or substance containing a detectable amount\u201d of MDMA.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">Under the Sentencing Guidelines, except when \u201cotherwise specified, the weight of a controlled substance set forth in the table refers to the entire weight of any mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of the controlled substance.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c), Note A to the Drug Quantity Table. On the other hand, when the Guidelines refer to the net weight of a drug rather than the gross weight of the \u201cfiller\u201d and drug together, the designation \u201c(actual)\u201d is used. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c), Note B to the Drug Quantity Table (\u201cThe terms \u2018PCP (actual)\u2019, \u2018Amphetamine (actual)\u2019, and \u2018Methamphetamine (actual)\u2019 refer to the weight of the controlled substance, itself, contained in the mixture or substance.\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">MDMA is not among the controlled substances listed in the Drug Quantity Table we just discussed. However, the same approach \u2014 using the pure drug weight only when that is specifically designated\u2014 is continued in the Typical Weight Per Unit Table that does apply to MDMA. There, an asterisk appears next to a named drug when the amount of the controlled substance alone is intended and not the drug\u2019s weight in combination with a filler. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, Application Note 11. MDMA is not one of the drugs designated with an asterisk. <em>Cf. Chapman v. United States, </em>500 U.S. 453, 459, 111 S.Ct. 1919, 114 L.Ed.2d 524 (1991) (statute in some instances indicates that the weight of the pure drug is used to determine a sentence; when statute does not so indicate, presumption is that relevant weight is that of the mixture which contains the drug).</p>\n<p id=\"b832-9\">Accordingly, the 100 mg of MDMA per-pill amount was not the relevant figure for the district court\u2019s calculations. The district court did not err in applying the presumed typical weight of 250 mg indicated by the Sentencing Guidelines when calculating Tushnet\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b832-7\">. Although MDMA is not specifically included in lite Drug Quantity Table to which Note B applies (the amount of MDMA must first be converted into marihuana terms), the Drug Equivalency Tables \u2014 where MDMA is included \u2014 make comparable distinctions. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, Application Note 10(E) <em>(e.g., </em>\"1 gm of Methamphetamine\u201d equals <em>\u201c2 </em>kg of marihuana\u201d; \"1 gm of Methamphetamine (actual)\u201d equals \u201d20 kg of marihuana\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
