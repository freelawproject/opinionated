The defendant Gleason had a contract dated February 11, 1908, with the \u201cPalmer &amp; Singer Mfg. Company\u201d of New York which controlled the output of the \u201cSimplex Automobile Company.\u201d By its terms he was given the exclusive right \u201cfor the sale of automobiles\u201d in \u201cthe City of Boston . . . and the territory within a radius of fifty . . . miles from the center of said City,\u201d with subagencies to be established by him within three months from the date of the contract in all cities in the territory \u201chaving a population of over 25,000.\u201d The contract expired by limitation on January 1, 1910; an option however of renewal was given if prior to that time Gleason had purchased and accepted delivery of a certain number of \u201cSimplex automobiles,\u201d and \u201cin <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>all respects\u201d had complied with the agreement. The contract appears to have been in force on July 21, 1908, when Gleason \u201cwas petitioned into involuntary bankruptcy.\u201d But the master states that \u201cwhile he enumerated it in his bankruptcy schedules, he claimed it did not pass to his trustee because of its personal nature and because it did not in its terms include his assigns.\u201d It was after his bankruptcy that he \u201cformed a plan to capitalize his contract ... by assigning it to a corporation and issuing stock against it.\u201d A corporation accordingly was organized under the laws of the State of Maine on August 28, 1908, with a capital of $25,000, \u201cto manufacture, purchase, repair, or in any way to deal in automobiles and motors of all kinds,\u201d and \u201cthree shares of stock only were issued when its charter was granted.\u201d The efforts to interest various parties in the enterprise, and induce them to purchase stock, although detailed in the report, need not be repeated. The corporation \u201cvoted to issue its full capital stock\u201d to the defendant Mahar \u201cfor the contract of Gleason ... or a similar one to be given by the Palmer, Singer Company with the new corporation, to be obtained by Gleason in exchange for the one then held by him.\u201d The master finds, that the full capital stock was issued originally to Mahar for Gleason and that the subsequent transfers were in accordance with the arrangement stated by counsel for Gleason at a meeting of all parties in interest on September 12, 1908. We now revert to the terms of this agreement participated in by all parties in interest whereby \u201c . . . the stock was all to be issued ... to Mahar to be held for Gleason\u2019s benefit and that the respective quarters were to be transferred by Mahar to the various parties . . . named when they should pay their amounts in full. The amounts so paid were to be used for the purchase of cars by Gleason to be sold by the plaintiff company and the profits made on these sales were to belong to the company.\u201d The stock having been transferred by Mahar to the purchasers, who paid cash, he apparently had received the entire proceeds of the company\u2019s capital, but whether the price was less than its par value does not specifically appear. The report is silent, but this defendant admits in his answer that the money \u201cwas turned over to him ... by Mahar.\u201d It was under these circumstances that on September 17, 1908, five days after the agreement of promotion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>had been entered into and the transfers of stock had been effected,. that \u201cMahar and Gleason went to New York to interview the Palmer and Singer Manufacturing Company relative to a new contract and to order automobiles to be sold by the plaintiff company under the new contract,\u201d which is referred to in the report. This contract which was to expire by limitation September 1, 1911, is dated September 17, 1908, and purports to be executed in behalf of the plaintiff by its treasurer. It grants to the plaintiff the exclusive right for the sale of automobiles handled by the Palmer and Singer Manufacturing Company within the territory of \u201cBoston, Mass., and fifty . . . miles surrounding.\u201d The contract with Gleason covering the same areas is not shown to have been cancelled, or assigned to the plaintiff. But this is of no consequence. It is plain from the report that the order for the \u201ctwo cars\u201d in question to be shipped \u201cto the . . . company\u201d was given under the contract with the plaintiff or \u201cthe new contract\u201d as the master finds. A deposit of $3,400 was made upon the order, but by whom the money was advanced is not stated. It became necessary when the automobiles arrived to pay for them in full before the bill of lading could be obtained and delivery made to the plaintiff. The necessary amount having been furnished by one Holcombe, the plaintiff secured possession. The title to the automobiles was in the plaintiff, and the sale of one of them to Geiger as alleged in the bill and admitted in the answers was as found by the master a gale by the plaintiff under its contract with the Palmer and . Singer Manufacturing Company. But the report does not show that either the customer was procured, or the sale was negotiated by Gleason. The decree for the plaintiff rests upon the following conclusions by the master. \u201cIn the sale to . . . Geiger ... an automobile called an Apperson car was received in exchange as part of the purchase consideration. The Apperson car was . delivered to one LeFevre in settlement of a claim against Gleason. The only interest the plaintiff company has in that transaction is the determination of how far the Apperson car figured as a profit in the sale to Mr. Geiger. To that extent it did. I find that the value of the Apperson car at that time was $800 and upon that basis the defendants, Mahar and Gleason, should account to the plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b425-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>If on the record Gleason is not shown to have been a stockholder or to have been entitled to any share in the sales of automobiles, yet by his contract with the company the cars were \u201cto be sold by the . . . company and the profits made on these sales were to belong to the company.\u201d While the transaction described was under the company\u2019s contract with the Palmer and Singer Manufacturing Company, it resulted in the payment of his debt to LePevre and decreased accordingly the amount which otherwise would have been received by the plaintiff. The value of the Apperson car which Gleason had thus received was a direct benefit, or a profit on the sale which he could not retain under his agreement with the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-3\">The defendant Mahar however is not shown to have taken any part in the sale, or to have had at the time of the transaction any title to or control over the Apperson car, or to have been connected in any way with LeFevre. The stock of the corporation was to be held by him solely for Gleason\u2019s benefit, who was to use the money received from its distribution \u201cfor the purchase of cars\u201d to be sold by the plaintiff. We are of opinion that after the entire agreement had been consummated and put in operation Mahar sustained no contractual or fiduciary relation to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">It follows that the interlocutory and final decree as to the defendant Gleason are affirmed with costs, but as to the defendant Mahar the interlocutory decree overruling his second, third and fourth exceptions, and the final decree, charging him jointly with Gleason for the value of the Apperson car, must be reversed, and a decree entered dismissing the bill as to him with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">\n<em>Ordered accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
