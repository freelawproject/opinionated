Rubin &amp; others.</parties>\n<court data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b66-5\">Suffolk.</court>\n<otherdate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"Aqj\">December 19, 1921.</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"As1\">March 3, 1922.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b66-6\">Present: Rtjgg, C. J., Braley, De Cotjrcy, Carroll, &amp; Jennet, JJ.</p>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b66-7\"><em>Evidence, </em>Of genuineness of signature; Opinion: expert; Presumptions and burden of proof. <em>Bills and Notes.</em></headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b66-8\">Where, at the trial of an action against an indorser upon a negotiable promissory note, the genuineness of the signature of the defendant was denied and there were submitted to the jury standard signatures of the defendant, which were introduced by the plaintiff and which the defendant admitted to be genuine, the jury were warranted in finding the defendant\u2019s signature upon the note to be genuine although no handwriting expert so testified, there was no direct affirmative evidence to that effect, and a handwriting expert called by the defendant testified to the contrary.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b66-9\">Contract against the maker and the indorsers of a negotiable promissory note for $500, made by Massachusetts Iron and Metal Company payable to the Chelsea Iron and Coal Company, and indorsed by the payee, \u201cDavid M. Rubin, Prop.,\u201d and by \u201cF. Herschman\u201d and Max D. Rubin. Writ in the Municipal Court of the City of Boston dated December 21, 1916.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b66-10\">On removal to the Superior Court, the action was tried before <em>Sanderson, </em>J. The defence was that the note was forged by David M. Rubin. All the defendants denied the genuineness of their respective signatures. Standards of the signature of the defendant F. Herschman, admitted by him to be genuine, were in evidence. A handwriting expert, called by the defendant, testified that the signature \u201cF. Hershman\u201d was not genuine. , No handwriting expert testified for the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b66-11\">At the close of the evidence the defendant Herschman made the motion and requests for rulings described in the opinion. The motion was denied and the requests were refused. The jury found for the plaintiff against the defendant Herschman and in favor of all the other defendants, stating, in answer to inquiries by the judge, that in their opinion the defendant Herschman \u201csigned it [the note] personally\u201d and that it was his own signature. The defendant Herschman alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b66-12\">The defendant Herschman died on December 30, 1918, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>Minnie Herschman, administratrix of his estate, was admitted as a defendant on November 18, 1919.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AO\">The case was submitted on briefs.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AOF\"><em>C.

Hershman,\u201d appearing as an indorser on the promissory note declared on, was affixed by him or by his authority. R. L. c. 173, \u00a7 86. <em>True </em>v. <em>Dillon, </em>138 Mass. 347. <em>Boles </em>v. <em>Harding, </em>201 Mass. 103, 106. The record recites that \u201c several genuine signatures of this defendant were admitted and introduced in evidence as standards and submitted to the jury.\u201d The defendant however asked the court for a directed verdict, and to rule that \u201cthere is no sufficient evidence that this defendant ever indorsed or authorized the indorsement of the note in suit, sufficient for the plaintiff to recover.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AzY\">The motion and request were denied rightly. It is argued that the proof failed because there was no affirmative evidence for the jury of the genuineness of the defendant\u2019s signature. While the plaintiff could have introduced the opinion of experts, or of those who were familiar with the defendant\u2019s handwriting, <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Huse, </em>10 Mass. 39, <em>Moody </em>v. <em>Rowell, </em>17 Pick. 490, the jury nevertheless had before them the standards admitted without objection and could make the necessary comparisons for themselves. <em>Homer </em>v. <em>Wallis, </em>11 Mass. 308. <em>Richardson </em>v. <em>Newcomb, </em>21 Pick. 315, 317. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sturtevant, </em>117 Mass. 122, 133. Wigmore on Ev. \u00a7\u00a7 2016, 2020, 2921.</p>\n<p id=\"AvQ\">The defendant\u2019s second request which the court declined to grant, that \u201cThere is no sufficient evidence of any adoption or ratification on the part of this defendant of the indorsement of his name on the note in suit sufficient to entitle the plaintiff to recover\u201d has become immaterial in view of the specific finding of the jury, that the defendant signed the note personally: \u201cIt was his own signature.\u201d <em>Cunningham </em>v. <em>Parks, </em>97 Mass. 172. <em>Hart </em>v. <em>Brierley, </em>189 Mass. 598.</p>\n<p id=\"AQ5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
