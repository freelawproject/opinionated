The bequest is \u201cin equal shares to my cousins, nephews and nieces, living at my death.\u201d If she had said my \u201cfirst and second cousins,\u201d the degree of consanguinity of the defendants would have been material. <em>Corporation of Bridgnorth </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>15 Sim. 538, 541. But the bequest to \u201c cousins \u201d in the absence of any testamentary language limiting her meaning, includes only first cousins; the child or children of an uncle or aunt. <em>Stoddart </em>v. <em>Nelson, </em>6 De G., M. &amp; G. 68, 73. <em>Caldecott </em>v. <em>Harrison, </em>9 Sim. 457, 461. <em>Sanderson </em>v. <em>Bayley, </em>4 Myl. &amp; Cr. 56. <em>Stevenson </em>v. <em>Abingdon, </em>31 Beav. 305. <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Chambers, </em>85 N. J. Eq. 376, 377. We are therefore of opinion, that the word \u201ccousins\u201d was used by the testatrix in the ordinary lexical and legal meaning, and that the decree ordering distribution among the grandnephews and grandnieces, and the first cousins to the exclusion of the second cousins, should be affirmed with costs to be taxed upon the fund as between solicitor and client. <em>Dana </em>v. <em>Dana, </em>185 Mass. 156. <em>Mullaney </em>v. <em>Monahan, </em>230 Mass. 245; <em>S.
