The case is here on the plaintiff\u2019s appeals from interlocutory decrees overruling its exceptions to the master\u2019s report, confirming the report, and denying a motion for an injunction; and from the final decree dismissing the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">Up to 1920 the defendant, while carrying on business alone, did so under his name \u201cSamuel Lipsky\u201d or \u201cLipsky &amp; Company.\u201d On his application to the Probate Court duly made and published under It. L. c. 154, \u00a7 12, his name was changed to Samuel Libby in February, 1920; and in May he changed the name under which he was doing business to \u201cLibby &amp; Libby Co. of Massachusetts.\u201d The plaintiff, in support of its motion for an injunction, relies upon the numerous cases where courts have enjoined a competitor from fraudulently putting on the semblance of somebody else, for the purpose of passing off his goods as the goods of that other person. <em>Samuels </em>v. <em>Spitzer, </em>177 Mass. 226. <em>Poiret </em>v. <em>Jules Poiret Ltd. &amp; A. F. Nash, </em>37 R. P. C. 177. <em>Wotherspoon </em>v. <em>Currie, L. </em>R. 5 H. L. 508. <em>Valentine Meat Juice Co. </em>v. <em>Valentine Extract Co. Ltd. </em>17 R. P. C. 673. <em>Chas. S. Higgins Co. </em>v. <em>Higgins Soap </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number><em>Co. </em>144 N. Y. 462. <em>Herring-Hall-Marvin Safe Co. </em>v. <em>Hall\u2019s Safe Co. </em>208 U. S. 554. The adoption by the defendant of \u201cLibby &amp; Libby Co. of Massachusetts\u201d rather than \u201cSamuel Libby\u201d as the style under which to conduct his business, standing alone might well raise a suspicion that his real intent was to infringe on the plaintiff\u2019s proprietary rights. But the record discloses much more. The master, who heard the witnesses, and whose findings of fact we must accept unless they are plainly wrong, specifically finds: \u201cThe defendant believed that it would help his business if he adopted an American name, and he chose \u2018Libby\u2019 partly because it closely resembled \u2018Lipsky\u2019 and partly because it was a name carrying prestige in the meat business. I do not find, however, that he chose the name \u2018Libby\u2019 with intent to obtain trade by leading the public to believe that, when dealing with him, they were dealing with the plaintiff, or that he adopted the designation of \u2018Libby &amp; Libby Co. of Massachusetts\u2019 with that object. I am disposed to accept the defendant\u2019s explanation that he wished to do business under the name of \u2018Libby &amp; Libby Co.\u2019 in order to give the impression that the business was growing and that he added the words \u2018of Massachusetts\u2019 so as to meet a possible contention that he was holding out his business as that of the plaintiff.\u201d He also found: \u201cShortly after the defendant began to do business under the name of \u2018Libby &amp; Libby Co. of Massachusetts\u2019 the plaintiff learned of the fact and began an investigation into the character of the defendant\u2019s business. So far as appears, however, this investigation did not disclose that the defendant was getting any trade away from the plaintiff through the use of the name or was in any other way causing appreciable damage to the plaintiff. Neither is it shown that the defendant has in any way attempted to pass his business off as or for the business of the plaintiff, except as the use of the name \u2018Libby &amp; Libby Co. of Massachusetts\u2019 may be regarded as such an attempt; the defendant has never used in his business the name \u2018Libby\u2019 alone or the name \u2018McNeill\u2019 either alone or in combination with \u2018Libby.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">It being established by the master\u2019s report that the defendant\u2019s conduct was not actuated by a fraudulent intent to deceive, there occurs the further question, whether a manifest liability to deception arises from the mere similarity between the plaintiff\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>name and that employed in business by the defendant. Has the name adopted by the defendant misled, or is it likely to mislead, \u201cthose with whom the parties deal and among whom they look for business?\u201d <em>Hub Dress Manuf. Co. </em>v. <em>Rottenberg, </em>237 Mass. 281, 284. The answer depends upon the facts as found by the master. The defendant does not deal in canned or cured meats, fruits, evaporated milk, jellies or other articles, which constitute so large a portion of the plaintiff\u2019s business. The only business in which he could come in conflict with the plaintiff is in the sale of fresh meat at wholesale to other dealers in the market district. He does no retail business. The plaintiff corporation has had no place of business in the market district since 1915. Its cut meats are sold mostly through a firm of commission merchants, who carry a stock of the plaintiff\u2019s meats and sell from this stock in their own name. No distinguishing mark has been placed upon fresh meats by either of the parties; and \u201cit would be difficult, if not impossible, even for one familiar with the business, to determine by examining any given piece of fresh meat belonging to the general class dealt in by both parties whether it had been sold by the plaintiff, by the defendant, or by some third person.\u201d The master finds that not only was there no evidence of any purchaser\u2019s mistaking the defendant\u2019s fresh meats for those of the plaintiff, but that \u201cthere is practically no chance that any one in the trade will buy of the defendant in the belief that he is dealing with the plaintiff, or that the sale of the plaintiff\u2019s meats at retail will be interfered with by the defendant\u2019s use of these names.\u201d Without reciting further findings as to the failure to show any damage caused by the defendant\u2019s use of the name \u201cLibby &amp; Libby Co. of Massachusetts,\u201d as he now uses it, we are of opinion that the plaintiff is not entitled to the injunction prayed for, on the facts as found by the master. <em>Burns </em>v. <em>William J. Burns International Detective Agency, Inc. </em>235 Mass. 553. <em>Hub Dress Manuf. Co. </em>v. <em>Rottenberg, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s exceptions to the master\u2019s report are largely disposed of by what has been said, and need not be further discussed. It may be added, however, that the findings are based on and confined to the business of the defendant as heretofore conducted, and as interpreted by the master. We are not now concerned with possible future conduct which might give to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>defendant\u2019s business methods an aspect materially different from that apparent from the master\u2019s report. On the record now presented we find no error in the interlocutory decrees. The final decree, dismissing the bill without costs, must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-3\">\n<em>Ordered accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
