On February 13, the insured went on a journey, after a conversation with his brother, in consequence of which the brother signed a check payable to the company for the amount of the premium on February 16, which was delivered to the company on February 19 and was collected by it on February 21. The applicant continued in good health until February 16, was taken seriously ill on February 17 or 18 and died on February 20.

Material evidence and exceptions saved by the plaintiff are described in the opinion. At the close of the evidence, verdicts were ordered for the defendant, and the judge reported the actions to this court \u201cfor its determination upon all of the exceptions taken during the trial to the admission or exclusion of evidence and so as to cover the claim of the plaintiffs that by the recital in the policies of the receipt of the premium the defendant is estopped from denying that it was so received, and the claim of the plaintiff that what took place on February 16, 1918, in regard to the premium, together with the talk between the insured and the insurance agent, amounted to payment, and that the check was in the hands of the defendant company by virtue of being subject to call by the insurance agent. If, upon the evidence which has been properly admitted, the foregoing facts agreed upon and such other evidence as has been offered and not admitted which should have been admitted, verdicts should not have been ordered for the defendant, judgment is to be entered for the plaintiff in the case in which Esther Ansin is plaintiff, in the sum of $5,000, together with interest thereon at six per cent from March 1, 1918; and judgment for the plaintiff in the action in which Esther Ansin, guardian of Charlotte Ansin, is plaintiff, in the sum of $2,500, together with interest thereon at six per cent from March 1, 1918; and judgment for the plaintiff in the action in which Esther Ansin, guardian of Mildred Ansin, is plaintiff, in the sum of $2,500, together with interest thereon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>at six per cent from March 1, 1918.

The policies and application are alike in each case with the exception of the names of the beneficiaries and the amounts involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">There was evidence that on or about February 5,1918, Michael Ansin signed an application for the issuance to him of the policies in question; that the application contained the following provision: \u201cThe proposed policy shall not take effect unless and until the first premium shall have been paid during my continuance in good health, and unless also the policy shall have been delivered to and received by me during my continuance in good health . . .\u201d; that the- application was obtained by Samuel Aisner, an agent of the defendant, and the policies were delivered to Michael Ansin on or about February 12, 1918, at the office of his brother, David; that Michael went to New York on February 13, 1918, where he was taken seriously ill on February 17 <em>or </em>18 and died on February 20, 1918. The defendant contends that the premiums were not paid while the insured was in good health, and that therefore the policies never had any validity.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">The plaintiff offered to show that, at the time the policies were delivered, Michael Ansin stated to the defendant\u2019s agent, Aisner, that it was not convenient for him to pay the premiums until Saturday (February 16, 1918); that Aisner replied that he would pay the premiums and keep the policies in force, and that Ansin could pay him on Saturday; and that the agent told Ansin that the policies would be in force from the time of their delivery. This evidence was excluded subject to the plaintiff\u2019s exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">David Ansin testified that, before his brother left for New York, he had a talk with him and in consequence of directions given him by his brother he signed a check dated February 16,1918, payable to the defendant. The plaintiff offered to show that on Saturday, February 16, Aisner called David Ansin on the telephone and asked bim if his brother had left a check for the premiums and was . told that he had; that Aisner asked him to hold the check until <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>he called for it, and that David Ansin agreed to do so. This evidence was excluded subject to the plaintiff\u2019s exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-3\">On the following Tuesday, February 19, Aisner received the check and delivered it to the defendant\u2019s general manager; it was collected by the defendant two days later.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">It is agreed that the insured continued in good health through Saturday, February 16, 1918. The defendant claimed and the plaintiff admitted that the check was not manually in the hands of the defendant company earlier than- Tuesday, February 19, 1918, about noon, and at that time Michael Ansin was not in good health. It is also agreed that the only actual money or anything that represented money which passed between Michael Ansin and the company was the check.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">The burden rested upon the plaintiff to prove that the policies were delivered and the first premium paid while Michael Ansin was in good health; it was made a part of the application and embodied in the policies; it is a condition precedent to recovery. <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Prudential Life Ins. Co. </em>203 Mass. 299. The contention of the plaintiff that the jury could have found that the check for the premiums was held by David Ansin at the request and under the direction of the defendant\u2019s agent, and that as a result of the conversation between them, the check was held by David Ansin at the request of the agent of the defendant and constituted a payment of the premiums, cannot be sustained. The conversation was properly excluded. The application expressly provides that no agent or other person except certain officers named has power \u201cto make, modify or discharge this or any contract of insurance, to extend the time for paying a premium, to waive any lapse or forfeiture or any of the Company\u2019s rights or requirements.\u201d <em>Whiting </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Mutual Life Ins.

Co. </em>275 Fed. Rep. 657. <em>Reese </em>v. <em>Fidelity Mutual Life Association, </em>111 Ga. 482. <em>Amos </em>v. <em>United States Casualty Co. </em>131 Md. 471. <em>Slocum </em>v. <em>New York Life Ins. Co. </em>228 U. S. 364, 375.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-3\">Before the illness of the deceased, neither the agent nor the company had acquired possession or control of the check; up to that time it remained in the possession of the deceased or his brother, and either of them could have refused to pay the premiums and the defendant would have had no right to collect them. The mere receipt of a check does not operate as a payment unless it is accepted as such. <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>11 Met. 44. <em>Illustrated Card &amp; Novelty Co. </em>v. <em>Dolan, </em>208 Mass. 53, 54. <em>Keystone Grape Co. </em>v. <em>Hustis, </em>232 Mass. 162,165. <em>Bergman </em>v. <em>Granstein, </em>235 Mass. 378. <em>Feinherg </em>v. <em>Levine, </em>237 Mass. 185.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">The contention of the plaintiff that, by reason of the recital in the policies of the receipt of the premiums, the defendant is estopped to deny that they were so received is not tenable upon the facts disclosed; besides there was no evidence that the agent had authority to deliver the policies until the first premiums were paid. The plaintiff admits that nothing was paid to the defendant until after Michael Ansin was stricken with a fatal illness. It is not claimed that the premiums were paid either at the time of the delivery of the policies or at any other time, apart from the delivery of the check by David Ansin to the defendant\u2019s agent on February 19, when the insured was not in good health. A conclusive presumption that the premiums were paid by reason of the recital would be repugnant to the express admission of the plaintiff that no payment was made other than by the delivery of the check to the agent. The recital of payment of the premium is merely evidentiary and the fact may be shown. <em>Way </em>v. <em>Greer, </em>196 Mass. 237 and cases collected at page 245. <em>Gilson </em>v. <em>Nesson, </em>208 Mass. 368, 370. <em>Lait </em>v. <em>Sears, </em>226 Mass. 119, 125. <em>Union Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>68 Maine, 229, 230, 231. <em>Sheldon </em>v. <em>Atlantic Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co. </em>26 N. Y. 460. <em>Equitable Fire &amp; Accident Office, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Ching Wo Hong, </em>[1907] A. C. 96, 100.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>The plaintiff argues that, as the proceeds of the check was not returned by the defendant until April 22, 1918, it was a question of fact for the jury to determine whether the defendant ratified the contracts of insurance. This issue is not raised by the report and does not seem to be open to the plaintiff at this time. If it were, the evidence would not warrant a finding of ratification. The evidence offered, and excluded by the court, subject to the plaintiff\u2019s exception, was not admissible. The uncontradicted testimony shows that payment of the premiums was neither made nor tendered while the applicant was in good health. It follows that the policies by their terms never became valid contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">In accordance with the report, judgment is to be entered for the defendant in each case.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
