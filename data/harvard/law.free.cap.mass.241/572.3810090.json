The agreement of the defendant under date of January 31, 1918, confirmed \u201csale to you [[the plaintiff] today of one hundred thousand (100,000) cash Roubles Russian bank notes to be delivered to you within six or eight weeks from date\u201d at stated price and denominations. The only defence is that the defendant was not authorized by law to make such a contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-12\">The defendant was organized under R. L. c. 115. That chapter is not included in the General Laws by reason of St. 1918, c. 12, which forbade future incorporations under said c. 115 but continued its provisions as to banks already incorporated thereunder. It was provided in \u00a7 30 of said c. 115, \u201cA bank shall carry on . . . the usual business of banking . . . may receive deposits, and may loan and negotiate its moneys and effects by discounting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>on banking principles upon such security as the stockholders consider expedient.\u201d In \u00a7 38 of the same chapter was this prohibition: \u201cNo bank shall use any of its moneys, goods, chattels or effects in trade or commerce.\u201d The single question presented is whether it could have been ruled as matter of law that the contract here in suit was in violation of either \u00a7 30 or \u00a7 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-3\">There was ample evidence from those familiar with banking tending to show that banks in this Commonwealth and particularly in Boston usually and generally bought and sold and dealt in Russian roubles and other foreign currency, that Russian roubles were bank notes issued by the Imperial Bank of Russia and were the currency of Russia at the time in question. The selling of foreign currency cannot be said as matter of law to be beyond the lawful power of a bank. Whether it was a part of \u201cthe usual business of banking\u201d within the meaning of those words in \u00a7 30 was a question of fact. It rightly was left to the jury. The verdict has established that such selling is within the scope of ordinary banking business in Boston and hence that it was not in violation of \u00a7 38. <em>Portland Bank </em>v. <em>Storer, </em>7 Mass. 433.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">Even if dealing in Russian roubles were \u201ctrade or commerce\u201d within the prohibition of those words in \u00a7 38, there is nothing in this record to show that the defendant had not acquired ownership of the roubles which were the subject of this contract in such way as to warrant it in making lawful contract to sell them. <em>Fortier </em>v. <em>New Orleans National Bank, </em>112 U.
