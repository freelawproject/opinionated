It might have been found that he did nothing which would be deemed careless if his movements had been directed by an adult of reasonable prudence. <em>McNeil </em>v. <em>Boston Ice Co. </em>173 Mass. 570. The plaintiff might himself have been found to have been in the exercise of due care. <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Chadwick, </em>236 Mass. 130,134. <em>Forzley </em>v. <em>Bianchi, </em>240 Mass. 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-12\">There was evidence to the effect that the wagon which was backed upon the plaintiff was loaded with bottles and was marked \u201cSuffolk Brewery Company,\u201d and that wagons, such as that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>wagon was and marked as it was, had been seen upon and about the premises of the defendant; that the product of the defendant was packed in cases and empty bottles were returned to its brewery in cases, and that no outside teams to haul the manufactured material either to or from its premises were employed, and that the wagons used by the defendant had its name on them. This was sufficient to support a finding that the wagon by which the plaintiff' was injured belonged to the defendant and was being used in its business. The slight difference in name between that of the defendant and that given in the testimony of one of the witnesses \u201cSuffolk Brewing Company, Boston,\u201d was not decisive. It simply affected the weight of the testimony. <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Fred T.
