He further testified that there was nothing to prevent his seeing the defendant\u2019s automobile coming as he got off the street car; that \u201cbefore he got out free and clear of the electric car side there wasn\u2019t any chance to see anything coming in the tracks; that be could have seen a little; that he couldn\u2019t have seen much more than half way down the side of the electric car . . .; that he looked; that he saw the automobile when he first looked and it was then not more than three feet away from him;\u201d that he did not see it when it was half the length of the car away and that there was nothing in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>the way to obstruct his view. There was also evidence that snow was piled upon both sides of the car tracks and that automobiles and sleighs were travelling on the tracks. While the defendant testified that he was travelling very slowly, there was other testimony that he was going at the rate of twenty miles an hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">The important question is whether the plaintiff was in the exercise of due care. He is presumed to have exercised such care, and contributory negligence on his part is an affirmative defence to be pleaded and proved by the defendant. St. 1914, c. 553. Under the statute if on all the evidence it appears that the plaintiff\u2019s carelessness contributed to his injury, he cannot recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">We are of opinion that on the evidence most favorable to the plaintiff the rational inference to be drawn is that his own lack of reasonable care contributed to his injury and that a verdict was rightly directed for the defendant on that ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">We are unable to distinguish in principle the present case from that of <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>Worcester Consolidated Street Railway, </em>210 Mass. 132, where the facts are similar: the plaintiff\u2019s intestate went to the rear of a car from which he had alighted, and attempted to cross the tracks; he was struck almost immediately after stepping upon the further track by a car going in the opposite direction from that of the one he had just left; there was evidence that just before alighting he looked up the street to see whether a car was coming and saw none; that he did not look again after passing behind the car but stepped on the track and was struck. In the present case the plaintiff knew that automobiles were running on the tracks on account of the snow; and while he says he looked to the right as he got to the corner of the car next to the adjoining track, he also says that although there was nothing to obstruct his view he could see only half the distance of the car. As there was nothing to obstruct his view, the cbnclusion is inevitable that his failure to see the approaching automobile sooner and in time to avoid being struck was due to carelessness on his part. <em>Donovan </em>v. <em>Lynn &amp; Boston Railroad, </em>185 Mass. 533, 534, 535. <em>Haynes </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>204 Mass. 249.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-8\"><em>Emery </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>218 Mass. 255, and <em>Kinsley </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>209 Mass. 467, much relied on by the plaintiff, are distinguishable in their facts from those in the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>at bar. In the former, the plaintiff, who was crossing a street railway track from behind a street car from which she had just alighted, having in mind the rule of the company requiring that a gong be sounded by the motorman of a car passing one that is stationary, stopped and listened; and hearing no gong she took one step forward and was struck by a car running at an excessive rate of speed. It was held that she could not be said as matter of law to have been negligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">In the case at bar the plaintiff did not listen for a signal of the approach of an automobile or car; and if he looked, no reason appears why he should not have seen the defendant\u2019s machine. His testimony that he did not hear any horn is merely negative and of no value as evidence that it was not sounded, as it does not appear that he was paying any attention for the purpose of hearing. <em>Menard </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Maine Railroad, </em>150 Mass. 386, 387. <em>Slattery </em>v. <em>New York, New Haven &amp; Hartford Railroad, </em>203 Mass. 453, 457.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">The plaintiff in <em>Kinsley </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, supra, </em>alighted from a car and passed behind it; when he arrived at the corner nearest to the adjoining track he glanced up the track and saw no car and heard none; and he was following another man walking four feet in front who did not indicate that a car was approaching. Manifestly these facts distinguish that case from the one under consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">While the question is not free from difficulty, we are of opinion that the verdict for the defendant was rightly ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
