Before Debruhl\u2019s trial, however, in <em>Arizona v. Gant,</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the Supreme Court narrowed <em>Belton </em>by precluding war-rantless searches of an automobile after the occupants had been removed and secured with handcuffs, and thus no longer remained a threat to police safety or to preservation of evidence. The parties agree that <em>Gant\u2019s </em>revised interpretation of the Fourth Amendment applies retroactively to all cases \u201cnot yet final.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Therefore, because Debruhl, like Gant, had been removed from his car and handcuffed before the arresting officers conducted their search, it is undisputed that the search of Debruhl\u2019s car was unconstitutional. As a consequence, argues Debruhl, the evidence seized from his car \u2014 cocaine and related drug paraphernalia \u2014 must be suppressed under the traditional exclusionary rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">To the contrary, says the government, the evidence is admissible under the \u201cgood-faith\u201d exception to the exclusionary rule because of the officers\u2019 reasonable, objective reliance on \u201csettled law\u201d \u2014 on the <em>Belton </em>line of cases \u2014 while conducting their search before <em>Gant </em>was decided. We cannot agree. As interpreted in this jurisdiction and in several federal circuits, <em>Bel-ton </em>did not reflect \u201csettled law\u201d on which police officers could reasonably rely in conducting the warrantless search on the facts of this case. We therefore agree with the trial court\u2019s decision to reject the good-faith exception and suppress the evidence seized from Debruhl\u2019s car. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-11\">I. Facts and Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"AhV\">On January 11, 2009, Metropolitan Police Department officers observed appellee Lorenzo Ali Debruhl driving an Oldsmobile with its lights off between 1:00 and 2:00 a.m. in the 900 block of Hamilton Street, N.E. Officers Cepeda and Eglund decided to conduct a traffic stop of the car and ran a check of its license plate. While the officers were asking for Debruhl\u2019s driver\u2019s license and registration, their inquiry on the license plate came back showing no record or listing for the tags. Upon checking the registration provided by De-bruhl, the officers found that it matched the license plate but not the car. A subsequent check of the vehicle identification number revealed that the car was unregistered. Officer Eglund asked Debruhl to step out of the car, placed him under arrest, then handcuffed him. Debruhl was escorted by Officer Cepeda to a spot behind the car while Officer Eglund searched the passenger compartment. During the search, the officer recovered a brown paper bag from under the driver\u2019s seat. Inside the bag were a pair of gloves, a digital scale, razor blades, an unspecified amount <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>of currency, and \u201ca clear plastic bag containing a white rock substance\u201d that field-tested positive for cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\">A grand jury indicted Debruhl on one count of possession of a controlled substance with intent to distribute,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and one count of possession of drug paraphernalia.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Before trial, Debruhl filed a motion to suppress the drugs and drug paraphernalia, and the motion was heard on September 11, 2009. Although the trial court credited the testimony of Officer Cepeda that the search had been made incident to Debruhl\u2019s arrest, the court inquired of counsel whether the Supreme Court\u2019s recent <em>Gant </em>decision required it to suppress the evidence as the product of a search that violated the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">The <em>Gant </em>case grew out of the search of a car incident to an arrest for a traffic offense on August 25, 1999.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The suspect, Gant, had been handcuffed and secured in a squad car while the police searched his car and located a bag of cocaine in the pocket of a jacket on the back seat.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Gant filed a motion to suppress the evidence, arguing that the search was unauthorized under the Fourth Amendment because, being handcuffed and stowed in the squad car, he had not posed a threat to the officers and, further, because his stop for a traffic offense did not authorize a search for evidence.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The trial court rejected these arguments, but the Arizona Court of Appeals reversed, suppressing the evidence. The Arizona Supreme Court affirmed the suppression order in an opinion issued on July 25, 2007, stressing that once the scene had been secured, <em>New York v. Belton </em>did not justify a search of the car incident to an arrest to protect officer safety or preserve destructible evidence.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b601-14\">Arizona sought review in the United States Supreme Court, which granted cer-tiorari on February 25, 2008. Oral arguments were held on October 7, 2008, and the decision came down on April 21, 2009, little more than three months after De-bruhl\u2019s arrest and search. In <em>Gant, </em>the Supreme Court affirmed the Arizona Supreme Court ruling: with Gant handcuffed and held in the squad car, there had been no risk to police officer safety nor any need to search the car for evidence related to his arrest for a traffic offense. This decision appeared to be at odds with the traditional understanding of the Court\u2019s bright-line rule in <em>Belton, </em>permitting indiscriminate search of a vehicle\u2019s passenger compartment incident to a lawful arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-15\">During discussion of Debruhl\u2019s suppression motion, the government conceded that <em>Gant </em>applied retroactively;<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Debruhl\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights had been violated. The government added, however, that despite the unlawful search, the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule should apply because the officers had done nothing wrong.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> They had reasonably relied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>on <em>Belton\u2019s </em>bright-line rule (as interpreted by this court) in conducting the search, and thus suppression of the evidence would not serve the principal purpose of the rule: to deter police misconduct.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">After discussion of <em>Gant </em>and relevant case law, the trial court ruled that the good-faith exception did not apply, and that the exclusionary rule accordingly survived the government\u2019s challenge. The court granted the defense motion and suppressed the evidence of drugs and drug paraphernalia on September 24, 2009. The government then filed this pretrial appeal.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">II.Exclusionary Rule Not Tied to Retroactivity of Fourth Amendment Ruling</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">Before addressing the government\u2019s argument based on the good-faith exception, we deal briefly with Debruhl\u2019s argument\u2014 adopted by the trial court \u2014 that under Supreme Court authority retroactive application of a Fourth Amendment ruling includes application of the exclusionary rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-13\">Because no one disputes that <em>Gant\u2019s </em>Fourth Amendment ruling applies- retroactively to Debruhl \u2014 that is, no one questions that the search of Debruhl\u2019s car and seizure of evidence from it were unconstitutional \u2014 the exclusionary rule, says De-bruhl, is inherent in the Fourth Amendment and flows retroactively as well. To the contrary, replies the government, the exclusionary rule no longer is considered an \u201cessential part\u201d <footnotemark>14</footnotemark>of the Fourth Amendment \u201cright to privacy,\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and thus retroactive applicability of the Fourth Amendment does not necessarily imply retroactive application of the exclusionary rule, without exception; these issues are separate.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b602-14\">Debruhl relies primarily on <em>United States v. </em>Johnson<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> where the Court applied, retroactively, to a case on direct appeal, the Fourth Amendment rule announced earlier in <em>Payton v. New York,</em><footnotemark><em>18</em></footnotemark><em> </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>and affirmed the reversal of Johnson\u2019s conviction and suppression of evidence unlawfully seized from him. The government had offered an \u201cobjective\u201d good-faith exception to retroactive application of <em>Pay-ton, </em>formulated in a way that the Court characterized as \u201can absurdity.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The government, however, was contending against retroactive application of the Fourth Amendment decision itself, not merely against retroactive application of the exclusionary rule; the government made no effort to separate the exclusion remedy from the Fourth Amendment right.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> As a result, the defendant received the benefit of the rule without a contest over it, and thus Debruhl cannot claim that <em>Johnson </em>necessarily precludes the government from presenting a \u201cgood-faith exception\u201d argument for admission of the evidence seized from his car.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\"><em>Gant </em>presents a closer question, as language from both the Court\u2019s opinion and the principal dissent suggest that both sides assumed suppression would follow from retroactive application of the Court\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> That said, none of the opinions in <em>Gant </em>expressly acknowledged, let alone addressed, that assumption. We are therefore left to deal with the issue anew in connection with the good-faith exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-10\">In doing so, it is important to keep in mind that we are considering an \u201cexception.\u201d The government does not dispute that, if the good-faith exception is not satisfied, the exclusionary rule will apply to a defendant whose Fourth Amendment rights have been violated, and all unlawfully seized evidence will be suppressed. In short, absent the exception, retroactive application of the Fourth Amendment will include retroactive application of the exclusionary rule as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-11\">III. The \u201cGood-Faith\u201d Exception</p>\n<p id=\"b603-12\">The government argues for the good-faith exception based on the police officers\u2019 reliance on the <em>Belton </em>line of cases allegedly reflecting \u201csettled law\u201d at the time of Debruhl\u2019s arrest. Three central questions are presented: <em>First, </em>what exactly is the good-faith exception? <em>Second, </em>in what situations does the good-faith exception apply? <em>Third, </em>assuming that the good-faith exception could be available here, did the <em>Belton </em>line of cases reflect law that was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>\u201csettled\u201d enough to justify reasonable reliance on it by the officers who searched Debruhl\u2019s car?</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">We take up the first question. In <em>United States v. Leon,</em><footnotemark><em>22</em></footnotemark><em> </em>a police officer relied on a search warrant that had been issued by a state Superior Court judge but later was found to have lacked probable cause. The Supreme Court, applying what it called a \u201cgood faith\u201d exception<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> to the exclusionary rule, rejected the ruling of the trial court (sustained by the court of appeals) that suppressed the evidence seized. The Court justified admission of the evidence because of the officer\u2019s \u201cobjectively reasonable\u201d reliance on the subsequently invalidated warrant.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Three years later, in <em>Illinois v. Krull,</em><footnotemark><em>25</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the Court extended <em>Leon\u2019s </em>ruling to a police officer\u2019s warrantless administrative search conducted in reasonable, good-faith reliance on a statute later declared unconstitutional. And less than a decade thereafter, in <em>Arizona v. Evans,</em><footnotemark><em>26</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the Court applied the exception to an officer who had \u201cobjectively reasonably\u201d relied on mistaken information in a court database indicating that an arrest warrant was outstanding. Most recently, in <em>Herring v. United, States,</em><footnotemark><em>27</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the Court invoked the \u201cgood-faith\u201d exception when an officer reasonably believed that there was an outstanding arrest warrant in a neighboring county, but his belief, it turned out, had been wrong because of a police employee\u2019s negligent bookkeeping error.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-13\">In this latest iteration of the good-faith exception in <em>Herring, </em>the Court rejected its earlier characterization of the exclusionary rule in <em>Mapp v. Ohio </em>as an inherent Fourth Amendment right.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Instead, the Court emphasized that the rule \u201capplies only where it \u2018results in appreciable deterrence\u2019 \u201d of police misconduct,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> meaning that \u201cthe benefits of deterrence must outweigh the costs,\u201d principally the cost of \u201cletting guilty and possibly dangerous defendants go free\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Summarizing the Court\u2019s latter-day exclusionary rule jurisprudence, the Chief Justice explained in <em>Herring:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-14\">[I]n <em>Krull </em>we elaborated that \u201cevidence should be suppressed \u2018only if it can be said that the law enforcement officer had knowledge, or may properly be charged with knowledge, that the search was unconstitutional under the Fourth Amendment.\u2019\u201d 480 U.S., at 348-349[, 107 S.Ct. 1160] (citation omitted).... To trigger the exclusionary rule, police conduct must be sufficiently deliberate that exclusion can meaningfully deter it, and sufficiently culpable that such deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>rence is worth the price paid by the justice system. As laid out in our cases, the exclusionary rule serves to deter deliberate, reckless, or grossly negligent conduct, or in some circumstances recurring or systemic negligence.... We have already held that \u201cour good-faith inquiry is confined to the objectively ascertainable question whether a reasonably well trained officer would have known that the search was illegal\u201d in light of \u201call of the circumstances.\u201d <em>Leon, </em>468 U.S., at 922, n. 23, 104 S.Ct. 3405.[<footnotemark>31</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b605-4\">This summary, of course, was presented in the context of police-officer reliance on a warrant, a statute, or other official record germane to an anticipated search. The ultimate question for us, therefore, in determining whether the good-faith exception applies, is whether Officers Eglund and Cepeda properly relied, instead, on appellate court opinions in deciding whether the warrantless search of Debruhl\u2019s car was constitutional. More specifically, can a police officer\u2019s reliance on appellate opinions supply the check on police behavior\u2014 and thus serve as the basis for objective good faith \u2014 that statutes, warrants, and other official records provide in advance of a search?</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">IV. \u201cMistake op Law\u201d v. Good-Faith Exception</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">Proponents of the good-faith exception over the years have assumed that it would apply in all Fourth Amendment cases, not just in situations where retroactive application of a Fourth Amendment ruling is at issue. Justice White, for example, has written without reference to retroactivity that the exclusionary rule should \u201cbe more generally modified to permit the introduction of evidence obtained in the reasonable good-faith belief that a search or seizure was in accord with the Fourth Amendment.\u201d <footnotemark>32</footnotemark> That generalization, however, reflects serious overstatement. When asking whether the good-faith exception is available to a police officer who relied on particular case law to justify the warrant-less search of an automobile, it is important to recognize that we are considering only a situation in which the Supreme Court has modified a settled rule of law on which the officer relied before the high Court ruled. The exception is not available in the typical \u201cmistake-of-law\u201d scenario confronted regularly in the local trial and appellate courts; and it is very important to understand the distinction here. If the good-faith exception is not properly circumscribed, it can legitimate the very dangers that mistake-of-law analysis has been developed to prevent.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-11\">A. Mistake of Law</p>\n<p id=\"b605-12\">Mistake-of-law cases do not involve modifications \u2014 whether \u201cclarifications\u201d or \u201coverrulings\u201d \u2014 by a higher court. More simply, they concern whether an officer\u2019s unlawful actions can be excused by a good-faith but erroneous understanding of the law (without the additional complication of a Supreme Court intervention). For example, assume that Debruhl\u2019s case came to this court before <em>Gant, </em>and that the arresting officers \u2014 aware, presumably, of this court\u2019s decisions applying Belton\u2014 searched Debruhl\u2019s car after escorting him away from it in handcuffs.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Further as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>sume that when the case came before this court, it was a case of first impression in the sense that this fact pattern (a \u201csecured\u201d suspect) had not appeared for decision in any of our previous <em>Belton-type </em>cases. And assume, finally, that we decided (foreshadowing Gant) that the officers had relied improperly on <em>Belton, </em>that the search had violated the Fourth Amendment, and thus that the evidence seized must be suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">In this situation, the officer\u2019s mistake of law in relying on Belton-type cases that did not consider the crucial, factual distinction between <em>Debruhl </em>and <em>Belton </em>would not excuse an unconstitutional search or prevent the resulting suppression of evidence. This is true even if we were to conclude that the officers, in light of earlier cases, had a reasonable if not conclusive basis for believing that a judge would rule in their favor. As to the facts the officers confronted, the law was not \u201csettled\u201d until this court ruled, contrary to the officers\u2019 expectations.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">Courts are explicit: \u201cThe justifications for the good-faith exception do not extend to situations in which police officers have interpreted ambiguous precedent <em>or relied on their own extrapolations from existing caselaw\u201d </em>(emphasis added).<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> \u201cTo create an exception here would defeat the purpose of the exclusionary rule, for it would remove the incentive for police to make certain that they properly understand the law that they are entrusted to enforce and obey.\u201d<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> To be clear: the good-faith exception cannot excuse a police officer\u2019s mistake of law; the exception applies only when a Supreme Court ruling upsets clearly settled law on which the officer had reasonably relied before the high Court\u2019s decision placed the mistake of law on the lower court, not on the officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-10\">B. Applying Good Faith Exception</p>\n<p id=\"b606-11\">We turn now to the good-faith exception as it applies to the situation actually before us: Debruhl\u2019s case came to this court after <em>Gant. </em>The government argues that the officers acted in reasonably objective (good faith) reliance on <em>Belton </em>and this court\u2019s interpretations of it. If our cases interpreting <em>Belton, </em>as the government suggests, had \u201csettled\u201d that the officers were allowed to conduct a warrantless search on the facts they encountered in Debruhl\u2014 that is, if our case law was not ambiguous as to that situation \u2014 then, theoretically, the test for the good-faith exception would have been met. The law would have been settled as explicitly as the permission reflected in a judicially-approved warrant {Leon) or an unambiguous statute {Krull), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>because all material facts presented in <em>De-bruhl </em>would have been congruent with those in which previous warrantless searches had received this court\u2019s blessing.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">On the other hand, if our case law on which the officers relied was ambiguous, as applied to the factual scenario at issue in <em>Debruhl, </em>then the officers would not have relied on \u201csettled\u201d law, and the good-faith exception would not apply.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Indeed, if the exception were to apply in this situation, we would be legitimating a \u201cmistake-of-law\u201d basis for the good-faith exception. More specifically, if this court were to grant the officer slack in determining what facts were material, we would be delegating to the officer, not reserving to the court, interpretation of the facts and law controlling application of the Fourth Amendment and the exclusionary rule. Put still another way, this court would be allowing the officer to rely on relevant, but not controlling, case law to authorize admission of evidence that the court itself might well have suppressed before the Supreme Court announced modification of <em>Belton </em>in <em>Gant.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">We turn, therefore, to the question whether the officers here relied on \u201csettled\u201d law that, before <em>Gant, </em>would have permitted their search of Debruhl\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">V. Did the Officers Rely on Settled Law?</p>\n<p id=\"b607-8\">The government argues that a substantial majority of those informed in constitutional law would have concluded that, as of the time of Debruhl\u2019s arrest, <em>Belton, </em>as commonly interpreted, permitted the search and seizure directed at Debruhl. Accordingly, says the government, whether <em>Gant </em>was a \u201cclarification\u201d<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> of <em>Belton, </em>as Justice Stevens opined for the majority, or an overruling,<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> as Justice Alito wrote for the four dissenters, it was enough of a surprise that Officers Eglund and Cepeda could not be faulted for acting in accord with <em>Belton\u2019s </em>traditional interpretation and searching Debruhl\u2019s passenger compartment. Their behavior, concludes the government, was \u201cobjectively reasonable,\u201d and thus in \u201cgood faith,\u201d consistent with the exclusionary rule exception announced in <em>United States v. Leon.</em><footnotemark><em>39</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b607-11\">It is not possible to answer this ultimate, \u201cgood-faith\u201d question without understanding in more detail how police-officer reliance on appellate opinions works, and whether these opinions would provide the \u201csettled law\u201d justifying a search that, say, the clear authority of a warrant offers. <em>First, </em>how is \u201csettled law\u201d defined? Is it merely the applicable rule, such as Justice Stewart\u2019s bright-line articulation of the auto compartment search in <em>Belton? </em>What if the rule is quite general, such as the \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d formula for finding probable to cause to arrest based on an informant\u2019s tip in <em>Illinois v. </em>Gates?<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> Or, focusing more broadly, is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>\u201csettled\u201d law always an applicable rule as applied to a particular pattern of facts, such that an appellate opinion will not reflect settled law for good-faith exception purposes unless the facts are close, in all material respects, to those confronted by the police officer?</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\"><em>Second, </em>what appellate opinions are relevant for determining \u201csettled law\u201d? Only those in the officer\u2019s own jurisdiction? What if opinions from this court and from the D.C. Circuit germane to the search are in conflict? What about opinions from other jurisdictions more directly applicable to the facts of the officer\u2019s case? Do Supreme Court opinions in tension with those in the officer\u2019s local jurisdiction undermine the judicial authority on which the officer would otherwise rely? How do Supreme Court hints, through concurrences and dissents showing dissatisfaction with the Court\u2019s own previous rulings, factor in- \u2014 if at all? In short, what is the jurisprudential universe from which a police officer is to discern \u201csettled law,\u201d applicable to the anticipated search, that would justify the good-faith exception to suppression of evidence seized unlawfully?</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">The discussion begins with <em>Chimel v. </em>California,<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> governing warrantless searches incident to arrest. The Court held in <em>Chimel </em>that police officers may conduct such searches only within the space under the suspect\u2019s \u201cimmediate control,\u201d defined as \u201cthe area from within which he might gain possession of a weapon or destructible evidence.\u201d<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> That test became problematic for searches of vehicles incident to the arrest of the driver or other occupants in the vehicle, the issue before the Court in <em>Belton.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b608-12\">A. <em>Belton</em></p>\n<p id=\"b608-13\">In <em>Belton, </em>after stopping the car for speeding, a police officer came upon four men in the car and, while conversing with them, smelled burnt marijuana and saw an envelope inside the vehicle, which he associated with that substance.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> The officer ordered all four out of the car, placed them under arrest for unlawful possession of marijuana, patted each of them down, split them into four separate locations on the Thruway, and searched the passenger compartment.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> There he found marijuana in the envelope and cocaine in a jacket on the back seat belonging to Belton, who moved to suppress that evidence after his indictment for criminal possession of a controlled substance.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> The New York Court of Appeals reversed the lower courts\u2019 denial of Belton\u2019s suppression motion, ruling that a \u201cwarrantless search of the zippered pockets of an unaccessible jacket may not be upheld as a search incident to a lawful arrest where there is no longer any danger that the arrestee or a confederate might gain access to the article.\u201d<footnotemark>46</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b608-14\">The Supreme Court reversed, announcing a bright line rule intended to approximate, as closely as possible, the scope of a search permitted by <em>Chimel. </em>Wrote Justice Stewart: \u201c[Cjourts have found no workable definition of \u2018the area within the immediate control of the arrestee\u2019 when that area arguably includes the interior of an automobile and the arrestee is its re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>cent occupant.... Accordingly, we hold that when a policeman has made a lawful custodial arrest of the occupant of an automobile, he may, as a contemporaneous incident of that arrest, search the passenger compartment of that automobile.\u201d<footnotemark>47</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b609-4\">B. <em>Harris </em>and <em>Staten</em></p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">Years later, in <em>United States v. </em>Harris,<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> this court applied <em>Belton </em>to a situation in which police officers stopped a car for running a red light. After discovering that the driver did not possess a valid driver\u2019s license, the officers arrested him for that offense, searched and handcuffed him, and locked him in the police cruiser.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> The two passengers were then ordered out of the car.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> As the front passenger began to step out of the car, one of the officers saw a handgun at the passenger\u2019s feet. The officers looked further and found a bag containing ammunition on the floorboard between the passenger\u2019s legs.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> After the front passenger, Harris, had been indicted for weapons offenses, the motions judge granted his motion to suppress, ruling that the officers \u201chad no basis for searching the vehicle after [the driver\u2019s] arrest for a traffic violation, nor did the officers reasonably fear for their safety.\u201d<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> Furthermore, the search had come \u201cwell after the arrest of the driver and was therefore not contemporaneous with \u2018potentially threatening circumstances confronting the officer.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> We reversed, relying on <em>Belton </em>and an earlier decision of this court, <em>Staten v. United States,</em><footnotemark><em>54</em></footnotemark><em> </em>where we had affirmed a conviction for weapons offenses based on a search of an automobile\u2019s glove compartment after the driver (arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol) and two passengers had been removed from the vehicle. None of the three was sequestered in a patrol car before the search.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-16\"><em>Harris </em>focused primarily on the \u201ccontemporaneous incident\u201d language in <em>Bel-ton </em><footnotemark>55</footnotemark> while <em>Staten </em>dealt mainly with the passenger\u2019s contention that he had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the glove compartment where the gun was found. Each, therefore, was what we shall call a \u201cpure\u201d <em>Belton </em>case in that both concerned searches and seizures of evidence before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>all occupants of the car had been removed and secured; as in <em>Belton, </em>the risk to police safety and loss of evidence had not entirely abated at the time of the search.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">C. The Movement to <em>Gant</em></p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">Cases in other jurisdictions began to address the question whether <em>Belton\u2019s </em>bright-line rule was being stretched too far, in derogation of <em>Chimel, </em>when passenger compartments were searched after all the occupants of a car had been handcuffed and locked in a squad car away from their vehicle.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> At the time of the search, could these sequestered occupants still be deemed to occupy space, as <em>Chimel </em>required, under their \u201cimmediate control,\u201d that is, \u201cthe area from within which [the occupants] might gain possession of a weapon or destructible evidence\u201d?<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> Courts began to say \u201cNo.\u201d<footnotemark>58</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">That question, as we have seen, eventually came to the Supreme Court in <em>Gant, </em>where a 5-to-4 majority also answered \u201cNo.\u201d For the Court, Justice Stevens wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-7\">The safety and evidentiary justifications underlying <em>Chimel\u2019s </em>reaching-distance rule determine <em>Belton\u2019s </em>scope. Accordingly, we hold that <em>Belton </em>does not authorize a vehicle search incident to a recent occupant\u2019s arrest after the arres-tee has been secured and cannot access the interior of the vehicle.[<footnotemark>59</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-14\">Because Debruhl had been arrested for a traffic violation, handcuffed, and held by police officers away from his car while it was searched, the government does not contest that, under <em>Gant, </em>the search violated the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-15\">D. <em>Thornton: </em>From Bright-Line to Cloudy</p>\n<p id=\"b610-16\">Five years before Debruhl\u2019s arrest, a Supreme Court majority in <em>Thornton v. United </em>States<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> had signaled its unease with <em>Belton. </em>The supposed bright line rule was cracking; its application had become uncertain.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-17\">In <em>Thornton, </em>decided in 2004, police officers on patrol who were suspicious of a passing car discovered, after a radio check, that the tags and the car did not match.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> Before the officers could stop the car, the driver pulled into a parking lot and got out of the car.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> The officers approached and arrested the driver, patted him down, and found marijuana and cocaine.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> The police handcuffed him, put him in the patrol car, then searched his car and found a hand<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>gun.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> In affirming the denial of the motion to suppress, the Supreme Court rejected the defense argument that a <em>Belton </em>search was limited to situations in which the police initiated contact with a suspect while he was still in the car.<footnotemark>65</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">On the facts, therefore, <em>Thornton </em>reflects an extension of <em>Belton </em>(although not on the security issue addressed in Gant). In reaching its result, however, the <em>Thornton </em>Court fractured, with one justice concurring dubitante,<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> two justices concurring only in the judgment on an alternative theory,<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> and two justices dissenting.<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> A Court majority, therefore, concluded that <em>Belton, </em>as commonly interpreted, had come to undermine the traditional limitation on searches incident to arrest \u2014 a limitation that <em>Belton\u2019s </em>bright line rule had supposedly been fashioned to protect. Without doubt, a Court majority telegraphed its belief that <em>Belton </em>lay on a \u201cshaky foundation,\u201d<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> had become a \u201cswollen rule,\u201d<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> indeed a rule stretched \u201cbeyond its breaking point.\u201d<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> In short, by 2004 five sitting justices had strongly advocated either revision or abandonment of <em>Belton, </em>with some pointing out the very flaws stressed five years later in the Court\u2019s corrective decision in <em>Gant. </em>Careful Court watchers could not have failed to notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-11\">We hasten to add that we are not at all suggesting that these ruminations from a majority of the justices amount to a formal rejection of <em>Belton. Thornton\u2019s </em>interpretation of <em>Belton </em>remained good law until the Court itself ruled in <em>Gant.</em><footnotemark><em>72</em></footnotemark><em> </em>We cite the justices\u2019 disquiet, however, simply to demonstrate that bright-line rules do not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>easily remain radiant. Although <em>Belton </em>was announced as a bright-line rule intended for simple, clear cut application, it is evident from <em>Belton\u2019s </em>history that such rules are often likely to remain truly \u201cbright line\u201d only for a limited period of time as factual scenarios test their limits.<footnotemark>73</footnotemark> <em>Belton </em>has become a classic case of a rule beclouded over time by exceptions generated by unique facts that pushed decisions beyond the \u201cbright line\u201d license \u2014 as evidenced by the three federal circuits that anticipated Gem\u00ed.<footnotemark>74</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">Consequently, the likelihood of a police officer\u2019s finding \u201csettled law\u201d attributable to <em>Belton </em>has diminished over time as new factual scenarios outpace Belton-type decisions that do not quite tell an officer what is, and is not, allowed in the new situation the officer faces. <em>Belton\u2019s </em>rule is not yet as amorphous a rule as those reflecting the \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d or excusing the warrant requirement for \u201cexigent circumstances.\u201d But it has been heading in that opaque direction; it has been losing its currency. Accordingly, an appellate court confronted by the government\u2019s argument that the good-faith exception applies in a particular <em>case </em>\u2014 Belton-type or otherwise \u2014 must be very careful in appraising whether a police officer has relied on truly \u201csettled law\u201d in the jurisdiction\u2014 meaning settled as to the material facts at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-10\">Two federal circuits have recently applied that strict limitation when applying the good-faith exception. <em>United States v. </em>Davis<footnotemark>75</footnotemark> concerned a <em>pre-Gant </em>search of an automobile after all the occupants had been secured with handcuffs and placed in a patrol car. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, ruling after <em>Gant </em>came down, applied the exception and allowed admission of the seized firearm. The court stressed, however, that \u201cthe governing law in this circuit unambiguously allowed Sergeant Miller to search the car.\u201d<footnotemark>76</footnotemark> Added the court: \u201cRelying on a court of appeals\u2019 well-settled and unequivocal precedent is analogous to relying on a statute [citing <em>Krull]</em>.\u201d<footnotemark>77</footnotemark> In <em>United States v. McCane,</em><footnotemark><em>78</em></footnotemark><em> </em>a similar case concerning suspects secured in a patrol car, the Tenth Circuit emphasized that the police officers, in seizing a firearm from the occupants\u2019 car, had relied on \u201csettled\u201d case law \u201cfactually indistinguishable from the instant case.\u201d<footnotemark>79</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b612-11\">To repeat: there is a crucial predicate that must be satisfied before the warrantless search of an automobile under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number><em>Belton </em>law can be a candidate for the good-faith exception. The tribunal\u2019s interpretation of the Supreme Court\u2019s rule on which the officer relies must be \u201csettled\u201d as <em>applied to all the material facts the officer faces. </em>Short of satisfying that strict <em>requirement </em>\u2014 ie., a requirement of explicit protection or \u201ccover\u201d from the court on which the officer relies \u2014 we cannot say that the officer\u2019s search would be objectively reasonable enough for the good faith exception to apply. Otherwise that officer, conducting a search later held unlawful by the Supreme Court, would be in no better position than that of the officer in a typical mistake-of-law situation who arguably makes a reasonable, but ultimately incorrect, guess at the lawfulness of the search.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-4\">It is important to emphasize that we are not defining \u201csettled law\u201d to mean case law that has addressed facts identical to those confronting the officer who conducts the search. We are referring, rather, only to the material facts \u2014 to the handful of variables, material to ascertaining a lawful <em>Bel-ton </em>search, that police officers permissibly take into account. These include the degree to which the search is contemporaneous with the arrest,<footnotemark>80</footnotemark> the proximity of the occupant to the vehicle, both temporally and spatially, when the officer makes a lawful arrest;<footnotemark>81</footnotemark> the need to search the vehicle in relation to the offense that justified the stop,<footnotemark>82</footnotemark> and, the extent of sequestering the suspect and other occupants in relation to the search.<footnotemark>83</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b613-9\">E. Unsettled Law</p>\n<p id=\"b613-10\">The government argues that the police officers who seized the incriminating evidence from Debruhl\u2019s car satisfied the good-faith test by taking \u201cobjectively reasonable\u201d<footnotemark>84</footnotemark> action in doing so. They adhered, says the government, to the traditional understanding of the Supreme Court\u2019s authoritative decision in <em>Belton </em>and this court\u2019s application of that authority in Harris<footnotemark>85</footnotemark> and <em>Staten</em><footnotemark><em>86</em></footnotemark><em> </em>\u2014 case law in effect at the time of Debruhl\u2019s arrest a few months before <em>Gant </em>was decided. Even according to Justice Stevens for the <em>Gant </em>majority, notes the government, <em>Belton </em>\u201chas been widely understood to allow a vehicle search incident to the arrest of a recent occupant even if there is no possibility the arrestee could gain access to the vehicle at the time of the search.\u201d<footnotemark>87</footnotemark> Therefore, says the government, exclusion of the evidence from Debruhl\u2019s trial would not deter police misconduct because the officers, applying the correct law at the time \u2014 indeed, \u201cengaging in a practice they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>never expected to be invalidated\u201d<footnotemark>88</footnotemark> \u2014 did nothing wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">Counsel for the government was asked at oral argument whether the universe of appellate opinions that yields the \u201csettled law\u201d for this case is limited to the jurisprudence of this court (as we have interpreted <em>Belton), </em>or embraces the larger universe that includes relevant case law from other jurisdictions, as well as Supreme Court developments. Counsel replied that this court is the proper source of settled law for good-faith purposes (although he acknowledged that the relevant universe would not necessarily be limited to local case law if it was \u201cso obviously incorrect\u201d that the police should favor sound law found elsewhere \u2014 a remote possibility, he said, not presented here). We agree with the government: we need not definitively resolve how broadly the universe of \u201csettled law\u201d might extend in unusual circumstances; we are satisfied that <em>Belton, </em>as interpreted by this court as of the time of the officers\u2019 search, is the law on which this case should turn.<footnotemark>89</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">We do not believe that our case law supports the government\u2019s position in light of the strict requirements for appraising \u201csettled law\u201d for good-faith exception purposes. If we focus carefully on this court\u2019s <em>Belton </em>decisions before <em>Gant, </em>it is possible to say \u2014 contrary to the government\u2019s contention-that this court might well have held the search of Debruhl\u2019s car unlawful and the evidence inadmissible. We say this because <em>Debruhl\u2019s </em>facts differ from those in <em>Staten </em>and <em>Harris </em>in a legally significant way, indeed in the very way that became determinative in <em>Gant. </em>In neither <em>Staten </em>nor <em>Harris </em>had all the occupants been removed from the car and secured with handcuffs before the search; they were, as we have noted, \u201cpure\u201d <em>Bel-ton </em>cases, legally indistinguishable from <em>Belton </em>on the facts.<footnotemark>90</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b614-10\">In Debruhl\u2019s case, like Gant\u2019s, all occupants of the car had been removed and secured before the search, a factual distinction from <em>Belton </em>which, as we have repeated, caused three federal circuits before <em>Gant </em>to rule that <em>Belton </em>did not apply.<footnotemark>91</footnotemark> Therefore, if Debruhl\u2019s counsel had litigated his motion to suppress before <em>Gant </em>was decided, counsel might well have persuaded the Superior Court, and then this court, that on the facts here the law was unsettled in this jurisdiction; that <em>Staten </em>and <em>Hams </em>were therefore not controlling; and that in light of the case law from other jurisdictions reflecting <em>Chimel\u2019s </em>limitation on <em>Belton\u2019s </em>reach, <em>Belton </em>should not be read to permit the search of Debruhl\u2019s car.<footnotemark>92</footnotemark> (In this hypothetical case, of course, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>as explained in Part IV., the officers would have relied on a mistake of law, and the good-faith exception would not have applied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">We are not saying to a certainty that, before <em>Gant, </em>every division of this court would unanimously have found an unlawful search based on the facts here. We are saying, however, that the facts matter in determining what is \u201csettled law,\u201d and that the police officer\u2019s reliance on <em>Staten </em>and <em>Harris </em>\u2014 on \u201cpure <em>Belton </em>\u201d cases \u2014 to justify the seareh of Debruhl\u2019s car would have been reliance on relevant but not on \u201csettled\u201d law; the case was one of first impression in this jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">All things considered, therefore, it is not possible to conclude that Officers Eglund and Cepeda relied on \u201csettled\u201d law authorizing their search of Debruhl\u2019s car. Even if, as Justice Stevens acknowledged, <em>Belton </em>may have been \u201cwidely understood\u201d <footnotemark>93</footnotemark> to allow warrantless searches of vehicle passenger compartments without limitation incident to an arrest, momentum against such a sweeping interpretation on facts such as those in Debruhl\u2019s case had been accelerating in the courts for years before his arrest. And no decision by this court had held that a police officer had a right, under <em>Belton, </em>to search a car after all its occupants had been removed and secured.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-14\">VI. Judicial Decisions as Predicates for Good-Faith Exception</p>\n<p id=\"b615-15\">We have been focusing on judicial decisions, more particularly on appellate opinions, as a basis for the good-faith exception and premising that discussion on an officer\u2019s reliance on case law congruent in all material respects with the search the officer is anticipating. As in Dams<footnotemark>94</footnotemark> and McCane<footnotemark>95</footnotemark> cited earlier, a number of federal and state courts have also accepted case law as an appropriate predicate for good-faith reliance.<footnotemark>96</footnotemark> They presume that appellate opinions, dealing with earlier events, can have the same prospective reliability as a warrant or unambiguous statute that invites \u201cobjectively reasonable\u201d reliance on its clarity and presumed validity for a look at an upcoming search.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-16\">Other courts, noting that an appellate opinion based on past events is not directed at the specific facts of an anticipated search, and thus is not express authority for that upcoming intrusion, have declined to premise the good-faith exception on judicial opinions.<footnotemark>97</footnotemark> These courts are con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>cerned that a trial judge or appellate panel may define \u201csettled law\u201d too loosely and thereby invite police officers, rather than the courts, to prescribe when exclusion is \u2014 and is not \u2014 appropriate. In other words, there is a concern that unless the courts define \u201csettled law\u201d tightly enough to provide an unambiguous road map to guide the warrantless search, the courts will be merging the discredited \u201cmistake-of-law\u201d defense <em>(see supra </em>Part IV.) into the good-faith exception, with all the mischief that this could entail. The danger would be too many police officers judging their own authority expansively \u2014 and thus more and more often erroneously \u2014 with serious erosion of the deterrence called for by the exclusionary rule. Put another way, a court\u2019s failure to interpret \u201csettled law\u201d strictly \u2014 including an unwillingness to call the law \u201cunsettled\u201d on the fact pattern presented \u2014 would be an invitation to police misconduct through interpretation of judicial opinions in ways that will narrow the rule of exclusion and force the courts to announce empty Fourth Amendment violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">In <em>Krull, </em>the Supreme Court recognized this very danger;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-5\">[T]he question whether the exclusionary rule is applicable in a particular context depends significantly upon the actors who are making the relevant decision that the rule is designed to influence. <em>The answer to this question might well he different when police officers act outside the scope of a statute, albeit in good faith. In that context, the relevant actors are not legislators or magistrates, hut police officers who concededly are \u201cengaged in the often competitive enterprise of ferreting out crime.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)[<footnotemark>98</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">Moreover, in <em>Leon </em>and its Supreme Court progeny, there was a third-party check or checkpoint \u2014 a judicial magistrate, a warrant clerk, a record officer, or the plain language of a <em>statute </em>\u2014 before the officer was entitled to conduct the search. When an officer is allowed instead to rely on police academy interpretation of judicial opinions to justify a search without additional, clear guidance, the potential for slippage into unconstitutional terrain is obvious.<footnotemark>99</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b617-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>If we say that case law, like a warrant, can serve as a basis for the good-faith exception, there is language in <em>Herring </em>that \u2014 unless this court defines \u201csettled law\u201d narrowly and precisely \u2014 would appear to allow the police officer, not the court, to define the \u201csettled law\u201d that permits the search. Assume, contrary to our decision here, that we were <em>not </em>to define our \u201csettled\u201d <em>Belton </em>law by reference to a published opinion reflecting the material facts applicable to the officer\u2019s intended search \u2014 in short, a roadmap akin to the clarity of a warrant. Absent that limited definition, <em>Herring </em>would permit suppression of the evidence seized \u201conly if it can be said that the law enforcement officer had knowledge, or may properly be charged with knowledge, that the search <em>was unconstitutional </em>under the Fourth Amendment,\u201d namely, that \u201ca reasonably well trained officer would have known that the search <em>was </em>illegal\u201d in light of \u201call of the circumstances.\u201d (Emphasis added.)<footnotemark>100</footnotemark> With this legal protection that the officer could search unless he knew the search \u201cwas unconstitutional,\u201d an officer could rely on a plausible, though not established, interpretation of <em>Belton </em>that would justify the search of Debruhl\u2019s car without regard to whether Debruhl had been removed and secured before the search. Mere \u201cplausible\u201d law would become \u201csettled\u201d law, without regard to how this court might have evaluated the search in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">VII. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b617-8\">We share the concerns about equating decisional law with warrants, statutes, and other independent checks on police searches that would excuse application of the exclusionary rule.<footnotemark>101</footnotemark> Until experience proves otherwise, however, we are not willing to assume now that trial judges and appellate panels in this jurisdiction will fail to strictly construe the \u201csettled law\u201d requirement underlying the good-faith exception. We are willing to allow for the possibility that a police officer\u2019s reliance on judicial precedent tending to support a particular search and seizure can be the legal equivalent of good-faith, objectively reasonable reliance on a defective or recalled warrant <em>{Leon, Evans), </em>or a state statute {Krull), or an erroneous police record {Herring). We are not willing to stop the discussion by ruling that judicial precedent, as a category, will always be too imprecise for a police officer to rely on it with reasonably objective certainty. We anticipate that our strict rule of construction will be followed. And we would be violating that rule, to be sure, if we were to permit the good-faith exception to apply in Debruhl\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b600-8\">. 453 U.S. 454, 101 S.Ct. 2860, 69 L.Ed.2d 768 (1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b600-13\">. - U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1710, 173 L.Ed.2d 485 (2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b600-12\">. <em>Griffith </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>479 U.S. 314, 328, 107 S.Ct. 708, 93 L.Ed.2d 649 (1987).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b601-6\">.
