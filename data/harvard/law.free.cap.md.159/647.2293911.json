Beach, filed his bill against his wife, Letha L. Beach, the appellee, alleging therein, that on or about the 8th day of July, 1922, she, without just cause or reason, abandoned and deserted him, and that such abandonment and desertion had continued uninterruptedly for more than three years and asked that he be granted an absolute divorce from his wife. In her answer to the bill, she denied the allegation of abandonment and desertion charged against her, and averred therein that the appellant had not only treated her with great cruelty and brutality, but had on the 16th day of June, 1922, without cause or reason, abandoned and deserted her. She thereafter filed a cross-bill alleging her husband\u2019s abandonment and desertion of her and asking that she be granted alimony and counsel, fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-9\">The court heard evidence upon the bill and cross bill and the respective answers thereto, and passed its decree dismissing both the bill and cross-bill, from which decree the husband has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-10\">The appellant and appellee, who were married in 1894, have had born to them eight children, seven of whom were living at the time of the trial of this case&gt; and all of full age, with the exception of Charles, who reached manhood in August, 1930.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-11\">The record discloses that the husband and wife, throughout their entire married life, often had their quarrels, and the husband on two occasions, prior to the final separation, had left the home in which they lived, but returned after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>being separated only a short while. The domestic difficulties between them, as stated by the husband, arose chiefly from the alleged fact that the wife failed to pay, out of the money given to her which was earned by him, debts that had been incurred by them, though the further complaint was made by him that, in the months immediately preceding the final separation, she refused to permit him to have conjugal relations with her and required him, as he stated, to obtain from a physician a certificate to the effect that he was free from venereal disease, and was in a condition in which it was safe for her to have such relations with him, and, though he obtained the certificate, such marital rights were still withheld from him by her.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">It may be gathered from the evidence that many of the quarrels between them were the result of the financial difficulties mentioned, though it is disclaimed by the wife that they were the chief cause of their troubles.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">The final separation followed a quarrel between the parties in June or July, 1922, when, as stated by the husband, he was told by his wife \u201cto get out, the sooner I got out the better. It would be the happiest day in her life if I went out and closed the door behind me and never open it again. * * * I want to be a free woman. I want to be free of everything. I said, all right.\u201d It was, as stated by the appellant, because of these commands of the wife that he left the home and went to his daughter\u2019s, with whom he lived until the institution of these proceedings, when he was informed by her that she did not wish him to remain longer with her. While at his daughter\u2019s, a period of over seven years, he contributed nothing to the support of his wife, although, in the year 1929, he received from the Baltimore Museum of Art in Wyman Park a salary of thirty-five dollars a week, which with compensation for over-time, amounted to $2,325.00, or an average of forty-four dollars and fifteen cents per week, and in addition to this he received a pension of seventy-five dollars a month from the Fire Department of the City.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">It is contended by the appellant that, though he left the marital home, it was not an abandonment or desertion of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>wife by bim, but au abandonment or desertion of bim by her, because of ber commands and directions to bim and tbe circumstances under which be left tbat home. In support of this claim, Thomas E. Beach, bis son, was offered by bim as a witness, wbo testified tbat, upon a visit to bis mother, a few days after tbe separation, be was told by ber tbat bis father bad left after an argument between bim and ber, and after being told by ber \u201cto get out\u201d. Tbe son Charles, wbo at tbe time of tbe separation of bis parents was not more than twelve or fourteen years of age, testified tbat be did not remember tbe time of their separation or. what was said by them at tbat time. Thereafter both of tbe attorneys for tbe appellant testified tbat they called upon Charles-prior to tbe trial and asked bim about bis being present at tbe time of tbe separation, and what was said by bis mother or father at tbat time, and they were told by bim tbat be was present and beard bis mother say to bis father, \u201cto get out and stay out,\u201d etc., but, when told tbat be would be summoned to testify in tbe case, be said be would not tell anything. Tbe evidence of Charles cannot be regarded as giving any support to' the alleged statement of bis father tbat be was told by bis mother to \u201cget out and stay out.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">As to tbe charge tbat bis wife would not permit bim to have conjugal relations with ber, tbe appellant testified tbat be did not regularly up to tbe time be separated live with tbe appellee as man and wife. Eor possibly six months before tbe separation be slept with bis son Edgar. This was because bis wife bad said tbat there was something wrong with bim and she could not sleep with bim. In response to ber demands and to convince her she was wrong, he obtained tbe certificate from tbe doctor, showing tbat be was not suffering from any disease of tbe character heretofore mentioned. This be showed to ber, but she still refused to accord to bim bis. marital rights and to live with bim as man and wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">Edgar, when called to tbe stand by bis father, testified tbat his father slept with bim for some months before tbe final separation, bis mother occupying another room of tbe home. He was told by bis father why be did not sleep with bis1. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>mother, and was also told of the certificate. He was not clear in his recollection whether his father slept with him to the time of the separation, though he was of the impression that he did. There was no other evidence offered by the appellant in support of this charge against the appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">The appellee, Mrs. Beach, testified that during their married life they had their disputes and quarrels, but these were not caused chiefly by her failure to pay the bills contracted by them, which, as she said, was not due to any fault of hers, as she could not pay bills when she did not have enough money with which to pay them, as was often the case. That her husband generally incurred the indebtedness and, when the money was turned over to her by him, she applied it, as far as it would go, to the payment of such debts. That so far as she could recall, only once did she have charged to their account any article of merchandise, and that was a coat for which she was to pay eighty dollars, and upon which a small payment was made. The coat was thereafter put in storage ata cost of five dollars, which she was never able to pay, for at the time it became payable there was money owing for hospital expenses resulting from an injury received by her husband while in the Eire Department and the money they had was applied to the payment of those expenses, and the coat was lost to her. Their domestic troubles, as she testified, often resulted- from his attention to other women. He would come home and tell of his affairs with them, and she would become provoked and angry with him and there would be little intercourse between them for days, or \u201cuntil the grouchiness wore away.\u201d The appellee further testified that the husband left their home on the 16th day of June, 1922. When asked what happened just prior to his leaving, she said: \u201cHe was staying out nights, and then he promised to take me to the theatre, Maryland, and when the time came to go he dressed up and went alone, and when he returned I asked him where he had been, and he said the Maryland, and I was much offended at it, and I told him he had promised to take me, and a few days afterwards he said he intended to leave, and packed up his belongings and left.\u201d That when he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number><em>failed to take </em>her to the theatre with him, she was cross, and of course her relations with him were at the time strained.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">\u201cQ. Did he say anything when he left? A. Hot that I can recollect. Q. Was any one else there when he left ? A. Rose, my daughter, was there. The only one I can remember being present was Rose. Q. Have you made any attempt to joersuade him to come back since he left? A. Ho, I went to my son\u2019s house on three different occasions, and he always went out the back way, and I never came face to face. He would always leave if he saw me coming.\u201d She also testified that at times his treatment of her was harsh and cruel. On one occasion, when they were at church, he said to her: \u201cDon\u2019t you shake hands with anybody in church.\u201d Shortly thereafter a deacon of the church came up and extended his hand, and she shook hands with him, whereupon her husband then and there slapped her in the face. Another time he threw a glass at her, and still another time, when they were in another one of their \u201carguments,\u201d she tried to get out of the room, and he twisted her arm in the door. As to the charge that she would not permit him to have conjugal relations with her, she testified that her refusal was because of his association with other women. When asked if she had any knowledge that he had been out with other women, she answered \u201cyes,\u201d and when asked\u2019 how she knew it, she replied: \u201cHe told me so himself.\u201d It was because of these confessions that she required him to obtain the certificate mentioned, and when it.was shown to her, they thereafter lived together as man and wife until he left, which, as she thought, covered a period of possibly two months.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">Rose E. Richter, a daughter, testified that she was at the home of her mother on the occasion her father left. Her mother told her he was going to leave. \u201cHe looked angry and I did not say anything, and he didn\u2019t say anything to me. He packed his things and walked out of the house, he never said good bye.\u201d She also testified that she saw him throw a glass at her mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">Dorothy R. Rauchhous, the youngest daughter, testified that she lived with her father and mother and, up to ten <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>days or two weeks prior to her father\u2019s leaving home, her married sister lived at the house, and while she and her husband were there, the witness slept in the room occupied by her mother and father, and she knows that at such time they occupied the same room. After her sister\u2019s departure from the home, she moved to the third floor. After that time, she could not say whether they continued to occupy the same room.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">The appellant based his charge of abandonment and desertion by the wife, first, upon her alleged refusal to have sexual intercourse with him; and, second, upon the alleged fact that he was ordered by her to leave the home occupied by them.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">This court has held in a number of cases that where either the husband or wife, without justification, refuses to have sexual intercourse with the other, with the intent that the marital relations shall no longer exist, the one denying the other such right may be said to have abandoned and deserted the one denied that right. <em>Fleegle v. Fleegle, </em>136 Md. 630; <em>Martin v. Martin, </em>141 Md. 182; <em>Klein v. Klein, </em>146 Md. 27. But, while this is the law of this state, the appellant has failed in his efforts to establish the truth of the charge so made against his wife. The only evidence tending to corroborate the evidence of the appellant as to such charge is that of his son Edgar, which went only to the extent of saying that his father\u2019 slept with him for some months before the separation,, while his mother at that time occupied another room in the house, but he could not say with any degree of certainty that he continued te\u00bb sleep with his father until the separation. The fact that the appellant slept with the witness, as stated by the latter, is not conclusive of the fact that the appellee refused to permit the appellant at other times and places to have those relations with her. <em>Ruckle v. Ruckle, </em>141 Md. 207.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">The wife testified that at the time of the separation she and the appellant were living together as man and wife. She admitted that she, for a short time only, refused to have sexual intercourse with him, and this was because of her fear of injury to herself if she permitted such intercourse1} but when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>her apprehensions were allayed by the production of the above mentioned certificate, the suspended marital relations were resumed and these relations were continued to the time he left. In addition to this, their daughter Dorothy testified that she, up to within two weeks of the time of their separation, slept in the room occupied by her mother and father. Thereafter she slept in a room on the third floor, which had been vacated by her married sister. She knew nothing of her father sleeping with Edgar. The only room she knew him to occupy was the one in which he slept with her mother. It is thus clearly shown that the appellant failed to sustain this charge brought against his wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">The evidence produced in support of the second charge, that he was ordered by the wife to leave the home, also fails to establish such fact. The only corroborative evidence offered to' sustain that charge is that of the son Thomas, who said that, on a visit to his mother\u2019s some days after his father had left, he was told by her that his father had left the home after being told by her to' \u201cget out.\u201d Without passing upon the question whether this order of the wife, if given by her, was under the facts and circumstances sufficient to constitute a desertion and abandonment of him by her, the evidence offered was not sufficient to establish the fact that she ordered him to leave the home, certainly not in the face of the express denial of the mother that she said to her son that she had told his father to \u201cget out,\u201d and the evidence of the daughter Bose, who was at the home when her father left.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">The learned chancellor, we think, committed no error in dismissing the bill. The wife did not appeal from that part of the decree dismissing the cross-bill; therefore we are not called upon to review the court\u2019s action in dismissing it.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">From what we have said, the decree appealed from will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-8\">\n<em>Decree affirmed, with/costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
