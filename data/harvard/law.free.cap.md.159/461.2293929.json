Grace Hesson died intestate Hovember 10th, 1926, leaving the appellee, who was her only son and heir at law, to whom letters of administration were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>granted on the mother\u2019s estate. He engaged Louis Hollander as his attorney, who prepared a deed of the lot so conveyed to his mother, which the appellee executed as administrator of his mother, Grace Hesson, to himself individually, and which was \u201csubject however to the legal operation and effect\u201d of the purchase money mortgage from Grace Hesson to Louis Buckner. After the death of his mother the appellee continued to reduce the amount of the mortgage debt until May, 1929, when he heard that the property had not been conveyed to his mother free and clear of ground rents. He mentioned this fact to both the appellant and the said attorney, but was assured by them \u201cthat the title was good and that the deeds conveyed the property free and clear of the payment of any ground rent in accordance with the terms of the aforementioned agreement.\u201d The appellee then advised them that he would make no further payments on the mortgage debt until he was assured that the property was clear of any ground rents. Early in the year of 1929, Louis Hollander, as attorney for Buckner, demanded payment of the balance of the mortgage. On July 29th, 1929, the appellee wrote the appellant, notifying him of the existence of the ground rents, and demanding a title in fee simple to the property free and clear of the ground rents. On or about August 21st, 1929, the appellee received a letter from one Samuel W. Oliner, advising him that he had purchased the mortgage and demanding its immediate payment. Later, on threat of foreclosure, the appellee paid the balance of the mortgage debt to Oliner and obtained a release of the mortgage. The property is sub jet to two ground rents, one of eighty dollars a year, the other of five hundred and eighty dollars a year, which represent a capitalization at six per cent, of eleven thousand dollars on a four thousand dollar property.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">The bill then prays that the agreement of March 11th, 1919, \u201cmay be specifically enforced and that the said defendant may be required <em>to- </em>convey to them a title to said property in accordance with the terms of said agreement,\u201d and for general relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>The only possible question this court sees in this case is whether the appellee should have prayed for specific performance of the agreement, or the defendant required \u201cto pay and keep' and save the property * * * conveyed free and clear from the liability for the ground rents and mortgages to which the same is now liable; etc.\u201d \u201cThe <em>prima, facie </em>presumption of law arising from the acceptance of a deed is that it is an execution of the whole contract, and the rights and remedies of the parties in relation to such contract are to be determined by such deed, and the original agreement becomes null and void.\u201d <em>Bryant v. Wilson, </em>71 Md. 443; <em>West Boundary Co. v. Bayless, </em>80 Md. 495; <em>Lawson v. </em>Mullinix, 104 Md. 156, 157; 18 <em>C. J. </em>270.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">The agreement required the appellant to convey to Grace Hesson the property therein mentioned in fee simple. What she got was a paper called a \u201cdeed\u201d but which was in fact an assignment of a lease, the fee being in the owners of the ground rents, and, after the death of his mother, the appellee, as her administrator, executed a \u201cdeed\u201d to himself individually, prepared by the same attorney who wrote the <em>deed </em>from Buckner to Grace Hesson. That attorney knew or ought to have known that the appellee could not, as administrator, execute a deed for the property in fee simple. It is an exception to the rule that an agreement merged in a deed cannot be enforced unless there be fraud, accident or mistake in the terms and execution of the deed. <em>Bladen v. Wells, </em>30 Md. 581; 18 <em>C. J. </em>271-2. In this case, though the appellant argues that the appellee has not in terms charged the appellant with fraud, accident, or mistake in the transaction, we think it is so stated as to come under at least one of these heads, and the appellant should be required to answer the bill of complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">\n<em>Decree affirmed, with costs, and case remanded for further proceedings.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
