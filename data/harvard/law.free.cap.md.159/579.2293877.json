To this the court replied that the assistant state\u2019s attorney was describing the indictment, and the jurymen had been told, and knew, that they were not to decide anything not in evidence in the case. It is sufficient to point out that, as a jury would inevitably be made aware of the names on an indictment when they took it to the jury room to consider their verdict, and would probably become aware of them otherwise during the proceeding before them, and, in view of the warning remark of the court that the jury were to consider only what had been shown by evidence before them, no injury to the accused could be attributed to the mere reading of the additional names during the argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\"><em>Judgment </em>affirmed, <em>with costs to the appellee.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
