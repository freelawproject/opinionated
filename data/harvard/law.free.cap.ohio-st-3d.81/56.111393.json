Bradley v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1997), 77 Ohio St.3d 239, 242, 673 N.E.2d 1275, 1277. For the reasons that follow, we hold that no evidence attributes Richards\u2019s medical condition to his lumbosacral strain and that the commission abused its discretion by awarding him TTD. Accordingly, we reverse and grant the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">The receipt of TTD \u201crests on a claimant\u2019s inability to return to his or her former job as a direct result of an industrial injury.\u201d State <em>ex rel. Pretty Products, Inc. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1996), 77 Ohio St.3d 5, 6, 670 N.E.2d 466, 467. The burden to prove these elements is the claimant\u2019s, <em>State ex rel. Pleban v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 406, 407, 678 N.E.2d 562, 564, and requires the production of affirmative evidence. Stated differently, the \u201clack of \u2018some evidence\u2019 supporting the [commission\u2019s] denial of [TTD] does not automatically translate into \u2018some evidence\u2019 supporting [the] award.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Foor v. Rockwell Internatl. </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 396, 398, 678 N.E.2d 554, 556; <em>State ex rel. Lampkins v. Dayton Malleable, Inc. </em>(1989), 45 Ohio St.3d 14, 542 N.E.2d 1105.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-9\">The commission does not dispute that no medical evidence specifically attributed Richards\u2019s period of disability to his 1989 industrial injury. It instead relies on <em>Fox v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1955), 162 Ohio St. 569, 55 O.O. 472, 125 N.E.2d 1, to argue that a causal connection can be inferred based on a reasonable probability that Richards\u2019s injury generated his medical condition. <em>Fox, </em>however, specifically requires direct medical testimony or other medical evidence to establish causation in proving a claimant\u2019s eligibility for workers\u2019 compensation. Following <em>Aiken v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1944), 143 Ohio St. 113, 28 O.O. 50, 53 N.E.2d 1018, syllabus, <em>Fox </em>held that the record \u201cmust include evidence by competent medical witnesses that a probable relationship existed between the original accident and [the claimant\u2019s disabling condition].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 575, 55 O.O at 475, 125 N.E.2d at 5. Accord <em>State ex rel. Quarto Mining Co. v. Foreman </em>(1997), 79 Ohio St.3d 78, 83, 679 N.E.2d 706, 710-711.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>Without medical evidence, the commission has no basis to determine the cause of a medical condition \u2014 it simply does not have the expertise. \u201cSuch a claim can be established by medical [proof] only.\u201d <em>Fox </em>at 576-577, 55 O.O. at 475, 125 N.E.2d at 6. As no medical evidence in this record attributed Richards\u2019s medical condition to his injury, the commission abused its discretion in awarding him TTD. Accordingly, we reverse the court of appeals\u2019 judgment and grant the requested writ of mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and writ granted.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b186-6\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, F.E. Sweeney, Pfeifer, Cook and Lundberg Stratton, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b186-7\">Douglas, J., dissents.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b186-8\">Douglas, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A5\">dissenting. I would affirm the well-reasoned judgment of the court of appeals and, thereby, uphold the TTD award entered by the Industrial Commission.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
