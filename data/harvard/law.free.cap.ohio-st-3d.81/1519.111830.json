On April 2, 1998, this case was dismissed for want of prosecution because appellant failed to timely file a memorandum in support of jurisdiction. On April 13,1998, appellant filed a motion for reconsideration of the dismissal of this case. Appellant attached to the motion for reconsideration a memorandum in support of jurisdiction and a motion to deem the memorandum in support of jurisdiction timely filed. Whereas S.Ct.Prac.R. XIV(1)(C) prohibits the filing of a document after the filing deadline and prohibits motions to waive the timeliness requirement,</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-20\">IT IS ORDERED by the court, <em>sua sponte, </em>that the memorandum in support of jurisdiction and motion attached to appellant\u2019s motion for reconsideration be, and hereby are, stricken.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-21\">IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that appellant\u2019s motion for reconsideration be, and hereby is, denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
