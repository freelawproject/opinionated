Civ.R. 8(B) states that a defendant \u201cshall state in short and plain terms the party\u2019s defenses to each claim asserted and shall admit or deny the averments upon which the adverse party relies.\u201d In this case, an <em>amended </em>complaint is at issue, but Civ.R. 15(A) requires a similar response to amended pleadings: \u201cA party shall plead in response to an' amended pleading within * * * fourteen days after service of the amended pleading * * * .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b148-11\">Civ.R. 8(C) provides that \u201c[i]n pleading to a preceding pleading, a party shall set forth affirmatively * * * res judicata * * * .\u201d In <em>State ex rel. Plain Dealer Publishing Co. v. Cleveland </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 31, 33, 661 N.E.2d 187, 189, this court held that \u201c[a]n affirmative defense is waived under Civ.R. 12(H), unless it is presented by motion before pleading pursuant to Civ.R. 12(B), affirmatively in a responsive pleading under Civ.R. 8(C), or by amendment under Civ.R. 15. <em>Hoover v. Sumlin </em>(1984), 12 Ohio St.3d 1, 4, 12 OBR 1, 4, 465 N.E.2d 377, 380.\u201d We modify that holding today, noting that Civ. R. 12(H) applies only to affirmative defenses listed in Civ. R. 12(B)(1) through (6). Affirmative defenses other that those listed in Civ.R. 12(B) are waived if not raised in the pleadings or in an amendment to the pleadings. Civ.R. 8; Civ.R. 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>In <em>State ex rel. Freeman v. Morris </em>(1991), 62 Ohio St.3d 107, 109, 579 N.E.2d 702, 703, this court held that the defense of <em>res judicata </em>may not be raised by a motion to dismiss under Civ.R. 12(B). Thus, even assuming that the city\u2019s last-second filing of a motion to dismiss based on <em>res judicata </em>was timely filed, the affirmative defense of <em>res judicata </em>was improperly raised therein. The city failed to raise the defense in either a responsive pleading or by amendment, and therefore waived it.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">The amendment to the original complaint in Jim\u2019s II was significant \u2014 it added another party with distinct claims. A responsive pleading asserting the defense of res <em>judicata </em>was therefore crucial. Whether <em>res judicata </em>would have been successful as an affirmative defense in a case like this is a bridge we will cross when we properly come to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">We accordingly reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and reinstate the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b149-8\">F.E. Sweeney and Lundberg Stratton, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b149-9\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick and Cook, JJ., concur in judgment only.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
