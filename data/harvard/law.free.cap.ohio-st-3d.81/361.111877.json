Further pleadings shall be had in accordance with the Rules of Civil Procedure, provided that service of summons on such petition shall not be required. * * * The court, or the jury * * *, shall determine the right of the claimant to participate or to continue to participate in the fund upon the evidence adduced at the hearing of the action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">Civ. R. 41(A)(1) provides that \u201can action may be dismissed by the plaintiff without order of court * *</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">Civ.R. 41(A)(2) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">\u201cExcept as provided in subsection (1) an action shall not be dismissed at the plaintiffs instance except upon order of the court and upon such terms and conditions as the court deems proper. If a counterclaim has been pleaded by a defendant prior to the service upon him of the plaintiffs motion to dismiss, the action shall not be dismissed against the defendant\u2019s objection unless the counterclaim can remain pending for independent adjudication by the court. Unless otherwise specified in the order, a dismissal under this paragraph is without prejudice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b491-9\">In <em>Lewis v. Connor </em>(1985), 21 Ohio St.3d 1, 21 OBR 266, 487 N.E.2d 285, at the syllabus, the court held:</p>\n<p id=\"b491-10\">\u201cWhere a notice of appeal is filed within the time prescribed by R.C. 4123.519 [now R.C. 4123.512] and the action is dismissed without prejudice after expiration of that time, R.C. 2305.19, the savings statute, is applicable to workers\u2019 compensation complaints filed in the common pleas court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b491-11\">Claimant reads <em>Lewis </em>as providing that \u201c[w]here the claimant timely files his complaint (petition) as required by [R.C.] 4123.512, and thereafter voluntarily dismisses such complaint, claimant is * * * entitled to refile his complaint within one year of the dismissal.\u201d To the extent that claimant seeks to bring the facts of the present case within the purview of the holding in <em>Lewis, </em>we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-12\">Unlike the present case, the <em>claimant </em>in <em>Lewis </em>appealed the commission\u2019s order to the common pleas court, and the court dismissed claimant\u2019s complaint without prejudice due to failure of claimant\u2019s counsel to attend a pretrial conference. It is true that the syllabus in <em>Lewis </em>is broader than its facts, since, by its terms, it permits the refiling of a complaint without regard to who filed the appeal or whether the claimant initiated the dismissal. However, despite the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>broadness of the syllabus language, it cannot fairly be said that the court in <em>Lewis </em>gave any consideration to the issue certified in the case <em>sub judice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">The certified issue has not been directly addressed by this court. The First, Second, and Tenth District Courts of Appeals have concluded that Civ.R. 41(A) does not apply to a workers\u2019 compensation claimant in a case appealed by the employer under R.C. 4123.512 or former R.C. 4123.519. <em>Rhynehardt; Richwalsky v. ABF Freight Sys., Inc. </em>(Sept. 18, 1996), Hamilton App. No. C-960064, unreported, 1996 WL 526695, appeal pending in case No. 96-2442; <em>Anderson v. Sonoco Products Co. </em>(1996), 112 Ohio App.3d 305, 310-311, 678 N.E.2d 631, 634-635.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">In a series of cases, the Eighth District Court of Appeals has held to the contrary. <em>Rice v. Stouffer Foods Corp. </em>(Nov. 6, 1997), Cuyahoga App. No. 72515, unreported, 1997 WL 691156; <em>Schade v. Ohio Bur. of Workers\u2019 Comp. </em>(1997), 117 Ohio App.3d 857, 691 N.E.2d 772; <em>Moore v. Trimble </em>(Aug. 15, 1996), Cuyahoga App. No. 67895, unreported, 1996 WL 465383; <em>Ross v. Wolf Envelope Co. </em>(Aug. 2, 1990), Cuyahoga App. No. 57015, unreported, 1990 WL 109082.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">In lining up on one or the other side of the issue, the following inquiries are presented: (1) whether the pleading that claimant is required to file in the common pleas court is a \u201cpetition\u201d or a \u201ccomplaint\u201d; (2) whether it is the filing of the notice of appeal by the employer or the filing of the petition/complaint by the claimant that \u201ccommences\u201d the action; (3) whether the claimant should be considered the \u201cplaintiff\u2019 in the action; (4) whether the employer\u2019s appeal should be analogized to a \u201ccounterclaim\u201d that cannot be independently adjudicated; and (5) whether application of Civ.R. 41(A) alters or defeats the basic purpose of R.C. 4123.512. See, also, <em>Keller v. LTV Steel Co. </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 55, 666 N.E.2d 225 (Lundberg Stratton, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">All these questions are \u00e1 necessary and unavoidable consequence of the symbiotic relationship that the General Assembly has created between R.C. 4123.512 and the Civil Rules. Although these inquiries tend to overlap and merge in application, they will be considered separately for purposes of analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b492-10\">\n<em>Petition/Complaint</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b492-11\">The inquiry into whether the claimant\u2019s initial pleading under R.C. 4123.512 is properly denominated a \u201cpetition\u201d or a \u201ccomplaint\u201d is a misdirected question. The term \u201cpetition,\u201d as used in R.C. 4123.512, has no special significance and possesses no unique value. For purposes of the Civil Rules, the pleading that R.C. 4123.512 names a petition is a complaint. R.C. 4123.512\u2019s use of the word \u201cpetition\u201d in no way affects the operation or applicability of Civ.R. 41(A). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number><em>Zuljevic v. Midland-Ross Corp. </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St.2d 116, 118, 16 O.O.3d 140, 141, 403 N.E.2d 986, 987; Staff Notes to Civ.R. 8(A); Young\u2019s Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law of Ohio (2 Ed.1971) 214, 216, Section 11.20.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">\n<em>Commencement of Action</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">According to one view, \u201cCiv.R. 41(A) applies only to those who <em>commence </em>the action and the claimant was not the one who commenced the action.\u201d (Emphasis <em>sic.) Keller, </em>76 Ohio St.3d at 55, 666 N.E.2d at 225 (Lundberg Stratton, J., dissenting). Similarly, GM argues that \u201c[t]he employer commenced the proceeding and * * * it is not the claimant\u2019s case to dismiss.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b493-9\"><em>Amicus curiae </em>Ohio Academy of Trial Lawyers (\u201cOATL\u201d) argues that the action is commenced by the filing of the complaint, rather than by the notice of appeal. In support, it refers to Civ.R. 3, which provides that \u201c[a] civil action is commenced by filing a complaint with the court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b493-10\">R.C. 4123.512(A) governs who may appeal an order of the Industrial Commission, which court has jurisdiction, and when the appeal must be filed. The last sentence of the first paragraph of R.C. 4123.512(A) reads: \u201cThe filing of the notice of the appeal with the court is the only act required to perfect the appeal.\u201d The second paragraph of R.C. 4123.512(A) begins, \u201c[i]f an action has been commenced * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b493-11\">The requirement that the claimant must file a petition first appears in R.C. 4123.512(D). When \u201cthe employer appeals, the purpose of requiring a petition by the claimant is to give orderliness to the appellate proceeding.\u201d <em>Singer Sewing Machine Co. v. Puckett </em>(1964), 176 Ohio St. 32, 37, 26 O.O.2d 303, 305,197 N.E.2d 353, 356.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-12\">-It seems reasonably clear that the General Assembly contemplated that the filing of the notice of appeal, not the complaint, commences the action. Contrary to OATL\u2019s position, \u201cthe statutory requirement of a notice of appeal is essential to the commencement of the action and it takes precedence over Rule 3(A), which defines commencement as the filing of a complaint with the court.\u201d Young\u2019s Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law of Ohio, at 214, Section 11.20. Accordingly, it is the employer, not the claimant, who has commenced the action pursuant to R.C. 4123.512.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-13\">This does not mean, however, that the claimant may not dismiss the action. It is not true that \u201cCiv.R. 41(A) applies only to those who commence the action\u201d or that \u201cit is not the claimant\u2019s case to dismiss.\u201d There is nothing in Civ.R. 41(A) that purports to limit its application to those who commence the action or that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>makes dismissal contingent upon commencement. Indeed, the word \u201ccommence\u201d is nowhere to be found in Civ.R. 41(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">An action is a \u201cclaim for relief.\u201d Staff Notes to Civ.R. 8(A). In the usual civil case, the party commencing the action is the one presenting a claim for relief. Thus, in the usual civil case, it would be accurate to conclude that Civ.R. 41(A) applies to those who commence the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">However, R.C. 4123.512 is a special statutory proceeding that creates a unique situation in which the party commencing the action is not presenting a claim for relief. When an employer appeals the commission\u2019s allowance of a claim pursuant to R.C. 4123.512, the employer is not presenting a claim for relief. A notice of appeal filed by the employer pursuant to R.C. 4123.512 is no more a claim for relief than it is a request for \u201caffirmative relief\u2019 or a \u201cdemand for judgment.\u201d <em>Zuljevic, </em>62 Ohio St.2d at 119, 16 O.O.3d at 142, 403 N.E.2d at 988, fn. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">Regardless of who files the notice of appeal, the action belongs to the claimant. It is the claimant who must \u201cfile a petition * * * showing a cause of action to participate or to continue to participate in the fund and setting forth the basis for the jurisdiction of the court over the action.\u201d R.C. 4123.512(D). It is the claimant who must plead all \u201cthe jurisdictional facts, i.e., injury in the course of and arising out of employment, disability, causal relationship, the filing of a claim, the required administrative processing terminating in an appealable order and the venue, situs of the injury or contract.\u201d Young\u2019s Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law, at 213, Section 11.20.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">It is also the claimant\u2019s burden to prove all these facts. As the court explained in <em>Zuljevic, </em>62 Ohio St.2d at 118, 16 O.O.3d at 141-142, 403 N.E.2d at 988:</p>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">\u201cIt has been held that a claimant has both the burden of going forward with evidence and the burden of proof at the hearing before the common pleas court. * * * Thus, where an employer appeals an unfavorable administrative decision to the court the claimant must, in effect, re-establish his workers\u2019 compensation claim to the satisfaction of the common pleas court [or jury] even though the claimant has previously satisfied a similar burden at the administrative level.\u201d (Citations omitted.) See, also, Fulton, Ohio Workers\u2019 Compensation Law (1991) 267, Section 12.6. Thus, \u201ca claimant must again substantiate <em>his claim </em>in order to refute an employer\u2019s appeal.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Youghiogheny &amp; Ohio Coal Co. v. Mayfield </em>(1984), 11 Ohio St.3d 70, 72, 11 OBR 315, 316, 464 N.E.2d 133, 135.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-9\">In Price <em>v. Westinghouse Elec. Corp. </em>(1982), 70 Ohio St.2d 131, 24 O.O.3d 237, 435 N.E.2d 1114, the court held Civ.R. 56 applicable to proceedings brought under former R.C. 4123.519. In <em>Price, </em>the employer appealed the commission\u2019s decision to the court of common pleas, and we noted that Civ.R. 56(B) was applicable to these proceedings. <em>Id., </em>70 Ohio St.2d at 132, 24 O.O.3d at 238, 435 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>N.E.2d at 1115, fn. 1. Civ.R. 56(B) makes summary judgment available to \u201c[a] party <em>against whom </em>a claim * * * is asserted,\u201d while Civ.R. 56(A) makes summary judgment available to \u201c[a] party seeking to recover upon a claim.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">Clearly, this court has consistently found that in an employer-initiated R.C. 4123.512 appeal, it is the claimant, not the employer, who presents a claim for relief. Accordingly, the fact that GM commenced the instant action in the common pleas court does not preclude claimant from voluntarily dismissing it pursuant to Civ.R. 41(A). Indeed, it would be quite anomalous to preclude claimant access to Civ.R. 41(A) on the basis that he did not commence the action. The cause is presently before this court precisely because it was dismissed by the trial court pursuant to Civ.R. 41(B)(1), on the basis that claimant failed to prosecute the action. Yet, the party who is required to prosecute the action under Civ.R. 41(B)(1) (and to show a \u201cright to relief\u2019 under [B][2]) is the same person to whom Civ.R. 41(A) gives the right to dismiss the action. If the right to dismiss is contingent upon commencement, so is the duty to prosecute. It is inconsistent to withhold from claimant the voluntary dismissal provisions of Civ.R. 41(A), on the basis that it is <em>not </em>his action to dismiss, yet apply against claimant the involuntary dismissal provisions of Civ.R. 41(B), on the basis that it <em>is </em>claimant\u2019s action to prosecute.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">\n<em>Claimant as Plaintiff</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b495-9\">The assertion that a claimant is not a plaintiff in an employer-initiated R.C. 4123.512 appeal is based on two arguments: (1) the claimant is not the one who brought the action, and (2) the claimant is an appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-10\">The first argument is a restated version of the commencement argument, and fails for essentially the same reasons. The claimant files a complaint, pleads all jurisdictional facts, presents a claim for relief, appears in the caption of the complaint as a plaintiff, opens and closes the case, has the burden of production and persuasion, and has the duty to prosecute the action. A trial <em>de novo </em>takes place in the common pleas court within the traditional framework of civil trials, and the claimant is required to take all affirmative steps necessary to have his or her claim litigated.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-11\">Also, as pointed out with respect to the commencement argument, the ruling giving rise to the present appeal is the trial court\u2019s granting of GM\u2019s motion pursuant to Civ.R. 41(B)(1). Civ.R. 41(B)(1) authorizes the court to involuntarily dismiss an action or claim \u201c[w]here the <em>plaintiff </em>fails to prosecute.\u201d (Emphasis added.) This is the same plaintiff to whom Civ.R. 41(A) grants the right of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>voluntary dismissal. Thus, for purposes of Civ.R. 41, the claimant in an employer-initiated R.C. 4123.512 appeal is the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">As to the second argument, the fact that claimant is denominated an appellee under R.C. 4123.512 does not detract from his or her status as a plaintiff for purposes of Civ.R. 41. \u201cThe appeal authorized by R.C. 4123.519 is unique in that it is considered a trial <em>de novo.\u201d Youghiogheny &amp; Ohio Coal Co., </em>11 Ohio St.3d at 71, 11 OBR at 316, 464 N.E.2d at 134. It necessitates a new trial, without reference to the administrative claim file or consideration of the results of the administrative hearings. <em>Valentino v. Keller </em>(1969), 17 Ohio St.2d 21, 46 O.O.2d 194, 244 N.E.2d 750; Young\u2019s Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law, at 217, Section 11.20. It is not a record review or an error proceeding. Instead, \u201c[t]he court, or the jury under the instructions of the court, if a jury is demanded, shall determine the right of the claimant to participate or to continue to participate in the fund upon the evidence adduced at the hearing of the action.\u201d R.C. 4123.512(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">In a particularly poignant analysis, the Court of Appeals for Franklin County, in <em>Marcum v. Barry </em>(1991), 76 Ohio App.3d 536, 539-540, 602 N.E.2d 419, 421-422, explained as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">\u201cAlthough labeled an appeal and commenced initially by the filing of a notice of appeal, the action in the common pleas court under R.C. 4123.519 seeking a redetermination of a decision of the Industrial Commission is not a traditional error proceeding[ ] * * *. R.C. 4123.519 contemplates not only a full and complete <em>de novo </em>determination of both facts and law but also contemplates that such determination shall be predicated not upon the evidence adduced before the Industrial Commission but, instead, upon evidence adduced before the common pleas court as in any civil action, which may involve a jury trial if demanded. The proceedings are <em>de novo </em>both in the sense of receipt of evidence and determination. The common pleas court, or the jury if it be the factual determiner, makes the determination <em>de novo </em>without consideration of, and without deference to, the decision of the Industrial Commission. R.C. 4123.519 contemplates a full <em>de novo </em>hearing and determination. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">\u201c* * * With respect to an R.C. 4123.519 appeal, there are no words such as \u2018review, affirm, modify, or reverse\u2019 as are contained in R.C. 2505.02, nor even the word \u2018affirm\u2019 or the words \u2018reverse, vacate, or modify\u2019 as set forth in R.C. 119.12 with respect to administrative appeals generally. Rather, the express language of R.C. 4123.519 is that contained in division (C) [now section (D) of R.C. 4123.512] that the court or jury shall \u2018determine the right of the claimant to participate or to continue to participate in the fund <em>upon the evidence adduced at the hearing of the action.\u2019 </em>(Emphasis added.)\u201d (Citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>Thus, when the employer appeals the allowance of a workers\u2019 compensation claim pursuant to R.C. 4123.512, the claimant is a plaintiff in the common pleas court proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">\n<em>The Counterclaim Analogy</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">GM argues that permitting the claimant to dismiss under Civ.R. 41(A) effectively nullifies the employer\u2019s right to appeal. In support, GM relies on <em>Rhynehardt </em>and <em>Anderson </em>for the proposition that \u201can employer\u2019s appeal under Ohio Rev.Code \u00a74123.512 cannot be resolved when a claimant voluntarily dismisses his petition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b497-9\">The court in <em>Rhynehardt </em>reasoned that:</p>\n<p id=\"b497-10\">\u201cWhile it is not completely on point, we find the present scenario to be persuasively analogous to the situation in which a Civ.R. 41(A)(1)(a) dismissal is expressly inapplicable, namely, when there is a counterclaim that cannot be independently adjudicated. The employer\u2019s appeal cannot be heard independent of the adjudication of the claimant\u2019s complaint.\u201d <em>Id., </em>103 Ohio App.3d at 332, 659 N.E.2d at 378.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-11\">The court in <em>Anderson </em>agreed \u201cbecause the employer\u2019s appeal, which the employee/claimant obviously cannot dismiss, is incapable of being adjudicated independently of the employee/claimant\u2019s claim of entitlement to Workers\u2019 Compensation benefits set forth in the petition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b497-12\">By its terms, Civ.R. 41(A)(2) is also inapplicable where a counterclaim is pleaded that cannot remain pending for independent adjudication. However, the analogy is fundamentally flawed. A counterclaim is \u201c[a] pleading that sets forth a claim for relief.\u201d Civ.R. 8(A). As previously mentioned with.respect to the commencement argument, a notice of appeal filed by the employer pursuant to R.C. 4123.512 is no more a claim for relief than it is a request for affirmative relief or a demand for judgment. <em>Zuljevic, </em>62 Ohio St.2d at 119, 16 O.O.3d at 142, 403 N.E.2d at 988, fn. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-13\">Thus, as stated by the court of appeals, \u201cthe foregoing logic is not persuasive because an employer\u2019s appeal in a workers\u2019 compensation case is not analogous to a counterclaim in a civil action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b497-14\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b497-15\">\n<em>Alteration of Statutory Purpose</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ArD\">Civ.R. 1(C) provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>\u201cThese rules, to the extent that they would by their nature be clearly inapplicable, shall not apply to procedure * * * (7) in all other special statutory proceedings; provided, that where any statute provides for procedure by a general or specific reference to all the statutes governing procedure in civil actions such procedure shall be in accordance with these rules.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">In Price <em>v. Westinghouse Elec. Corp. </em>(1982), 70 Ohio St.2d 131, 132, 24 O.O.3d 237, 238, 435 N.E.2d 1114, 1115, the court explained:</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">\u201cCiv.R. 1 is clearly a rule of inclusion rather than exclusion. * * * To the extent that the issue in question is procedural in nature, the Civil Rules should apply unless they are \u2018clearly inapplicable.\u2019 * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">\u201c * * * Moreover, it is clear that in certain instances some of the Civil Rules will be applicable while others will be clearly inapplicable.\u201d (Citations omitted.) See, also, Staff Notes (1970) to Civ.R. 1(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">A Civil Rule is clearly inapplicable \u201c \u2018only when [its] use will alter the basic statutory purpose for which the specific procedure was originally provided in the special statutory action.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>70 Ohio St.2d at 133, 24 O.O.3d at 239, 435 N.E.2d at 1116, quoting <em>State ex rel. Millington v. Weir </em>(1978), 60 Ohio App.2d 348, 349, 14 O.O.3d 310, 311, 397 N.E.2d 770, 772.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-9\">GM and the <em>amici </em>in support argue that the application of Civ.R. 41(A) would allow claimants to arbitrarily delay th\u00e9 proceedings for perhaps an additional one or two years, during which time they will continue to receive or pursue disputed compensation and benefits which the employer or the fund may not be able to recoup. Thus, Civ.R. 41(A), if applied to an employer\u2019s appeal under R.C. 4123.512, would alter the basic statutory purpose of such an appeal, which is to provide for a speedy and inexpensive remedy, and is clearly inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-10\">As presented, the argument is directed at the applicability of Civ.R. 41(A) as a whole, rather than at the applicability of Civ.R. 41(A)(2) in particular, and draws support- from cases that involve dismissals under Civ.R. 41(A)(1)(a). However, the issue certified in this case, and the only issue properly before the court at this time, is limited to the applicability of Civ.R. 41(A)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-11\">Whatever reasoning may be advanced as justification for denying a claimant the unilateral ability to dismiss his or her action loses its potency with respect to dismissals under Civ.R. 41(A)(2). The claimant has no ability under Civ.R. 41(A)(2) to arbitrarily delay the adjudication of the common pleas court proceedings. Civ.R. 41(A)(2) bestows no right or power of decision upon the claimant. To the contrary, it provides that \u201can action shall not be dismissed at the plaintiffs instance except upon order of the court and upon such terms and conditions as the court deems proper.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AtC\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>Civ.R. 41(A)(2), therefore, forces a judicial determination as to the propriety of the dismissal prior to its effectuation. In considering whether to grant the dismissal under Civ.R. 41(A)(2), the trial court is able to assess the claimant\u2019s reasons for dismissal and to gauge whether, and to what extent, the claimant stands to receive more compensation or benefits at the time the dismissal is sought. Thus, the employer\u2019s right to an expeditious appeal would not be altered by the claimant\u2019s use of Civ.R. 41(A)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\">Moreover, the result urged by GM is that the dismissal without prejudice here operates as the summary destruction of claimant\u2019s complaint. \u201cThis result is both anomalous and fundamentally unfair.\u201d <em>Lewis, </em>21 Ohio St.3d at 3, 21 OBR at 267, 487 N.E.2d at 287.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">In accordance with all the foregoing, we answer the certified issue in the affirmative, and hold that when an employer has appealed a decision of the Industrial Commission to a court of common pleas under R.C. 4123.512, the court of common pleas may subsequently grant a motion to voluntarily dismiss the employee\u2019s complaint without prejudice under Civ.R. 41(A)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b499-8\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, F.E.

The claimant in this case presents himself as a \u201cplaintiff\u2019 and asserts that he has the right to dismiss his petition under Civ.R. 41(A). Because I would find that in an appeal perfected by an employer pursuant to R.C. 4123.512, a claimant may not voluntarily dismiss his or her petition pursuant to Civ.R. 41(A), I respectfully dissent for the following three reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-10\">First, a claimant is not similarly situated to a traditional plaintiff because the claimant is not the one who <em>commences </em>this action. When the employer <em>appeals </em>a workers\u2019 compensation decision, the claimant is required to file a <em>petition </em>(not a complaint) <em>in response </em>to a notice of appeal filed by the employer. See <em>Keller v. LTV Steel Co. </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 55, 666 N.E.2d 225 (Lundberg Stratton, J., dissenting). The trial <em>de novo </em>issue is merely a statutory delegation of the burden of proof upon appeal. The majority ignores the fact that the claimant continues to receive benefits while having to reestablish his or her right to these benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>In <em>Anderson v. Sonoco Products Co. </em>(1996), 112 Ohio App.3d 305, 310-311, 678 N.E.2d 631, 634-635, the court emphasized the importance of the language of R.C. 4123.512:</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">\u201c[T]he action is initially brought by the employer, when it is an employer\u2019s appeal, by virtue of the filing of the notice of appeal. This statute does not refer to the employee as a \u2018plaintiff,\u2019 but as a \u2018claimant.\u2019 Furthermore, the statute does not refer to the pleading required to be filed by the claimant as a \u2018complaint,\u2019 but as a \u2018petition.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">\u201cIn our view, the use of the terms \u2018claimant\u2019 and \u2018petition\u2019 in the statute in contradistinction .to the terms \u2018plaintiff and \u2018complaint\u2019 is significant. It reflects the fact that the claimant is not a plaintiff in the ordinary sense of that word as being the person who brought the action. Where the employer has appealed, the employer has brought the action, although the burden of prosecuting that action immediately shifts to the claimant by virtue of the statute. Thus, in our view, the employee/claimant is not a \u2018plaintiff for purposes of Civ.R. 41(A)(1), and is not, therefore, entitled as a matter of right to dismiss the action without prejudice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">Second, this claimant is not similarly situated to a traditional plaintiff because a traditional plaintiff has not yet received any award and therefore does not want delay. In an employer\u2019s R.C. 4123.512 appeal, the commission has already awarded the claimant benefits and the claimant is receiving those benefits. The majority\u2019s holding today encourages delay and abuse of Civ.R. 41(A). It allows the claimant to wait as long as possible and then dismiss the case, wait one year and refile, or never refile at all, in order to continue to receive payments for a claim that the employer is challenging. Even though the majority limits the dismissals to Civ.R. 41(A)(2), which would provide for some judicial control over dismissal of the case, the trial judge nevertheless lacks control over whether the claimant refiles. The employer has no mechanism to force the claimant to promptly refile his or her case; the employer simply must wait for the claimant to make the next move, no matter how long. If the claimant never refiles, does the employer file a motion after one year to dismiss a case <em>already dismissed </em>in order to bring closure to the claimant\u2019s failure to pursue what was the employer\u2019s appeal?</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">Third, this claimant- is not simil\u00e1rly situated to a traditional plaintiff because the claimant, having already been awarded benefits at the commission level, is not required to pay back the benefits received, regardless of the outcome of the case. The claimant will continue to receive benefits after failure to refile the case in one year until a court ruling that would somehow bring closure to this \u201cdismissed\u201d appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">In conclusion, to permit a claimant to unilaterally dismiss the employer\u2019s appeal under Civ.R. 41(A) to delay or thwart the rights of an employer that is contesting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>the findings of the Industrial Commission defeats the purpose of the appeals process and is an abuse of Civ.R. 41(A). <em>Keller, </em>76 Ohio St.3d at 55-56, 666 N.E.2d at 225 (Lundberg Stratton, J., dissenting). Further, permitting this dismissal frustrates the statutory purpose of R.C. 4123.512. Thus, I agree with the rationale in <em>Anderson </em>and would hold that when the employer files an appeal in a common pleas court pursuant to R.C. 4123.512, the employee/claimant is not a \u201cplaintiff\u2019 for purposes of Civ.R. 41(A) and may not voluntarily dismiss the case without prejudice. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b501-5\">Cook, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Auc\">dissenting. For the reasons set forth in Justice Stratton\u2019s dissenting opinion, I too must respectfully dissent. I write separately only to complement her analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">Justice Stratton\u2019s first reason for dissenting tracks the analysis set forth by Judge Fain in <em>Anderson v. Sonoco Products Co. </em>(1996), 112 Ohio App.3d 305, 678 N.E.2d 631. Judge Fain, writing for a majority of the court, interpreted Civ.R. 41(A) to exclude an employee/claimant to an employer\u2019s R.C. 4123.512 appeal from having the right of voluntary dismissal. Judge Fain based that interpretation on the differing terms used in Civ.R. 41(A) and in R.C. 4123.512. In an R.C. 4123.512 appeal, the employee is titled a \u201cclaimant\u201d and the pleading that he or she files is titled a \u201cpetition.\u201d As an R.C. 4123.512 claimant to an employer\u2019s appeal, an employee does not initiate the action by filing the petition. Instead, the action is initiated by the employer\u2019s filing of an appeal. Common definition of the term \u201cplaintiff,\u201d which contemplates only the party who initiates an action, therefore excludes the R.C. 4123.512 claimant as a person who may invoke a Civ.R. 41(A) dismissal. <em>Id. </em>at 309-311, 678 N.E.2d at 634-635.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">Justice Stratton\u2019s remaining reasons for finding Civ.R. 41(A) inapplicable to employer appeals under R.C. 4123.512 find support in Civ.R. 1(C), which states:</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">\u201cThese rules, to the extent that they would by their nature be clearly inapplicable, shall not apply to procedure * * * (7) in all other special statutory proceedings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b501-9\">This court has interpreted that rule to mean that \u201c \u2018[t]he civil rules should be held to be clearly inapplicable only when their use will alter the basic statutory purpose for which the specific procedure was originally provided in the special statutory action.\u2019 \u201d <em>Price v. Westinghouse Elec. Corp. </em>(1982), 70 Ohio St.2d 131, 133, 24 O.O.3d 237, 239, 435 N.E.2d 1114, 1116, quoting <em>State ex rel. Millington v. Weir </em>(1978), 60 Ohio App.2d 348, 349, 14 O.O.3d 310, 311, 397 N.E.2d 770, 772.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-10\">Because the employer\u2019s challenge under R.C. 4123.512 is in the nature of an appeal and the employee/claimant continues to receive benefits until the claim is disallowed, a voluntary dismissal under Civ.R. 41(A) permits the employee/claim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>ant a strategic hedge. Even if the. appealing employer ultimately succeeds on appeal, an employee/claimant may substantially extend his or her benefit period by invoking Civ.R. 41(A). Accordingly, use of Civ.R. 41(A) in an R.C. 4123.512 employer\u2019s appeal alters the basic statutory purpose for which the specific procedure was originally provided in the special statutory action \u2014 that being prompt resolution of a challenge to the employee/claimant\u2019s right to participate in the State Insurance Fund. By limiting the employee/claimant\u2019s ability to voluntarily dismiss to the procedure set forth in Civ.R. 41(A)(2), the majority does not remove this incompatibility. The delay occasioned by a voluntary dismissal, even where some control is retained by the court, is simply at odds with an R.C. 4123.512 appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">Accordingly, I too would answer the certified question in the negative and reverse the judgment of the appellate court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b502-5\">Lundberg Stratton, J., concurs in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
