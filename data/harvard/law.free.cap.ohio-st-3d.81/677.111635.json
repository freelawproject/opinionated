Roche Laboratories </em>(1996), 77 Ohio St.3d 116, 121, 671 N.E.2d 252, 256, fn. 2, citing <em>Gladon v. Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Auth. </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 312, 318-319, 662 N.E.2d 287, 294; and <em>Posin v. A.B.C.

Civ.R. 50(A)(4) states:</p>\n<p id=\"b807-8\">\u201cWhen a motion for a . directed verdict has been properly made, and the trial court, after construing the evidence most strongly in favor of the party against whom the motion is directed, finds that upon any determinative issue reasonable minds could come to but one conclusion upon the evidence submitted and that conclusion is adverse to such party, the court shall sustain the motion and direct a verdict for the moving party as to that issue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b807-9\">In <em>Wagner, </em>we quoted <em>Strother v. Hutchinson </em>(1981), 67 Ohio St.2d 282, 284-285, 21 O.O.3d 177, 178-179, 423 N.E.2d 467, 469, in setting forth the standard for deciding a motion for a directed verdict or for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict:</p>\n<p id=\"b807-10\">\u201cThe law in Ohio regarding directed verdicts is well formulated. In addition to Civ.R. 50(A), it is well established that the court must neither consider the weight of the evidence nor the credibility of the witnesses in disposing of a directed verdict motion. * * * Thus, \u2018if there is substantial competent evidence to support the party against whom the motion is made, upon which evidence reasonable minds might reach different conclusions, the motion must be denied. <em>Kellerman v. J.S. Durig Co. </em>(1964), 176 Ohio St. 320 [27 O.O.2d 241, 199 N.E.2d 562] * * *.' <em>Hawkins v. Ivy </em>(1977), 50 Ohio St.2d 114, 115 [4 O.O.3d 243, 244, 363 N.E.2d 367, 368].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b807-11\">In <em>Wagner, </em>we stated that \u201c \u2018[t]he \u201creasonable minds\u201d test of Civ.R. 50(A)(4) calls upon the court only to determine whether there exists any evidence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>substantial probative value in support of [the claims of the party against whom the motion is directed], * * * A motion for a directed verdict raises a question of law because it examines the materiality of the evidence, as opposed to the conclusions to be drawn from the evidence.\u2019 <em>Ruta v. Breckenridge-Remy Co. </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St.2d 66, 68-69, 23 O.O.3d 115, 116-117, 430 N.E.2d 935, 938.\u201d <em>Wagner, </em>77 Ohio St.3d at 119-120, 671 N.E.2d at 255-256.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">We thus must determine whether reasonable minds could come to the one conclusion that appellant contributed more than fifty percent of the negligence involved in the accident so that, under Ohio\u2019s comparative negligence laws, appellant was not entitled to judgment. We hold instead that reasonable minds could differ as to the allocation of negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">In order to establish actionable negligence, the plaintiff must show the existence of a duty, a breach of the duty, and an injury proximately resulting therefrom. <em>Fed. Steel &amp; Wire Corp. v. Ruhlin Constr. Co. </em>(1989), 45 Ohio St.3d 171, 173, 543 N.E.2d 769, 772, citing <em>Menifee v. Ohio Welding Products, Inc. </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 75, 77, 15 OBR 179, 180, 472 N.E.2d 707, 710; <em>Di Gildo v.

Howard </em>(1967), 10 Ohio St.2d 189, 39 O.O.2d 228, 226 N.E.2d 564.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">The court of appeals in the case <em>sub judice </em>held as a matter of law that appellant had a duty to take due care in observing hazards in her path (to \u201cwatch her step\u201d in effect) that exceeded appellee\u2019s duty to keep dangerous obstructions out of the way of pedestrians. The existence of a particular party\u2019s duty \u201c \u2018 depends on the foreseeability of the injury. * * * \u2019 <em>Menifee v. Ohio Welding Products, Inc., supra, </em>at 77, 15 OBR at 180, 472 N.E.2d at 710, citing <em>Ford Motor Co. v. Tomlinson </em>(C.A.6, 1956), 229 F.2d 873, 59 O.O. 345; <em>Gedeon v. E. Ohio Gas Co. </em>(1934), 128 Ohio St. 335, 190 N.E. 924; see, also, <em>Hill v. Sonitrol of Southwestern Ohio, Inc. </em>[(1988), 36 Ohio St.3d 36, 39, 521 N.E.2d 780, 783]. The court in <em>Menifee, supra, </em>set forth the following test to be used in order to determine foreseeability: \u2018[W]hether a reasonably prudent person would have anticipated that an injury was likely to result from the performance or nonperformance of an act.\u2019 <em>Menifee, supra, </em>at 77, 15 OBR at 180, 472 N.E.2d at 710, citing <em>Freeman v. United States </em>(C.A.6, 1975), 509 F.2d 626; <em>Thompson v. Ohio Fuel Gas Co. </em>(1967), 9 Ohio St.2d 116, 38 O.O.2d 294, 224 N.E.2d 131; <em>Mudrich v. Standard Oil Co. </em>(1950), 153 Ohio St. 31, 41 O.O. 117, 90 N.E.2d 859.\u201d <em>Fed. Steel &amp; Wire Corp., </em>45 Ohio St.3d at 174, 543 N.E.2d at 772-773.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-7\">The legal issue presented here is whether a reasonably prudent person would have anticipated that an injury would result from walking normally on that sidewalk. This court has held that \u201c[a] pedestrian using a public sidewalk is under a duty to use care reasonably proportioned to the danger likely to be encountered but is not, as a matter of law, required to look constantly downward <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>* **.\u201d <em>Grossnickle v. Germantown </em>(1965), 3 Ohio St.2d 96, 32 O.O.2d 65, 209 N. E.2d 442, paragraph two of the syllabus. This care requires a pedestrian \u201cto use his senses to avoid injury while walking on a sidewalk, but this does not mean that he is required as a matter of law to keep his eyes upon the sidewalk at all times. It may be necessary to keep a lookout for traffic and other pedestrians to avoid collision.\u201d <em>Griffin v. Cincinnati </em>(1954), 162 Ohio St. 232, 238, 55 O.O. 118, 120, 123 N.E.2d 11, 15. See, also, <em>Cash v. Cincinnati </em>(1981), 66 Ohio St.2d 319, 325-326, 20 O.O.3d 300, 304, 421 N.E.2d 1275, 1279; <em>Burge v. Pepsi-Cola Bottling Co. of Cincinnati </em>(1971), 26 Ohio St.2d 237, 55 O.O.2d 478, 271 N.E.2d 273, syllabus, and 26 Ohio St.2d at 241-242, 55 O.O.2d at 480, 271 N.E.2d at 275.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">More recently, this court has continued to hold that the question of whether the contributory negligence of a plaintiff is the proximate cause of the injury is an issue for the jury to decide pursuant to the modern comparative negligence provisions of R.C. 2315.19(A)(1). <em>Junge v. Brothers </em>(1985), 16 Ohio St.3d 1, 4, 16 OBR 254, 256, 475 N.E.2d 477, 480. See, also, <em>Cash, </em>66 Ohio St.2d at 326, 20 O.O.3d at 304, 421 N.E.2d at 1280.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-8\">After construing the evidence most strongly in favor of appellant (the party against whom the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict was directed), we find that reasonable minds could differ as to the proper distribution of negligence between the parties. Testimony indicated that the propped-open service door blocked at least half the width of the sidewalk and that the bucket used to prop open the door contained protruding concrete blocks that could cause serious injuries. Although appellant testified that she did not actually see the concrete bucket, she stated that she was walking at a normal or a slower-than-normal pace that day and that she was taking due care as she walked, looking straight ahead, rather than down at the ground. Thus, there is adequate evidence in the record of substantial probative value that supports the jury\u2019s finding that appellant was taking the proper amount of care to avoid obstructions and that appellee was one hundred percent negligent in the manner by which the bucket of concrete propped open the door, and that this negligence proximately caused the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-9\">We therefore reverse the judgment of the court of appeals on the issue addressed in this opinion. We remand this cause to the court of appeals for that court to review the remaining assignments of error raised by both parties below, which were found to be moot and not addressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-10\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b809-11\">Douglas, F.E. Sweeney and Pfeifer, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b810-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>Moyer, C.J., Cook and Lundberg Stratton, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b810-5\">Cook, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A-o\">dissenting. I agree with the judgment of the court of appeals and thus respectfully dissent. By Rule\u2019s testimony, we know that the door and the offending bucket were visible to Texler as she walked along the sidewalk where she fell. Texler herself testified that she remembered that the bucket protruded into her path. Construing that evidence most strongly in Texler\u2019s favor, reasonable minds could not differ on the issue of whether Texler\u2019s proportion of negligence exceeded fifty percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">I would affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<judges id=\"b810-7\">Moyer, C.J., and Lundberg Stratton, J., concur in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b810-8\">Lundberg Stratton, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ABX\">dissenting. Because the uncontroverted facts in this case, construed most strongly in Texler\u2019s favor, support the court of appeals\u2019 finding that the trial court should have granted a directed verdict or judgment notwithstanding the verdict in favor of appellee, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-9\">The record at trial established that Texler worked in the same shopping complex as D.O. Summers Cleaners and frequently walked past the business. Texler knew that D.O. Summers often propped open its side door with an object. Texler admitted that, on the day of her fall, she saw the door propped open. Dorothy Rule, walking next to Texler, testified that she saw the bucket about forty feet away. The bucket was obvious. Texler does not recall any obstructions to her vision and she admits she would have seen the bucket had she looked.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-10\">The majority articulates the issue as whether \u201ca reasonably prudent person would have anticipated that an injury would result from walking normally on that sidewalk.\u201d The majority concludes that there was adequate evidence in the record to support the jury\u2019s finding that Texler was using the proper amount of care to avoid the bucket. However, a reasonably prudent person who should have seen a five-gallon bucket in plain view being used to prop open a large metal door has a duty to exercise due care to avoid the bucket. The law requires that if a pedestrian sees a\u2019hazard on the sidewalk, he or she has a duty to avoid it. <em>Grossnickle v. Germantown </em>(1965), 3 Ohio St.2d 96, 32 O.O.2d 65, 209 N.E.2d 442. If it is clearly discernible from a reasonable distance, a person\u2019s failure to see and avoid it constitutes negligence. <em>Griffin v. Cincinnati </em>(1954), 162 Ohio St. 232, 55 O.O. 118, 123 N.E.2d 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-11\">Texler had a duty to discover and protect herself from an open and obvious hazard on the sidewalk. <em>Raflo v. Losantiville Country Club </em>(1973), 34 Ohio St.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>1, 63 O.O.2d 1, 295 N.E.2d 202; <em>Sidle v. Humphrey </em>(1968), 13 Ohio St.2d 45, 42 O.O.2d 96, 233 N.E.2d 589. Texler\u2019s failure to avoid the bucket because she did not look down at the sidewalk was no excuse, particularly when she admitted that she saw the door propped open when approaching and would have seen the bucket had she looked down. <em>Raflo; Jeswald v. Hutt </em>(1968), 15 Ohio St.2d 224, 44 O.O.2d 196, 239 N.E.2d 37. Consequently, Texler\u2019s injury was foreseeable and was the natural and probable consequence of her failure to exercise due care to avoid a discernible hazard on the sidewalk. <em>Jeffers v. Olexo </em>(1989), 43 Ohio St.3d 140, 143, 539 N.E.2d 614, 617.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-4\">Property owners and shopkeepers frequently place obstacles in the path of pedestrians \u2014 a display of sale items in a grocery aisle; a mop, bucket and sign warning \u201cwet floor\u201d; or a grocery cart or empty box in the middle of an aisle. Individuals also leave objects in the path of pedestrians \u2014 a broom, suitcase, briefcase, or open door. We expect that something obvious and apparent will be seen and avoided by a reasonably prudent person who walks by. Any negligence attributable to placing an object, open and obvious, in the path of another could not exceed the negligence of a pedestrian who should have seen the object yet does not exercise due care to avoid colliding with it. The majority\u2019s opinion creates a dangerous precedent, which, in effect, alleviates a pedestrian\u2019s responsibility for exercising due care.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">Consequently, I would affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<judges id=\"b811-6\">Moyer, C.J., concurs in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
