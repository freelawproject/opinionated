Former Ohio Adm.Code 4121:1-5-01(B)(17) defines \u201cguarded\u201d as \u201ccovered, fenced, railed, enclosed, or otherwise shielded from accidental contact.\u201d Fetzer presents three arguments that alternately assert compliance and inapplicability. Upon review, we find none of them persuasive and affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">Fetzer cites the language \u201cotherwise shielded from accidental contact\u201d and claims that the robotic equipment performed that function by eliminating the need for claimant to be in the danger zone during the operating cycle. This argument fails for two reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">First, the protection that Ohio Adm.Code 4121:1\u20145\u201411(D)(6) requires is not confined to the machine\u2019s \u201coperating cycle.\u201d This distinguishes this case from <em>State ex rel. Aspinwall v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 55, 531 N.E.2d 681, on which Fetzer heavily relies. There, the relevant part of the safety requirement expressly limited protection to the machine\u2019s \u201coperating cycle.\u201d The provision before us contains no such restriction.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">Second, the robotic device prevented accidental contact only while parts were actually being cast. It provided no protection when claimant \u2014 as he was often required \u2014 entered the danger zone to dislodge a part.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">Fetzer also argues that claimant was not entitled to the protection of Ohio Adm.Code 4121:1-5-11(D)(6) because he was the \u201ctender,\u201d not the \u201coperator\u201d of the machine. This contention fails as well. Regardless of what Fetzer chose to call claimant, he was actively involved in the machine\u2019s operation. Claimant started, inspected, and cleaned the die. He operated the linkage mechanism and set die heights. He oiled the die and checked for defective parts. He was responsible for lodged parts and correcting malfunctions. He was not, therefore, a casual observer with no responsibility for or participation in the machine\u2019s function.-</p>\n<p id=\"b594-9\">Fetzer lastly alleges that claimant has not established the requisite causal relationship because he has not established why the die closed. Fetzer misconstrues the nature of the relevant causal relationship. Claimant was not required to explain precisely how the accident happened. He was required to show only that the machine was not guarded and that the absence of this protection proximately caused his injuries. Claimant has satisfied this burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-10\">Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-11\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b594-12\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
