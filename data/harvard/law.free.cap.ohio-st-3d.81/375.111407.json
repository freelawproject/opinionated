R.C. 2505.03(A) states that \u201c[ejvery final order\u201d may be reviewed on appeal. Thus, at first glance, the resolution of the issue seems clear. However, in the past, this court has arrived at a different conclusion. In <em>State v. Huntsman </em>(1969), 18 Ohio St.2d 206, 47 O.O.2d 440, 249 N.E.2d 40, this court found that an order granting a defendant a new trial was a \u201cfinal order\u201d within the meaning of those words as used in Section 3, Article IV of the Ohio Constitution and in R.C. 2953.02, and therefore appealable. <em>Id. </em>at 210-211, 47 O.O.2d at 443, 249 N.E.2d at 43. However, this court found that the thrust of R.C. 2953.02 to 2953.13 clearly indicated that the General Assembly was contemplating appeals by the defendant in a criminal action and <em>not </em>by the state. Thus, the court held that R.C. 2953.02 to 2953.14 inclusive do not provide for an appeal on behalf of the state from the action of the trial judge in granting a defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">However, <em>Huntsman </em>dealt with R.C. Chapter 2953, while the case at bar involves R.C. 2505.02. Further, while the <em>Huntsman </em>court differentiated between appeals under R.C. Chapters 2953 and 2505, finding that R.C. Chapter 2505 covered civil appeals, this court has since applied R.C. 2505.02 to criminal cases. See <em>State v. Davidson </em>(1985), 17 Ohio St.3d 132, 17 OBR 277, 477 N.E.2d 1141, where this court held that an order granting a motion seeking to suppress evidence \u201c[is] a final appealable order within the meaning of R.C. 2505.02.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 135, 17 OBR at 280, 477 N.E.2d at 1145. Therefore, we have already implicitly held that R.C. 2505.02 applies to all appeals, civil and criminal.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-9\">In this case, the court of appeals denied leave to appeal pursuant to R.C. 2945.67, which provides that \u201c[a] prosecuting attorney * * * may appeal as a matter of right any decision of a trial court in a criminal case * * * which grants a motion to dismiss all or any part of an indictment, complaint, or information, a motion to suppress evidence, or a motion for the return of seized property or grants post conviction relief * * * and may appeal by leave of the court to which the appeal is taken any other decision, except the final verdict, of the trial court in a criminal case * * *.\u201d R.C. 2945.67(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-10\">R.C. 2945.67(A) is unique to criminal cases, dealing with procedural aspects that occur only in criminal cases, and draws a distinction between an appeal as of right and an appeal by leave. This statute enumerates four trial court decisions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>from which the state may appeal as a matter of right: a motion to dismiss all or any part of an indictment, complaint, or information, a motion to suppress evidence, a motion for the return of seized property, or a motion granting postconviction relief. R.C. 2945.67(A). All other appeals are by leave at the discretion of the court of appeals, except, of course, that the state may not appeal a final verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">One could argue that R.C. 2945.67, as enacted November 1, 1978, implicitly overruled <em>Huntsman </em>and expanded state appeals by leave to include orders granting new trials. To clarify any lingering confusion, we hold that pursuant to R.C. 2505.02 and 2505.03(A), a trial court\u2019s order granting the defendant a new trial in a criminal case is a final appealable order. However, the state may appeal from that order only by leave of the court to which the appeal is taken, pursuant to R.C. 2945.67(A). <em>State v. Huntsman, </em>18 Ohio St.2d 206, 47 O.O.2d 440, 249 N.E.2d 40, is no longer applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">A motion for a new trial is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court, and the court\u2019s ruling on the motion will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Schiebel </em>(1990), 55 Ohio St.3d 71, 564 N.E.2d 54, paragraph one of the syllabus. The defendant\u2019s first motion for new trial alleged that Roulette later received consideration for his testimony after both he and the prosecution denied the existence of a deal. The second motion for new trial alleged that a man named Raymond Marks came forward on April 4, 1991 to confess that he was the individual who murdered Wayne Price. The third motion for new trial alleged that Roulette provided a sworn statement recanting his prior trial testimony where he identified defendant as the murderer. Finally, the fourth motion for new trial was based on a combination of Roulette\u2019s alleged recantation, Roulette\u2019s alleged secret deal with the state, and newly discovered evidence of Paxton\u2019s alleged secret deal with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">Granting or denying the state\u2019s motion for leave to appeal in a criminal case is solely within the discretion of the reviewing court. <em>State v. Fisher </em>(1988), 35 Ohio St.3d 22, 517 N.E.2d 911, paragraph two of the syllabus; <em>State v. Ferman </em>(1979), 58 Ohio St.2d 216, 12 O.O.3d 206, 389 N.E.2d 843. Although the court of appeals in its 1992 affirmance of defendant\u2019s convictions and the denial of defendant\u2019s first motion for new trial did indeed address the possibility of secret deals between the state and Roulette and Paxton, it was not until after defendant was convicted that Roulette and Paxton actually would have received any leniency. Thus, while these early references to the alleged deals with Roulette and Paxton could be seen as barring the granting of defendant\u2019s final motion for new trial due to considerations of <em>res judicata, </em>see <em>State v. Perry </em>(1967), 10 Ohio St.2d 175, 39 O.O.2d 189, 226 N.E.2d 104, that was for the trial court to decide in granting the final motion for new trial. From the numerous and varied motions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>for new trial alleging secret deals, recantations, and even another possible killer, the facts of this case are so murky that we cannot determine whether the court of appeals should have granted leave to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\">We are now clarifying that under R.C. 2505.02 and 2505.03(A), a trial court\u2019s order granting the defendant a new trial in a criminal case is a final appealable order which the state may appeal by leave of court. Thus, at the time this matter was before the court of appeals, it was unclear whether <em>Huntsman </em>was the law and whether orders granting a new trial in criminal cases were final appealable orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">In this case, the appellate court\u2019s decision consisted of only one line: \u201cMotion by appellant for leave to appeal pursuant to R.C. 2945.67 is denied.\u201d The court of appeals\u2019 order overruling the state\u2019s motion for leave to appeal fails to reveal the basis upon which the court relied. It is unclear whether the court of appeals denied leave to appeal under R.C. 2945.67 because it assumed that an order granting a motion for a new trial was not a final order appealable by the state or whether the court simply denied leave under its discretionary authority. Therefore, because this court now clarifies that an order granting a new trial in a criminal case is a final appealable order, we remand to the court of appeals for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b507-7\">Resnick and Pfeifer, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b507-8\">Moyer, C.J., concurs in the syllabus and judgment.</judges>\n<judges id=\"Aem\">Douglas and F.E.

I respectfully dissent. The granting of a new trial in a criminal case to a defendant is a final order which may be appealed by the state as a matter of right. The last prong of R.C. 2505.02 is clear and unambiguous: \u201cAn order that affects a substantial right in an action which in effect determines the action and prevents a judgment, an order that affects a substantial right made in a special proceeding or upon a summary application in an action after judgment, or <em>an order that vacates or sets aside a judgment or grants a new trial </em>is a final order that may be reviewed, affirmed, modified, or reversed, with or without retrial.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Since such an order is final, it, without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>more, becomes appealable pursuant to R.C. 2505.03(A). These sections of the code need to be applied \u2014 not interpreted.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">Accordingly, I believe that both the majority opinion and the dissent of Justice Cook are in error. This is not an R.C. 2945.67 case or issue. The language \u201cand may appeal by leave of the court\u201d in R.C. 2945.67 refers only to those orders which are not final in and of themselves and which are not, pursuant to the statute, appealable as of right. To discuss R.C. 2945.67 in the context of a clear R.C. 2505.02-.03 case only adds to what the majority describes as \u201clingering confusion.\u201d Today we turn \u201clingering confusion,\u201d if there was any, into \u201crampant confusion.\u201d I am compelled to dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b508-5\">F.E. Sweeney, J., concurs in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b508-6\">Cook, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AcO\">dissenting. I agree with the majority that, pursuant to R.C. 2945.67(A), the grant of a motion for new trial is a final order which the state may appeal only by leave of court. However, I do not believe it is judicially prudent to address our decision in <em>Huntsman. </em>Nor do I believe it is necessary to remand the cause to the appellate court. I therefore respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">In <em>State v. Huntsman </em>(1969), 18 Ohio St.2d 206, 47 O.O.2d 440, 249 N.E.2d 40, this court held that former R.C. 2953.02 (providing for review of judgments or final orders in criminal cases) did not afford the state a right to appeal from a trial court order granting the defendant a new trial. In reaching this conclusion, the court stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">\u201cWhen Section 2953.05 was amended in 1960, the General Assembly again evidenced that it was contemplating only appeals by defendants pursuant to Sections 2953.02 to 2953.13, inclusive, of the Revised Code.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 213, 47 O.O.2d at 444, 249 N.E.2d at 44-45.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-9\">Many of the code sections relied upon in <em>Huntsman </em>have since been repealed. Moreover, discussion and application of R.C. 2945.67, which specifically addresses the situation at hand, is absent from the <em>Huntsman </em>analysis. As a result, I believe that the decision in <em>Huntsman </em>was correct in the context in which it was made: Former R.C. 2953.02 did not provide for appeals by the state.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>By analyzing <em>Huntsman </em>in the context of the case at bar, the majority creates the appearance that it bears some relevance to the issue at hand.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It is not the case that <em>Huntsman </em>is \u201cno longer applicable,\u201d but that it is not applicable to the present situation. For those members of the bar depending upon this court for guidance, I am concerned that the majority\u2019s treatment of <em>Huntsman </em>misrepresents both its status as legal precedent and the legal basis for reaching our conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">In <em>Huntsman, </em>this court determined that an order granting a new trial is a final appealable order in the criminal, as well as the civil, context, and that \u201c[s]ections 2953.02 to 2953.14, inclusive, of the Revised Code, do not provide for an appeal on behalf of the state from the action of a trial judge in granting a defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial.\u201d <em>Id., </em>18 Ohio St.2d 206, 47 O.O.2d 440, 249 N.E.2d 40, syllabus. These propositions are still good law. By engaging in this tangential analysis, the majority creates an opportunity for misconstruction of its holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">As for the remand to the court of appeals, I believe it to be unnecessary. By its assessment that the appellate court\u2019s decision may have been based on a view that it lacked jurisdiction, the majority discounts the well-settled notion that a reviewing court does not presume error by an inferior court. Rather, we are to indulge in all reasonable presumptions consistent with the record in favor of lower court decisions on questions of law, <em>Fletcher v. Fletcher </em>(1994), 68 Ohio St.3d 464, 468, 628 N.E.2d 1343, 1347, and presume that the court of appeals properly exercised its discretion in denying the state leave to appeal. Accordingly, I would affirm the decision of the court of appeals.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b508-10\">. Those sections of R.C. Chapter 2953 that are discussed in <em>Huntsman </em>and are currently in existence, R.C. 2953.03, 2953.07 to 2953.11, and 2953.13, still do not provide for appeals by the state, from any final order except that of sentencing. See R.C. 2953.08(B). R.C. 2953.14, also discussed in the <em>Huntsman </em>opinion, today provides, as it did in 1969, for appeals by the state from adverse decisions rendered by courts <em>superior to the trial court.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b509-11\">. The appellee did not file a brief or argue in this ease.
