However, based upon respondent\u2019s violations of DR 1-102(A)(6), 6 \u2014 101 (A)(2), and 6-101(A)(3), we believe a more severe sanction is warranted. We hereby suspend respondent from the practice of law for one year with six months of the year stayed, provided that within thirty days respondent resume his counseling with a psychologist or psychiatrist who would submit quarterly reports to relator, that respondent complete one year of probation, and that he make restitution of $400 to Mr. and Mrs. Tom Derifield, who had filed one of the grievances giving rise to count one of the complaint.
