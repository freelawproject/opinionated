Ranzy\u2019s assertion, however, is meritless for the following reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-13\">First, Ranzy\u2019s maximum prison term has not expired. As the court of appeals correctly concluded, under former R.C. 2929.41(B)(3),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Ranzy\u2019s sentences for new <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>felonies committed after his 1973 conviction and sentence for armed robbery were to be served consecutively to his 1973 sentence. Second, Ranzy did not verify his petition as required by R.C. 2725.04. <em>State ex rel. Lemmon v. Ohio Adult Parole Auth. </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 186, 188, 677 N.E.2d 347, 349. Finally, Ranzy did not attach copies of all of his pertinent commitment papers. <em>McBroom, v. Russell </em>(1996), 77 Ohio St.3d 47, 48, 671 N.E.2d 10, 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">Based on the foregoing, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b238-7\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
