Fisher, sitting by assignment in the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas, Division of Domestic Relations, from further proceedings in the above-captioned case.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-7\">Affiant alleges that Judge Fisher is biased and prejudiced against her and in favor of the defendant. In support of this claim, affiant cites several actions and statements allegedly made by Judge Fisher during pretrial proceedings in this case. She further notes that this case, which originally was assigned to Judge James P. Celebrezze, was reassigned to Judge Fisher by the administrative judge of the division following Judge Celebrezze\u2019s recusal, and alleges that the recusal and reassignment occurred without a hearing, which demonstrates a strong appearance of impropriety. Affiant also asserts that Judge Fisher denied her recent motion for a change of venue without conducting a hearing on the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-8\">Disagreement or dissatisfaction with a judge\u2019s rulings does not constitute bias or prejudice and is not grounds for a judge\u2019s disqualification. <em>In re Disqualification of Murphy </em>(1988), 36 Ohio St.3d 605, 522 N.E.2d 459. The fact that one judge of a multi-judge division recuses himself from a pending case and that the administrative judge of that division reassigns that case without a hearing does not impute bias, prejudice, or an appearance of impropriety to the judge to whom the case is assigned. Similarly, a judge\u2019s denial of a motion for a change of venue without conducting a hearing is a matter subject to review on appeal and does not demonstrate bias or prejudice on the part of the judge. This is particularly true where, as here, the motion was filed several months after the affiant elected to file her case in Cuyahoga County.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-9\">The balance of affiant\u2019s claims does not support a finding of bias, prejudice, or other interest that mandates Judge. Fisher\u2019s disqualification from this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-10\">For these reasons, the affidavit of disqualification is found not well taken and is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
