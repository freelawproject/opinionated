I(9)(A)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-11\">The applicant in this case used the title \u201cGeneral Counsel\u201d on agency letterhead as well as the title \u201cAttorney at Law\u201d on her personal stationery when she was not licensed to practice law in Ohio. The issue before this court is whether these actions constitute the unauthorized practice of law in Ohio. We hold that they do.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-12\">R.C. 4705.07 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>\u201cNo person who is not regularly licensed to practice law in the state shall hold himself out in any manner as an attorney at law, or shall represent himself either orally or in writing, directly or indirectly, as authorized to practice law.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">\u201cThe use of \u2018lawyer,\u2019 \u2018attorney at law,\u2019 \u2018counselor at law,\u2019 \u2018law,\u2019 \u2018law office,\u2019 or other equivalent words by any person not licensed to practice law, in connection with his own name, or any sign, advertisement, card, letterhead, circular, or other writing, document, or design, the evident purpose of which is to induce others to believe such person to be an attorney, constitutes holding out within the meaning of this section.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">In addition, DR 2-102(A)(4) of the Code of Professional Responsibility provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b685-8\">\u201cA lawyer or law firm may be designated as \u2018General Counsel\u2019 or by similar professional reference on stationery of a client if the lawyer or the firm devotes a substantial amount of professional time in the representation of that client. \u2021 \u2021 \u2021 \u00bb</p>\n<p id=\"b685-10\">DR 2-101(A) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b685-11\">\u201cA lawyer shall not, on his or her own behalf or that of a partner, associate, or other lawyer affiliated with the lawyer or the lawyer\u2019s firm, use, or participate in the use of, any form of public communication, including direct mail solicitation, that:'</p>\n<p id=\"b685-12\">\u201c(1) Contains any false, fraudulent, misleading, deceptive, self-laudatory, or unfair statement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b685-13\">As cited by the Board of Commissioners on Character and Fitness in its September 12,1997 report, Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline Opinion No. 89-37 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b685-14\">\u201cThe Code of Professional Responsibility does not prohibit an attorney admitted in another state from being listed on an Ohio law firm\u2019s letterhead provided the jurisdictional limitations are indicated. An attorney admitted in another state and awaiting admission to the Ohio bar is not permitted to hold himself or herself out as an attorney licensed to practice law in Ohio. An attorney licensed to practice in another state and waiting to be admitted in Ohio is not permitted to give legal advice directly to clients in Ohio even if the jurisdictional limitations are disclosed. * * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b685-15\">In a second opinion, No. 90-13, the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline held:</p>\n<p id=\"b685-16\">\u201cUnder DR 2-102(A)(4), a lawyer who devotes a substantial amount of professional time to a client may appear on the client\u2019s letterhead and be designated as \u2018general counsel\u2019 or similar professional reference. The same lawyer may also sign correspondence using a client\u2019s letterhead, with or without being listed on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>the letterhead provided there is a clear designation of the lawyer\u2019s professional status.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">The third relevant opinion of the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline, Opinion No. 89-11, provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">\u201cNon-lawyer employees of a law firm may use the firm\u2019s letterhead as long as under their signature they indicate their capacity with clarity, including indicating that they are not licensed to practice law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">Based upon the above opinions, the Board of Commissioners on Character and Fitness found that Stage should have had a disclaimer at least on her letterhead indicating that she was not licensed to practice law in Ohio. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">Stage contends that she and CMHA orally informed officers, management, and employees of CMHA, as well as outside counsel, that she was not yet admitted to practice law in Ohio. Further, she contends that the article submitted to local newspapers referring to her as General Counsel for CMHA was submitted without her prior knowledge and approval. However, protecting the public is the primary goal in prohibiting the unauthorized practice of law. While Stage\u2019s colleagues were well aware of her status, members of the public may not have been so informed because written communications to the public made no mention of her pending status.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-8\">Since this error was brought to the applicant\u2019s attention, she has added a disclaimer to her agency letterhead indicating that she is not licensed to practice in Ohio, and CMHA has changed her title to that of \u201cManaging Counsel.\u201d In addition, she has ceased using the title \u201cAttorney at Law\u201d on her personal stationery. Changing her title to \u201cManaging Counsel\u201d would not have been enough to satisfy this court\u2019s requirement that attorneys in these circumstances inform the public that they are not yet licensed in Ohio, as the designation of \u201cCounsel\u201d still conveys the impression of being a licensed attorney. However, the use of the disclaimer with either title fulfills this burden because it conveys her pending status to the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-9\">We concur in the board\u2019s finding that when an individual is not admitted to the practice of law in Ohio, the use of the term \u201cGeneral Counsel\u201d without a disclaimer stating that the individual is not licensed to practice law in Ohio constitutes the unauthorized practice of law. Because of the danger of misleading the public, the better practice would be not to use titles such as \u201cGeneral Counsel\u201d or \u201cManaging Counsel\u201d at all until the applicant is admitted to practice law in Ohio. Thus, to avoid confusion regarding whether an individual is an attorney licensed to practice in the state of Ohio, applicants should not use such potentially misleading designations while awaiting admittance to the Ohio Bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>Accordingly, we hold that an applicant for admission without examination to the practice of law in Ohio or any other person not admitted to the practice of law in Ohio may not use the designation \u201cGeneral Counsel,\u201d \u201cManaging Counsel,\u201d or any other term implying that the individual is already admitted to the practice of law in Ohio unless that person provides a disclaimer in any letterhead or other oral or written communication stating that the individual is not licensed to practice law in Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">In the case at bar, there was no evidence that Stage actively engaged in the unauthorized practice of law beyond mere use of the inappropriate designations. Because the circumstances do not indicate a deliberate attempt to mislead and because the applicant has either ceased using or added a disclaimer to the inappropriate designations, we find that the applicant has the requisite character, fitness, and moral qualifications for admission to the practice of law in the state of Ohio. The court will now consider her pending application for admission without examination pursuant to Gov.Bar R. I(9)(F).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">\n<em>Character, fitness and moral qualifications approved.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b687-7\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
