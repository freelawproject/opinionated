For the reasons that follow, we hold that adverse possession must be proven by clear and convincing evidence and affirm the court of appeals\u2019 determination that the Kochs had not established title by adverse possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-12\">To acquire title by adverse possession, the party claiming title must show exclusive possession and open, notorious, continuous, and adverse use for a period of twenty-one years. <em>Pennsylvania Rd. Co. v. Donovan </em>(1924), 111 Ohio St. 341, 349-350, 145 N.E. 479, 482. See, also, <em>State ex rel. A.A.A. Invest. v.

Noel </em>(1884), 42 Ohio St. 18, 21; R.C. 2305.05. Failure of proof as to any of the elements results in failure to acquire title by adverse possession! <em>Pennsylvania Rd. Co. v. Donovan, </em>111 Ohio St. at 349-350, 145 N.E. at 482.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-13\">As a preliminary matter, we must clarify the quantum of proof needed to establish each element of an adverse possession claim, something this court has not done definitively apart from the cotenant context.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> See <em>Demmitt v. McMillan </em>(1984), 16 Ohio App.3d 138, 140, 16 OBR 146, 148, 474 N.E.2d 1212, 1215.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>The court of appeals spoke at length about adverse possession being disfavored. We agree. A successful adverse possession action results in a legal titleholder forfeiting ownership to an adverse holder without compensation. Such a doctrine should be disfavored, and that is why the elements of adverse possession are stringent. See 10 Thompson on Real Property (Thomas Ed.1994) 108, Section 87.05 (\u201cthere are no equities in favor of a person seeking to acquire property of another by adverse holding\u201d). We believe that the burden of proof should be equally rigorous. A substantial majority of our sister states agree and already apply the clear and convincing evidentiary standard, or a variant thereof, to adverse possession claims.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We hold that to acquire title by adverse posses<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>sion, a party must prove, by clear and convincing evidence, exclusive possession and open, notorious, continuous, and adverse use for a period of twenty-one years.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">Grace first took action to assert ownership in July 1992, when Anthony Koch began spreading gravel over the strip and Grace attempted to stop him.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Therefore, to establish adverse possession, the Kochs must prove by clear and convincing evidence that each element of adverse possession had been established since 1971. We find it unnecessary to address each of the elements of adverse possession because the Kochs did not establish by clear and convincing evidence that they held the strip adversely to Grace for the. entire statutory period.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">This court has stated that \u201c[i]t is the visible and adverse possession with an intent to possess that constitutes [the occupancy\u2019s] adverse character,\u201d <em>Humphries v. Huffman </em>(1878), 33 Ohio St. 395, 402, and that \u201c[t]he occupancy must be such as to give notice to the real owner of the extent of the adverse claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 404. In <em>Lane v. Kennedy </em>(1861), 13 Ohio St. 42, this court stated that to make possession adverse, \u201cthere must have been an intention on the part of the person in possession to <em>claim title, so manifested </em>by his declarations or his acts, that a failure of the owner to prosecute within the time limited, raises a presumption of an extinguishment or a surrender of his claim.\u201d (Emphasis <em>sic.) Id. </em>at 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-8\">The Vermont Supreme Court stated the same proposition more colorfully when it declared that to establish adversity, \u201c[t]he tenant must unfurl his flag on the land, and keep it flying so that the owner may see, if he will, that an enemy has invaded his dominions and planted his standard of conquest.\u201d <em>Darling v. Ennis </em>(1980), 138 Vt. 311, 313, 415 A.2d 228, 230. See, also, <em>Philbin v. Carr </em>(1920), 75 Ind.App. 560, 591, 129 N.E. 19, 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>There is no question that the Kochs used the strip. They mowed the grass, parked cars in the strip, and their children played in the strip. The Kochs also placed firewood, oil drums, and a swing set in the strip.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> While we consider the case a close one, we conclude that the record does not contain clear and convincing evidence that Grace or his parents were on notice that their dominions had been invaded in 1971. The Kochs asked for the Graces\u2019 permission before proceeding to mow the strip. Mr. Koch conceded that he knew that the strip belonged to Grace and that he never would have used it without permission. Absent clear and convincing evidence of the adversity of the Kochs\u2019 claim to the strip for the entire statutory period, adverse possession must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals and remand the cause to the trial court for restoration of title to the strip to Grace and determination of damages for the Kochs\u2019 trespass on the strip.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b710-7\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.

Fletcher </em>(1906), 74 Ohio St. 295, 78 N.E. 433, this court stated, \u201c[A] tenant in common cannot assert title by adverse possession against his co-tenant unless he shows a definite and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>continuous assertion of adverse right by overt acts of unequivocal character clearly indicating an assertion of ownership of the premises to the exclusion of the right of the co-tenant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 305-306, 78 N.E. at 436. See <em>Hogg v. Beerman </em>(1884), 41 Ohio St. 81, paragraph three of the syllabus; <em>Youngs v. Heffner </em>(1880), 36 Ohio St. 232, paragraph one of the syllabus. The court enunciated an extremely high standard to establish adverse possession against a cotenant because possession by one eotenant is presumed to be possession by all. <em>Ferenbaugh v. Ferenbaugh </em>(1922), 104 Ohio St. 556, 559, 136 N.E. 213, 214-215.
