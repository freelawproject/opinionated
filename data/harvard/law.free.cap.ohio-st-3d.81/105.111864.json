He claims entitlement to a writ of mandamus by alleging that Judge Griffin did not follow the mandate of the court of appeals in <em>Cotton </em>to enter a judgment vacating his conviction and sentence and discharging him.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-10\">Cotton is not entitled to a corrected common pleas court entry vacating his conviction and sentence and discharging him because he has already received this relief from the court of appeals. Although some of the <em>Cotton </em>opinion and entry refers to a \u201cremand\u201d to the common pleas court for \u201cfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion,\u201d the entire entry and opinion in context leave no doubt that the court of appeals reversed Cotton\u2019s judgment of conviction and discharged him.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court of appeals was authorized to enter this judgment. <em>Superior Metal Products, Inc. v. Ohio Bur. of Emp. Serv. </em>(1975), 41 Ohio St.2d 143, 145, 70 O.O.2d 263, 264, 324 N.E.2d 179, 181; <em>State v. Kline </em>(1983), 11 Ohio App.3d 208, 11 OBR 330, 464 N.E.2d 159; App.R. 12(B); R.C. 2953.07. An entry in the common pleas court vacating the judgment and ordering Cotton\u2019s discharge is unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-11\">Based on the foregoing, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-12\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b234-13\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.

The \u201cJournal Entry and Opinion\u201d in <em>Cotton </em>refers to the court of appeals\u2019 judgment as \u201cJUDGMENT VACATED AND DEFENDANT DISCHARGED\u201d and further states that \u201c[t]his cause is vacated, the defendant discharged and the matter remanded to the lower court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
