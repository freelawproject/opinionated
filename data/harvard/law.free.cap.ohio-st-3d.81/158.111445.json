(2) Was Garrett required to prove that the aggravation of his arthritic condition caused his disability and need for medical benefits? (3) Did the commission\u2019s confirmation of the DHO\u2019s May 17, 1988 finding that Garrett\u2019s condition was permanent preclude the commission\u2019s continuation of TTD? (4) Did the commission sufficiently explain its reasoning? and (5) Assuming reversal of the writ vacating Garrett\u2019s award, is Chrysler entitled to reimbursement from the Surplus Fund under former R.C. 4123.515 due to the commission\u2019s failure to appeal? For the reasons that follow, we hold that (1) Dr. Kalb\u2019s reports are some evidence to support the commission\u2019s decision; (2) Garrett was required to and did provide evidence to establish a causal connection between his injury and disability; (3) the commission complied with <em>State ex rel. Eaton Corp. v. Lancaster </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 404, 534 N.E.2d 46, such that the commission\u2019s permanency determination did not preclude subsequent TTD; (4) the commission\u2019s explanation was adequate under <em>State ex rel. Mitchell v. Robbins &amp; Myers, Inc. </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 481, 6 OBR 531, 453 N.E.2d 721; and (5) Chrysler is not entitled to reimbursement from the Surplus Fund. Accordingly, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">\n<em>Some Evidence and Causation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">To receive workers\u2019 compensation for conditions developing after an industrial injury, the claimant must show \u201cnot only that his injury arose out of and in the course of his employment, but that a direct and proximate causal relationship existed between his accidental injury and his harm or disability.\u201d <em>Fox v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1955), 162 Ohio St. 569, 576, 55 O.O. 472, 475, 125 N.E.2d 1, 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">The commission relied on the reports of Dr. Kalb and Drs. Purewal and Rosenblatt, both commission specialists, to grant Garrett TTD and authorize surgery. Neither the Purewal nor Rosenblatt reports, however, recognized the aggravation of Garrett\u2019s arthritic condition as allowed by the commission. Thus, the court of appeals correctly concluded that neither report is evidence tying Garrett\u2019s injury to his arthritic disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">In April 1988, Dr. Kalb reported:</p>\n<p id=\"b289-9\">\u201cIn summary, it is my opinion [Garrett\u2019s] pre-existing patellofemoral arthritis condition was aggravated by his work-related injury * * *. It is also my opinion at the present time that he has reached maximum medical improvement unless further treatment is carried out. This treatment would consist of patellectomy or knee arthroplasty and would be expected to improve his condition and function <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>and possibly allow return to work. His work restrictions after such a procedure, however[,] would involve limitations to avoid frequent knee flexion beyond 90 degrees. This would include restrictions on frequent squatting, stair climbing and ladder climbing activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">\u201cWith his age, muscle strength, and weight, knee arthroplasty would be expected to provide a more favorable lasting result than patellectomy. In direct answer to your question regarding his initial complaints, his symptoms were present on both sides subsequent to his injury. His impairment would be based upon his limitation of knee ROM according to the AMA guidelines for impairment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">In January 1991, Dr. Kalb recommended replacement of Garrett\u2019s knee and offered this report, apparently to redress inconsistency in two depositions he had provided in February 1990 for the common pleas court proceedings:</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">\u201cAs I mentioned in my deposition, it is unusual that an injury such as that sustained by Mr. Garrett would be expected to produce abrupt, continuous and progressive symptoms of pain within the knee. My opinion regarding the accident resulting in substantial aggravation to his knee condition is based as I mentioned on Mr. Garrett\u2019s history of not having had any problems with his knees of any sort, nor any requirement for medical treatment for his knees prior to the accident * * *. <em>a </em>* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">\u201cIn summary, as I mentioned in my deposition, one would not expect an injury from the side to aggravate or contribute to his patellofemoral arthritic knee condition. However, one must not ignore the patient\u2019s history of having no pain prior to the accident with his knees and having had no medical treatment prior to the accident with his knees. Based upon his history * * * of having [the] onset of symptoms which have become progressive subsequent to the accident[,] [it] is logical to conclude that for whatever reason, his pain did develop immediately subsequent to the accident and therefore it is logical to conclude that the accident certainly played a role in his symptoms even though his radiographic and arthroscopic findings would not likely be expected to be substantially different than prior to the accident. With osteoarthritis or chondromalacia patella, patients are known in many cases to have rather sudden onset of pain which is continuous following a relatively minor traumatic event. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b290-9\">\u201cIn review of prior radiographs on patients such as this, it is clear that the degenerative process had been going on for some time prior to their becoming symptomatic. It is believed that these conditions may become rather abruptly painful following minor trauma or in some cases no trauma, due to the final thin layer of articulate cartilage being finally worn off exposing direct contact with the bone beneath.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>Dr. Kalb\u2019s reports represent that Garrett\u2019s injury provoked his arthritic disability; however, Chrysler complains that Dr. Kalb testified differently during his two depositions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> According to Chrysler and the court of appeals, Dr. Kalb\u2019s deposition testimony conceded his uncertainty about the cause of Garrett\u2019s disability, making his opinion too equivocal to constitute some evidence for the commission\u2019s decision under <em>State ex rel. Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 263, 265, 638 N.E.2d 565, 567 (commission cannot rely on a repudiated medical opinion or one that is \u201cmerely equivocal\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">Chrysler relies on this cross-examination from Dr. Kalb\u2019s first deposition:</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">\u201cQ. Let me ask you to assume just hypothetically that the events of December 21st, 1985 did aggravate a pre-exsting osteoarthritic condition in Mr. Garrett\u2019s knees. Is there any way you can say to a reasonable degree of medical probability that Mr. Garrett\u2019s knees would not be in the same condition that they are in today, even if the events of December 21st, hadn\u2019t happened? In other words, can you say that he would not have gotten to the point that he is today even if the events of December 21st, 1985 hadn\u2019t happened?</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">\u201cA. No, I cannot say that.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-9\">\u201cQ. And based on the pre-existing congential problems which were significant in Mr. Garrett\u2019s knees, it would not be unfair to assume that he would be in the same condition today that he\u2019s in even if the events of December 21st hadn\u2019t happened?</p>\n<p id=\"b291-10\">\u201cA. That is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-11\">U \u2021</p>\n<p id=\"b291-12\">\u201cQ. So what we\u2019ve got is somebody whose having degenerative problems in his knees and from a medical standpoint there\u2019s no way that you can say that his condition is any worse today than it would otherwise have been even if what happened on December 21st hadn\u2019t happened.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-13\">\u201cA. That is correct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b291-14\">Chrysler also relies on this cross-examination from Dr. Kalb\u2019s deposition taken two weeks later:</p>\n<p id=\"b291-15\">\u201cQ. So you would agree, would you not, that based on the conditions that existed in Mr. Garrett\u2019s knees prior to the events of December 21st, 1985 you would have expected to see just over the normal course of time of degeneration an increase in symptoms and discomfort in his knees?</p>\n<p id=\"b291-16\">\u201cA. That is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>\u201cQ. There is no way that you can say today, Doctor, that Mr. Garrett\u2019s condition is any worse than it would have been even if the accident hadn\u2019t happened?</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">\u201cA. That is correct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">In response, Garrett insists that Dr. Kalb rehabilitated his testimony during the second deposition and with his January 1991 medical report. Garrett maintains that (1) Dr. Kalb repeatedly attributed Garrett\u2019s disability entirely to the injury-induced aggravation of his arthritis because Garrett had not experienced subjective symptoms of the condition before the accident, and (2) Dr. Kalb\u2019s inconsistency as to the cause of Garrett\u2019s problems was a mistake he later clarified and corrected. Clarification and correction, Garrett argues, resolves equivocation and sustains the evidentiary value of expert opinion. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">The rule that an equivocal medical opinion is \u201cnot evidence\u201d on which the commission can rely emerged from <em>State ex rel. Jennings v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1982), 1 Ohio St.3d 101, 1 OBR 135, 438 N.E.2d 420; <em>State ex rel. Paragon v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 72, 5 OBR 127, 448 N.E.2d 1372; and <em>State ex rel. Walters v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1985), 20 Ohio St.3d 71, 20 OBR 402, 486 N.E.2d 94. After reviewing this precedent, <em>State ex rel. Eberhardt v. Flxible Corp. </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 649, 657, 640 N.E.2d 815, 821-822, explained what constitutes equivocation by a medical expert:</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">\u201c[EJquivocation occurs when a doctor repudiates an earlier opinion, renders contradictory or uncertain opinions, or fails to clarify an ambiguous statement. Ambiguous statements, however, are considered equivocal only while they are unclarified. <em>Paragon, supra. </em>Thus, once clarified, such statements fall outside the boundaries of <em>Jennings, supra, </em>and its progeny.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-9\">\u201cMoreover, ambiguous statements are inherently different from those that are repudiated, contradictory or uncertain. Repudiated, contradictory or uncertain statements reveal that the doctor is not sure what he means and, therefore, they are inherently unreliable. Such statements relate to the doctor\u2019s position on a critical issue. Ambiguous statements, however, merely reveal that the doctor did not effectively convey what he meant and, therefore, they are not inherently unreliable. Such statements do not relate to the doctor\u2019s position, but to his communication skills. If we were to hold that clarified statements, because previously ambiguous, are subject to <em>Jennings </em>or to commission rejection, we would effectively allow the commission to put words into a doctor\u2019s mouth or, worse, discount a truly probative opinion. Under such a view, any doctor\u2019s opinion could be disregarded merely because he failed on a single occasion to employ precise terminology. In a word, once an ambiguity, always an ambiguity. This court cannot countenance such an exclusion of probative evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>Here, Dr. Kalb offered two different conclusions as to the cause of Garrett\u2019s arthritis; however, the contradiction apparently resulted because of mistake, not uncertainty. His cross-examination testimony was based on the assumption that Garrett had experienced pain and swelling even before his knee injury, which Dr. Kalb later realized was incorrect. On redirect, Dr. Kalb confessed that he had misunderstood his own operative notes and had drawn a conclusion contrary to Garrett\u2019s documented prior medical history. When asked to explain the contradiction, he said:</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">\u201cInitially when giving the deposition and answering [Chrysler\u2019s counsel\u2019s] questions previously and reviewing this operative note on 3-14-86 I read the sentence: this disorder was made worse by injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">\u201cAnd I assumed that this disorder meant [Garrett\u2019s] complaints related to his problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">\u201cAnd from that single sentence I was assuming that he had related a history of some prior problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">\u201cIn review of the physical examination and history from that date which was dictated at that time and in more detail, the history and physical examination, that indicates that that is not the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-9\">\u201cIn review of my entire record I have no documentation of [Garrett\u2019s] ever having had a problem or complaining of a problem prior to his injury as noted.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-10\">\u201cAnd so that was inconsistent.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-11\">\u201cEither that was an inaccuracy on my part; or by his disorder I meant his congenital disorder, namely chondromalacia patella.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-12\">\u201cSo either of those two are possibilities; either my * * * disorder sentence of 3-14-86 was not accurate; or more likely, I was referring to this disorder being the congenital problem with his patellofemoral malalignment because that directly conflicts with the dictated history and physical in terms of his having or not having had prior symptoms with his knees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b293-13\">And, on further redirect, the following exchange took place:</p>\n<p id=\"b293-14\">\u201cQ. Now that you [Dr. Kalb] have had an opportunity to look at the entire document and to clarify the history, does that change your answers to [Chrysler\u2019s counsel\u2019s] questions in reference to [Garrett\u2019s] pre-existing condition?</p>\n<p id=\"b293-15\"><em>a </em>* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b293-16\">\u201cA. Yes; that is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-17\">\u201cQ. And in reference to this document, which history is the reliable history?</p>\n<p id=\"b293-18\">\u201cA. The history and physical examinations intended to provide the history. The information dictated on * * * the operative note is designed to give the indications for the procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>\u201cQ. So they serve two separate purposes?</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">\u201cA. That is correct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">Whether we or the court of appeals is persuaded by this explanation is not at issue; ours are not the credibility determinations that count. The commission is the exclusive evaluator of the weight and credibility to be given medical reports of record, and reviewing courts cannot second-guess the commission\u2019s credibility determinations in mandamus. <em>State ex rel. Pass v. C.S.T. Extraction Co. </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 373, 376, 658 N.E.2d 1055, 1058; <em>State ex rel. Consolidation Coal Co. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 176, 177, 677 N.E.2d 338, 341. Thus, review extends only to whether some evidence exists for the commission\u2019s decision; after that, courts must defer to the commission\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">For these reasons, this court in <em>Eberhardt </em>defended the commission\u2019s reliance on ah ambiguous medical conclusion that was ultimately clarified by the doctor. There we concluded that this was a credibility determination for the commission to make. The same rule must apply when a physician offers contradictory conclusions by mistake, but later acknowledges the contradiction and resolves it to the commission\u2019s satisfaction. In both cases, any uncertainty is destroyed and the reliability of the physician\u2019s statement is rejuvenated.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">Accordingly, we hold that where, as here, an inconsistent or contradictory medical conclusion can be attributed to mistake, as compared to lack of knowledge, and testimony or other medical evidence exists from which the commission could conclude that the mistake was resolved, the commission is able to rely on that evidence in granting or denying compensation or benefits. See, <em>e.g., State ex rel. Owens-Corning, supra, </em>70 Ohio St.3d at 266, 638 N.E.2d at 567 (Douglas, J., dissenting) (where some evidence exists for the commission\u2019s decision, it must not be disturbed in mandamus, notwithstanding \u201c[a]rtful cross-examination\u201d). The court of appeals erred, therefore, in rejecting Dr. Kalb\u2019s testimony as too equivocal.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-9\">We also reject Chrysler\u2019s argument that the commission had no evidence upon which to attribute Garrett\u2019s disability completely to the injury-induced aggravation of his arthritic condition. This argument is again based on the theory that Dr. Kalb\u2019s opinion is unreliable, although Chrysler frames it as an attack on a practice purportedly used by the commission \u2014 to attribute disability caused by a nonallowed pre-existing condition to the allowed aggravation of that condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-10\">The commission cannot compensate claimants unless their disability results <em>exclusively </em>from an allowed condition. <em>State ex rel. Wean United, Inc. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 272, 274, 611 N.E.2d 828, 829. Here, Dr. Kalb\u2019s reports and testimony satisfy this standard because he attributed Garrett\u2019s disability entirely to the aggravation of his arthritis, not to the pre-existing condition. Dr. Kalb concluded that while Garrett probably had arthritic changes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>prior to his injury that were detectable by radiological and arthroscopic tests, he had not experienced symptoms that had prevented him from working at Chrysler before his injury, which is the test for temporary total disability. <em>State ex rel. Bowie v. Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Auth. </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 458, 461, 663 N.E.2d 926, 929. Thus, contrary to Chrysler\u2019s argument, evidence exists from which the commission could find that Garrett had no pre-existing disability attributable to his pre-existing condition. As <em>State ex rel. Kettering Med. Ctr. v. Wallace </em>(1994), 68 Ohio St.3d 588, 589, 629 N.E.2d 444, 446, explained:</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">\u201c[The employer\u2019s] argument erroneously assumes that evidence of a preexisting <em>condition </em>is <em>prima facie </em>evidence of a pre-existing <em>disability </em>as well. [The employer], however, ignores that claimant worked without any apparent problems prior to her industrial accident. Because her [pre-existing] psychological condition did not affect her ability to work before the accident, [the employer] cannot persuasively argue that the claimant had a pre-existing emotional <em>disability. </em>See <em>Marshall v. Ouachita Hosp. </em>(1980), 269 Ark. 958, 961, 601 S.W.2d 901, 902. (Appellate court upheld claimant\u2019s contention that although he was a polio victim, he had no pre-existing disability in the workers\u2019 compensation sense, since he had been able to work as a lab technician and perform all required tasks for twenty-two years prior to his work-related accident.)\u201d (Emphasis <em>sic.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">Accordingly, we reverse the court of appeals\u2019 finding that the commission abused its discretion by awarding TTD and medical benefits without evidence tying Garrett\u2019s disability to his industrial injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">\n<em>Permanency and Subsequent TTD Award</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Aze\">As an alternative basis for affirming the court of appeals\u2019 judgment, see <em>Morgan v. Cincinnati </em>(1986), 25 Ohio St.3d 285, 289-290, 25 OBR 337, 340-341, 496 N.E.2d 468, 472 (where necessary to preserve lower court judgment, R.C. 2505.22 allows appellee to assert assignments of error without filing cross-appeal), Chrysler argues that the commission had no jurisdiction to award Garrett TTD after having found his condition permanent and, effectively, at maximum medical improvement, pursuant to the DHO order of May 17, 1988. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-9\">As mentioned, in <em>State ex rel. Eaton Corp. v. Lancaster, </em>40 Ohio St.3d at 407, 534 N.E.2d at 50, we invalidated the commission\u2019s policy, employed initially here when Garrett filed his PTD application, that permitted its hearing officers to continue PTD for \u201clengthy intervals\u201d between the decision to terminate TTD due to permanency and the decision to grant or deny PTD. But out of concern for claimants\u2019 welfare, we did not immediately terminate TTD for those claimants who were receiving it pursuant to the commission\u2019s defunct procedure. Rather, we directed the commission to implement a new process for assessing PTD eligibility, one that did not compromise the TTD requirement that a claimant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>condition remain temporary while this compensation is paid, and to do so \u201cwithin ninety days of [our] decision, or <em>as soon thereafter as is practicable.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>Id. </em>at 408, 534 N.E.2d at 51. Thus, in that case and others, see, <em>e.g., State ex rel. Peabody Coal Co. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1989), 41 Ohio St.3d 5, 534 N.E.2d 347, reconsidered and modified on other grounds (1989), 44 Ohio St.3d 104, 541 N.E.2d 74, we returned causes for the commission to rectify its having continued TTD despite a prior determination of permanency.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">In Garrett\u2019s case, Chrysler appealed the allowance of his aggravated arthritic condition to common pleas court pursuant to former R.C. 4123.519 shortly after we decided <em>Eaton. </em>As this appeal removed the claim from the commission\u2019s jurisdiction, <em>State ex rel. Gatlin v. Yellow Freight Sys., Inc. </em>(1985), 18 Ohio St.3d 246, 249, 18 OBR 302, 305, 480 N.E.2d 487, 490, the commission had little if any meaningful opportunity to comply with our decision. Only after the court of appeals reinstated the commission\u2019s order and invoked the commission\u2019s duty to conduct further consistent proceedings, see former R.C. 4123.519(F) (now R.C. 4123.512[G]) (commission and bureau of workers\u2019 compensation administrator must execute final court judgment as if it were the commission\u2019s decision), did the commission have the power and practicable ability to correct the problem <em>Eaton </em>identified. And the commission made the appropriate correction when it regained jurisdiction \u2014 the commission assigned Garrett\u2019s PTD claim to its <em>\u201cEaton </em>docket,\u201d a procedure that sanctioned expedited review of PTD applications in conjunction with motions to terminate TTD. Cf. <em>State ex rel. Ford Motor Co. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 17, 599 N.E.2d 261 (TTD award after permanency determination invalidated under <em>Eaton </em>because commission had continuous jurisdiction over claim and did not expeditiously comply). We have since endorsed this procedure, <em>State ex rel. Blake v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 453, 455, 605 N.E.2d 23, 25; <em>State ex rel. Kinnear Div., Harsco Corp. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1997), 77 Ohio St.3d 258, 265-266, 673 N.E.2d 1290, 1296, and Chrysler offers neither evidence nor argument to establish that the commission failed to act \u201cas soon as practicable\u201d in making this assignment. Thus, under these circumstances, we consider the commission\u2019s response time to our admonition in <em>Eaton </em>to comply with that decision. Accordingly, we reject Chrysler\u2019s argument that the commission\u2019s prior determination of permanency precluded its further award of TTD to this claimant.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">For those claimants who were receiving TTD benefits despite a finding of permanence at the time <em>Eaton </em>was decided, we directed the commission \u201cas soon thereafter as is practicable, to hold hearings to determine the eligibility of these claimants for <em>total </em>disability benefits.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Eaton, </em>40 Ohio St.3d at 408, 534 N.E.2d at 51. We did not limit the issue at such hearings to a determination of permanent total disability. Instead, it was contemplated that the commission would, at these hearings, determine both the claimant\u2019s continued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>eligibility for TTD and eligibility for PTD. Otherwise, there would have been no need for the court in <em>Eaton </em>to consider, as it did, whether \u201c[i]n each case, the relied-on medical evidence uniformly indicated a permanent condition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 411, 534 N.E.2d at 53. Thus, under the prese\u00f1t circumstances, there was no need for the commission to premise its continuing TTD on new and changed circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\"><em>Eaton </em>notwithstanding, the claimant\u2019s need for surgery, under the facts of this case, constitutes a new and changed circumstance. It is true, as pointed out in the concurring and dissenting opinion, that Dr. Kalb predicted in 1988 that Garrett would benefit from patellectomy, or knee replacement. However, no request for authorization was made at that time, and this issue was neither presented nor decided at the 1988 hearing. It was not until after the 1988 administrative proceedings that Dr. Kalb, in a report dated September 11, 1989, devised a plan for claimant to \u201capply for Worker\u2019s Compensation [sic ] approval for bilateral knee replacement arthroplasty,\u201d noting \u201cprogressive pain in both knees\u201d and that such \u201cknee pain has become intolerable now bilaterally.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">Thus, at the time claimant\u2019s condition was found permanent in 1988, the issue whether claimant would need surgery, and whether such surgery would improve claimant\u2019s condition, was not litigated and, under these facts, could not have been litigated. When the advent of further surgery arose after 1988, there was a new and changed circumstance which justified modification pursuant to R.C. 4123.52. See <em>Stainless Specialty Mfg. Co. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1985), 144 Ariz. 12, 695 P.2d 261.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">\n<em>Adequate Explanation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">Also to preserve the judgment below, Chrysler proposes that the commission failed to sufficiently explain its TTD award as required by <em>State ex rel. Mitchell v. Robbins &amp; Myers, </em>6 Ohio St.3d at 483-484, 6 OBR at 534, 453 N.E.2d at 724 (commission must state evidence and give brief explanation for decision to grant or deny TTD). But rather than attack the commission\u2019s cursory explanation, Chrysler uses the opportunity to resurrect its \u201cno-evidence-of-causation\u201d argument. We reject this argument for the reasons already discussed. We further conclude that while the instant commission order is less than comprehensive, it is at least as informative as the order in <em>Mitchell, </em>which was vacated due to lack of evidence, not for inadequate explanation. <em>Id. </em>at 484, 6 OBR at 534, 453 N.E.2d at 724. Accordingly, we cannot grant Chrysler any relief on this basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">\n<em>Reimbursement</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b297-9\">Chrysler also insists that if we reverse in Garrett\u2019s favor, it is still entitled to reimbursement from the Surplus Fund because the commission failed to appeal. Again, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>The source of Chrysler\u2019s asserted right to reimbursement is former R.C. 4123.515,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which provided, in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">\u201c[I]f the decision of the district hearing officer is appealed by the employer or the administrator, the bureau shall withhold compensation and benefits during the course of the appeal to the regional board of review, but where the regional board rules in favor of the claimant, compensation and benefits shall be paid by the bureau or by the self-insuring employer whether or not further appeal is taken. <em>If the claim is subsequently denied, </em>payments shall be charged to the surplus fund created under division (B) of section 4123.34 of the Revised Code, and if the employer is a state risk such amount shall not be charged to the employer\u2019s experience and if the employer is a self-insurer such amount shall be paid to the self-insurer from said surplus fund.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 137 Ohio Laws, Part II, 3934, 3939.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">This statute allowed reimbursement only if compensation had been <em>denied </em>on appeal from the regional board of review. Accord <em>State ex rel. Peabody Coal Co. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1989), 44 Ohio St.3d 104, 105, 541 N.E.2d 74, 75; <em>State ex rel. Eaton v. Lancaster </em>(1989), 44 Ohio St.3d 106, 541 N.E.2d 64; and <em>Eaton, </em>40 Ohio St.3d at 416, 534 N.E.2d at 58 (Douglas, J., dissenting). Garrett was not denied compensation at subsequent levels of commission or judicial review; the TTD and medical benefit awards were left undisturbed. As former R.C. 4123.515 confers no right to reimbursement where the claimant prevails, Chrysler is not entitled to reimbursement under these facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">Having found that some evidence exists for the commission\u2019s decision and that none of Chrysler\u2019s other arguments justifies the court of appeals\u2019 judgment in Chrysler\u2019s favor, we reverse the order granting a writ of mandamus and reinstate the commission\u2019s award to Garrett of TTD and medical benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b298-9\">Douglas, F.E.

R.C. 4123.515 was repealed effective October 20, 1993. On that same date, R.C. 4123.519 was amended and renumbered R.C. 4123.512, which provides that, \u201cAny action pending in common pleas court or any other court \u00f3n January 1, 1986, under this section is governed by former sections * * * 4123.515 * * * and 4123.519 * <em>* </em>* of the Revised Code.\u201d The present action was not pending in any court on January 1, 1986. Chrysler contends that any attempt to apply this legislation retroactively to preclude reimbursement would be unconstitutional. Because we find that former R.C. 4123.515 confers no right to reimbursement where the claimant ultimately prevails on the issue of entitlement to TTD, there is no need to address the retroactive application of R.C. 4123.512.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b299-4\">Lundberg Stratton, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ACr\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">I concur with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the claimant may be awarded temporary total disability compensation (\u201cTTD\u201d) pending the determination of claimant\u2019s eligibility for an award of permanent total disability compensation (\u201cPTD\u201d). However, I dissent from the majority\u2019s decision that Chrysler is not entitled to be reimbursed for the amount of TTD it paid to the claimant after it was determined that his condition was permanent.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">I do not necessarily disagree that the <em>Eaton </em>rationale might justify continuing TTD, pending the hearing to determine PTD.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> However, the majority agrees with the claimant\u2019s contention that his condition is not permanent and therefore TTD should be reestablished. I disagree. The commission cannot exercise continuing jurisdiction unless new and changed circumstances have developed since the initial order. <em>State ex rel. Bowman v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 317, 319, 603 N.E.2d 1000, 1002. Further, a claimant is not entitled to TTD when the commission has determined that the claimant\u2019s condition has become permanent. <em>State ex rel. Jeep Corp. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1991), 62 Ohio St.3d 64, 577 N.E.2d 1095.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">In the case at bar, on May 17, 1988, a DHO recognized that the claimant\u2019s condition of \u201caggravation of pre-existing bilateral pat[]ellofemoral arthritis\u201d had become permanent. Chrysler challenged the allowance of benefits to the claimant in common pleas court. The jury found that the claimant could not participate in the State Insurance Fund for the aggravated arthritic condition. Chrysler stopped paying TTD in 1990. However, the court of appeals reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">Pursuant to the court of appeals\u2019 judgment, the commission formally recognized the claimant\u2019s claim for \u201caggravation of a pre-existing bilateral pat[]ellofemoral arthritis.\u201d At a rehearing, a DHO ordered Chrysler to make up the TTD <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>payments 'stopped after the common pleas court ruling and to continue TTD based on submission of medical evidence. The DHO also determined that the claimant\u2019s disability, \u201cbased upon all the allowed conditions had not yet reached maximum medical recovery,\u201d and therefore authorized surgery to replace the claimant\u2019s right knee. Thus, this issue was fully litigated.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">The court of appeals\u2019 decision merely affirmed the commission\u2019s allowance of the claimant\u2019s arthritic condition and that this condition was permanent. Since the determination by the commission that the claimant\u2019s condition had become permanent, there has been no circumstance indicating a change in his condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">The claimant claims that he had again become temporarily totally disabled after Chrysler cut off his TTD in August 1990. The claimant cites the syllabus of <em>State ex rel. Bing v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 424, 575 N.E.2d 177, which states:</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">\u201cEven where temporary total disability compensation payments have been previously terminated, R.C. 4123.52 grants the Industrial Commission continuing jurisdiction to award temporary total disability compensation where the claimant has again become temporarily totally disabled.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">The claimant relies upon Dr. Kalb\u2019s reports concerning the continued deterioration of his condition and need for surgery, arguing that these are the type of circumstances that justify the commission\u2019s reassessment of his TTD eligibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">However, an examination of Dr. Kalb\u2019s 1991 report reveals that his opinion is neither new nor significantly different. Dr. Kalb had predicted that the claimant would benefit from patellectomy, or knee replacement, back in 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-9\">Further, the claimant did not suffer a temporary decline in his condition that again prevented him from returning to work. Rather, his condition declined steadily, and he never returned to work after the industrial injury. The claimant\u2019s consistent inability to work distinguishes this case from permitted exercise of the commission\u2019s continuing jurisdiction to revisit and award TTD where the claimants were unable to work on two separate occasions, the second due to a \u201cflare-up\u201d or relapse in a single maximum medically improved condition. See <em>Bing, </em>61 Ohio St.3d at 427, 575 N.E.2d at 180; <em>State ex rel. Navistar Internatl. Transp. Corp. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 267, 611 N.E.2d 824. Simply because a predicted condition or surgery results, the commission should not be required to reopen every permanency case to restore TTD.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-10\">When the commission has determined that a claimant\u2019s condition is permanent, the claimant is not eligible for TTD. <em>State ex rel. Ramirez v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St.2d 630, 23 O.O.3d 518, 433 N.E.2d 586. Without new and changed circumstances, fraud, clerical error, or unauthorized action by an inferior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>administrative tribunal, the commission cannot revisit and revise a prior denial of TTD due to permanency. <em>Bowman, </em>65 Ohio St.3d at 319, 603 N.E.2d at 1002.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">For the aforementioned reasons, the commission had no jurisdiction to award the claimant TTD after it left the DHO\u2019s 1988 finding of permanency undisturbed. Accordingly, although I would allow TTD to continue under the <em>Eaton </em>doctrine pending the final hearing on PTD, I would affirm the portion of the court of appeals\u2019 decision that held that the commission\u2019s May 17,1988 permanency determination precluded <em>restoration </em>of TTD.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">Because I would find that the commission had no jurisdiction to <em>restore </em>an award of TTD to the claimant after his condition was determined to be permanent, Chrysler should not be responsible for the payment of TTD after permanency was determined. As Justice Douglas pointed out in his concurrence in <em>Eaton, </em>40 Ohio St.3d at 416-417, 534 N.E.2d at 57-58, an employer should be entitled to reimbursement for TTD funds erroneously paid under an invalidated procedure for continuing to award TTD.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">Accordingly, I would find (1) that the claimant\u2019s condition had not changed since the May 17, 1988 finding of permanency, (2) that once the claimant\u2019s condition was determined to be permanent, the commission had no jurisdiction to restore TTD, and (3) notwithstanding the commission\u2019s lack of jurisdiction to restore TTD, the commission is authorized to' temporarily continue TTD under the <em>Eaton </em>rationale until a hearing on PTD can be held. I would also find that since the commission had no jurisdiction to restore TTD to the claimant, Chrysler should be reimbursed from the Surplus Fund for the TTD payments made to the claimant after May 17,1988.</p>\n<judges id=\"b301-8\">For these reasons, I respectfully concur in part and dissent in part.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b301-9\">Moyer, C.J., and Cook, J., concur in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b299-9\">. In <em>State ex rel. Eaton Corp. v. Lancaster </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 404, 534 N.E.2d 46, this court invalidated a policy instituted by the commission where it continued to award TTD to a claimant whose condition had been determined to be permanent while the claimant was waiting for a hearing to award PTD. (The commission has no jurisdiction to award TTD when the claimant\u2019s condition has been determined to be permanent.) However, in an attempt to prevent this \u201cgap\u201d in coverage of the benefits; the court essentially ordered the commission to create a procedure whereby the determination of permanency and the award of PTD occur simultaneously or as close together as practically possible.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-10\">In this case, the majority has cited <em>Eaton </em>to justify the commission\u2019s continued payment of TTD to the claimant pending his hearing for PTD.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
