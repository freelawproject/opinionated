We hold that the Cubby employees were fixed-situs employees within the meaning of the coming-and-going rule, but nevertheless demonstrated that their injuries occurred in the course of and arose out of their employment, so as to permit their participation in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">The coming-and-going rule is a tool used to determine whether an injury suffered by an employee in a traffic accident occurs \u201cin the course of\u2019 and \u201carise[s] out of\u2019 the employment relationship so as to constitute a compensable injury under R.C. 4123.01(C). \u201cAs a general rule, an employee with a fixed place of employment, who is injured while traveling to or from his place of employment, is not entitled to participate in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Fund because the requisite causal connection between injury and the employment does not exist.\u201d <em>MTD Products, Inc. v. Robatin </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 66, 68, 572 N.E .2d 661, 663, citing <em>Bralley v. Daugherty </em>(1980), 61 Ohio St.2d 302, 15 O.O.3d 359, 401 N.E .2d 448. The rationale supporting the coming-and-going rule is that \u201c[t]he constitution and the statute, providing for compensation from a fund created by assessments upon the industry itself, contemplate only those hazards to be encountered by the employe[e] in the discharge of the duties of his employment, and do not embrace risks and hazards, such as those of travel to and from his place of actual employment over streets and highways, which are similarly encountered by the public generally.\u201d <em>Indus. Comm. v. Baker </em>(1933), 127 Ohio St. 345, 188 N.E. 560, paragraph four of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">In determining whether an employee is a fixed-situs employee and therefore within the coming-and-going rule, the focus is on whether the employee commences his substantial employment duties only after arriving at a specific and identifiable work place designated by his employer. <em>Indus. Comm. v. Heil </em>(1931), 123 Ohio St. 604, 606-607, 176 N.E. 458, 459; 1 Larson\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Law (1997) 4-194 to 4-200. Accordingly, this court has denied compensation for injuries sustained in the commute to work of a teacher who prepared lesson plans at her home <em>(Indus. Comm. v. Gintert </em>[1934], 128 Ohio St. 129, 190 N.E. 400), a police officer who, by rule, was required to serve in his official capacity whenever needed but typically started work only after checking in at a station house <em>(Simerlink v. Young </em>[1961], 172 Ohio St. 427, 17 O.O.2d 376, 178 N.E.2d 168), a products-control manager who occasionally took work home and remained on call twenty-four hours a day <em>(Lohnes v. Young </em>[1963], 175 Ohio <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>St. 291, 25 O.O.2d 136, 194 N.E.2d 428), and a slaughterhouse superintendent whose employer provided compensation for travel from his home to the plant. <em>(Heil, supra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">The focus remains the same even though the employee may be reassigned to a different work place monthly, weekly, or even daily. Despite periodic relocation of job sites, each particular job site may constitute a fixed place of employment. See <em>Demko v. Admr. of Workers\u2019 Comp. </em>(Oct. 7, 1994), Portage App. No. 93-P-0067, unreported, at 4, 1994 WL 587963; <em>Hawkins v. Connor </em>(Aug. 12, 1983), Mercer App. No. 10-82-11, unreported, at 10, 1983 WL 7317.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">The evidence demonstrates that the riggers here had no duties to perform away from the drilling sites to which they were assigned. The riggers\u2019 workday began and ended at the drilling sites. Accordingly, although work at each drilling site had limited duration, it was a fixed work site within the meaning of the coming-and-going rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">Classification of the riggers as fixed-situs employees, however,' does not end our inquiry. While the coming-and-going rule works well in most of its applications, a claimant may avoid its force in the rare circumstance where he can, nevertheless, demonstrate that he received an injury in the course of and arising out of his employment. See <em>MTD Products, supra, </em>61 Ohio St.3d 66, 572 N.E.2d 661.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">IN THE COURSE OF EMPLOYMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b248-9\">As this court stated in <em>Fisher v. Mayfield </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 275, 277, 551 N.E.2d 1271, 1274, the statutory requirement that an injury be in the course of employment involves the time, place, and circumstances of the injury. Time, place, and circumstance, however, are factors used to determine whether the required nexus exists between the employment relationship and the injurious activity; they are not, in themselves, the ultimate object of a course-of-employment inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-10\">The phrase \u201cin the course of employment\u201d limits compensable injuries to those sustained by an employee while performing a required duty in the employer\u2019s service. <em>Indus. Comm. v. Gintert </em>(1934), 128 Ohio St. 129, 133-134, 190 N.E. 400, 403. \u201cTo be entitled to workmen\u2019s compensation, a workman need not necessarily be injured in the actual performance of work for his employer.\u201d <em>Sebek v. Cleveland Graphite Bronze Co. </em>(1947), 148 Ohio St. 693, 36 O.O. 282, 76 N.E.2d 892, paragraph three of the syllabus. An injury is compensable if it is sustained by an employee while that employee engages in activity that is consistent with the contract for hire and logically related to the employer\u2019s business. <em>Kohlmayer v. Keller </em>(1970), 24 Ohio St.2d 10, 12, 53 O.O.2d 6, 7, 263 N.E.2d 231, 233. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>In the normal context, an employee\u2019s commute to a fixed work site bears no meaningful relation to his employment contract and serves no purpose of the employer\u2019s business. That is not the case, however, where, as here, the employee travels to the premises of one of his employer\u2019s customers to satisfy a business obligation. Under the standard announced by this court in <em>Indus. Comm. v. Bateman </em>(1933), 126 Ohio St. 279, 185 N.E. 50, the riggers here have established the required relationship between employment and injury to satisfy the course-of-employment requirement:</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">\u201cIn order to avail himself of the provisions of our compensation law, the injuries sustained by the employe[e], must have been \u2018occasioned in the course of his employment. * * * [I]f the injuries are sustained [off premises], the employe[e], acting within the scope of his employment, must, at the time of his injury, have been engaged in the promotion of his employer\u2019s business and in the furtherance of his affairs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">The nature of the rigging business requires that drilling be done on a customer\u2019s premises. That is a necessary condition of the work contract. The riggers set up on a customer\u2019s premises, drill a well and, after completion, disassemble the derrick for transport to the next job site. Consequently, while coming to and going from a customer\u2019s premises, these employees are engaged in the promotion and furtherance of their employer\u2019s business as a condition of their employment. Accordingly, their travel is in the course of their employment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">ARISING OUT OF EMPLOYMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">Even though the \u25a0 riggers\u2019 travel meets the \u201cin the course of employment\u201d requirement under the foregoing analysis, it will fail the definition of injury under R.C. 4123.01(C) if it cannot be said to also arise out of the employment. Satisfaction of both statutory elements is a prerequisite to recovery from the fund. <em>Fisher, </em>49 Ohio St.3d at 277, 551 N.E.2d at 1274. \u201cThe \u2018arising out of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>element * * * contemplates a causal connection between the injury and the employment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 277-278, 551 N.E.2d at 1274.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">APPLICATION OF THE <em>LORD </em>TEST</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">In <em>Fisher, id. </em>at 277, 551 N.E.2d at 1274, this court reaffirmed use of the <em>Lord v. Daugherty </em>(1981), 66 Ohio St.2d 441, 20 O.O.3d 376, 423 N.E.2d 96, \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d test to determine whether there exists a sufficient causal connection between injury and employment to justify a claimant\u2019s participation in the fund. That test requires primary analysis of the following facts and circumstances: \u201c(1) the proximity of the scene of the accident to the place of employment, (2) the degree of control the employer had over the scene of the accident, and (3) the benefit the employer received from the injured employee\u2019s presence at the scene of the accident.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">Application of the <em>Lord </em>factors to the present facts does not support compensation. Each accident occurred some distance away from the assigned work site. Compare <em>Bralley v. Daugherty </em>(1980), 61 Ohio St.2d 302, 15 O.O.3d 359, 401 N.E.2d 448 (denying compensation where the accident occurred one-third of a mile from the employer\u2019s plant). The employer exercised no control over the public roadways upon which the accidents occurred. Compare <em>MTD Products, supra, </em>61 Ohio St.3d at 70, 572 N.E.2d at 665 (stating that the employer therein \u201cdid not have control over the scene of the accident: it controlled neither the public street on which the accident occurred nor the negligent driver who caused the accident\u201d). Finally, the riggers\u2019 presence <em>at the scene of the accident </em>served-little benefit to the employer. Simply put, at the time of the accidents, none of the riggers had yet arrived at a place where the work was to be performed. Although the riggers\u2019 travel was necessitated by the employer\u2019s business obligations, the accident did not occur at a location where the riggers could carry on their employer\u2019s business.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">ALTERNATE METHODS OF PROVING CAUSALITY</p>\n<p id=\"b250-9\">An employee\u2019s failure to satisfy the three enumerated factors of the <em>Lord </em>test, however, does not foreclose further consideration. When applying the <em>Lord </em>test the enumerated factors are not intended to be exhaustive and the totality-of-the-circumstances test may continue to evolve. <em>Fisher, supra, </em>49 Ohio St.3d at 279, 551 N.E.2d at 1275, fn. 2. \u201cFor example, the recreational activity cases have developed a unique group of tests, as well as the so-called \u2018coming and going\u2019 cases. * * * [WJorkers\u2019 compensation cases are, to a large extent, very fact specific. As such, no one test or analysis can be said to apply to each and every factual possibility.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 280, 551 N.E.2d at 1276.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>In <em>MTD Products, supra, </em>61 Ohio St.3d at 69-70, 572 N.E.2d at 664-665, another coming-and-going case, this court applied the <em>Lord </em>three-part test as but one of the possible tests for determining whether the employee demonstrated the required causal connection to satisfy the \u201carising out of\u2019 element of R.C. 4123.01(C). The court also considered whether the fixed-situs employee therein fell within the \u201czone of employment\u201d or the then newly recognized \u201cspecial hazard\u201d exception to the coming-and-going rule so as to satisfy R.C. 4123.01(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">THE SPECIAL HAZARD RULE</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">In denying recovery under the \u201cspecial hazard\u201d rule, the <em>MTD Products </em>court noted that the risk encountered by the employee therein \u2014 a left turn into the employer\u2019s premises across traffic on a congested city street \u2014 was a risk neither \u201c \u2018distinctive in nature [n]or quantitatively greater than the risk common to the public.\u2019\u201d <em>Id., </em>61 Ohio St.3d at 69, 572 N.E.2d at 664, quoting <em>Littlefield v. Pillsbury Co. </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 389, 6 OBR 439, 453 N.E.2d 570, syllabus. The court, however, preserved the special hazard rule set forth in <em>Littlefield </em>to the extent that it was not in conflict with that opinion. <em>Id. </em>at 67-68, 572 N.E.2d at 663.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">The <em>MTD Products </em>court applied the special hazard rule as a test of causality only. It did not specifically analyze whether the employee therein was sufficiently in the course of his employment so as to satisfy R.C. 4123.01(C). Because R.C. 4123.01(C) requires an employee to satisfy both its \u201cin the course of\u2019 and \u201carising out of\u2019 elements to participate in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Fund, the court\u2019s conclusion that the employee\u2019s injury did not \u201carise out of\u2019 the employment decided the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">Treatment of the special hazard rule as a test of causality is consistent with the stated purpose behind the coming-and-going rule that workers\u2019 compensation insurance does \u201cnot embrace risks and hazards, such as those of travel to and from his place of actual employment over streets and highways, which are similarly encountered by the public generally.\u201d <em>Baker, supra, </em>127 Ohio St. 345, 188 N.E. 560, paragraph four of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-9\">THE <em>LITTLEFIELD </em>SYLLABUS STATES A RULE OF CAUSATION ONLY</p>\n<p id=\"b251-10\">The special hazard rule set forth in the <em>Littlefield </em>syllabus accurately states a causal relation between employment and injury that is sufficient to escape the coming-and-going rule. That syllabus, however, does not address the degree to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>which the employee\u2019s activity when injured must relate to his employment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because statutory law requires an injury to be suffered in the course of employment <em>and </em>to arise out of the employment, the syllabus statement does not state all that is required to avoid the coming-and-going rule.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">Accordingly, we now expressly limit the syllabus of <em>Littlefield </em>to state a test for determining only whether a traffic injury suffered by a fixed-situs employee while coming to or going from work <em>arises out of </em>the employment relationship. If an employee\u2019s injury occurs in the course of his employment, yet fails the <em>Lord </em>three-part test for causation, a fixed-situs employee may, nevertheless, demonstrate the required causal connection between employment and injury under the special hazard rule of causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">APPLICATION OF THE SPECIAL HAZARD RULE</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">In this case, multiple factors work in combination to make travel to the temporary drilling sites a special hazard of employment. Two such factors are the temporary nature and constantly changing location of the riggers\u2019 fixed work sites. Cubby regularly dispatched its employees over a three-state area for work assignments typically lasting somewhere between three and ten days. Unlike the typical fixed-situs employee, the Cubby riggers did not know the location of future assignments, and it was impossible for them to fix their commute in relation to these remote work sites. Cubby\u2019s customers determined the drilling sites and Cubby dispatched its employees to these locations without regard to the distance the riggers would need to travel. While Cubby paid a bonus to its employees based on how far they worked away from the company\u2019s Midvale base, under normal circumstances that bonus was minimal and did not contemplate overnight expenses. Instead, Cubby expected its workers to commute back and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>forth to the job site on a daily basis or arrange and pay for their own overnight accommodations.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">A third factor pertinent here is the distance of the riggers\u2019 commutes to the remote work sites. As a condition of their employment, Cubby required the riggers to report to work sites separated by significant distances, both from each other and from the Midvale home base. Although the riggers worked within an area of a one-day drive, that area was not so limited \u00e1s to bring the riggers\u2019 travel to the varying work sites in line with work commutes common to the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">For most employees, commuting distance to a fixed work site is largely a personal choice. Any increased risk due a longer commute is due more to the employee\u2019s choice of where he or she wants to live than the employer\u2019s choice of where it wants to locate its business. Accordingly, it usually is not the employment relationship that exposes an employee to the greater risk associated with a long commute. Moreover, the risks associated with highway travel are not distinctive in nature from those faced by the public in general. Here, however, the employment relationship dictates that the riggers undertake interstate and lengthy intrastate commutes, thereby significantly increasing their exposure to traffic risks associated with highway travel. Accordingly, because of the combination of all these factors, the riggers have established a risk quantitatively greater than risks common to the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">R.C. 4123.452</p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">Finally, Cubby asserts that the employees\u2019 ineligibility to participate in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Fund is expressly established by R.C. 4123.452, which states:</p>\n<p id=\"b253-9\">\u201cAs used in this section, \u2018ridesharing arrangement\u2019 means the transportation of persons in a motor vehicle where such transportation is incidental to another purpose of a volunteer driver and includes ridesharing arrangements known as carpools, vanpools and buspools.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-10\">\u201cNo compensation shall be allowed under this chapter for any employee injured while participating in a ridesharing arrangement between his place of residence and place of employment or termini near such places. An injury occurring while an employee is voluntarily participating in a ridesharing arrangement is not considered in the course of employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b253-11\">Cubby would have us interpret this section as a rule of exclusion \u2014 that even if we normally would consider the travel resulting in an employee\u2019s injury to fall within the course of employment, the employee\u2019s participation in a voluntary ridesharing arrangement forecloses recovery of workers\u2019 compensation benefits. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>In interpreting statutes, however, we are to presume that a just and reasonable result is intended. R.C. 1.47; see, also, <em>State ex rel. Dispatch Printing Co. v. Wells </em>(1985), 18 Ohio St.3d 382, 384, 18 OBR 437, 439, 481 N.E.2d 632, 634 (noting the axiom of judicial interpretation that \u201cstatutes be construed to avoid unreasonable or absurd consequences\u201d). Additionally, R.C. 4123.95 provides that \u201c[s]ections 4123.01 to 4123.94 * * * of the Ohio Revised Code shall be liberally construed in favor of employees and the dependents of deceased employees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">Cubby discounts both of these statutory considerations. Under Cubby\u2019s interpretation, the statute would strip employees of their statutory right to participate in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Fund solely on the basis of their participation in ridesharing, an activity that the legislature has expressly directed the Directors of Transportation and Development to promote (R.C. 5501.031[F]) and has authorized the use of cars owned or leased by state agencies and political subdivisions to further (R.C. 1551.25[B]).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">Instead of a rule of exclusion, R.C. 4123.452 establishes that voluntary participation in a ridesharing arrangement is not an act that converts the personal nature of the typical work commute into an activity that is in the course of employment as contemplated in R.C. 4123.01(C). Accordingly, R.C. 4123.452 does not alter our disposition of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">We hold that a fixed-situs employee is entitled to workers\u2019 compensation benefits for injuries occurring while coming and going from or to his or her place of employment where the travel serves a function of the employer\u2019s business and creates a risk that is distinctive in nature from or quantitatively greater than risks common to the public. Accordingly, we affirm the appellate court judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"A3G\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b254-10\">Moyer, C.J., F.E. Sweeney and Pfeifer, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"Ayx\">Lundberg Stratton, J., concurs in the syllabus and judgment:</judges>\n<judges id=\"A5n\">Douglas and Resnick, JJ., concur in judgment only.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b249-9\">. Although all of the parties to this action argued the significance of the per diem bonus paid to Cubby employees in relation to the course-of-employment inquiry, payment of that bonus has little influence on our determination. Although payment for travel is commonly considered to be a key factor in determining whether an employee was in the course of his or her employment while traveling to a job site (see, generally, 1 Larson at 4-255 to 4-261), characterization of such payment is far too malleable to serve as a leading factor in the course-of-employment inquiry. See <em>Heil, supra </em>(denying compensation to an employee who was injured while commuting to work despite the fact that his employer compensated him for the commute). Regardless of whether travel is a necessary component of an employee\u2019s service to his employer, compensation may be made part of his benefit package, just as an employer may choose to pay a parking allowance. Likewise, even where travel undoubtedly serves a function of the employment relationship, an employer may choose to compensate the employee for his travel indirectly, with a higher base or hourly salary. Here, we simply note that Cubby\u2019s payment of the per diem bonus is not inconsistent with our course-of-employment conclusion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b252-8\">. The <em>Littlefield </em>court did, in fact, discuss the work-relatedness of the claimant\u2019s activity at the time of the accident in the body of its opinion. The court noted that the injury occurred during a regularly scheduled meal break, while the claimant was returning from a local restaurant. The <em>Littlefield, </em>court additionally noted that the employer sometimes paid the restaurant directly for meals consumed by its employees during work hours. Additionally, a concurrence written by Justice Clifford F. Brown specifically distinguished the case from <em>Bralley, supra, </em>on the basis of time, place, and circumstance. The <em>MTD Products </em>court, however, did not deem these facts a sufficient basis to distinguish its case \u2014 involving an employee engaged in his initial commute to work \u2014 from <em>Littlefield.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b252-9\">.

While the majority arrives at the correct judgment, it does so based on a faulty analysis concerning whether claimants had a fixed place of employment for purposes of the \u201cgoing and coming\u201d rule, and whether claimants\u2019 injuries arose out of their employment. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>I write separately to clarify certain aspects of the \u201ccourse\u201d and \u201carising\u201d elements as they apply to the fact patterns presented in these cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">Appellant, Cubby Drilling, Inc. (\u201cCubby\u201d), is engaged in the business of drilling oil and gas wells. Most of its drilling is performed in Ohio and Pennsylvania, with occasional drilling sites in New York. Claimants-appellees, Kenneth Ruck-man, Jr., John W. Riggs III, and Richard Brosius, were employed by Cubby to work in four-man crews on rigs as they moved from site to site.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">According to Riggs, the drill site would move approximately every fourth to eighth day. According to Ruckman and Brosius, they were assigned to drilling sites for periods of three to five days. According to Cubby, the average job site ranged from a few days to a few months.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">Regardless of the duration of particular drilling sites, the location of the sites was subject to constant change and was determined entirely by contract between Cubby and its customers. Claimants were informed as to which drill site to report in one of two ways. In the event they had worked the shift prior to a move of the rig, they would be assigned to the next job at that time. Otherwise, they would be called at home and told where and when to report.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">Once given their assignments, claimants were required to report directly to the drill site rather than to Cubby\u2019s home office in Midvale. Typically, the claimants would leave their homes prior to each shift, meet with other crew members at an agreed place, and ride to the site together in a single vehicle. Cubby neither provided nor offered transportation, but would pay a per diem based on the number of miles a drill site was from Cubby\u2019s home office.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-9\">On December 17, 1991, Riggs and Brosius met two other crew members in Canton, Ohio, and headed to their job site in Champion, Ohio. At about 10:00 p.m., while en route from Canton to Champion on State Route 225 in Portage County, Riggs and Brosius were injured when a vehicle approaching from the other direction crossed the centerline and collided with the vehicle in which they were passengers.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-10\">On January 20, 1993, Ruckman met two other members of his crew near Cadiz, Ohio, and headed for his job site in Mercer, Pennsylvania. At about 6:00 a.m., while en route from Cadiz to Mercer on State Route 225 in Portage County, Ruckman was injured when the vehicle in which he was a passenger was struck by a tractor-trailer rig.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-11\">Each claimant filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim, which was allowed administratively. All three orders were appealed to the Portage County Court of Common Pleas. In each case, cross-motions for summary judgment were filed, and the trial court entered judgment in favor of the claimant. The court of appeals, in three separate opinions, affirmed the judgments of the trial court. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>Relying on <em>Fletcher v. Northwest Mechanical Contr., Inc. </em>(1991), 75 Ohio App.3d 466, 599 N.E.2d 822, the court of appeals declined to apply' the \u201cgoing and coming\u201d rule to defeat compensation in these cases because \u201cthe nature of the employment itself requires travel as a necessary part of the job.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">Since all three claimants were injured under similar circumstances and were engaged in the same kind of work for the same employer, the common question confronting this court is whether the \u201cgoing and coming\u201d rule applies to defeat compensation to those employees who are assigned to work at constantly changing work sites.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">COURSE OF EMPLOYMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">Under R.C. 4123.01(C), an injury, to be compensable, must be \u201creceived in the course of, and arising out of, the injured employee\u2019s employment.\u201d The course-of-employment requirement tests work-connection as to time, place, and circumstance. <em>Fisher v. Mayfield </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 275, 277, 551 N.E.2d 1271, 1274. It connotes the performance of some required duty in the service of the employer. <em>Indus. Comm. v. Gintert </em>(1934), 128 Ohio St. 129, 133-134, 190 N.E. 400, 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-8\">Even though the employment is the cause of the worker\u2019s journey between home and workplace, it has never been accepted that workers\u2019 compensation was intended to protect against all risks and hazards of that journey. <em>Indus. Comm. v. Baker </em>(1933), 127 Ohio St. 345, 188 N.E. 560, paragraph four of the syllabus. See, also, Fulton, Ohio Workers\u2019 Compensation Law (1991) 149, Section 7.7; 1 Larson\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Law (1997) 4-3, Section 15.11. Accordingly, the rule has evolved that an employee injured while traveling to and from a fixed and limited place of employment generally does not receive an injury in the course of employment. <em>Bralley v. Daugherty </em>(1980), 61 Ohio St.2d 302, 303, 15 O.O.3d 359, 360, 401 N.E.2d 448, 450. Thus, absent certain exceptions relative to the range of employment dangers, an employee who is going to and from a fixed place of employment is covered only on the employer\u2019s premises. <em>Indus. Comm. v. Bateman </em>(1933), 126 Ohio St. 279, 185 N.E. 50, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-9\">This rule, known as the \u201cgoing and coming\u201d or \u201cpremises\u201d rule, represents \u201ca compromise on the subject of going to and from work.\u201d 1 Larson, <em>supra, </em>at 4-3, Section 15.11. See, also, Fulton, Ohio Workers\u2019 Compensation Law (1991) 149, Section 7.7. It neither always allows nor always precludes compensation to all employees who are injured in the course of their travel to and from work. By definition, it applies only to the employee having a \u201cfixed\u201d place of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-10\">As relevant here, \u201cfixed\u201d means \u201cnot subject to change or fluctuation.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (1986) 861. Thus, \u201c[a]n employee who has a fixed situs of employment reports to the same place each day to carry out <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>his duties.\u201d Young\u2019s Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law of Ohio (2 Ed.1971) 81, Section 5.7. Accordingly, in <em>Indus. Comm. v. Heil </em>(1931), 123 Ohio St. 604, 176 N.E. 458, the court held the going-and-coming rule applicable to a plant superintendent who \u201chad no duties to perform for the company <em>at any place other </em>than at the abattoir plant.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Id., </em>123 Ohio St. at 604, 176 N.E. at 459.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">In <em>Indus. Comm. v. Gintert </em>(1934), 128 Ohio St. 129, 190 N.E. 400, the court held the going-and-coming rule applicable to a school teacher whose sole place of employment was a particular school building. The claimant argued that the decedent was in the course of her employment while traveling between work and home because she did some preparatory work at home. In rejecting this argument, the court reasoned:</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">\u201cIf there can be a recovery under the facts in this record, then there could be a like recovery in the case of any clerk, stenographer, bookkeeper, or any other employe[e] employed in an office, bank, store, factory, or other place of employment, who carried home any books, papers, statements, etc., for any purpose at all connected with his duties * * <em>Id., </em>128 Ohio St. at 133, 190 N.E. at 402-403.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">In <em>Outland v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1940), 136 Ohio St. 488, 493, 17 O.O. 92, 94, 26 N.E.2d 760, 762, the court explained that \u201c[djecedent [an automobile salesman] was not a pieceworker plying his trade in a particular place.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">In <em>Lohnes v. Young </em>(1963), 175 Ohio St. 291, 25 O.O.2d 136, 194 N.E.2d 428, the court found that the decedent, who was employed as a products control manager by General Mills, Inc., at its Toledo plant, was a fixed-situs employee. In so doing, the court carefully pointed out that decedent\u2019s \u201cwork was performed in and his duty to his employer extended over <em>only this one plant. </em>The only traveling decedent did was to and from work, from his home to the plant. His job, as such, required <em>no other traveling, </em>and he was thus subjected to no greater hazards than any other member of the public.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Id., </em>175 Ohio St. at 293, 25 O.O.2d at 137, 194 N.E.2d at 430. Thus, the court concluded, \u201cno matter what hours decedent worked, his work was performed <em>in a fixed and limited place, General Mills\u2019 plant, and it was only there that he was required to perform his duties on behalf of his employer.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>Id., </em>175 Ohio St. at 294, 25 O.O.2d at 137, 194 N.E.2d at 430-431.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-9\">Thus, a factory worker, plant superintendent, school teacher and products control manager, as well as a clerk, stenographer, bookkeeper or any other employee employed at a particular plant, office, school, bank, store, factory or other unchanging place of employment, are examples of persons who have fixed places of employment. They report to the same work situs each day, and that situs is not subject to change.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>On the other hand, many courts, including at least six Ohio district courts, of appeals, have refused to bar compensation on the basis of the going-and-coming rule to those employees who are required to work at various or constantly changing work sites. Collectively, these courts have allowed compensation for injuries sustained during travel in the case of a road construction worker who was assigned to various job sites for periods of up to one year; a field erection supervisor whose duties consisted of supervising the installation of industrial machines in the factories of purchasers where he would remain for five- to six-month periods; home health aides and nurses who are assigned to constantly varying work sites; a \u201cworking foreman\u201d who installed and supervised the installation of sprinkler systems, which required that he work at varying sites for various periods of time; a security guard employed to fill various shifts and assignments which became open due to sickness or emergencies at various work sites; a laborer for a company which was in the business of leveling, securing, and skirting trailers at various sites; and a \u201cdriller\u2019s assistant,\u201d a \u201cpumper,\u201d a \u201ctool pusher,\u201d and a \u201croughneck,\u201d each of whom worked at various oil and gas well sites. <em>Hampton v. Trimble </em>(1995), 101 Ohio App.3d 282, 655 N.E.2d 432; <em>Fletcher, supra; Durbin v. Ohio Bur. of Workers\u2019 Comp. </em>(1996), 112 Ohio App.3d 62, 677 N.E.2d 1234; <em>Ruckman v.

They were not pieceworkers plying their trade in a particular place. They did not report to the same place of employment each day to carry out their duties. Their work took them on roads and highways to ever-changing work sites across Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York, where they worked for various periods of time as the rig moved from site to site, depending upon the location and needs of Cubby\u2019s various customers and where Cubby directed them to report. Without the willingness of employees like Ruckman, Riggs, and Brosius to expose themselves to the hazards of long distances of highway travel to constantly varying work <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>sites, Cubby could not have done business under its system. I simply cannot accept that the term \u201cfixed,\u201d as used in the going-and-coming rule, was intended to stretch so far as to encompass this type of employment arrangement. To do so would be a strict rather than a liberal interpretation of the course-of-employment requirement, and directly contravene the mandate of R.C. 4123.95.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">The majority finds that despite claimants\u2019 classification as fixed-situs employees, and the application of the going-and-coming rule, their injuries were nevertheless sustained in the course of employment. The majority explains:</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">\u201cThe nature of the rigging business requires that drilling be done on a customer\u2019s premises. That is a necessary condition of the work contract. The riggers set up on a customer\u2019s premises, drill a well and, after completion, disassemble the derrick for transport to the next job site. Consequently, while coming to and going from a customer\u2019s premises, these employees are engaged in the promotion and furtherance of their employer\u2019s business as a condition of their employment. Accordingly, their travel is in the course of their employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">This analysis recognizes, in essence if not by name, the principle' that \u201c[t]he rule excluding off-premises injuries during the journey to and from work does not apply if the making of that journey * * * is in itself a substantial part of the service for which the worker is employed.\u201d 1 Larson\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Law, <em>supra, </em>at 4-193, Section 16.00. To the extent that the majority finds that the fixed-situs claimant may rely on the journey-as-part-of-service principle to \u201cavoid [the] force\u201d of the going-and-coming rule, I have no quarrel with its analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">However, once this principle is recognized, it can be considered the justification for holding, in the first instance, that variable-situs employees generally have no fixed place of employment. Many of the cases set forth above have considered the constantly changing nature of a claimant\u2019s employment situs to be the decisive factor in determining that a particular injurious journey to or from a work site was a necessary, substantial, or integral part of the claimant\u2019s employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-9\">ARISING OUT OF EMPLOYMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b259-10\">The majority\u2019s entire \u201carising out of\u2019 analysis is misdirected. Under the majority\u2019s analysis, the claimants are required to rely on the \u201cspecial hazard\u201d exception, as an \u201calternate method[ ] of proving causality\u201d because \u201c[application of the <em>Lord [v. Daugherty </em>(1981), 66 Ohio St.2d 441, 20 O.O.3d 376, 423 N.E.2d 96] factors to the present facts does not support compensation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b259-11\">In these cases, it is not necessary that claimants satisfy the <em>Lord </em>test or the special-hazard rule in order to establish that their injuries arose out of their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>employment. \u201cIf an employee is in the service of his employer at the time an accident occurs by reason of risk or hazard inherent in the use of a public road, it follows that the resultant injury or death arose out of the employment.\u201d <em>Newman, supra, </em>212 Kan. at 569, 512 P.2d at 503. In other words, \u201cwhen the employer\u2019s business is such that traveling was an integral part of the contract between the employee and the employer, the risk of accident during travel was a risk interrelated with the nature of that employment.\u201d <em>Fletcher, supra, </em>75 Ohio App.3d at 474, 599 N.E.2d at 827.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">Thus, as the Supreme Court of Kansas aptly explained in <em>Mitchell, supra, </em>154 Kan. at 122, 114 P.2d at 844:</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">\u201cThe accident also arose out of his employment. A necessary part of his employment consisted in traveling from well to well and to any other place at which he might desire to transact business pertaining to drilling activities. Manifestly, part of his business consisted of traveling the highways. The hazards and risks of highway travel were incidents of his employment. It was in connection with those hazards of employment that his death occurred and it cannot be said the accident did not arise out of his employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">In the present cause, claimants\u2019 travel to and from their assigned site was, as the majority states, \u201ca condition of their employment.\u201d The risk of accident during such travel, therefore, was a hazard of their employment. Since claimants\u2019 injuries were caused by a hazard of their employment, it necessarily follows that their injuries arose out of their employment. It is at this point that the \u201carising out of\u2019 inquiry ends, not begins. The fact patterns presented in these cases do not warrant any further consideration under <em>Lord, supra, </em>or the special-hazard exception. Those tests would come into play only if there was some evidence to the effect that claimants were traveling off-route to their assigned sites, or that their injuries were caused by some risk other than that inherent in the travel itself. That is not the case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">Accordingly, I would hold that an employee who is required to report to various or constantly changing work sites is not generally subject to the going- and-coming rule. When an employee is injured during travel to and from a variable work situs, his or her injury is generally received in the course of, and arising out of, his or her employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">RIDESHARING</p>\n<p id=\"b260-9\">I agree with the majority that \u201cR.C. 4123.452 establishes that voluntary participation in a ridesharing arrangement is not an act that converts the personal nature of the typical work commute into an activity that is in the course of employment as contemplated in R.C. 4123.01(C).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>I wish to stress, however, that R.C. 4123.452 is a ridesharing statute, nothing more. While this statute obviously contemplates the going-and-coming rule, it does not purport to codify, supersede, modify, or impose any additional requirements on the going-and-coming rule. It applies when compensation is sought on the basis that claimant\u2019s injuries occurred while he or she was participating in a ridesharing arrangement. It adopts the concept that the ridesharing arrangement <em>itself </em>is not sufficient to bring an injury within the course of employment. It does not operate to preclude compensation for injuries which occur during a ridesharing arrangement where there is an independent basis for compensation. Since claimants in this cause do not base their claims on the fact that they were carpooling when their injuries occurred, R.C. 4123.452 does not apply. However, it remains a judicial function to determine the nature, extent, and applicability of the going-and-coming rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">In light of all the foregoing, and for the reasons set forth herein, I concur in the majority\u2019s judgment that the injuries suffered by each claimant were received in the course of, and arising out of, his employment with Cubby and, therefore, are compensable.</p>\n<judges id=\"b261-7\">Douglas. J., concurs in the foregoing concurring opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
