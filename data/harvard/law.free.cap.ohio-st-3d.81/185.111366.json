We note that three years after having been admitted to the bar in 1970, respondent was purportedly diagnosed as suffering from \u201canxiety related [phobic] reaction.\u201d Except for some treatment from a physician in 1991, respondent attempted to deal with the problem himself, and he claims it was during the time of his illness that these disciplinary violations occurred. Although respondent\u2019s illness has allegedly lasted for nearly twenty-five years, he introduced no medical evidence to support his claim that he suffered from the disease, nor any evidence, apart from his having had a successful legal practice since 1995, that, if he did suffer from an illness, he has now recovered. We, therefore, adopt the recommendation of the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>Respondent is hereby suspended from the practice of law for one year, and his reinstatement is conditioned on full restitution to Zeleny and Nicholson, a psychological examination of respondent by a psychiatrist chosen by relator within one month of the entry of this order, again at the end of six months, and again at the end of one year. Costs taxed to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b315-6\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, F.E.

Just so the respondent does not misunderstand our opinion, his merely obtaining an exam and ignoring any appropriate recommendation by the psychiatrist may not be enough to convince the court that respondent has successfully dealt with his claimed underlying mental issues. We also would expect the respondent to undertake any appropriate counseling or treatment for his \u201ccondition\u201d as recommended by the psychiatrist to be sure respondent reaches full rehabilitation.</p>\n<judges id=\"b315-9\">Resnick, J., concurs in the foregoing concurring opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
