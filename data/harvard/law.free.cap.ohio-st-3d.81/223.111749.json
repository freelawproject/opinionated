Finding none meritorious, we affirm his convictions. In accordance with the mandate of R.C. 2929.05(A), we have considered each of Mitts\u2019s propositions of law and have reviewed the sentence for appropriateness and proportionality.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-11\">We have previously held that R.C. 2929.05 does not require this court to address and discuss, in opinion form, each proposition of law raised in a capital case. See, <em>e.g., State v. Keith </em>(1997), 79 Ohio St.3d 514, 517, 684 N.E.2d 47, 54; <em>State v. Allen </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 626, 628, 653 N.E.2d 675, 680. Accordingly, we reject the eleventh proposition of law, a familiar attack on the constitutionality of Ohio\u2019s death-penalty statutes, for reasons we have often stated before. We address the remainder of the propositions of law below and for the reasons that follow we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">The Guilt Phase</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">In his second proposition of law, Mitts argues that the trial court erred in not allowing Dr. Sonya McKee, a psychiatrist, to answer a hypothetical question during her guilt-phase testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">At trial, the defense called Dr. McKee, who testified that she had examined Mitts and found him competent, not suffering from any mental disease or defect, and responsible for his acts. Dr. McKee did think that Mitts was intoxicated on the day of the offenses and suffering from impaired memory as a result, and she answered various hypothetical questions on those points. But the court sustained the state\u2019s objection to a question concerning a hypothetical man, \u201cB,\u201d who hated \u201cblack people [and] police officers,\u201d then got drunk, and shot a black man and a police officer. This question contrasted \u201cB\u201d with a hypothetical person, \u201cA,\u201d presumably Mitts, who did not dislike blacks or police officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-9\">Initially, we note that Mitts did not preserve this issue for review by proffering the substance of the excluded testimony. See Evid.R. 103(A)(2); <em>State v. Gilmore </em>(1986), 28 Ohio St.3d 190, 28 OBR 278, 503 N.E.2d 147, syllabus. Even if it was properly preserved, we would find no abuse of discretion in the exclusion of this evidence. See <em>State v. Williams </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 569, 576, 660 N.E.2d 724, 732, citing <em>State v. Williams </em>(1983), 4 Ohio St.3d 53, 4 OBR 144, 446 N.E.2d 444, syllabus. Under Evid.R. 403(A), the trial court must exclude evidence \u201cif its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of * * * confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury.\u201d Defense counsel\u2019s attempt to secure Dr. McKee\u2019s opinion contrasting two hypothetical persons was misleading and confusing.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-10\">Moreover, the trial court could have excluded the testimony because, except in the mitigation phase, \u201ca defendant may not offer expert psychiatric testimony, unrelated to the insanity defense, to show that, due to mental illness, intoxication, or any other reason, he lacked the mental capacity to form the specific mental state required for a particular crime or degree of crime.\u201d <em>State v. Cooey </em>(1989), 46 Ohio St.3d 20, 26, 544 N.E.2d 895, 906; accord <em>State v. Wilcox </em>(1982), 70 Ohio St.2d 182, 194, 24 O.O.3d 284, 291, 436 N.E.2d 523, 530; <em>State v. Slagle </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 597, 607, 605 N.E.2d 916, 927; <em>State v. Huertas </em>(1990), 51 Ohio St.3d 22, 27, 553 N.E.2d 1058, 1065 (rejecting expert witnesses as to the effect of intoxication). Thus, we reject Mitts\u2019s second proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-11\">By his fourth proposition of law, Mitts challenges the trial court\u2019s refusal to instruct the jury on voluntary intoxication when \u201ca reasonable jury could find that the defendant could not form the requisite intent due to * * * inebriation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>As we recognized in <em>State v. Fox </em>(1981), 68 Ohio St.2d 53, 54-55, 22 O.O.3d 259, 260, 428 N.E.2d 410, 411, \u201c[t]he common law and statutory rule in American jurisprudence is that voluntary intoxication is not a defense to any crime.\u201d Nonetheless, \u201cwhere specific intent is a necessary element, * * * if the intoxication was such as to preclude the formation of such intent, the fact of intoxication may be shown to negative this element.\u201d <em>Fox, </em>68 Ohio St.2d at 55, 22 O.O.3d at 260, 428 N.E.2d at 411-412.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">In denying the defense request for an instruction on intoxication, the trial court relied on <em>State v. Hicks </em>(1989), 43 Ohio St.3d 72, 538 N.E.2d 1030. In <em>Hicks, </em>the trial court did not instruct on voluntary intoxication despite evidence of intoxication. On appeal Hicks claimed that he was so intoxicated, through cocaine, that he could not form the specific intent to kill. The <em>Hicks </em>court recognized that \u201c[t]he issue of intoxication is not raised as a defense to the element of purpose * * * merely because the evidence suggests reduced inhibitions, impaired judgment or blurred appreciation by the defendant of the consequences of his conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">It is within the sound discretion of the trial court to determine whether the evidence is sufficient to require a jury instruction on intoxication. <em>State v. Wolons </em>(1989), 44 Ohio St.3d 64, 541 N.E.2d 443, paragraph two of the syllabus; <em>State v. Fox, </em>68 Ohio St.2d 53, 22 O.O.3d 259, 428 N.E.2d 410. Evidence of intoxication is sufficient to raise the intoxication defense only where, if believed, it would support acquittal. <em>State v. Hicks, </em>43 Ohio St.3d at 75, 538 N.E.2d at 1034.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">Here, there was evidence that Mitts was intoxicated during the police standoff, but the jury still could not have reasonably found that he lacked the capacity to form a specific intent to kill at the time of the murders. Testimony from witnesses who observed Mitts before or during the shootings does not support a finding that Mitts was so intoxicated that he did not intend what he was doing when he shot the victims. Around 8:00 p.m., when Timothy Rhone encountered Mitts in the hallway, Mitts displayed no signs of intoxication. Mitts held the gun \u201c[perfectly steady\u201d when he aimed it at Rhone\u2019s head. After 8:00 p.m., when Griffin saw Mitts walk up, aim, and shoot Bryant, Mitts was not staggering. Daniel O\u2019Brien saw Mitts just after he killed Bryant and when Mitts shot at the first responding police car. O\u2019Brien testified that Mitts was not staggering as he walked around, and he had no trouble ejecting the clip from his weapon, reloading, and firing several times at a police car.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">Between 8:30 and 9:00 p.m., after Mitts shot Lt. Kaiser and Sgt. Glivar, Lt. Kaiser tried to negotiate with Mitts for twenty or thirty minutes. Mitts threatened to kill Bryant\u2019s girlfriend, Griffin, as well as the entire police department. By refusing to surrender and demanding that the police come to his apartment and kill him, Mitts demonstrated that he was acting purposefully and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>knew what he had done and what he was doing. At that time, Mitts said he had been drinking, but he did not say how much and his speech was not slurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">Officer Mackey, who talked with Mitts even later, also noted that Mitts said he had been drinking, but Mitts was \u201ccalm\u201d and \u201cnever angry,\u201d and his speech pattern did not indicate intoxication. Further, Mitts read the label on Glivar\u2019s shotgun and fired it twice, although he was unfamiliar with that weapon. Sgt. Robert Sackett, who joined in Mitts\u2019s lengthy conversations with Officer Mackey, thought Mitts seemed \u201ccompletely sober.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">Chief Salerno, who first talked with Mitts around 8:30 p.m. during the police standoff, testified that Mitts would \u201cgiggle and laugh\u201d at times, and at other times would \u201cstart getting angry.\u201d Mitts told Salerno that he had finished drinking a bottle of bourbon and was now drinking scotch. Salerno thought Mitts was drunk, but Mitts told him exactly what he had done, <em>ie., </em>killed a black man and shot two police officers. Detective Ronald Arco also thought Mitts was intoxicated when he overheard Mitts on the telephone around 9:42 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">Police Sergeant Gary Wolske, who stayed with Mitts after he was arrested around 2:00 a.m., described him as quiet, neither combative nor confused, and apparently sober. A nurse who first treated Mitts testified that he displayed no signs of intoxication. A Life Flight nurse, who saw Mitts later, thought he had been drinking, but his speech was not impaired. Mitts indicated that he knew what he had done because he told the nurse, \u201cI\u2019m a cop killer and you might as well kill me now.\u201d Mitts also said, \u201cI think I killed a nigger.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">Mitts\u2019s strongest evidence of intoxication is his blood-alcohol level of .21 grams per one hundred milliliters taken at 3:43 a.m. Although the blood-alcohol level is evidence that Mitts was intoxicated at the time of the blood test, more than six hours after the shootings, it does not compel an intoxication instruction because the jury could not have inferred from it that the intoxication precluded Mitts from forming the intent to purposefully commit the murders.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-9\">The evidence of intoxication could not have supported a verdict of acquittal. The trial court was correct in determining that an intoxication instruction was not required. Accordingly, we reject the fourth proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b357-11\">Penalty Phase</p>\n<p id=\"Aq\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b357-12\">Instruction on Nature of Life Sentences</p>\n<p id=\"Ay\">In his first proposition of law, Mitts argues that the trial court should have instructed the jury that it could recommend that Mitts receive consecutive life sentences on the two counts of aggravated murder. The trial judge denied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>Mitts\u2019s request for such an instruction. The court did not err by refusing to give Mitts\u2019s requested instruction because it is not an accurate statement of the law. See <em>State v. Scott </em>(1986), 26 Ohio St.3d 92, 101, 26 OBR 79, 87, 497 N.E.2d 55, 63. Under Ohio law, \u201c[a] jury has no option of recommending whether life sentences should run consecutively or concurrently.\u201d <em>State v. Allard </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 482, 492, 663 N.E.2d 1277, 1287, citing <em>State v. Grant </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 465, 482, 620 N.E.2d 50, 69; see, also, R.C. 2929.03(D)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">Mitts next argues that the trial court\u2019s failure/refusal to tell the jury, in response to a question, that he could or would require that life sentences, if recommended, be served consecutively violated Mitts\u2019s rights under the Fifth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. During penalty deliberations, the jury asked the judge, \u201cWould a verdict of life imprisonment on count one and count two be served consecutively or concurrently?\u201d The court answered that these aggravated murder counts \u201care separate and distinct counts. * * * [T]he matter or the question as to consecutive or concurrent sentencing is up to the Court * * Mitts contends that \u201c[t]he jury question implies that the life option may have been recommended had the jury been assured that the judge would or could order that the sentences be served consecutively.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">In <em>State v. Allard, </em>75 Ohio St.3d at 492, 663 N.E.2d at 1287, when faced with the same issue, we responded that \u201cassertions regarding the jury\u2019s possible motives for asking about consecutive and concurrent sentences are purely speculative\u201d and \u201cthe trial court\u2019s response to the jury\u2019s question was proper, since a jury has no option of recommending whether life sentences should run consecutively or concurrently.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">Mitts relies on <em>Simmons v. South Carolina </em>(1994), 512 U.S. 154, 114 S.Ct. 2187, 129 L.Ed.2d 133. <em>Simmons </em>held that a trial judge violated an accused\u2019s due process rights by refusing to instruct the jury that a life sentence, under the facts and the applicable law, carried with it no possibility of parole. Mitts\u2019s reliance on <em>Simmons </em>is misplaced. In <em>Simmons, </em>South Carolina statutes prohibited Simmons\u2019s release on parole. This information was relevant given the prosecution\u2019s argument of Simmons\u2019s future dangerousness and the evidence that the public misunderstood the meaning of \u201clife imprisonment\u201d in South Carolina. In <em>Simmons, </em>a plurality reasoned that, to the extent that the jury\u2019s misunderstanding (that Simmons could be released on parole) pervaded the jury\u2019s deliberations, it had the effect of creating a false choice between sentencing petitioner to death and sentencing him to a limited period of incarceration. <em>Id. </em>By contrast, in Mitts\u2019s case the prosecutor did not argue future dangerousness and there was no misunderstanding by the jury \u2014 the law in Ohio is that the judge is to make the determination of whether sentences will be served concurrently or consecutively. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>Moreover, counsel\u2019s argument that it was unrealistic to think that the trial judge would impose concurrent sentences here is speculative. Accordingly we overrule Mitts\u2019s first proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">Merger of Capital Specifications</p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">In his third proposition of law, Mitts contends that the trial court\u2019s failure to merge duplicative capital specifications was prejudicial error because significant mitigating evidence existed. Both aggravated murder counts charged Mitts with three course-of-conduct specifications, R.C. 2929.04(A)(5). For example, Count One, alleging the aggravated murder of Sgt. Glivar, included specification three, a course-of-conduct specification in which Bryant was killed. Specification four alleged a course of conduct in which Mitts attempted to kill Lt. Kaiser, and specification five alleged a course of conduct in which Mitts attempted to murder Officer Mackey. Count Two, alleging the aggravated murder of Bryant, included three similar specifications concerning Sgt. Glivar, Lt. Kaiser, and Officer Mackey.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-9\">Multiple course-of-conduct specifications are duplicative and must be merged at the sentencing phase. See <em>State v. Jenkins </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 164, 194-200, 15 OBR 311, 337-342, 473 N.E.2d 264, 292-296. In fact, such multiple course-of-conduct specifications should not even be included in an indictment. In <em>State v. Spisak </em>(1988), 36 Ohio St.3d 80, 84, 521 N.E.2d 800, 803, this court held that \u201c[e]ach aggravated <em>murder </em>count should thus contain only one specification that appellant\u2019s acts were part of a course of conduct.\u201d Further, if such multiple specifications are included in an indictment, the \u201ctrial court should instruct the jury in the penalty phase that those duplicative specifications must be considered merged for purposes of weighing the aggravating circumstances against the mitigating factors.\u201d <em>State v. Garner </em>(1995), 74 Ohio St.3d 49, 53, 656 N.E.2d 623, 630. No such instruction was given in this case. To determine whether that omission constituted reversible error we must engage in a two-pronged analysis. <em>Id., </em>citing <em>State v. Jenkins, </em>15 Ohio St.3d 164, 15 OBR 311, 473 N.E.2d 264, at paragraph five of the syllabus. In the first prong we determine \u201cwhether the specifications at issue \u2018ar[o]se from the same act or indivisible course of conduct,\u2019 and were thus, in fact, duplicative.\u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>State v. Jenkins, </em>15 Ohio St.3d 164, 15 OBR 311, 473 N.E.2d 264, at paragraph five of the syllabus. The court of appeals correctly held, and the state concedes, that the specifications were duplicative.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-10\">For the second prong, we must \u201cdetermine whether the jury\u2019s penalty-phase consideration of those duplicative aggravating circumstances affected its verdict, and independently determine whether the merged aggravating circumstances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>outweigh the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201c[M]erging of aggravating circumstances [can] take place upon appellate review,\u201d and \u201cresentencing is not automatically required.\u201d <em>State v. Jenkins, </em>15 Ohio St.3d 164, 15 OBR 311, 473 N.E.2d 264, at paragraph five of the syllabus; <em>State v. Garner, </em>74 Ohio St.3d at 53, 656 N.E.2d at 630; <em>State v. Spisak, </em>36 Ohio St.3d at 84, 521 N.E.2d at 803.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">We find that the trial court\u2019s failure to instruct the jury that the duplicative specifications should be considered merged did not influence the jury to recommend the death penalty rather than life imprisonment. The outcome of the penalty hearing did not hinge on the failure to merge these three course-of-conduct specifications. We agree with the appellate court that merger of the duplicative course-of-conduct specifications into a single specification listing each shooting victim would not change the nature of the evidence which the jury was statutorily required to consider. Furthermore, the judge did not instruct the jury that its finding of guilt of multiple specifications should be deemed to increase the weight given the aggravating circumstances. Cf. <em>State v. Penix </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 369, 372, 513 N.E.2d 744, 747.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">Moreover, our independent weighing of the mitigating factors against the properly merged aggravating circumstances may be used to cure the penalty-phase error. <em>State v. Combs </em>(1991), 62 Ohio St.3d 278, 286, 581 N.E.2d 1071, 1079; <em>Clemons v. Mississippi </em>(1990), 494 U.S. 738, 110 S.Ct. 1441, 108 L.Ed.2d 725. Accordingly, we reject Mitts\u2019s third proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">Jury Instruction Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b360-9\">With his' fifth proposition of law, Mitts argues that the trial court erred by instructing the jury that its sentencing verdict was only a recommendation and not binding on the court. Mitts\u2019s counsel failed, to object at trial and waived all but plain error. <em>State v. Slagle </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 597, 605, 605 N.E.2d 916, 925. Plain error is an obvious error or defect in the trial proceedings that affects a substantial right. Crim.R. 52(B). Under this standard, reversal is warranted only when the outcome of the trial would have been different without the error. <em>State v. Long </em>(1978), 53 Ohio St.2d 91, 7 O.O.3d 178, 372 N.E.2d 804, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-10\">This court has previously held that the trial court does not err by referring to the jury\u2019s verdict as a recommendation or by recognizing that the trial court would make the final decision on the death penalty. See, <em>e.g., State v. Woodard </em>(1993), 68 Ohio St.3d 70, 77, 623 N.E.2d 75, 80-81; <em>State v. DePew </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 275, 280, 528 N.E.2d 542, 550; <em>State v. Jenkins, </em>15 Ohio St.3d 164, 15 OBR <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>311, 473 N.E.2d 264, at paragraph six of the syllabus. Accordingly, we overrule Mitts\u2019s fifth proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">In his sixth proposition of law, Mitts raises three additional penalty-phase issues, but Mitts\u2019s counsel failed to object or request additional instructions and again waived all but plain error. <em>State v. Williams </em>(1977), 51 Ohio St.2d 112, 5 O.O.3d 98, 364 N.E.2d 1364, paragraph one of the syllabus; <em>State v. Underwood </em>(1983), 3 Ohio St.3d 12, 3 OBR 360, 444 N.E.2d 1332, syllabus. First, Mitts argues that the trial court erred by giving the statutory definition of \u201creasonable doubt,\u201d as contained in R.C. 2901.05(D). In doing so, the trial court referred to the \u201ctruth of the charge.\u201d While this specific reference is inappropriate in the penalty-phase context, this deficiency was not outcome-determinative. See <em>State v. Taylor </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 15, 29, 676 N.E.2d 82, 96; <em>State v. Woodard, </em>68 Ohio St.3d at 76-77, 623 N.E.2d at 80; <em>State v. Spirko </em>(1991), 59 Ohio St.3d 1, 17, 570 N.E.2d 229, 248.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">Second, Mitts argues that the trial court gave an improper \u201cacquittal-first\u201d instruction on its sentencing deliberations in violation of <em>State v. Thomas </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 213, 533 N.E.2d 286. The court did <em>not </em>instruct the jury that it could consider lesser penalties only if it first unanimously rejected the death penalty. Instead, the court instructed that if all twelve members of the jury found that the state had not proved that the aggravating circumstances outweighed mitigating factors, then it must choose between the possible life sentences. That instruction is consistent with R.C. 2929.03(D)(2) and does not constitute error. <em>State v. Taylor, </em>78 Ohio St.3d at 28-29, 676 N.E.2d at 95; <em>State v. Davis </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 107, 116-118, 666 N.E.2d 1099, 1108-1109.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">Third, Mitts complains because the trial court instructed, without objection, that the jury \u201cmust not be influenced by <em>any </em>consideration of sympathy or prejudice,\u201d as opposed to the term <em>\u201cmere </em>sympathy.\u201d Again, this issue lacks merit. Sympathy is not a relevant sentencing criteria, and \u201c[t]here is no practical difference between \u2018mere sympathy\u2019 and \u2018any syinpathy\u2019 in this context.\u201d <em>State v. Taylor, </em>78 Ohio St.3d at 30, 676 N.E.2d at 96. The court\u2019s instruction to the jury not to consider sympathy or prejudice was a correct statement of the law. <em>State v. Allen </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 626, 638, 653 N.E.2d 675, 687; <em>State v. Steffen </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 111, 125, 31 OBR 273, 285, 509 N.E.2d 383, 396; <em>State v. Jenkins, </em>15 Ohio St.3d 164, 15 OBR 311, 473 N.E.2d 264, at paragraph three of the syllabus. Thus, we reject Mitts\u2019s sixth proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">\u2022 With Proposition of Law VIII, Mitts argues that the trial court erred in refusing to instruct the jury that \u201cit could consider as mitigating the fact that the appellant was highly intoxicated at the time of the offense.\u201d The court, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>followed the statutory language in R.C. 2929.04(B), and accurately stated the law by instructing the jury to consider the accused\u2019s \u201chistory, character and background,\u201d as well as his lack of a criminal record and \u201c[a]ny other factors that are relative [sic] to the issue whether defendant should be sentenced to death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">Thus, the jury was allowed to consider all of the mitigation evidence including Mitts\u2019s asserted intoxication, as well as his counsel\u2019s argument that intoxication was a mitigating factor. The jury was not precluded from considering any evidence as mitigating. In <em>State v. Landrum </em>(1990), 53 Ohio St.3d 107, 122, 559 N.E.2d 710, 727-728, we held that a trial judge did not err by simply following the statutory language and declining to instruct that particular evidence was a possible specific mitigating factor. We find that Mitts\u2019s eighth proposition of law lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">Ineffective Assistance of Counsel</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">In his seventh proposition of law, Mitts argues that his counsel\u2019s failure, to object to improper jury instructions deprived him of his constitutional right to the effective assistance of counsel. Reversal of a conviction or sentence on the grounds of ineffective assistance of counsel requires that the defendant show, first, that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and, second, that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense so as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial. <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2064, 80 L.Ed.2d 674, 693. To demonstrate that counsel is deficient, appellant must show that counsel\u2019s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonable representation. <em>State v. Bradley </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 538 N.E.2d 373, paragraph two of the syllabus. To demonstrate prejudice, appellant must prove that there exists a reasonable probability that were it not for counsel\u2019s error, the result of the trial would have been different. <em>Id. </em>at paragraph three of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">Mitts\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance do not meet the <em>Strickland </em>standard. Since we have previously concluded that the trial court\u2019s \u201cacquittal first\u201d instruction, \u201creasonable doubt\u201d definition, and use of the term \u201crecommendation\u201d were not erroneous, counsel\u2019s performance was not deficient for failing to raise these issues. (See discussion of Propositions of Law V and VI, above.)</p>\n<p id=\"b362-9\">As we discussed under Proposition of Law III, the course-of-conduct death-penalty specifications should have been merged. Any deficiency in counsel\u2019s failure to raise this issue, however, did not prejudice the defendant because, as we determined, the failure to merge was not outcome-determinative.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>Mitts also raises his counsel\u2019s failure to object to prosecutorial misconduct.- On that point, however, Mitts fails to describe specifically any alleged prosecutorial misconduct. Hence, we reject this proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">E</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">Trial Court\u2019s Sentencing Opinion</p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">In his tenth proposition of law, Mitts argues that the \u201ctrial court improperly weighed the relevant sentencing factors\u201d in imposing the death sentence on Mitts.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-9\">In imposing a sentence, \u201cthe assessment and weight to be given mitigating evidence are matters for the trial court\u2019s determination.\u201d <em>State v. Lott </em>(1990), 51 Ohio St.3d 160, 171, 555 N.E.2d 293, 305. The fact that mitigation evidence is admissible \u201cdoes not automatically mean that it must be given any weight.\u201d <em>State v. Steffen </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 111, 31 OBR 273, 509 N.E.2d 383, paragraph two of the syllabus. See, also, <em>State v. Stumpf </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 95, 512 N.E.2d 598, paragraph two of the syllabus. R.C. 2929.03(F) does require, however, that the trial court state in its separate opinion its specific findings as to the existence of the mitigating factors, the aggravating circumstances the offender was found guilty of committing, and the reasons why the aggravating circumstances were sufficient to outweigh the mitigating factors. R.C. 2929.03(F); <em>State v. Maurer </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 239, 15 OBR 379, 473 N.E.2d 768, paragraph three of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-10\">We agree with Mitts that the trial court erred by not separately weighing the aggravating circumstances in each count of aggravated murder. <em>State v. Cooey </em>(1989), 46 Ohio St.3d 20, 544 N.E.2d 895, paragraph three of the syllabus. The trial court also incorrectly stated that no evidence of any statutory mitigating factors existed; in fact, the evidence showed that Mitts had no criminal record. See R.C. 2929.04(B)(5). Although the trial court correctly identified the aggravating circumstances, the trial court did not merge the specifications as it should have done. (See discussion on Proposition of Law III.) Nor does the trial court\u2019s opinion explain why the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating factors. See <em>State v. Fox </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 183, 190-191, 631 N.E.2d 124, 130-131.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-11\">Despite these deficiencies in the trial court\u2019s opinion, we find that reversal is not required. The court of appeals already noted these defects and determined, after an independent sentence review, that the death penalty was appropriate. Further, our \u201cindependent review of a sentence will cure any flaws in the trial court\u2019s opinion.\u201d <em>State v. Fox, </em>69 Ohio St.3d at 191, 631 N.E.2d at 131. Accord <em>State v. Hill </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 195, 210, 661 N.E.2d 1068, 1082; <em>State v. Lott, </em>51 Ohio St.3d at 170-173, 555 N.E.2d at 304-307. Accordingly, we overrule the tenth proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">Independent Sentence Assessment</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">In his ninth proposition of law, Mitts argues that \u201cthe proven aggravating factors * * * do not outweigh the mitigating factors,\u201d summarizes the mitigating evidence, and outlines various mitigating factors he draws from that evidence. We will consider these arguments in our independent sentence review.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">Pursuant to R.C. 2929.05, we independently weigh the aggravating circumstances against the mitigating factors and determine whether Mitts\u2019s sentence is \u25a0 disproportionate to sentences in similar cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">Sgt. .Glivar\u2019s murder has two aggravating circumstances: (1) that the victim was a peace officer in the line of duty (R.C. 2929.04[A][6]) and (2) that the murder was part of a course of conduct involving the purposeful killing or attempt to kill two or more persons (R.C. 2929.04[A][5]). Bryant\u2019s murder carries only the course-of-conduct aggravating circumstance. The evidence proves these aggravating circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-9\">We find that the nature and circumstances of these offenses do not offer the slightest mitigating value. In contrast, Mitts\u2019s history, character, and background are entitled to some mitigating weight. As several witnesses testified, Mitts was respected and loved by his family and was a devoted father. See <em>State v. Fox, </em>69 Ohio St.3d at 194, 631 N.E.2d at 133. Mitts\u2019s brother testified that Mitts was the oldest child in the family and that while growing up Mitts looked after the younger children. Mitts\u2019s sister described Mitts as \u201claid-back\u201d and a \u201cgentle giant,\u201d who was very protective of his brothers and sisters. Mitts served honorably for four years in the Coast Guard, and he was gainfully employed all of his life. See <em>State v. Lundgren </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 474, 495, 653 N.E.2d 304, 324-325; <em>State v. Fox, supra; State v. Simko </em>(1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 483, 496, 644 N.E.2d 345, 350; <em>State v. Brewer </em>(1990), 48 Ohio St.3d 50, 64, 549 N.E.2d 491, 505. We accord all of these factors some mitigating weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-10\">R.C. 2929.04(B)(1) through (4) and (6) are not applicable in this case. The victims did not \u201cinduce or facilitate\u201d the offenses and Mitts did not act under \u201cduress, coercion or strong provocation.\u201d (R.C. 2929.04[B][1] and [2].) The expert opinion testimony confirmed that Mitts did not suffer from any \u201cmental disease or defect.\u201d (R.C. 2929.04[B][3].) Mitts was forty-two years old at the time of the offenses and was the principal offender. (R.C. 2929.04[B][4] and [6].)</p>\n<p id=\"b364-11\">Mitts had no criminal record, and this \u201cnoteworthy\u201d mitigating factor in R.C. 2929.04(B)(5) is entitled to significant mitigating weight. See <em>State v. Fox, </em>69 Ohio St.3d at 195, 631 N.E.2d at 133-134.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-12\">\u00c1s to \u201cother factors\u201d (R.C. 2929.04[B][7]), Mitts claims remorse for his actions as well as the influence of alcohol as mitigating factors. Mitts\u2019s expression of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>remorse in his unsworn statement is entitled to some weight. See <em>State v. Rojas </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 131, 143, 592 N.E.2d 1376, 1387. As to alcohol, Mitts presented no evidence that he was an alcoholic, and voluntary drunkenness is entitled to very little mitigating weight. See, <em>e.g., State v. Slagle, </em>65 Ohio St.3d at 614, 605 N.E.2d at 931.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">We now weigh these mitigating factors against the aggravating circumstance(s) in each murder. \u201cWhen a capital defendant is convicted of more than one count of aggravated murder, * * * [o]nly the aggravating circumstances related to a given count may be considered in assessing the penalty for that count.\u201d <em>State v. Cooey </em>(1989), 46 Ohio St.3d 20, 544 N.E.2d 895, paragraph three of the syllabus. Based on the evidence, we find that the aggravating circumstances in the murder of Sgt. Glivar outweigh the mitigating factors. As to the murder of Bryant, we also find that the aggravating circumstance outweighs the mitigating factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">We further conclude that the death penalty imposed for each aggravated murder is appropriate and proportionate when compared with similar capital cases. As to \u201ccourse of conduct\u201d murders, see <em>State v. Allard </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 482, 663 N.E.2d 1277; <em>State v. Williams </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 569, 660 N.E.2d 724; <em>State v. Dunlap </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 308, 652 N.E.2d 988; <em>State v. Loza </em>(1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 61, 641 N.E.2d 1082; <em>State v. Grant </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 465, 620 N.E.2d 50; <em>State v. Lorraine </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 414, 613 N.E.2d 212; <em>State v. Hawkins </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 339, 612 N.E.2d 1227; <em>State v. Montgomery </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 410, 575 N.E.2d 167; and <em>State v. Combs </em>(1991), 62 Ohio St.3d 278, 581 N.E.2d 1071. When compared with prior cases involving the murder of a peace officer, the death penalty is also appropriate and proportionate. See, <em>e.g., State v. Zuern </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 56, 512 N.E.2d 585; <em>State v. Glenn </em>(1986), 28 Ohio St.3d 451, 28 OBR 501, 504 N.E.2d 701.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">Accordingly, we affirm the convictions and death penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-9\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b365-10\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
