Miller from further proceedings in the above-captioned case.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-14\">Affiant claims that Judge Miller should be disqualified from the pending case because she has a \u201cpersonal dating relationship\u201d with a member of the same law firm as counsel for the plaintiffs in the underlying case. Affiant asserts that this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1210\">*1210</page-number>relationship requires Judge Miller\u2019s disqualification pursuant to Canon 3(C)(1)(d)(ii) of the Code of Judicial Conduct and because her impartiality in this case might reasonably be questioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\">Canon 3(C)(1)(d)(ii) mandates a judge\u2019s disqualification from a pending case where a judge\u2019s spouse acts as a lawyer in a pending proceeding before that judge. In applying this provision, the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline, in Advisory Opinion No. 91-8, held that a judge\u2019s disqualification is not required where an attorney who practices law with the judge\u2019s spouse appears before the judge. Regardless of the nature and extent of Judge Miller\u2019s relationship with an attorney who practices law in the plaintiffs\u2019 law firm, there is no indication that this attorney is serving as counsel in the underlying case. Accordingly, Judge Miller\u2019s disqualification is not warranted by Canon 3 of the Code of Judicial Conduct, and I cannot conclude, based on the affidavit filed by counsel for the defendant, that there exists a reasonable question regarding Judge Miller\u2019s impartiality in this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">The affidavit of disqualification is found not well taken and is denied. The case shall proceed before Judge Miller.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
