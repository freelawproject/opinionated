Moreover, tax years 1993 and 1994 were in the same interim period within the meaning of R.C. 5715.19(A)(2), and the 1993 and 1994 complaints concerned the same property.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-15\">The BOE contends that the complaint filed by Elkem for tax year 1993 constitutes a complaint filed within the same interim period, despite being dismissed, and, therefore, the complaint filed for tax year 1994 is prohibited by R.C. 5715.19(A)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b813-16\">Elkem, on the other hand, contends that a dismissed property valuation complaint does not constitute a \u201cfiling\u201d for the purposes of the prohibition of R.C. 5715.19(A)(2) against a second filing in the same interim period.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-17\">In <em>Gammarino v. Hamilton Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 388, 643 N.E.2d 1143, a real property valuation complaint for tax year 1990 was dismissed for lack of standing. Tax year 1990 was the first year of the interim period. Gammarino filed another complaint for tax year 1991 and it was dismissed by the board of revision for lack of prosecution. Gammarino appealed the dismissal of the 1991 complaint to the BTA, where the county auditor moved to dismiss it under R.C. 5715.19(A)(2). Gammarino\u2019s 1991 complaint did not allege any of the special circumstances enumerated in R.C. 5715.19(A)(2)(a) through (d). The BTA denied the auditor\u2019s motion, finding the board of revision lacked the authority to dismiss the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>On appeal, we reversed the BTA\u2019s decision. We stated that \u201cR.C. 5715.19(A)(2) clearly provides that only one complaint can be filed during each interim period absent any showing of a change in circumstances as described in R.C. 5715.19(A)(2)(a) through <em>(d).\u201d Id. </em>at 389, 643 N.E.2d at 1144.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">In the current matter, the BTA held that the 1993 complaint filed by Elkem was void <em>ab initio, </em>a nullity, thereby finding that there was no filing for tax year 1993. We disagree and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-6\">In <em>Seventh Urban, Inc. v. Univ. Circle Prop. Dev., Inc. </em>(1981), 67 Ohio St.2d 19, 22, 21 O.O.3d 12, 14, 423 N.E.2d 1070, 1073, we stated that jurisdiction is the authority to hear and determine a cause. See, also, <em>Sheldon\u2019s Lessee v. Newton </em>(1854), 3 Ohio St. 494; <em>State v. King </em>(1957), 166 Ohio St. 293, 2 O.O.2d 200, 142 N.E.2d 222. The jurisdiction for boards of revision is set forth in R.C. 5715.01 and 5715.11. R.C. 5715.01 provides, \u201cThere shall also be a board in each county, known as the county board of revision, which shall hear complaints and revise assessments of real property for taxation.\u201d R.C. 5715.11 provides, \u201cThe county board of revision shall hear complaints relating to the valuation or assessment of real property * * *. The board shall investigate all such complaints and may increase or decrease any such valuation * *</p>\n<p id=\"b814-7\">A review of the applicable statutes set forth above shows that a board of revision has been given jurisdiction to hear and rule on complaints submitted to it. As part of its jurisdiction to hear and rule on complaints, a board of revision must undertake a two-step analysis. First, the board of revision must examine the complaint to determine whether it meets the jurisdictional requirements set forth by the statutes. Second, if the complaint meets the jurisdictional requirements, then the board of revision is empowered to proceed to consider the evidence and determine the true value of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-8\">The statutory requirements for filing and filling out a complaint are contained in R.C. 5715.13 and 5715.19. In <em>Stanjim Co. v. Mahoning Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1974), 38 Ohio St.2d 233, 235, 67 O.O.2d 296, 298, 313 N.E.2d 14, 16, we stated that \u201cfull compliance with R.C. 5715.19 and 5715.13 is necessary before a county board of revision is empowered to act on the merits of a claim.\u201d Thus, only after a board of revision determines that the complaint meets the jurisdictional requirements can it proceed to the second step to determine the case on the merits. If the complaint does not meet the jurisdictional requirements, then the board of revision must dismiss it because the complaint has not invoked the board\u2019s power to proceed to a consideration of the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-9\">Elkem\u2019s 1993 complaint was determined by the common pleas court not to be filled out properly and, therefore, the BOR was not empowered to proceed to determine the merits of the case. The fact that the BOR was not empowered by Elkem\u2019s 1993 complaint to proceed to the second step to decide the merits does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>not mean that it did not have jurisdiction to det\u00e9rmine whether the complaint met the jurisdictional requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">In <em>Sheldon\u2019s Lessee </em>this court stated, \u201cIf the court had jurisdiction of the subject matter, and the parties, it is altogether immaterial how grossly irregular, or manifestly erroneous, its proceedings may have been; its final order cannot be regarded as a nullity, and cannot therefore, be collaterally impeached.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 498. The BTA\u2019s decision in this matter has the effect of declaring all the proceedings, as regards the 1993 complaint, void and a nullity. The BTA\u2019s decision is erroneous because the BOR had jurisdiction to determine whether the 1993 complaint met the jurisdictional requirements. The filing of a complaint with a board of revision invokes its jurisdiction to rule whether the complaint meets the jurisdictional requirements. A board of revision\u2019s decision as to whether a complaint meets the jurisdictional requirements, while voidable, is not void and likewise the complaint is not void <em>ah initio.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">Turning now to a consideration of Elkem\u2019s 1994 complaint, we conclude that our decision here must turn upon the' meaning of the word \u201cfiled\u201d as used in R.C. 5715.19(A)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b815-7\">In <em>Fulton v. State ex rel. Gen. Motors Corp. </em>(1936), 130 Ohio St. 494, 5 O.O. 142, 200 N.E. 636, we considered a statute that required preference claims to be filed within a certain period of time. In determining what the word \u201cfiled\u201d meant, we cited at 497-498, 5 O.O. at 144, 200 N.E. at 637, definitions for the words \u201cfile\u201d and \u201cfiled\u201d from several different sources, all of which could be summed up by the quotation quoted from <em>United States v. Lombardo </em>(1916), 241 U.S. 73, 76, 36 S.Ct. 508, 509, 60 L.Ed. 897, 898, that \u201c \u2018[a] paper is filed when it is delivered to the proper official and by him received and filed.\u2019 \u201d Thus, when Elkem delivered its complaint for tax year 1993 to the BOR, it \u201cfiled\u201d a complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-8\">In commenting on an exception to the four-year statute of limitations for making sales tax assessments, applicable when a vendor fails to file a return, we stated in <em>Petrarca v. Peck </em>(1953), 159 Ohio St. 377, 379, 50 O.O. 333, 334, 112 N.E.2d 378, 379, that the phrase \u201cfailure \u2018to file a return,\u2019 means failure to file <em>any </em>return, not an accurate or perfect return.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Likewise, in this case we believe that the relevant factor is the fact that a prior complaint was <em>filed, </em>not whether the prior complaint was accurate or perfect.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-9\">While our reading of R.C. 5715.19(A)(2) makes the filing of a complaint with a board of revision the relevant factor for determining whether a complaint has been \u201cfiled,\u201d Elkem argues that we should ignore its first filing because it was dismissed for jurisdictional reasons, and therefore was a nullity. We do not find any wording in R.C. 5715.19(A)(2) or in any of the circumstances set forth in subparagraphs (a) through (d) wherein a second complaint is permitted to be filed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>in the same interim period if the first complaint was dismissed for jurisdictional reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">Elkem finally argues that by dismissing the second complaint, it is being denied a determination on the merits. Specifically, Elkem states that the purpose of R.C. 5715.19(A)(2) is to provide at least one merit hearing in a triennium. We cannot accept such an interpretation. We find nothing in R.C. 5715.19(A)(2) that would support Elkem\u2019s interpretation. We cannot ignore the statute as written. <em>Slingluff v. Weaver </em>(1902), 66 Ohio St. 621, 631-632, 64 N.E. 574, 577.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">Accordingly, we hold that the decision of the BTA allowing Elkem to file its 1994 complaint was unreasonable and unlawful, and it is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">\n<em>Decision reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b816-7\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
