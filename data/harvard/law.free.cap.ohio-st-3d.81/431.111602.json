The first is whether Tucker was subjected to an \u201cinterrogation\u201d by the corrections officers without being given the requisite <em>Miranda </em>warnings. The second issue is whether admission of Brock\u2019s taped statements was prejudicial error. For the reasons which follow, we determine that neither of the trial court\u2019s separate decisions to allow Tucker\u2019s statement and Brock\u2019s statements into evidence was prejudicial error requiring a reversal of Tucker\u2019s convictions. We reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and reinstate Tucker\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b562-10\">After his apprehension in Kentucky, Tucker was brought to the Logan County Jail on April 12, 1994, and held there while awaiting trial. Tucker was in a \u201cday room\u201d with several other inmates at the jail on December 4, 1994, when corrections officers guarding him noticed that he was nervous and \u201cwasn\u2019t himself.\u201d Tucker had been watching television news coverage of Brock\u2019s separate trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-11\">The guards, Logan County Deputy Sheriff Larry Garwood and Jail Corporal Phil'Bailey, also with the Logan County Sheriffs Department, decided to remove Tucker from the day room and to take him to another room in the jail, away from other prisoners. The guards gave him a cigarette and a soft drink, in an effort to calm him down. Tucker had undergone some mental health counseling while being detained, and the guards asked him if he wanted them to contact a mental health professional to come to the jail. Tucker told them that he did not want a counselor. Tucker began talking about Brock\u2019s trial to the guards, telling them <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>he wished \u201cthis would just get over\u201d so he could \u201cstart [his] time.\u201d He had in the past told the guards that it helped him to talk about it and to get it off his chest because it helped him sleep. Tucker told the guards he was going to plead guilty when he was tried (unless Brock got the death penalty, because he wouldn\u2019t plead guilty then). At this point, one of the guards remarked, \u201cwhen this is all said and done, I\u2019d like to hear about what happened that day.\u201d Tucker stated that he would tell them \u201cright now\u201d what happened \u201cif it doesn\u2019t go any further.\u201d One of the guards said, \u201cyou don\u2019t have to talk about it.\u201d Tucker said it helped him to talk about it, and proceeded to tell the guards of the plan he and Brock came up with to rob Thomas Herring\u2019s house of the guns, describing the shootings of Herring in the kitchen and the taking of Herring\u2019s guns.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">At the hearing held on Tucker\u2019s motion to suppress, both Deputy Garwood and Corporal Bailey testified to the circumstances surrounding Tucker\u2019s statement to them at the Logan County Jail, as well as to the details of the statement itself. After the trial court denied the motion to suppress the state\u2019s use of this statement, Deputy Garwood also testified at Tucker\u2019s trial, over renewed defense objections, about the statement\u2019s factual setting and its contents.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">At issue is whether Tucker\u2019s motion to suppress the statement should have been granted by the trial court because he was subjected to an \u201cinterrogation\u201d without being given <em>Miranda </em>warnings at the time, so that the statement should not have been used against him at his trial. We must therefore consider what \u201cinterrogation\u201d means in this context.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">In the course of its opinion in <em>Miranda v. Arizona </em>(1966), 384 U.S. 436, 444, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 1612, 16 L.Ed.2d 694, 706, the United States Supreme Court; in establishing the well-known <em>\u201cMiranda </em>rules\u201d for advising suspects of their rights, stated that \u201c[b]y custodial interrogation, we mean questioning initiated by law enforcement officers after a person has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way.\u201d In <em>Rhode Island v. Innis </em>(1980), 446 U.S. 291, 298, 100 S.Ct. 1682, 1688, 64 L.Ed.2d 297, 306, the court undertook to refine the contours of the term \u201cinterrogation\u201d in light of the use of the word \u201cquestioning\u201d in <em>Miranda.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">The <em>Innis </em>court determined that the <em>Miranda </em>rules are not so narrow as to apply to only \u201cthose police interrogation practices that involve express questioning of a defendant * * <em>Innis, </em>446 U.S. at 298, 100 S.Ct. at 1688, 64 L.Ed.2d at 306. The <em>Innis </em>court read the term \u201cinterrogation\u201d more broadly, to also include the more subtle \u201ctechniques of persuasion\u201d sometimes employed by police officers that do not rise to the level of express questioning, but which also can be extremely coercive in some situations. <em>Id., </em>446 U.S. at 299-300, 100 S.Ct. at 1689, 64 L.Ed.2d at 306-307.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>However, as the <em>Innis </em>court emphasized, the <em>Miranda </em>rules do not operate to prevent the use as evidence of <em>every </em>statement made by a person in custody: \u201c \u2018Confessions remain a proper force in law enforcement. Any statement given freely and voluntarily without any compelling influences is, of course, admissible in evidence. <em>The fundamental import of the privilege </em>[against compulsory self-incrimination] <em>while an individual is in custody is not whether he is allowed to talk to the police without the benefit of warnings and counsel, but whether he can be </em>interrogated.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis <em>sic.) Id., </em>446 U.S. at 299-300, 100 S.Ct. at 1689, 64 L.Ed.2d at 307, quoting <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 478, 86 S.Ct. at 1630, 16 L.Ed.2d at 726. Moreover, the <em>Innis </em>court determined that \u201c \u2018[interrogation,\u2019 as conceptualized in the <em>Miranda </em>opinion, must reflect a measure of compulsion above and beyond that inherent in custody itself.\u201d 446 U.S. at 300, 100 S.Ct. at 1689, 64 L.Ed.2d at 307.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">Thus, to determine whether a suspect has been \u201cinterrogated,\u201d the heart of the inquiry focuses on police coercion, and whether the suspect has been compelled to speak by that coercion. This compulsion can be brought about by express questioning, but also can be brought about by the \u201cfunctional equivalent\u201d of express questioning, <em>i.e., </em>\u201cany words or actions on the part of the police (other than those normally attendant to arrest and custody) that the police should know are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from the suspect.\u201d (Footnotes omitted.) <em>Id., </em>446 U.S. at 300-301, 100 S.Ct. at 1689-1690, 64 L.Ed.2d at 308. See, also, <em>State v. Williams </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 281, 6 OBR 345, 452 N.E.2d 1323, paragraph five of the syllabus (\u201cFor purposes of application of the <em>Miranda </em>rule, custodial interrogation refers not merely to explicit questioning but also to any words or actions on the part of police officers, excepting those normally incident to arrest and custody, that the officers should know are reasonably likely to induce an incriminating response from the suspect.\u201d); <em>State v. Knuckles </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 494, 605 N.E.2d 54, paragraph two of the syllabus (\u201cWhen a statement, question or remark by a police officer is reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from a suspect, it is an interrogation.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">Initially, there is no evidence in the record of any <em>actual </em>coercive practices employed by the corrections officers. It is clear that no actual express questioning, in the sense of the first prong of <em>Miranda </em>regarding \u201cinterrogation,\u201d occurred in this case. Furthermore, the officers cannot be said to have designed their words or actions in an attempt to elicit an incriminating response from Tucker, so that it is apparent that the officers did not invite, nor did they expect, a response. The testimony of the corrections officers regarding the making of Tucker\u2019s statement reveals that no questions meant to elicit information from Tucker about the incidents at the Herring home were voiced. However, pursuant to <em>Innis, </em>the inquiry does not stop there. In this context, what the officers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>should have known as to the reasonable impact their statements would have had on Tucker is just as important.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\">Our inquiry thus focuses on the second, \u201cfunctional equivalent,\u201d interrogation prong of <em>Miranda, </em>as discussed in <em>Innis. </em>Even if the words or actions of the corrections officers were not designed to elicit an incriminating response, should the officers have realized that their conduct would, in fact, elicit an incriminating response? In other words, should the officers have realized that their actions, while not coercive, were being interpreted as coercive by the suspect, Tucker, so<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that Tucker felt compelled to speak?</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">Our answer to this question is \u201cno.\u201d The concept of \u201cfunctional equivalent of questioning\u201d compulsion would have to be extended beyond its recognized boundaries as explained in <em>Innis </em>in order that \u201cfunctional equivalent\u201d compulsion sufficient to invoke the <em>Miranda </em>principles be found on the facts of this case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On the record before us, the officers reasonably should not have anticipated that their actions or words would be likely to evoke an incriminating response.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">Tucker himself is the one who voluntarily turned the conversation to the subject of Herring\u2019s killing. Tucker told the guards he was going to plead guilty, because then he could \u201cstart [his] time\u201d and get this \u201cover.\u201d Any further interaction between Tucker and the guards was a continuation of the conversation and flowed from the initial volunteered incriminating statement of Tucker.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">Even given the guards\u2019 knowledge of Tucker\u2019s past mental health counseling, and given their awareness of his uneasiness over seeing coverage of Brock\u2019s trial on television, their interaction with him has all the earmarks of casual conversation. The officers were simply looking out for Tucker\u2019s well-being. They engaged him in casual conversation, as they had in the past when they observed he was anxious or nervous, and were attempting to calm him.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">Tucker had never confessed any details in the past to them of his participation in the events at Herring\u2019s home, and there was no reason for them to anticipate that he would confess this time. Deputy Garwood testified at the suppression hearing that he was a Logan County deputy, and that he really did not know the details of Tucker\u2019s case, because Tucker was a suspect in Shelby County and was to be tried in Shelby County. Moreover, the musings of Deputy Garwood that \u201cwhen this is all said and done, I\u2019d like to hear about what happened that day\u201d were not \u201creasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>This statement by the corrections officer was similar to the officers\u2019 statements at issue in <em>Innis </em>that were characterized by the United States Supreme Court as \u201coffhand remarks.\u201d 446 U.S. at 303, 100 S.Ct. at 1691, 64 L.Ed.2d at 309. \u201c[T]he police surely cannot be held accountable for the unforeseeable results of their words or actions.\u201d <em>Id., </em>446 U.S. at 301-302, 100 S.Ct. at 1690, 64 L.Ed.2d at 308. We conclude that Tucker was not \u201cinterrogated,\u201d so that he was not subjected to the \u201cfunctional equivalent\u201d of questioning. Therefore, his entire statement must be considered to have been voluntarily made. \u201cVolunteered statements of any kind are not barred by the Fifth Amendment and their admissibility is not affected by our holding today.\u201d <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 478, 86 S.Ct. at 1630, 16 L.Ed.2d at 726.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">Moreover, there is no requirement that officers interrupt a suspect in the course of making a volunteered statement to recite the <em>Miranda </em>warnings. As Tucker himself voluntarily turned the conversation to the Herring killing, and the rest of the conversation was a continuation in the same vein, Tucker cannot be said to have been interrogated. The guard\u2019s statement that \u201cyou don\u2019t have to talk about it\u201d (produced in response to Tucker\u2019s statement about talking \u201cif it doesn\u2019t go any further\u201d) was merely one comment made as part of the ongoing conversation.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">While it is obvious that the guard\u2019s statement is no substitute for <em>Miranda </em>warnings, it does not have to be, because <em>Miranda </em>warnings were not required. This statement, which clearly shows that the guards were not putting pressure on Tucker, further supports that the entire interaction between Tucker and the guards was an ongoing casual conversation.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">For all the foregoing reasons, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals on this issue. Tucker\u2019s motion to suppress was properly denied by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b566-9\">When Daniel Brock was called to the stand outside the presence of the jury in Tucker\u2019s trial, he invoked his Fifth Amendment rights and did not testify. The trial court declared Brock to be unavailable as a witness. The state then called to testify outside the presence of the jury Deputy Sheriff Doug Schlagetter, a detective with the Shelby County Sheriffs Department. Schlagetter recounted how he had interviewed Brock on the date of Brock\u2019s arrest, March 31, 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-10\">Schlagetter had advised Brock of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, Brock agreed to waive those rights, and Schlagetter proceeded to inquire of Brock about the Herring murder. The more than an hour interview, wherein Brock related a version of what happened at the Herring house on March 9, 1994, was recorded on audio tape.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>Schlagetter told the trial judge of the circumstances surrounding the making of Brock\u2019s statements, and referred generally to the contents of the tape without getting into specifics. Schlagetter testified that, from the answers given by Brock at the time, as well as from later evidence acquired during the investigation regarding the Herring murder, it became evident that Brock had told him \u201cnumerous lies\u201d during the interview. Schlagetter also agreed on cross-examination that a constant theme in Brock\u2019s story was an attempt to shift the blame to Tucker and away from Brock. Schlagetter did not testify to the jury at this point in the trial, and the question of the tape\u2019s admissibility was deferred to a later time.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">Later on in the trial, the trial court heard arguments outside the presence of the jury from the attorneys on whether Brock\u2019s taped statements should be played for the jury. The trial court ruled the tape admissible under Evid.R. 804(B)(3),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> as a statement against Brock\u2019s interest. Schlagetter took the witness stand, this time in the presence of the jury, and testified to the circumstances of Brock\u2019s taped statements. Brock\u2019s taped statements were then played for the jury, after the trial judge instructed the jury to listen \u201cwith due regard and grave caution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">For much of the tape, Brock repeatedly denied that he had fired either of the shots at Herring, and claimed that Tucker had shot Herring twice, \"with different guns. Brock claimed that Burnham and Tucker were out to pin the Herring murder on him, and that he was afraid of Tucker. Finally, near the end of the session, Brock admitted that he shot Herring with a shotgun, after Tucker had shot Herring first. Brock claimed that Tucker threatened to shoot him if he did not fire at Herring.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">After the tape was played, Schlagetter on cross-examination verified that many of the details in Brock\u2019s story were inconsistent with the other evidence that had been discovered during the investigation of the Herring case.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-9\">At issue is whether Brock\u2019s taped statements should have been used against Tucker. This case potentially raises the questions of whether the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>abused its discretion in admitting Brock\u2019s taped statements against Tucker under Evid.R. 804(B)(3), as well as whether the admission of the taped statements violated Tucker\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to confront adverse witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">Tucker urges that, based on the facts of this case, this court should \u201cfollow the lead\u201d of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Williamson v. United States </em>(1994), 512 U.S. 594, 114 S.Ct. 2431, 129 L.Ed.2d 476. In <em>Williamson, </em>the Supreme Court clarified the scope of Fed.R.Evid. 804(b)(3), the federal version of the hearsay exception for statements against penal interest, and determined that Fed.R.Evid. 804(b)(3) \u201cdoes not allow admission of non-self-inculpatory statements, even if they are made within a broader narrative that is generally self-inculpatory.\u201d 512 U.S. at 600-601, 114 S.Ct. at 2435, 129 L.Ed.2d at 483.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">Tucker argues that this court should divide Brock\u2019s statements into self-inculpatory (admissible) and self-exculpatory (inadmissible) portions. Tucker further argues that, if <em>Williamson\u2019s </em>interpretation of Fed.R.Evid. 804(b)(3) is determined by this court to apply to Ohio\u2019s Evid.R. 804(B)(3), then the trial court should have admitted only a very small part of Brock\u2019s statements \u2014 the part in which Brock admitted shooting Herring \u2014 so that the trial court erred in admitting the statements in their entirety.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">The trial court found the statements to be admissible under the hearsay exception of Evid.R. 804(B)(3) as being against Brock\u2019s interest, relying on <em>State v. Gilliam </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 17, 635 N.E.2d 1242. In <em>Gilliam, </em>this court found that the admission of a co-defendant\u2019s taped statement after the co-defendant became unavailable to testify did not violate the defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to confront adverse witnesses. The court determined that the trial court did not abuse its discretion, because the statement at issue was clearly a statement against interest, in that it clearly tended to subject the declarant to criminal liability. <em>Id., </em>70 Ohio St.3d at 20, 635 N.E.2d at 1245. Furthermore, the <em>Gilliam </em>court found that corroborating circumstances indicated the trustworthiness of the statement. 70 Ohio St.3d at 20-21, 635 N.E.2d at 1246.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">The state urges that \u201c[\u00a1Inconsistencies in a co-defendant\u2019s confession, which confession is otherwise corroborated by extrinsic circumstances, are relevant to its weight rather than its admissibility.\u201d The state, while acknowledging that Brock\u2019s statements are fraught with inconsistencies, points out that some of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>details included in Brock\u2019s statements, for example that he, Tucker, and Burnham were all at the Herring house, are accurate. The state argues that, pursuant to <em>Gilliam, </em>the best course in this situation is for the trial court to give a limiting instruction to the jury, and then to admit the full statements, with the jury itself evaluating which parts of the statements are truthful and which are not.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">We recognize that there are significant factors present in this case that arguably were not present in <em>Gilliam. </em>The court of appeals found that the taped statements should not have been admitted against Tucker because the statements were not truly against Brock\u2019s interest, and also found, without citation, that \u201cthe corroborating circumstances required for admission of this type of hearsay statement clearly do not exist.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">We need not resolve whether Brock\u2019s taped statements should have been admitted by the trial court. In <em>State v. Williams, </em>at paragraph six of the syllabus, this court held that \u201c[wjhere constitutional error in the admission of evidence is extant, such error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt if the remaining evidence, standing alone, constitutes overwhelming proof of defendant\u2019s guilt.\u201d Because the record demonstrates that overwhelming proof of Tucker\u2019s guilt was presented at trial without reference to Brock\u2019s taped statements, the admission of those statements, if error, was harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">The essentially uncontroverted testimony of other witnesses at Tucker\u2019s trial, particularly of Shawn Burnham, Shanda Grieves, and Deputy Garwood, provided overwhelming proof sufficient to convince the jury of Tucker\u2019s guilt. In addition, physical and circumstantial evidence supported the state\u2019s theory of events that took place. A unique facet of this case is the amount of credible evidence available for the jury to use as a basis to evaluate Brock\u2019s statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">It is extremely doubtful that the admission of Brock\u2019s taped statements actually could have misled the jury in this ease. There can be little doubt after examining the record that no reasonable juror would have accepted Brock\u2019s versions of events, as related on the tape, as plausible. No rational jury member could have put much value on Brock\u2019s statements as proving \u201cthe truth of the matter[s] asserted\u201d by Brock. See Evid.R. 801(C). Most of the tape was so transparently self-serving toward Brock\u2019s attempts to exonerate himself that it is doubtful that the tape had much probative value at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-9\">Among the factors that point to the tape\u2019s lack of influence on the jury verdict are the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b569-10\">Brock\u2019s statements on the tape directly contradicted the eyewitness testimony offered by Burnham. While Brock attempted to place blame on Tucker for orchestrating the robbery and committing the killing, Burnham\u2019s testimony, already heard by the jury, established that Brock was the organizer of the trip, and that Brock was by no means an unwilling participant. Rather than making <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>Tucker appear more guilty, the unlikeliness of Brock\u2019s statements, when contrasted with Burnham\u2019s testimony, tended to indicate that Brock\u2019s statements were at best an improbable effort at self-exculpation.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">The taped statements themselves are a disjointed series of responses to questions, and are riddled with internal inconsistencies, the most glaring of which is that Brock repeatedly denies that he shot Herring, until, near the end of the tape, he does an about face and admits to it (with the hollow claim that Tucker made him do it).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">Detective Schlagetter, who testified before and after the tape was played, stated for the jury that there were obvious inconsistencies in Brock\u2019s versions of events.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">The trial court gave the jury a limiting instruction, telling the jurors to listen to Brock\u2019s statements with caution.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-8\">For all the reasons detailed above, we determine that Tucker was not prejudiced by the trial court\u2019s admission of the tape into evidence, so that the trial court\u2019s decision to allow the tape to be played, if error, was harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-9\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b570-10\">In conclusion, we determine that Tucker\u2019s statement was not the product of an \u201cinterrogation,\u201d so that the trial court properly denied the motion to suppress. In addition, we find that regardless of whether Brock\u2019s taped statements were improperly admitted into evidence against Tucker, the admission of the statements was harmless error. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals granting Tucker a new trial, reinstate the judgment of the trial court on the jury\u2019s verdict, and sustain Tucker\u2019s convictions and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-11\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b570-12\">Douglas, F.E.

Evid.R. 804(B) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b567-11\"><em>\u201cHearsay exceptions. </em>The following are not excluded by the hearsay rule if the declarant is unavailable as a witness:</p>\n<p id=\"b567-12\">\u201c(3) <em>Statement against interest. </em>A statement that was at the time of its making so far contrary to the declarant\u2019s pecuniary or proprietary interest, or so far tended to subject the declarant to civil or criminal liability, or to render invalid a claim by the declarant against another, that a reasonable person in the declarant\u2019s position would not have made the statement unless the declarant believed it to be true. A statement tending to expose the declarant to criminal liability, whether offered to exculpate or inculpate the accused, is not admissible unless corroborating circumstances clearly indicate the trustworthiness of the statement.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b568-9\">. The Supreme Court in <em>Williamson, </em>512 U.S. at 605, 114 S.Ct. at 2437, 129 L.Ed.2d at 486, made clear that its decision was based solely on its interpretation of Fed.R.Evid. 804(b)(3), and was not dependent on Confrontation Clause analysis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b568-10\">. The state points out in its brief that Tucker argued at trial only that Brock\u2019s statements were inadmissible in their entirety \u2014 and that Tucker never argued to the trial court that the statements could be divided into admissible and inadmissible portions, with only the self-inculpatory statements of Brock played to the jury.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b570-13\">Pfeifer, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AJo\">dissenting. I dissent from the majority opinion because allowing both Tucker\u2019s statement and Brock\u2019s statements into evidence constituted prejudicial error, which required a reversal of Tucker\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-14\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b570-15\">Coercion can occur in places other than the back seat of a police cruiser or in a stifling hot interrogation room with a single light bulb shining in an accused\u2019s face. The \u201cgood cop/bad cop\u201d treatment is not a necessary ingredient in coercing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>an incriminating statement. In this case, we see the coercive effect of the \u201cgood cop/good cop\u201d treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\">In <em>Rhode Island v. Innis </em>(1980), 446 U.S. 291, 301, 100 S.Ct. 1682, 1689-1690, 64 L.Ed.2d 297, 308, the court recognized that subtle persuasion can constitute a form of interrogation:</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">\u201c[T]he term \u2018interrogation\u2019 under <em>Miranda </em>refers not only to express questioning, but also to any words or actions on the part of the police (other than those normally attendant to arrest and custody) that the police should know are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from the suspect. The latter portion of this definition focuses primarily upon the perceptions of the suspect, rather than the intent of the police.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">Tucker\u2019s perception obviously was that he was among friends. Garwood and Bailey had taken Tucker from the day room, away from the other prisoners, and into a separate room. They had given him a cigarette and a drink. Tucker believed his statements would be kept just among the three of them. As the court stated further in <em>Innis:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">\u201cAny knowledge the police may have had concerning the unusual susceptibility of a defendant to a particular form of persuasion might be an important factor in determining whether the police should have known that their words or actions were reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from the suspect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 302, 100 S.Ct. at 1690, 64 L.Ed.2d at 308, fn. 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">Tucker was in an agitated state. The guards knew that he was in that state because he had been viewing Brock\u2019s trial. The majority admits that in the past Tucker had told the guards that it helped him to talk about the crime to get it off his chest and help him sleep. Knowing that Tucker was agitated and that telling his story made him feel better, one guard stated that he would like to hear Tucker\u2019s story. The guards should have known that the request would likely yield an incriminating response. Any doubt should have been resolved when Tucker prefaced his remarks with the admonition that his story would go no further.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-9\">The guards\u2019 treatment of Tucker was the functional equivalent of questioning\u2014 they took him to a secluded room, made him comfortable, and basically asked him to confess. Tucker was clear that he would not talk if he were not among friends and made it clear that he would tell the guards what happened only if it went no further, <em>i.e., </em>only if what he said would not be used against him in a court of law. I would find that <em>Miranda </em>warnings were required, and that Tucker\u2019s motion to suppress should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">The majority seems to agree that the trial court erred in admitting the entirety of Brock\u2019s statements into evidence. The statements, rather than falling under the hearsay exception for statements against interest, were almost entirely in Brock\u2019s interest, blaming the crime on Tucker. Unlike the majority, I do not believe that the remaining evidence against Tucker is overwhelming, and would affirm the appellate court\u2019s granting of a new trial.</p>\n<judges id=\"b572-5\">Moyer, C.J., concurs in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
