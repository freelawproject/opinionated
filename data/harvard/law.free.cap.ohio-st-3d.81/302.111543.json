A claim against an estate is not rejected by silence pursuant to R.C. 2117.11 unless the creditor plainly invokes the statute\u2019s five-day response period.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-9\">A motion to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction should be denied if \u201cany cause of action cognizable by the forum has been raised in the complaint.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Bush v. Spurlock </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 77, 80, 537 N.E.2d 641, 644. Provident\u2019s petition for payment of its claim was cognizable by the probate court unless rejected by Cash, as executor, in accordance with R.C. 2117.11. If rejected, Provident\u2019s claim would have to be filed in a court of general jurisdiction, as Ohio probate courts lack jurisdiction to adjudicate and enter money judgments upon rejected claims. Because Cash did not reject Provident\u2019s claim, the court of appeals correctly concluded that the probate court could exercise jurisdiction over Provident\u2019s petition for payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-10\">R.C. Chapter 2117 governs presentment of claims against an estate. Various sections of that chapter control the mechanics of allowance and rejection of claims by an estate\u2019s personal representative. A creditor must first present a claim for allowance in order to invoke the jurisdiction of the probate court on a petition for payment of the claim. In the instant case, Provident\u2019s written demands for payment of its claim necessarily constituted a presentment for allowance as contemplated by R.C. 2117.06. See <em>Miller v. Ewing </em>(1903), 68 Ohio St. 176, 183-184. 67 N.E. 292. 294.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>Following proper presentation by Provident of its claim, the statutory scheme obliged Cash to allow or reject it. R.C. 2117.06(D). Whether Cash rejected Provident\u2019s claim against Baughman\u2019s estate affects both the probate court\u2019s jurisdiction to hear the merits of Provident\u2019s petition and Provident\u2019s ability to bring suit on the allegedly rejected claim. R.C. 2117.12 provides that a claimant must commence an action on a rejected claim \u201cwithin two months after such rejection * * * or be forever barred from maintaining an action thereon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">\u201cIt is well established in Ohio that notice of disallowance of a creditor\u2019s claim against an estate by a fiduciary must be plain and unequivocal.\u201d <em>Hawkes Hosp. v. Colley </em>(1982), 2 Ohio St.3d 40, 42, 2 OBR 584, 585, 442 N.E.2d 761, 763. R.C. 2117.11 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">\u201cAn executor or administrator shall reject a creditor\u2019s claim against the estate he represents by giving the claimant written notice of the disallowance thereof. Such notice shall be given to the claimant personally or by registered mail with return receipt requested * * *. A claim may be rejected in whole or in part. * *</p>\n<p id=\"b433-10\">Cash does not contend that he rejected Provident\u2019s claim in writing as required. Instead, Cash asserts that although he did not explicitly reject Provident\u2019s claim, by ignoring Provident\u2019s letters he unequivocally communicated rejection of the claim by his silence.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-11\">Silence, however, is ordinarily ambiguous. Recognizing this, the General' Assembly crafted a limited exception to the general rule that rejection of a claim must be in writing. The second paragraph of R.C. 2117.11 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b433-12\">\u201cA claim is rejected if the executor or administrator, on demand in writing by the claimant for an allowance thereof within five days, which demand may be made at presentation or at any time thereafter, fails to give to the claimant, within such period, a written statement of the allowance of such claim. Such rejection shall become effective at the expiration of such period.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b433-13\">Cash maintains that this provision entitles an administrator or executor to reject by five days of silence any claim\" presented for allowance. Because it would obviate the general requirement for -written rejeetion/disallowance of claims against an estate, this construction of the statute is unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-14\">The aim of the provision permitting rejection by silence is to enable those creditors faced with a dilatory executor to hasten resolution of their claims against the estate. As a mechanism triggering expedited decisions regarding payment of claims against an estate, rejection by silence is the creditor\u2019s tool. A creditor may invoke the rejection by silence provision of R.C. 2117.11, deem the claim rejected after five days, and move forward to bring suit in the court of common pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>Pursuant to the express language of the statute, the demand for allowance within five days need not be made at the time of presentment, but may be made at any time. Thus, though a creditor may make several demands that qualify as presentments for allowance, whether silence will be deemed a valid rejection depends upon the form of the creditor\u2019s written demand.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">Accordingly, we hold that to distinguish claims subject to rejection by silence from those claims that are simply pending an allowance decision by an estate\u2019s personal representative, the creditor\u2019s demand must, at a minimum, refer to R.C. 2117.11 and its five-day response period. For example, in <em>Countyline Landscaping, Inc. v. Widen </em>(June 18, 1993), Geauga App. No. 92-G-1730, unreported, 1993 WL 218440, the creditor plainly invoked the rejection by silence provision by stating in its demand, \u201c[P]lease consider this a demand that the claim be allowed within five days, pursuant to Ohio Revised Code Section 2117.11.\u201d On the other hand, a demand containing only the phrase \u201cwithin the time provided by law,\u201d <em>Bush v. O\u2019Dell </em>(Feb. 26, 1992), Licking App. No. CA-3705, unreported, 1992 WL 61283, is insufficient to invoke the R.C. 2117.11 rejection by silence provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">Provident\u2019s letters contained no language demanding that Cash answer within five days pursuant to R.C. 2117.11. Because Provident\u2019s letters cannot be construed as plainly invoking the rejection by silence provision contained in R.C. 2117.11, the court of appeals was correct in holding that Cash\u2019s failure to respond to Provident\u2019s letters did not trigger the provision. Cash did not reject Provident\u2019s claim by his silence, and thus the claim was,not a rejected claim over which the probate court lacks jurisdiction. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b434-8\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
