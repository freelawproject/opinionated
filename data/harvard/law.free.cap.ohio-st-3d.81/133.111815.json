As a result, we affirm the convictions and sentence of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">I. CHOICE OF COUNSEL</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">In his first proposition of law, Keenan contends that he was denied his constitutional right to counsel of his choice when the trial judge replaced his retained counsel, Paul Mancino, Jr. and John H. Higgins, with court-appointed counsel on conflict-of-interest grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-9\">Higgins had previously represented Keenan\u2019s co-defendant, Joseph D\u2019Ambrosio, at his trial for Klann\u2019s aggravated murder. D\u2019Ambrosio was convicted, and Mancino represented him on appeal to the court of appeals. Higgins then represented D\u2019Ambrosio on appeal to this court. See <em>State v. D\u2019Ambrosio </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 185, 616 N.E.2d 909; <em>State ex rel. Keenan v. Calabrese </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 176, 631 N.E.2d 119. The trial court found that Mancino\u2019s and Higgins\u2019s prior representation of D\u2019Ambrosio created an actual conflict of interest that precluded them from representing Keenan under DR 5-105.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b264-10\">Whether or not an <em>actual </em>conflict of interest existed, there clearly was a <em>potential </em>conflict of interest inherent in Keenan\u2019s representation \u2022 by the same attorneys who had represented D\u2019Ambrosio in litigation stemming from the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>set of facts. \u201c[A] possible conflict inheres in almost every instance of multiple representation.\u201d <em>Cuyler v. Sullivan </em>(1980), 446 U.S. 335, 348, 100 S.Ct. 1708, 1718, 64 L.Ed.2d 333, 346.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">In <em>State v. Gillard </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 304, 595 N.E.2d 878, the same attorney represented two co-defendants at a preliminary hearing, then represented one of them in the trial, even though the other one testified on behalf of the defense. On those facts, we held that \u201cthere is a clear possibility of conflict of interest\u201d and that the trial court, on being apprised of these facts, knew or should have known \u201cthat a possible conflict of interest existed which could affect [defense counsel\u2019s] representation of appellant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 312, 595 N.E.2d at 883. See, generally, <em>State v. Dillman </em>(1990), 70 Ohio App.3d 616, 621-623, 591 N.E.2d 849, 852-853.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">The existence of a potential conflict is fatal to Keenan\u2019s claim. A trial court \u201cmust be allowed substantial latitude in refusing waivers of conflicts of interest not only * * * where an actual conflict may be demonstrated before trial, but in the more common cases where a potential for conflict exists which may or may not burgeon into an actual conflict * * <em>Wheat v. United States </em>(1988), 486 U.S. 153, 163, 108 S.Ct. 1692, 1699, 100 L.Ed.2d 140, 151. Thus, \u201cthe standard of review for determining whether the court erred in its pretrial disqualification of defense counsel is whether it abused its broad discretion.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Keenan v. Calabrese, </em>69 Ohio St.3d at 180, 631 N.E.2d at 122.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">Keenan claims that a criminal defendant has an \u201cunqualified\u201d constitutional right to retain counsel of one\u2019s choice. There is no such right. A defendant has only a <em>presumptive </em>right to employ his own chosen counsel. \u201c[T]hat presumption may be overcome not only by a demonstration of actual conflict but by a showing of a serious potential for conflict.\u201d <em>Wheat, </em>486 U.S. at 164, 108 S.Ct. at 1700, 100 L.Ed.2d at 152.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">The trial judge has \u201cwide latitude\u201d in determining that an actual or potential conflict exists. <em>United States v. Mays </em>(C.A.6, 1995), 69 F.3d 116, 121. Moreover, it is irrelevant that both Keenan and D\u2019Ambrosio waived their right to conflict-free counsel. <em>Wheat </em>makes clear that the trial court may \u201crefus[e] waivers of conflicts of interests * * 486 U.S. at 163, 108 S.Ct. at 1699, 100 L.Ed.2d at 151.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-10\">\u201cThe term \u2018abuse of discretion\u2019 connotes more than an error of law or of judgment; it implies that the court\u2019s attitude is unreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable.\u201d <em>State v. Adams </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St.2d 151, 157, 16 O.O.3d 169, 173, 404 N.E.2d 144, 149. There is nothing in this record that could justify us in finding that the trial judge abused his discretion by disqualifying Mancino and Higgins. Therefore, we must overrule Keenan\u2019s first proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>II. SELF-REPRESENTATION</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">Although represented by (appointed) counsel, Keenan filed a <em>pro se </em>motion asking the court to let him act as \u201cco-counsel.\u201d The trial court granted this motion in part and denied it in part, permitting Keenan to examine witnesses, but not to argue to the jury. In his second proposition of law, Keenan claims that the trial court deprived him of his constitutional right to self-representation by denying him leave to argue to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">A criminal defendant does have a constitutional right to represent himself. <em>Faretta v. California </em>(1975), 422 U.S. 806, 95 S.Ct. 2525, 45 L.Ed.2d 562. Moreover, when the defendant conducts his own defense, his right of self-representation includes the right to personally argue to the jury. <em>Herring v. New York </em>(1975), 422 U.S. 853, 864, 95 S.Ct. 2550, 2556, 45 L.Ed.2d 593, 602, fn. 18; <em>McKaskle v. Wiggins </em>(1984), 465 U.S. 168, 174, 104 S.Ct. 944, 949, 79 L.Ed.2d 122, 131.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">However, Keenan never asked to be allowed to argue to the jury. Indeed, he affimatively stated to the trial judge that he was <em>not </em>asking permission to argue to the jury. Keenan\u2019s statement clearly constitutes a waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">Nor did Keenan invoke his right to self-representation. His motion specifically asked leave to participate as \u201cco-counsel\u201d and did not request the discharge of his appointed counsel.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A defendant has no right to a \u201chybrid\u201d form of representation wherein he is represented by counsel, but also acts simultaneously as his own counsel. <em>McKaskle, </em>465 U.S. at 183, 104 S.Ct. at 953, 79 L.Ed.2d at 136; <em>State v. Thompson </em>(1987), 33 Ohio St.3d 1, 6, 514 N.E.2d 407, 414. Yet hybrid representation was precisely what Keenan asked for here. Keenan not only employed the term \u201cco-counsel\u201d repeatedly, he specifically argued that the trial court had discretion to allow hybrid representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-9\">By permitting Keenan to act as \u201cco-counsel\u201d for the purpose of examining witnesses, the trial judge gave Keenan all that he asked for (and more, incidentally, than he had any right to demand). Keenan\u2019s second proposition of law is waived, and for that reason we overrule it.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-10\">III. DATE OF OFFENSE</p>\n<p id=\"b266-11\">In his third proposition of law, Keenan contends that the prosecutor \u201cconstructively amend[ed] the indictment\u201d by arguing to the jury that the state need not prove the exact date of the offense. However, all four counts of the indictment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>allege that Keenan committed the charged offenses <em>\u201con or about </em>\u201d September 24, 1988. Hence, the prosecutor\u2019s argument conformed to the indictment. Nor did the prosecutor\u2019s argument deprive Keenan of fair notice of the charges, since essentially the same dispute over the date took place at his first trial. See <em>State v. Keenan, </em>66 Ohio St.3d at 411, 613 N.E.2d at 210. Keenan\u2019s third proposition of law lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">IV. UNRECORDED SIDEBARS</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">In his fourth proposition of law, Keenan complains that the trial court denied his pretrial motion to record all sidebars, and held forty-seven unrecorded sidebars during trial. Under Crim.R..22, <em>all </em>proceedings in serious offense cases must be recorded, including sidebars. See <em>State v. Brewer </em>(1990), 48 Ohio St.3d 50, 60-61, 549 N.E.2d 491, 502. However, Keenan did not attempt to use App.R. 9 to reconstruct the content of the unrecorded sidebars and show prejudice. Hence, \u201cthe error may be considered waived.\u201d <em>Brewer. </em>See, also, <em>State v. Tyler </em>(1990), 50 Ohio St.3d 24, 41-42, 553 N.E.2d 576, 596; <em>State v. Jells </em>(1990), 53 Ohio St.3d 22, 32, 559 N.E.2d 464, 474.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">V. LESSER INCLUDED OFFENSE</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">At trial, the defense requested an instruction on murder as a lesser included offense of aggravated murder under Count One. Count One charged prior calculation and design under R.C. 2903.01(A), and Keenan argued that the jury could reasonably find \u201cthat there was no plan.\u201d The trial court found the evidence did not support a murder instruction and therefore refused to give one.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-9\">In his twenty-second proposition of law, Keenan argues that the trial court should have instructed on murder as to Count One.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-10\">Keenan presented an alibi defense. Ordinarily, where a defendant presents a complete defense to the substantive elements of the crime, such as an alibi, an instruction on a lesser included offense is improper. See, <em>e.g., State v. Strodes </em>(1976), 48 Ohio St.2d 113, 117, 2 O.O.3d 271, 273, 357 N.E.2d 375, 378, vacated on other grounds (1978), 438 U.S. 911, 98 S.Ct. 3135, 57 L.Ed.2d 1154. In such a case, the defendant is entitled to a lesser included offense instruction only \u201cif, based on the evidence adduced by the state, the trier of fact can find for the defendant * * * on some element of the greater offense which [sic] is not required to prove * * * the lesser offense and for the state on the elements required to prove * * * the lesser offense.\u201d <em>State v. Solomon </em>(1981), 66 Ohio St.2d 214, 20 O.O.3d 213, 421 N.E.2d 139, paragraph two of the syllabus. Hence, Keenan was entitled to a murder instruction only if the jury, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the defense, could have had a reasonable doubt as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>to prior calculation and design, but yet could have found that Keenan purposely killed Klann.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">There was in this case no evidence at all to permit such a finding. Espinoza\u2019s testimony, if believed, clearly shows prior calculation and design. According to him, Keenan drove his truck around Little Italy and interrogated Klann while his henchmen held Klann prisoner at knifepoint. Keenan ultimately drove to a remote area, ordered Klann out of the truck, and asked him one more time where Lewis was. When Klann failed to give a satisfactory answer, Keenan ordered him to tilt his head back. Keenan then cut Klann\u2019s throat, led him to and pushed him into the creek. When Klann tried to flee, Keenan ordered D\u2019Ambrosio to finish him off. This sequence of events simply is not consistent with a spur-of-the-moment killing. The jury could not have found murder \u201cbased on the evidence adduced by the state.\u201d <em>Solomon.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">If D\u2019Ambrosio is believed, however, the search for Lewis did not culminate in Klann\u2019s murder at all. D\u2019Ambrosio testified that Klann was picked up in Little Italy on Friday morning but was not harmed. The defense claimed that Klann was murdered on Friday night/Saturday morning, a time period for which Keenan had an alibi.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">Here, then, are two \u201ccompletely divergent stories.\u201d <em>State v. Wilkins </em>(1980), 64 Ohio St.2d 382, 388, 18 O.O.3d 528, 532, 415 N.E.2d 303, 308. Neither Keenan nor the state presented any evidence negating prior calculation and design. Thus, the jury was never presented with a reasonable view of the evidence on which it could have convicted Keenan of murder. A murder instruction would have been an improper invitation to the jury to reach a compromise verdict that \u201ccould not possibly be sustained by the adduced facts.\u201d <em>Wilkins, </em>64 Ohio St.2d at 387, 18 O.O.3d at 531, 415 N.E.2d at 307. Keenan\u2019s twenty-second proposition of law is overruled-</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">VI. CLAIM THAT RETRIAL WAS BARRED</p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">In his twenty-seventh proposition of law, Keenan argues that, under <em>State v. Penix </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 369, 513 N.E.2d 744, the state was barred from seeking the death penalty upon remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-9\">Keenan clearly misreads <em>Penix. </em>There, we held that, when an appellate court reverses <em>a death sentence </em>recommended by a jury and remands the cause <em>for resentencing, </em>the death penalty may not be reimposed on remand. We so held because R.C. 2929.03(D) requires that any death sentence be recommended by \u201cthe trial jury\u201d; in <em>Penix, </em>we held that \u201cthe trial jury\u201d is \u201cthe same jury that convicted the offender in the guilt phase.\u201d <em>Penix, </em>32 Ohio St.3d at 373, 513 N.E.2d at 747-748.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>The <em>Penix </em>rationale obviously does not apply when the defendant\u2019s <em>conviction </em>is reversed and the cause is remanded for a <em>new trial. </em>In such a case, the jury that convicts the offender on retrial most certainly may impose the death sentence, for then the sentence is recommended by \u201cthe same jury that convicted the offender in the guilt phase.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">Keenan also claims that, because we reversed his original conviction on grounds of prosecutorial misconduct, his retrial constituted double jeopardy. Yet it is a fundamental, long-settled principle \u201cthat a successful appeal of a conviction <em>precludes </em>a subsequent plea of double jeopardy.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>United States v. Scott </em>(1978), 437 U.S. 82, 89, 98 S.Ct. 2187, 2193, 57 L.Ed.2d 65, 73. The rule is the same under the Ohio Constitution. See <em>Sutcliffe v. State </em>(1849), 18 Ohio 469, 477-479.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">Admittedly, some courts have carved out a narrow exception to this rule. Where a defendant asks for, and gets, a <em>mistrial </em>based on prosecutorial misconduct, the Constitution bars his retrial if the prosecutor\u2019s misconduct was calculated to goad the defendant into seeking a mistrial. See <em>Oregon v. Kennedy </em>(1982), 456 U.S. 667, 675-676, 102 S.Ct. 2083, 2089, 72 L.Ed.2d 416, 424-425. Certain courts have extended <em>Kennedy </em>to bar retrial after an <em>appellate reversal </em>based on misconduct calculated or intended to prevent a likely acquittal, even though no mistrial was declared. See, <em>e.g., United States v. Wallach </em>(C.A.2, 1992), 979 F.2d 912, 916.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">However, we have twice declined to adopt this exception to the general rule. <em>State v. Liberatore </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St.2d 583, 23 O.O.3d 489, 433 N.E.2d 561, was a c\u00e1se involving the gravest prosecutorial misconduct. Yet, paragraph two of our syllabus in <em>Liberatore </em>flatly states, \u201cRetrial for the same offense after reversal of a prior conviction on appeal does not constitute a violation of the constitutional provision prohibiting double jeopardy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b269-9\">More recently, in <em>State v. Sage </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 173, 31 OBR 375, 510 N.E.2d 343, we specifically considered the applicability of <em>Kennedy </em>to the appellate-reversal situation. We stated, <em>\u201cKennedy </em>* * * is inapplicable * * * for <em>two </em>reasons: first, the prosecutorial misconduct * * * was not calculated to goad the accused into seeking a mistrial and, second, <em>the retrial was the result of reversal on appeal of his prior </em>conviction.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Id. </em>at 187, 31 OBR at 386-387, 510 N.E.2d at 353.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-10\">Consistent with <em>Liberatore </em>and <em>Sage, </em>we think it unsound to extend <em>Kennedy </em>to retrials after appellate reversals. <em>Kennedy </em>expressly states, \u201cIf a mistrial were in fact warranted * * * the defendant could in many instances successfully appeal * * * on the same grounds that he urged a mistrial, and the Double Jeopardy Clause would present \u00f1o bar to retrial.\u201d 456 U.S. at 676, 102 S.Ct. at 2090, 72 L.Ed.2d at 425. But, see, <em>Jacob v. Clarke </em>(C.A.8, 1995), 52 F.3d 178, 181. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>Moreover, \u201cthe crucial difference between reprosecution after appeal by the defendant and reprosecution after a * * * mistrial declaration is that in the first situation the defendant has not been deprived of his option to go to the first jury and, perhaps, end the dispute then and there with an acquittal.\u201d <em>United States v. Jorn </em>(1971), 400 U.S. 470, 484, 91 S.Ct. 547, 557, 27 L.Ed.2d 543, 556 (plurality opinion). Accord <em>Liberatore, </em>69 Ohio St.2d at 591, 23 O.O.3d at 494, 433 N.E.2d at 567. See, also, <em>State v. Swartz </em>(Ia.App.1995), 541 N.W.2d 533, 539.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">We conclude that double jeopardy principles did not bar Keenan\u2019s reprosecution on remand. Keenan\u2019s twenty-seventh proposition of law is therefore overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">VII. HEARSAY</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">In his fifth proposition of law, Keenan complains that Detective Leo Allen gave hearsay evidence during his direct examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-8\">Over objection, Detective Allen testified that, on September 27,1989, D\u2019Ambrosio told him \u201cthe last time that he saw [Klann] was about 2:00 * * * Saturday morning, at Coconut Joe\u2019s.\u201d Allen\u2019s recounting of what D\u2019Ambrosio told him was certainly hearsay. However, the admission of hearsay does not violate the Confrontation Clause if the declarant testifies at trial. <em>California v. Green </em>(1970), 399 U.S. 149, 90 S.Ct. 1930, 26 L.Ed.2d 489. D\u2019Ambrosio, the declarant, testified in this case as a defense witness. Thus, the admission of his statement to Allen was not constitutional error.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-9\">\u201cNonconstitutional error is harmless if there is substantial other evidence to support the guilty verdict.\u201d <em>State v. Webb </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 325, 335, 638 N.E.2d 1023, 1032. Here, there was \u201csubstantial other evidence\u201d to support the guilty verdict, and we accordingly find this error, harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-10\">Keenan\u2019s remaining hearsay claims were not preserved by objection at trial. Thus, they are waived, absent plain error. We find that none of the alleged hearsay statements, singly or together, reaches the level of plain error. See <em>State v. Long </em>(1978), 53 Ohio St.2d 91, 7 O.O.3d 178, 372 N.E.2d 804, paragraph two of the syllabus. Hence, we need not reach their merits. Keenan\u2019s fifth proposition of law is rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-11\">VIII. EXPERT OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b270-12\">Dr. Elizabeth Balraj, who performed the autopsy on Klann, testified that the deepest of Klann\u2019s stab wounds was eight inches deep, but that a blade only four or five inches long <em>\u201ccould </em>cause that kind of an injury.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Balraj then identified three knives that police had given her for examination and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>measurement. Balraj testified that Klann\u2019s injuries <em>\u201ccould </em>have been inflicted by any or all of these three exhibits.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">In his sixth proposition of law, Keenan claims Balraj\u2019s opinion was inadmissible because it was not stated in terms of probability. However, Keenan did not object to this testimony. He thus waived this issue, absent plain error. In the case of Keenan\u2019s co-defendant, involving similar testimony by the same witness about the same facts and exhibits, we held that the alleged error was not plain error. <em>State v. D\u2019Ambrosio, </em>67 Ohio St.3d at 191, 616 N.E.2d at 915. We so hold here as well, and thus overrule Keenan\u2019s sixth proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">IX. REFERENCE TO DEFENDANT\u2019S INCARCERATION</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">In his seventh proposition of law, Keenan complains that the trial court called to the jury\u2019s attention the fact that Keenan was being held in jail. This proposition, we find, is based on a simple misreading of the record. On April 27, 1994, the court\u2019s morning session began late. The trial judge explained the delay to the jury:</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">\u201c * * * [T]his Court had a sentencing in another case, scheduled for 9:00 a.m., a five-minute sentencing hearing, which we ordinarily would do prior to starting in the morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">\u201cThe Jail, not our deputies here, but the Correction people downstairs, were not able to either locate or bring the defendant up until 10:00 a.m.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b271-9\">This reference to \u201cthe defendant\u201d clearly meant the defendant in the <em>other </em>case, whose sentencing had been scheduled for 9:00 a.m. We see no reasonable possibility that the jury could have misconstrued the judge\u2019s remarks as referring to Keenan. Thus, Keenan\u2019s seventh proposition of law is meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-10\">X. SHACKLED WITNESS</p>\n<p id=\"b271-11\">In his eighth proposition of law, Keenan complains that handcuffs were placed on D\u2019Ambrosio after he was brought into court as Keenan\u2019s witness. Generally, \u201ca defendant has a right to have his witnesses appear free of shackles, except * * * where there is evident danger of escape or harm to individuals in the courtroom. The decision * * * is left to the sound discretion of the trial judge.\u201d <em>Kennedy v. Cardwell </em>(C.A.6, 1973), 487 F.2d 101, 105, fn. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-12\">Although a witness\u2019s prisoner status alone may not warrant shackling, a witness\u2019s serious criminal record and history of violence may justify a trial court\u2019s security concerns. See <em>Wilson v. McCarthy </em>(C.A.9, 1985), 770 F.2d 1482, 1485; <em>United States v. Amaro </em>(C.A.7, 1987), 816 F.2d 284, 285-286. But, see, <em>State v. Coursolle </em>(1959), 255 Minn. 384, 389, 97 N.W.2d 472, 476-477 (shackling impermissible unless witness does something at time of trial to justify it). Moreover, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>handcuffing a witness is \u201cmuch less\u201d prejudicial than handcuffing a defendant, <em>Kennedy v. Cardwell </em>at 109, and thus logically should not require as much justification.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">As a condemned murderer, D\u2019Ambrosio could be presumed dangerous. Moreover, he had the greatest possible incentive to escape and was \u201cbeyond the deterrent reach of the law.\u201d <em>United States v. Fountain </em>(C.A.7, 1985), 768 F.2d 790, 794. Moreover, D\u2019Ambrosio entered the courtroom without handcuffs on, and the handcuffs were placed on him' outside the presence of the jury. Finally, the state\u2019s key witness, Espinoza, was also handcuffed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Cf. <em>United States v. Garcia </em>(C.A.7, 1980), 625 F.2d 162, 167-168; <em>Payne v. Commonwealth </em>(1987), 283 Va. 460, 466, 357 S.E.2d 500, 504. Under the totality of the circumstances, we conclude that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in ordering D\u2019Ambrosio handcuffed.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">XI. PRESENTATION OF FORMER TESTIMONY</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">Keenan in his eighth proposition of law also contends that the trial court discriminated against the defense by using two different procedures in presenting the former testimony of unavailable witnesses pursuant to Evid.R. 804(B)(1). In presenting the former testimony of prosecution witness James Russell, the prosecutor and defense counsel read the questions from the transcript, the trial court played the judge\u2019s role, and the court\u2019s bailiff read Russell\u2019s testimony. But in presenting the former testimony of defense witnesses Steven Gaines and David Oliver, the bailiff read the entire transcript \u2014 questions and answers both.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">However, the defense not only assented to, but actually suggested, the latter method of presentation. If there was any error here, it was invited error, and Keenan may not capitalize on it. Cf. <em>State ex rel. Fowler v. Smith </em>(1994), 68 Ohio St.3d 357, 359, 626 N.E.2d 950, 952.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-9\">XII. MISCELLANEOUS GUILT PHASE ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b272-10\">In his ninth proposition of law, Keenan complains that various trial-court rulings improperly interfered with his defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-11\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b272-12\">James Russell, who had testified at Keenan\u2019s first trial and at D\u2019Ambrosio\u2019s trial, was unavailable for Keenan\u2019s retrial. The state therefore introduced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>Russell\u2019s testimony from Keenan\u2019s first trial. See Evid.R. 804(B)(1). Keenan claims he tried to introduce portions of Russell\u2019s testimony from D\u2019Ambrosio\u2019s trial, but the judge excluded them. Keenan contends that the trial judge should have admitted Russell\u2019s testimony from <em>D\u2019Ambrosio </em>because it was inconsistent with Russell\u2019s testimony in Keenan\u2019s first trial. However, the two portions of the record cited by Keenan do not support Keenan\u2019s claim that he tried to introduce Russell\u2019s <em>DAmbrosio </em>testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">Early in the trial, the prosecutor requested that Russell\u2019s testimony from Keenan\u2019s first trial be read to the jury, explaining to the judge that the state had tried and failed to locate Russell. A discussion of Russell\u2019s unavailability followed. At no point in this discussion did the admissibility of Russell\u2019s <em>DAmbrosio </em>testimony come up.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">Subsequently, the state actually introduced Russell\u2019s testimony from the previous trial. After an off-the-record sidebar, the trial judge stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">\u201cThey just informed me * * * that Mr. Russell testified in the D\u2019Ambrosio trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-9\">\u201cThe Court is ruling that the materials were substantially the same, in the material portion of it. I am going to allow the transcript to be read.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-10\">\u201cMR. KERSEY [defense counsel]: It is from the Keenan trial, the first Keenan case.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-11\">\u201cTHE COURT: I am going to allow that to be read.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-12\">\u201cMR. KERSEY: Not the D\u2019Ambrosio trial, because what the Court is ruling, if I understand the Court, that is substantially the same. There is nothing * * * materially inconsistent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b273-13\">Nothing in this discussion reflects any defense attempt to introduce Russell\u2019s <em>D\u2019Ambrosio </em>testimony. (In fact, this discussion took place during the <em>state\u2019s </em>case-in-chief.) Nor does the discussion indicate that the trial court had closed the door to any subsequent defense use of the <em>D\u2019Ambrosio </em>testimony. The defense simply made no attempt to use it.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-14\">Moreover, Russell\u2019s testimony in Keenan\u2019s first trial is consistent with what Keenan claims Russell said in D\u2019Ambrosio\u2019s trial. Contrary to Keenan\u2019s claim, Russell did <em>not </em>testify in Keenan\u2019s first trial that Kennan was carrying a gun in his pocket. He testified that he saw an object that looked like a gun; that, on second thought, he did not believe the object was a gun; and that the object could have been a boot-shaped key ring that Keenan owned. And that is precisely what Keenan claims Russell said in <em>D\u2019Ambrosio. </em>Hence, any error would be nonprejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">Keenan complains that the trial judge would not let him cross-examine Lewis as to whether Lewis was in jail between June and August 1988. Keenan claims this was relevant because Lewis was imprisoned \u201cat the time of the occurrence of these events.\u201d That claim is false. Klann was murdered in <em>September </em>1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">On direct examination, the defense asked Patrick Keenan (appellant\u2019s brother) about a conversation he had with Adam Flanik in 1989. The state\u2019s objection was sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">Keenan claims Flanik said something to Patrick that was inconsistent with Flanik\u2019s testimony. But Keenan did not proffer Patrick\u2019s testimony into the record. His failure to do so waives any claim of error stemming from the exclusion of that testimony. Evid.R. 103(A)(2). (Moreover, Keenan concedes that he did not give Flanik an opportunity to explain or deny his alleged inconsistent statement before offering it into evidence. Hence, extrinsic evidence of the statement was inadmissible in any event. Evid.R. 613[B].)</p>\n<p id=\"b274-9\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b274-10\">Keenan\u2019s father testified for the defense. On cross-examination, he admitted that he had not testified at his son\u2019s first trial. Asked on redirect why he had not, Keenan\u2019s father replied, \u201cIt was determined by counsel that no defense would be presented.\u201d The state objected because the witness was not Keenan\u2019s counsel and did not personally know what counsel decided. The trial court did not rule on this point, but stated (outside the jury\u2019s hearing) that the testimony \u201cis completely inaccurate\u201d because Keenan had presented a defense at his first trial. The judge struck the question and answer and instructed the jury to disregard them.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-11\">Appellant correctly argues that a trial judge cannot strike testimony simply because he thinks it inaccurate. However, we find the error harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. The testimony at issue was inadmissible for the reason given in the state\u2019s original objection \u2014 a witness may not testify absent evidence that he has personal knowledge of what he testifies to. Evid.R. 602. The defense never showed how Keenan\u2019s father knew that \u201c[i]t was determined by counsel that no defense would be presented.\u201d Cf. <em>Myers v. Garson </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 610, 614-615, 614 N.E.2d 742, 745 (correct judgment will not be reversed because erroneous reason given for it). Moreover, the testimony went to a collateral issue, and the judge did not stigmatize it as inaccurate in front of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>E</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">Keenan complains that the trial court would not allow his counsel to inspect the police report of Cleveland Police Detective Ernest Hayes. Under Crim.R. 16(B)(1)(g), after a witness\u2019s direct examination, opposing counsel may request an <em>in camera </em>inspection of the witness\u2019s \u201cwritten or recorded statement\u201d to determine whether it is inconsistent with his testimony. \u201cStatement\u201d includes police reports to the extent they contain the officer\u2019s \u201cobservations and recolleetion[s],\u201d but not \u201cportions which recite matters beyond the witness\u2019 personal observations.\u201d <em>State v. Jenkins </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 164, 225, 15 OBR 311, 364, 473 N.E.2d 264, 316.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">However, Hayes\u2019s report is- not in the record. Review of this issue is therefore impossible. At trial, Keenan neither requested the report\u2019s inclusion in the record nor objected to its omission. Consequently, he has waived this issue. <em>Jenkins </em>at 226,15 OBR at 365, 473 N.E.2d at 316.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">F</p>\n<p id=\"b275-9\">Keenan complains that the trial court allowed the state to cross-examine D\u2019Ambrosio about his aggravated murder conviction. Actually, the defense elicited that fact on direct. The prosecutor did elicit that D\u2019Ambrosio was on death row, but D\u2019Ambrosio had testified that he had discussed the case with Keenan. The prosecutor was entitled to explore how D\u2019Ambrosio could have done that while \u201cin isolation\u201d on death row. Contrary to Keenan\u2019s claim, D\u2019Ambrosio never testified that <em>Keenan </em>was on death row.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-10\">G</p>\n<p id=\"b275-11\">Keenan argues that the trial judge biased the jury by questioning D\u2019Ambrosio in such a way as to indicate doubt. Keenan accuses the trial judge of \u201cdenigrating\u201d Father Louis O\u2019Reilly, a defense witness, by making comments and asking him certain questions about his background. Keenan never objected to any of these questions or statements. These issues are therefore waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-12\">Keenan further alleges that the trial court, in questioning other defense witnesses, insulted them and otherwise showed his bias against the defense. Keenan\u2019s record citations do not support these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-13\">H</p>\n<p id=\"b275-14\">Although the statement is not made part of the record, Keenan complains that during voir dire, the trial judge referred to one of the prosecutors as a \u201crising star\u201d in the presence of the venire. Keenan did not object, and this trivial pleasantry could hardly be plain error. Similarly, when the judge introduced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>several judges who were visiting the courtroom, Keenan did not object. We see no conceivable impropriety or prejudice in this, and no plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">Keenan claims that the judge misinformed the jury in the guilt-phase instructions. In fact, the judge never said any of the things Keenan attributes to him. He did not say that Keenan was with Klann at the time of Klann\u2019s death. He did not say that Keenan was part of a conspiracy; he merely instructed on conspiracy. He did not say that Keenan was charged with felonious assault; he correctly said that the state.alleged purpose to commit several felonies, including felonious assault, as the \u201cpurpose\u201d element of aggravated burglary. He did not say that Keenan planned to murder Lewis; he said that the state so alleged. He did not tell the jury to ignore Keenan\u2019s alibi; he said that the state did not have to prove the date of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">Espinoza testified that there \u201cmight have been a little light rain, drizzle\u201d when Klann was picked up. On cross, defense counsel asked: \u201cDidn\u2019t you * * * say * * * it was drizzling when you bumped into Anthony?\u201d The judge interjected, \u201cHe said light drizzle.\u201d Keenan did not object, and we find no plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">Keenan claims that the judge' \u201ctold the jury that the Grand Jury had determined prior calculation and design.\u201d What Keenan means is that, during voir dire, the judge read the indictment to the venire. Keenan did not object to this.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">Also during voir dire, the judge explained the concepts of aggravation and mitigation to two veniremen by saying that the state might present evidence that the defendant was a \u201cnasty\u201d or \u201cvicious\u201d person, and the defense might attempt to show that he was \u201ca good person\u201d or \u201ca real nice fellow.\u201d However, the defense did not object. Keenan also accuses the trial court of refusing to discharge two \u201cobviously biased\u201d veniremen for cause. But Keenan expressly declined to challenge either venireman for cause. Both these issues are waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-9\">J</p>\n<p id=\"b276-10\">Keenan claims that the court erroneously excluded a written statement by prosecution witness Nancy Somers. However, Keenan did not present this issue to the court of appeals. Consequently, it is waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-11\">K</p>\n<p id=\"b276-12\">Finally, Keenan complains that by authorizing his execution to be broadcast, the judge biased the jury. But the jury had already rendered its verdicts when the trial judge made his remarks about broadcasting the execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-13\">Keenan\u2019s ninth proposition of law is rejected <em>in toto.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>XIII. PROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">In his tenth proposition of law, Keenan alleges that the prosecutor repeatedly commented during guilt-phase closing argument on his failure to testify. See, generally, <em>Griffin v. California </em>(1965), 380 U.S. 609, 85 S.Ct. 1229, 14 L.Ed.2d 106. However, Keenan objected to none of these statements at trial. Hence, any error is waived unless it is plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">Although Keenan did not testify at trial, the prosecutor stated:'</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">\u201cThe defendant testified in this case through various means. What is the first time he testified? When he was arrested on Tuesday he told Detective Leo Allen * * * on that Friday evening that he was out at a person\u2019s house. That is his first testimony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b277-9\">The prosecutor then said, \u201cThe second time [Keenan] talks to us\u201d was in his letter to Espinoza. Later, the prosecutor said, \u201cHe talks to us through his alibi,\u201d and \u201cThe alibi is the third time the defendant speaks to us * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b277-10\">These could be construed as indirect comments on Keenan\u2019s silence. By repeatedly applying the word \u201ctestimony\u201d to Keenan\u2019s out-of-court statements, the remarks tended to direct the jury\u2019s attention toward Keenan\u2019s refusal to testify <em>in </em>court. While not \u201cmanifestly intended\u201d to reflect on the accused\u2019s silence, these remarks may have been \u201cof-such character\u201d that the jury would have taken them as such. (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State v. Cooper </em>(1977), 52 Ohio St.2d 163, 173, 6 O.O.3d 377, 382, 370 N.E.2d 725, 733, vacated on other grounds (1978), 438 U.S. 911, 98 S.Ct. 3137, 57 L.Ed.2d 1157.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-11\">However, the trial court instructed the jury that Keenan\u2019s failure to testify could not be considered for any purpose. Because of that, the indirect nature of the comments at issue, and the strength of the state\u2019s evidence, the prosecutor\u2019s comments do not clearly appear to be outcome-determinative. We find no plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-12\">Keenan claims the prosecutor made four other comments on his failure to testify.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> However, these comments were even less direct than those addressed above; indeed, it is doubtful whether they could even be construed as comments on Keenan\u2019s failure to testify. Thus, we can say without hesitation that no plain error exists with respect to these comments.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>In the absence of plain error, Keenan\u2019s claims are waived, and he is not entitled to a decision on their merits. On that basis, we overrule Keenan\u2019s tenth proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">Keenan also claims prosecutorial misconduct in his eleventh proposition of law. However, he did not object to any of this alleged misconduct at trial. His claims are waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">In his twelfth proposition of law, Keenan identifies more examples of alleged prosecutorial misconduct. Keenan accuses the prosecution of objecting when his counsel asked for mercy. This assertion is inaccurate. The state\u2019s objections actually went to defense counsel\u2019s statement of personal opinion and evidence outside the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">Keenan also complains because the prosecutor argued to the trial judge that Espinoza\u2019s plea bargain was completed and did not include his testimony in the retrial. Even if this argument is incorrect, we do not see how advancing it constituted misconduct. In any case, it had no effect on the trial. The defense was permitted to cross-examine Espinoza on the plea bargain and to voir dire veniremen on their reaction to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">Keenan argues that the prosecutor improperly cross-examined defense witnesses on whether they had come forward to testify at the first trial. Keenan cites R.C. 2945.82, which provides, \u201cWhen a new trial is * * * awarded on appeal, the accused shall stand for trial upon the indictment or information as though there had been no previous trial thereof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b278-9\">We do not read this as <em>meaning </em>that a previous trial can never be mentioned in any way during a retrial of the same cause. Rather, we think it means simply that there is no requirement for a new indictment or information when a case is remanded for retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-10\">Keenan\u2019s interpretation would bring the statute into potential conflict with Evid.R. 611(B): \u201cCross-examination shall be permitted on all * * * matters affecting credibility.\u201d A witness\u2019s failure to come forward earlier with relevant information certainly affects his credibility. A statute conflicting with a valid procedural rule promulgated by this court is of no force. Section 5(B), Article IV, Ohio Constitution. Thus, Keenan\u2019s interpretation would raise serious questions about the constitutionality of R.C. 2945.82. We decline to adopt such an interpretation when an equally plausible alternative reading of the statute would avoid any constitutional problems. A court is bound to give a statute a constitutional construction, if one is reasonably available, in preference to one that raises serious questions about the statute\u2019s constitutionality. See, <em>e.g., Buchman v. Wayne Trace Local School Dist. Bd. of Edn. </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 260, 269, 652 N.E.2d 952, 960. We therefore reject Keenan\u2019s reading of R.C. 2945.82 and hold that the prosecutor\u2019s questions did not violate it.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>Keenan\u2019s remaining claims under this proposition of law involve questions and statements by the prosecution to which Keenan did not object at trial. These issues are waived, and Keenan\u2019s twelfth proposition of law is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">XIV. INSTRUCTIONAL ISSUES -</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">The trial court instructed that \u201ccomplicity\u201d means, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cthat a person * * * conspired with another to commit an offense.\u201d The court also defined \u201cconspiracy.\u201d In his thirteenth proposition of law, Keenan contends that the court should not have instructed on conspiracy. Because the indictment did not charge conspiracy, Keenan argues, instructing on it altered the charge without notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">Keenan\u2019s claim is meritless. One who \u201c[c]onspire[s] with another to commit [an] offense in violation of [R.C.] 2923.01\u201d is also guilty of complicity under R.C.\u2019 2923.03(A)(3). R.C. 2923.03(F) states, \u201cA charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this section, or <em>in terms of the principal </em>offense.\u201d (Emphasis added.) This provision places defendants on notice that the jury may be given a complicity instruction even though the defendant has been charged as a principal offender. <em>Hill v. Perini </em>(C.A.6, 1986), 788 F.2d 406, 407-408.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">In Keenan\u2019s fourteenth proposition of law, he contends that because the trial court instructed on conspiracy, he should have been sentenced for conspiracy, not aggravated murder. This claim is meritless. Keenan was not prosecuted for the substantive offense of conspiracy, but for aggravated murder. The instructions properly permitted the jury to find him guilty of aggravated murder based on a finding that he conspired to commit aggravated murder, and therefore was complicit in the commission of aggravated murder. Keenan\u2019s fourteenth proposition of law is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-9\">Keenan\u2019s fifteenth through nineteenth, twenty-first, and twenty-third through twenty-sixth propositions of law deal -with instructions to which Keenan did not object at trial. See Crim.R. 30(A). Keenan\u2019s \u201cfailure to object before the jury retire[d] in accordance with the second paragraph of Crim.R. 30(A), absent plain error, constitutes a waiver.\u201d <em>State v. Williford </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 247, 251, 551 N.E.2d 1279, 1283.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-10\">Having closely examined the record, we cannot find that any of these alleged errors were of such a nature that, had they not occurred, the outcome of the trial clearly would have been otherwise. <em>State v. Long. </em>Without inquiring into their merits, therefore, we overrule propositions of law fifteen through nineteen, twenty-one, and twenty-three through twenty-six.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>Similarly, propositions of law twenty-nine, thirty, and thirty-three attack penalty-phase instructions to which the defense made no objection in the trial court. These propositions, too, are waived, and we overrule them.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">XV. INEFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">In his twentieth proposition of law, Keenan claims ineffective assistance of trial counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">Ineffective-assistance claims are evaluated in a two-step process. First, \u201cthe defendant must show that counsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.\u201d <em>Strickland, v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 688, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2064, 80 L.Ed.2d 674, 693. Second, \u201c[t]he defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d Id. at 694, 104 S.Ct. at 2068, 80 L.Ed.2d at 698.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">Keenan argues that his trial counsel should have objected when the prosecutor elicited testimony from Espinoza and Rosell concerning the contents of letters Keenan had sent them. Such an objection would have had merit: under the Best Evidence Rule, Evid.R. 1002, the state should have introduced the actual letters, rather than proving their content by testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-9\">However, defense counsel may well have preferred not to force the state to comply with the Best Evidence Rule. Had the letters been introduced, they would have gone to the jury room during deliberations, along with the other exhibits. Defense counsel could reasonably conclude that Keenan\u2019s letters wo\u00fcld do less damage as testimony \u2014 which would not follow the jurors into the jury room\u2014 than as exhibits, which would be physically present at all times during the jury\u2019s deliberations. Thus, we can find neither deficient performance nor prejudice in defense counsel\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-10\">Keenan further argues that defense counsel should have made a number of other objections to evidence, argument, and instructions. But, as to evidence and argument, many lawyers recognize the wisdom of keeping objections to a minimum. See, <em>e.g., State v. Campbell </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 38, 53, 630 N.E.2d 339, 352. As to the instructions, none of Keenan\u2019s claims is so clearly meritorious that a reasonable attorney would have had to raise it.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-11\">Keenan claims that defense counsel mishandled closing argument by suggesting \u201ca possible homosexual love triangle\u201d among Klann, Lewis, and Espinoza. We agree that there was no evidence of such a relationship, but Keenan\u2019s claim that this argument \u201cinsult[ed]\u201d the jurors is sheer speculation, insufficient to show prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>Keenan claims that his trial counsel did not challenge a certain venireman for cause. This claim is simply false.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">Keenan\u2019s ineffective-assistance claims lack merit. Keenan barely tries even to show deficient performance or resulting prejudice; instead, he makes shotgun claims and accuses his trial counsel, wholly without evidence, of deliberately sabotaging his defense in collusion with the state. Keenan\u2019s twentieth proposition of law is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">XVI. SENTENCING ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">In the penalty phase, the trial judge instructed the jury that its recommendation of death \u201cis not binding upon the Court,\u201d that \u201cthe final decision\u201d rested with the court, and that \u201c[in] the final analysis * * * the Judge will make the [penalty] decision.\u201d In his twenty-eighth proposition of law, Keenan claims that these instructions violated <em>Caldwell v. Mississippi </em>(1985), 472 U.S. 320, 105 S.Ct. 2633, 86 L.Ed.2d 231. However, the instructions were accurate and were not made to induce reliance on the appellate process. Hence, they did not violate Keenan\u2019s constitutional rights. See, <em>e.g., State v. Durr </em>(1991), 58 Ohio St.3d 86, 93, 568 N.E.2d 674, 682; <em>State v. Woodard </em>(1993), 68 Ohio St.3d 70, 77, 623 N.E.2d 75, 80-81.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">In the penalty phase, the trial judge instructed, \u201cYou will be called upon to decide * * * whether or not the defendant in the first place produced evidence as to any of the statutory [mitigating] factors and other non-statutory factors, that is, [whether] the defendant has met his burden of going forward with evidence of any factors in mitigation * *</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">In his thirty-first proposition of law, Keenan claims that the trial judge considered nonstatutory aggravating circumstances in sentencing him to death. The judge stated from the bench \u201cthat this was a vicious killing devoid of any human compassion,\u201d and in the sentencing opinion, he mentioned Keenan\u2019s \u201crefus[al] to take responsibility\u201d for Klann\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-9\">Nevertheless, the opinion gives no indication that the judge weighed these facts as aggravating circumstances. The opinion specifically identifies the single aggravating circumstance pleaded and proved by the state. Consequently, this proposition lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-10\">Although only one aggravating circumstance was charged in the indictment, the trial judge referred several times to \u201caggravating circumstances\u201d in the plural. In his thirty-second proposition of law, Keenan claims that these inaccurate plural references tainted the jury\u2019s recommendation. But he did not object at the time, and these trivial verbal slips do not amount to plain error. Keenan has waived this issue, and his thirty-second proposition of law is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>In his thirty-seventh proposition of law, Keenan argues that kidnapping cannot serve as an aggravating circumstance to support the death penalty for aggravated murder because the General Assembly has prescribed a sentence of fifteen to twenty-five years for kidnapping alone. This is a <em>non sequitur. </em>He also argues that kidnapping cannot serve as both an element of aggravated murder and an aggravating circumstance. We rejected a similar argument in <em>State v. Henderson </em>(1988), 39 Ohio St.3d 24, 528 N.E.2d 1237. Keenan\u2019s thirty-seventh proposition of law is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">In orally pronouncing sentence from the bench, the trial judge stated that he was authorizing \u201cthe warden or authorities in charge of executing this sentence [of death] to permit and allow, if they so desire, representatives of television, radio, and media to be present and have access <em>to broadcast such procedure.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) The trial judge\u2019s statement is the subject of Keenan\u2019s thirty-eighth proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">We agree with Keenan that no statute permits prison authorities to allow the broadcasting of executions.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> However, the trial judge\u2019s statement from the bench regarding broadcasting was not incorporated in the trial court\u2019s journal entries. Consequently, it has no force: a court of record speaks only through its journal. See, <em>e.g., Schenley v. Kauth </em>(1953), 160 Ohio St. 109, 51 O.O. 30, 113 N.E.2d 625, paragraph one of the syllabus. In addition, the judge\u2019s statements were made after the verdict was returned and therefore could not have prejudiced the jury. Keenan\u2019s thirty-eighth proposition of law is therefore overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">In his thirty-ninth proposition of law, Keenan raises various long-discredited arguments against the Ohio death penalty statutes. We summarily reject this proposition. See, generally, <em>State v. Poindexter </em>(1988), 36 Ohio St.3d 1, 520 N.E.2d 568; <em>State v. Spisak </em>(1988), 36 Ohio St.3d 80, 521 N.E.2d 800.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-8\">In his thirty-fourth proposition of law, Keenan claims that, because the felony-murder charged in Count Two was predicated on the kidnapping of Anthony Klann, the trial court should have merged Count Two with the kidnapping count under R.C. 2941.25. However, aggravated murder and kidnapping are not allied offenses of similar import under R.C. 2941.25. See <em>State v. Powell </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 255, 261, 552 N.E.2d 191, 198; <em>State v. Buell </em>(1986), 22 Ohio St.3d 124, 141-142, 22 OBR 203, 218, 489 N.E.2d 795, 810-811; <em>State v. Logan </em>(1979), 60 Ohio St.2d 126, 135, 14 O.O.3d 373, 379, 397 N.E.2d 1345, 1352. A kidnapping can take place without an aggravated murder, and an aggravated murder can take place without a kidnapping. Cf. <em>State v. Henderson </em>(1988), 39 Ohio St.3d 24, 28, 528 N.E.2d 1237, 1242.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>Keenan further claims that sentencing him on both counts imposed multiple punishments for the same offense, and thus constituted double jeopardy. However, because R.C. 2941.25 authorizes the imposition of punishment for both offenses, Keenan\u2019s multiple-punishment double-jeopardy claim fails. See <em>State v. Moss </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St.2d 515, 518-520, 23 O.O.3d 447, 448-450, 433 N.E.2d 181, 184-185.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">Finally, Keenan argues that sentencing him both for kidnapping and for a felony-murder predicated on the same kidnapping is cruel and unusual punishment because it was \u201cdisproportionate\u201d to the gravity of the offenses. See, generally, <em>Harmelin v. Michigan </em>(1991), 501 U.S. 957, 111 S.Ct. 2680, 115 L.Ed.2d 836. This claim is, to put it mildly, unpersuasive. Keenan\u2019s thirty-fourth proposition of law is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">XVII. INDEPENDENT REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">Because this court is upholding Keenan\u2019s convictions on both counts of aggravated murder, and because both counts involve the same victim, the two counts merge for sentencing purposes. See, <em>e.g., State v. Lawson </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 336, 351, 595 N.E.2d 902, 913.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-9\">The sole aggravating circumstance here is that Keenan committed the aggravated murder of Anthony Klann during a kidnapping. The testimony of Espinoza, Russell, and Flanik clearly supports the guilty verdict. Espinoza saw Keenan cut Klann\u2019s throat and also testified that Klann was forced into the truck and confined there. Russell and Flanik corroborated much of Espinoza\u2019s account. Flanik testified that he saw D\u2019Ambrosio holding Klann at knifepoint in the truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-10\">Next, we must independently determine whether the aggravating circumstance outweighs the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-11\">Keenan called his parents and his brother Patrick as witnesses in the penalty phase. They testified that they loved Keenan and could not believe he was guilty. They described the pain that Keenan\u2019s plight was putting their family through. Finally, they begged the jury to spare his life. We think this testimony deserves little weight in mitigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-12\">Keenan made an unsworn statement claiming innocence. He said he was at a party in either Pepper Pike or Strongsville on Friday night, September 23, 1988. During the guilt phase, Detective Allen had testified that Keenan told him he was at Nancy Somers\u2019s house in Pepper Pike that night. Keenan disputed Allen\u2019s version of that conversation: \u201c[M]y actual original statement said one night I was in Pepper Pike, one night in Strongsville and I honestly didn\u2019t know which one was where. Of course, to fit their case the police only put down the Pepper Pike thing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>The mitigation adduced here was weak indeed. We conclude that the aggravating circumstance in this case outweighs the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt. Thus, we find the death penalty to be appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">Finally, this court must determine whether the death sentence here is proportionate to those approved in similar cases. We conclude that it is. We have approved the death penalty in several cases where kidnapping was the only aggravating circumstance present. See, <em>e.g., State v. Brewer </em>(1990), 48 Ohio St.3d 50, 64, 549 N.E.2d 491, 504; <em>State v. Jells </em>(1990), 53 Ohio St.3d 22, 36, 559 N.E.2d 464, 477; <em>State v. Fox </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 183, 195, 631 N.E.2d 124, 134.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">In the case of Keenan\u2019s co-defendant D\u2019Ambrosio, we affirmed the death penalty despite the existence of somewhat stronger mitigation than Keenan presented here. <em>State v. D\u2019Ambrosio </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 141, 652 N.E.2d 710. Unlike Keenan, D\u2019Ambrosio showed that he had no criminal record and a good military record. Moreover, he was younger than Keenan and, although a principal offender, played a lesser role in this crime. Finally, D\u2019Ambrosio introduced evidence that he was a generally nonviolent person for whom this crime was out of character. 73 Ohio St.3d at 145-146, 652 N.E.2d at 715 (majority opinion); see, also, <em>id. </em>at 148, 652 N.E.2d at 716-717 (dissenting opinion). If death is the appropriate penalty for D\u2019Ambrosio, it is surely the appropriate penalty for Keenan as well. Accordingly, we find the death sentence to be proportionate to sentences approved in similar cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">The judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b284-9\">Douglas, Resnick, F.E. Sweeney and Cook, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b284-10\">Moyer, C.J., and Pfeifer, J., concur in part and dissent in part.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b264-11\">. Keenan petitioned the court of appeals for writs of mandamus and prohibition to compel vacatur of the trial court\u2019s disqualification order; the writs were denied, and we affirmed that denial in <em>State ex rel. Keenan v. Calabrese </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 176, 631 N.E.2d 119.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b266-12\">. In a separate motion filed the same day, Keenan did ask the trial court to discharge his appointed counsel, but that request was part of his effort to <em>replace </em>appointed counsel with Mancino and Higgins; at no time did he invoke his <em>Faretta </em>right to represent himself.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b272-13\">. Keenan points out that state\u2019s witness Paul Lewis was not handcuffed, although he was serving a sentence in Indiana at the time of the trial. But Lewis, unlike Espinoza and D\u2019Ambrosio, was not a convicted murderer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b277-13\">. The prosecutor stated that \u201cthere was no contradiction\u201d to Lewis\u2019s testimony that Keenan gave him drugs to settle a debt. See <em>State v. Ferguson </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 160, 163, 5 OBR 380, 383, 450 N.E.2d 265, 268, and paragraph one of the syllabus; <em>Butler v. Rose </em>(C.A.6, 1982), 686 F.2d 1163, 1170-1171 <em>(en banc). </em>The prosecutor asked, \u201cHow do you explain\u201d Keenan\u2019s letters to witnesses and \u201c[W]here was he when his two buddies were arrested?\u201d Finally, the prosecutor said (sarcastically, we take it), \u201c[A]nd of course, when [Keenan] finds out that his good friends are arrested, and they got his truck, he runs down to the Police Department and says, hey, what\u2019s going on here? You got my truck. You got my employees. What happened?\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b282-9\">.

I concur in the holding of the majority that affirms the conviction and sentence of death on count two, aggravated murder, R.C. 2903.01(B) (felony-murder); count three, kidnapping; and count four, aggravated burglary. However, I must respectfully dissent as to the conviction on count one, aggravated murder under R.C. 2903.01(A) (prior calculation and design).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-12\">As this court has observed in several cases, the General Assembly in 1974 reclassified first-degree murder as \u201caggravated murder\u201d and changed the traditional requirement of \u201cdeliberate and premeditated malice\u201d to a more stringent element, \u201cprior calculation and design.\u201d See 134 Ohio Laws, Part II, 1866, 1900, Am.Sub.H.B. No. 511; <em>State v. Cotton </em>(1978), 56 Ohio St.2d 8, 10 O.O.3d 4, 381 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>N.E.2d 190, paragraph one of the syllabus; <em>State v. Taylor </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 15, 19, 676 N.E.2d 82, 88.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">The 1973 Technical Committee Comment to Am.Sub.H.B. No. 511, a Legislative Service Commission summary, clearly states that R.C. 2903.01, which made \u201cprior calculation and design\u201d the requisite element of intent in the crime of aggravated murder, \u201crestates the former crime of premeditated murder so as to embody the classic concept of the planned cold-blooded killing while discarding the notion that only an instant\u2019s prior deliberation is necessary. By judicial interpretation of the former Ohio law, murder could be premeditated even though the fatal plan was conceived and executed on the spur of the moment.\u201d See <em>State v. Taylor </em>at 19, 676 N.E.2d at 88.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">The General Assembly adopted the new requirement of \u201cprior calculation and design\u201d to explicitly supersede court decisions that have held that murder could be deemed premeditated even though the fatal plan was conceived and executed on the spur of the moment. See, <em>e.g., id., State v. Taylor; State v. Stewart </em>(1964), 176 Ohio St. 156, 27 O.O.2d 42, 198 N.E.2d 439; <em>State v. Schaffer </em>(1960), 113 Ohio App. 125, 17 O.O.2d 114, 177 N.E.2d 534. Despite this explicit clarification of legislative intent and the General Assembly\u2019s clear statement on this issue, a majority of this court continues to disregard the policy of the law by extending the application of prior calculation and design beyond the statutory language.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">Construing the testimony in the light most favorable to the prosecution as required under <em>State v. Jenks </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 574 N.E.2d 492, paragraph two of the syllabus, there is still insufficient evidence to find that Keenan killed Klann with prior calculation and design. The state presented no evidence that would lead a reasonable juror to believe that Keenan had calculated, schemed, or planned to kill Klann prior to their arrival at the creek. Unlike Espinoza and D\u2019Ambrosio, Keenan did not take a weapon with him when he and the others went looking for Lewis. Further, Keenan was the only one of the three men who did not strike or threaten Klann with a weapon during the search for Lewis. The fact that Keenan drove around with Klann in the truck, or that he questioned him about Lewis\u2019s whereabouts, or even that he failed to intervene when D\u2019Ambrosio and Espinoza threatened and hit Klann while trying to get information from him, does not prove that Keenan schemed to kill Klann. Keenan\u2019s only demonstrated purpose was to find Lewis. There is no evidence even to suggest that Keenan felt any animosity towards Klann. Further, although Keenan was looking for Lewis, there is not any evidence to suggest that Keenan had intended to kill Lewis if he found him. The testimony of the state\u2019s witnesses indicates that Espinoza, not Keenan, had threatened to kill Lewis and had also been fighting with Klann earlier in the evening.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>Once the men arrived at the creek, Keenan ordered Klann to get out of the truck. Espinoza testified that shortly thereafter, Keenan asked Klann where Lewis was, and at this point he may have had D\u2019Ambrosio\u2019s knife. No evidence suggests that Keenan intended to kill Klann even at this point. Keenan had demonstrated a serious intent to find Lewis, but aside from the frustration of not getting the information he wanted, there was still no indication that he had any animosity toward Klann. No evidence showed that Klann would have been killed if he had been able to tell Keenan where he could find Lewis and, undeniably, no evidence even suggests a \u201cstudied care in planning or analyzing the means of the crime\u201d or a \u201cscheme encompassing\u201d Klann\u2019s death. Technical Committee Comment to Am.Sub.H.B. No. 511 (R.C. 2903.01); <em>State v. Taylor </em>at 19, 676 N.E.2d at 88.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">When Klann did not tell Keenan where Lewis could be found, Keenan cut Klann\u2019s throat. Keenan let Klann wander around for a few moments, and pushed him in the creek. The testimony indicates that Keenan then passed the knife to D\u2019Ambrosio and told him to \u201cfinish him.\u201d D\u2019Ambrosio jumped into the creek and stabbed Klann until he died. This entire chain of events could have taken place in a matter of a couple of minutes and appears to have erupted \u201con the spur of the moment\u201d when Keenan became frustrated because he did not get the information he wanted from Klann. Despite the violent nature.of this crime, the evidence is insufficient to permit a finding that Keenan planned or analyzed with' studied care a scheme \u201cdesigned to implement the calculated decision to kill\u201d Klann and the means of doing so. <em>State v. Cotton </em>at paragraph three of the syllabus. While these facts unquestionably support a finding of an intentional killing, this case falls short of the degree of prior calculation required by Am.Sub.H.B. No. 511 (R.C. 2903.01).</p>\n<judges id=\"b286-6\">Pfeifer, J., concurs in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
