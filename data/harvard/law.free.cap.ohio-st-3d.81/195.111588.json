I respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s decision to reduce the sanction recommended by the board. Respondent called another lawyer\u2019s client, the sort of ethical violation that undermines the function of a \u201ccounselor at law.\u201d EC 7-18 recognizes that \u201c[t]he legal system in its broadest sense functions best when persons in' need of legal advice or assistance are represented by their own counsel.\u201d Respondent\u2019s testimony about his difficulty in contacting Dominic DelBalso (Mary Tilenni\u2019s attorney) could, at most, justify his calling Tilenni to verify that she was represented and to ask that she have her attorney contact respondent. No amount of difficulty in contacting counsel or perceived malfeasance on the part of Tilenni justifies respondent\u2019s engaging her in a discussion of the handling of the estate. Because this is an offense for which there can be no excuses, I would impose the harsher sanction as recommended by the board.</p>\n<judges id=\"b324-10\">Moyer, C.J., concurs in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
