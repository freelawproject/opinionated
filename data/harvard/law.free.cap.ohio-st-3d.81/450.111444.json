In order to dismiss a complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, it must appear beyond doubt that relator can prove no set of facts warranting relief, after all factual allegations of the complaint are presumed true and all reasonable inferences are made in relator\u2019s favor. <em>State ex rel. Findlay Publishing Co. v. Schroeder </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 580, 581, 669 N.E.2d 835, 837.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">Judge Hunter seeks a writ of prohibition to prevent the commission from proceeding with the juvenile court employees\u2019 appeal. Judge Hunter would be entitled to the requested writ of prohibition if she established (1) that the commission is about to exercise judicial or quasi-judicial power, (2) that the exercise of that power is unauthorized by law, and (3) that the denial of the writ will result in injury for which no other adequate remedy exists in the ordinary course of law. <em>Whitehall ex rel. Wolfe v. Ohio Civ. Rights Comm. </em>(1995), 74 Ohio St.3d 120, 121, 656 N.E.2d 684, 686. Judge Hunter alleged and the commission conceded that it is about to exercise quasi-judicial power in hearing the juvenile court employees\u2019 appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">Regarding the remaining requirements for a writ of prohibition, in general, absent a patent and unambiguous lack of jurisdiction, a tribunal having general subject-matter jurisdiction can determine its own jurisdiction, and a party challenging the tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction has an adequate remedy by appeal. See <em>State ex rel. Fraternal Order of Police, Ohio Labor Council, Inc. v. Franklin Cty. Court of Common Pleas </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 287, 289, 667 N.E.2d 929, 931. If, however, the tribunal patently and unambiguously lacks jurisdiction over the matter, prohibition will lie to prevent the unauthorized exercise of jurisdiction. <em>State ex rel. Litty v. Leskovyansky </em>(1996), 77 Ohio St.3d 97, 98, 671 N.E.2d 236, 238.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-9\">The court of appeals determined that Judge Hunter could not establish the second and third requirements for a writ of prohibition because the commission had not yet determined whether it had jurisdiction over the juvenile court employees\u2019 appeal. The court of appeals relied on <em>State ex rel. Cuyahoga Cty. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number><em>Bd. of Commrs. v. State Personnel Bd. of Review </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 73, 74, 537 N.E.2d 212, 214, where we held:</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">\u201cHere, the county alleged that the SPBR was about to exercise unlawful quasi-judicial authority and that this would cause the county irreparable harm. However, because the SPBR may ultimately find that it has no jurisdiction, the county cannot show that it <em>will </em>be injured if a writ of prohibition is denied. Indeed, if the SPBR finds jurisdiction to be absent and dismisses the pertinent cases, the county would not want even to consider an appeal. In this sense, the county\u2019s complaint was \u2018premature,\u2019 and we find that the court of appeals properly dismissed it on this basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">\u201cOur conclusion, makes it unnecessary to decide whether the county will have no adequate remedy at law if the SPBR decides the question of jurisdiction adversely to it. The county asks us to assume how the SPBR will resolve the issue. However, in <em>State, ex rel. B.F. Goodrich, v. Griffin </em>(1979), 59 Ohio St.2d 59, 13 O.O.3d 55, 391 N.E.2d 1018, we refused to make a similar assumption prior to a common pleas court\u2019s ruling on facts relating to its jurisdiction. We find <em>Griffin </em>sufficient authority for us <em>to </em>refuse to make the assumption needed to reach the county\u2019s claim here.\u201d See, also, <em>State ex rel. LTV Steel Co. v. Oryshkewych </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 462, 463, 605 N.E.2d 30, 31; <em>State ex rel. Independence Local School Dist. Bd. of Edn. v. State Emp. Relations Bd. </em>(1991), 62 Ohio St.3d 134, 136, 580 N.E.2d 430, 432.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">Nevertheless, none of the foregoing cases involved a patent and unambiguous lack of jurisdiction. If there is a patent and unambiguous lack of jurisdiction, Judge Hunter\u2019s complaint is not premature. In other words, when a tribunal patently and unambiguously lacks jurisdiction to consider a matter, a writ of prohibition will issue to prevent assumption of jurisdiction regardless of whether the tribunal has ruled on the question of its jurisdiction. <em>State ex rel. Barclays Bank PLC v. Hamilton Cty. Court of Common Pleas </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 536, 541, 660 N.E.2d 458, 462; <em>State ex rel. Rice v. McGrath </em>(1991), 62 Ohio St.3d 70, 71, 577 N.E.2d 1100, 1101; <em>State ex rel. Albright v. Delaware Cty. Court of Common Pleas </em>(1991), 60 Ohio St.3d 40, 41, 572 N.E.2d 1387, 1388; <em>Ohio Dept. of Adm. Serv., Office of Collective Bargaining v. State Emp. Relations Bd. </em>(1990), 54 Ohio St.3d 48, 562 N.E.2d 125, syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-8\">Therefore, the dispositive issue is whether the commission patently and unambiguously lacks jurisdiction over the discharged employees\u2019 appeal. The commission concedes on appeal that if the discharged employees are unclassified or at will, it lacks jurisdiction over their appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b580-9\">\u201cSection 6.04, Article VI, of the Charter and Commission Rule 19 confer jurisdiction on the Commission only over matters of discharge over employees who are in the <em>classified </em>civil service. Commission Rule 9.03(G) defines the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>unclassified service to include <em>\u2018any position designated as unclassified, or at-will, </em>under <em>any </em>federal or <em>state statute, </em>other than the now inapplicable RC [Chapter] 124.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">R.C. 2301.03(I)(2) provides that the Summit County Court of Common Pleas Juvenile Division Judge \u201cshall be, and have the powers and jurisdiction of, the juvenile judge as provided in Chapter 2151. of the Revised Code\u201d and \u201cshall have charge of the employment, assignment,' and supervision of the personnel of the juvenile division.\u201d R.C. 2151.13 provides that juvenile.court judges \u201cmay appoint such bailiffs, probation officers, and other employees as are necessary\u201d and that \u201c[s]uch employees shall serve during the pleasure of the judge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">Under R.C. 2301.03(D(2) and 2151.13, juvenile court employees are at-will employees who are unclassified employees under the commission\u2019s own rules. An unclassified employee is appointed at the discretion of the appointing authority and serves at the pleasure of such authority. See <em>Lee v. Cuyahoga Cty. Court of Common Pleas </em>(1991), 76 Ohio App.3d 620, 622-623, 602 N.E.2d 761, 763 (Court employees who serve at pleasure of court are unclassified employees who have no vested property interest in continued employment.); <em>Peters v. Jackson </em>(1995), 100 Ohio App.3d 302, 311, 653 N.E.2d 1238,1244, quoting <em>Schack v. Geneva Civ. Serv. Comm. </em>(1993), 86 Ohio App.3d 689, 694, 621 N.E.2d 788, 791 (Unclassified employees serve at the pleasure of the appointing power and \u00e1re not entitled to civil service protection.).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">Based on the foregoing, after construing the allegations of Judge Hunter\u2019s complaint most strongly in her favor, it is not beyond doubt that Hunter can prove no set of facts entitling her to the requested extraordinary relief in prohibition. The court of appeals thus erred in concluding otherwise and granting the commission\u2019s Civ.R. 12(B)(6) motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-8\">Normally, reversal of a court of appeals\u2019 erroneous dismissal of a complaint requires a remand for further proceedings. See <em>State ex rel. Rogers v. Brown </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 408, 410-411, 686 N.E.2d 1126, 1128. If the parties, however, are in agreement about the pertinent facts, we can exercise our plenary authority in extraordinary actions and address the merits. <em>State ex rel. Kaylor v. Bruening </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 142, 147, 684 N.E.2d 1228, 1233. Here, based on the commission\u2019s admission that it lacks jurisdiction over the juvenile court employees\u2019 appeal if they are unclassified employees and R.C. 2301.03(I)(2) and 2151.13 and the commission\u2019s own rules providing that they are unclassified employees, the commission patently and unambiguously lacks jurisdiction over the employees\u2019 appeal. Prohibition should therefore issue despite the commission\u2019s failure yet to rule on this jurisdictional issue. <em>State ex rel. Barclays Bank PLC </em>and <em>Ohio Dept. of Adm. Serv., Office of Collective Bargaining.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and issue a writ of prohibition preventing the commission from proceeding with the juvenile court employees\u2019 appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and writ granted.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b582-6\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.

By so holding, we need not consider Judge Hunter\u2019s remaining claimed jurisdictional issues, <em>i.e., </em>the lack of a county council ordinance establishing the commission\u2019s policies, separation of powers, etc.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
