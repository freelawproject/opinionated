Int.Rev.Acts, page 836, which allows a credit for amounts-which cannot be paid out as dividends without violating an express provision of' a written contract executed prior to May 1, 1936. Plaintiff urges that such a restriction on the .payment of dividends is contained in its trust indenture executed in. 1926, in the provision prohibiting the payment of dividends \u201cexcept out of earnings, or surplus accrued from earnings\u201d; that the amount on which the Commissioner assessed the surtax did not constitute \u201cearnings\u201d within the meaning of the indenture ;\u2022 that at the beginning of 1936 plaintiff had. a deficit in \u201csurplus accrued from earnings,\u201d and that its \u201csurplus accrued from earnings\u201d during 1936 did not exceed the-amount of undistributed surtax net income on which it paid the surtax with its-return.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-22\">Defendant contends that the amount in-question was available for distribution as. dividends under'the terms of plaintiff\u2019s indenture and that plaintiff\u2019s surplus available for distribution as dividends was suf-' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>ficient in 1936 to make inapplicable the provisions of Section 26(c) (1) of the Revenue Act of 1936.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-4\">The details of the various transactions underlying the amount in question are set forth in full in the findings and will only be repeated to the extent deemed necessary for an understanding of the issues involved and the arguments of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">Section 26(c) of the Revenue Act of 1936 provides for credits of corporations against undistributed profits in part as follows: \u201c(1) <em>Prohibition on payment of dividends. </em>An amount equal to the excess of the adjusted net income over the aggregate of the amounts which can be distributed within the taxable year as dividends without violating a provision of a written contract executed by the corporation prior to May 1, 1936, which provision expressly deals with the payment of dividends. * * * \u201d 49 Stat. 1664.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">Under a trust indenture executed April 1, 1926, by plaintiff and the National Bank of Commerce in New York, as trustee, plaintiff became obligated for the payment of $75,000,000 of bonds which were outstanding in 1936. Article V, \u201cCertain Covenants of the Company,\u201d Section 10, provided as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b875-7\">The Company covenants and agrees that it will not declare or pay any dividends on its stock except out of earnings or surplus accrued from earnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-8\">In the determination by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue of plaintiff\u2019s income for the year 1936, there was included a \u201cprofit\u201d of $400,283.75 from the sale and exchange of plaintiff\u2019s investments in the American Utilities Company. Plaintiff concedes that, for income tax purposes, this profit was realized, and it is not seeking to recover the income tax nor the excess profits tax assessed and paid thereon. For the purpose of surtax on undistributed profits, Section 14 of the Revenue Act of 1936, 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 14, however, plaintiff insists that the \u201cprofit\u201d on the American Utilities Company transaction was not available for distribution as dividends because of the restriction contained in Section 10 of Article V of the above-mentioned indenture.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-11\">The questions thus presented are, whether the amount in question constitutes \u201cearnings\u201d within the meaning of the indenture, and whether plaintiff had available for distribution in 1936 \u201csurplus accrued from earnings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b875-12\">Plaintiff was a public utility holding company. It was subordinate to and controlled by the Associated Gas and Electric Corporation, another holding company, which held all of plaintiff\u2019s capital stock. Plaintiff was affiliated with a group of companies that were owned by the Associated Gas and Electric Company. Plaintiff\u2019s corporate purpose and principal business was the investment of its funds in the common stock and other securities of public utility companies for the purpose of deriving the benefit of income in the form of dividends and interest from the companies whose securities it owned and held. These investments were the assets which it employed in the normal course of its business to secure its object of profit. It was not engaged in the business of acquiring securities of other companies for the purpose of resale.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-13\">During the years 1931 and 1932 plaintiff acquired a large amount of the bonds and other items of American Utilities Company and its subsidiaries. American Utilities Company was a public utility holding company owning investments in public utility operating companies. The American Utilities Company investments were acquired by plaintiff through plaintiff\u2019s parent company and other associated companies. The cost of these investments to plaintiff was in excess of their cost basis to plaintiff\u2019s parent and affiliates. In 1936 plaintiff acquired additional securities of American Utilities Company through plaintiff\u2019s affiliated companies. In June 1936, the American Utilities Company was dissolved pursuant to a court order. Under the approved dissolution agreement, plaintiff became entitled to receive certain debentures of its parent company. Plaintiff never received these interest bearing debentures, but in lieu thereof, plaintiff acquired open accounts from its subsidiaries and an affili<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>ated company, to which companies the assets of American Utilities Company had been transferred pursuant to an agreement between the parties. The face value of these open accounts which plaintiff received in exchange for its investments in American Utilities Company, and which were stipulated as to fair market value, was in excess of the original cost bases of the American Utilities Company investments to plaintiff\u2019s parent and affiliated companies. For the purposes of this suit, the amount of that excess is stipulated to be $400,283.75. It is this amount which defendant insists is an undistributed profit in plaintiff\u2019s hands in 1936 which plaintiff could have, but did not, distribute as dividends.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-4\">The indenture executed in 1926 by plaintiff and the trustee for the benefit of plaintiff\u2019s bondholders, was clearly a \u201cwritten contract\u201d within the terms of Section 26(c) (1) of the Revenue Act of 1936, and Section 10 of Article V \u201cexpressly deals with the payment of dividends.\u201d It is conceded by the parties' that in order for the profits in question ($400,283.75) to be available for distribution as dividends, they must constitute \u201cearnings\u201d within the meaning of plaintiff\u2019s indenture. It is also conceded that these profits resulted from the sale and exchange of some \u25a0 of plaintiff\u2019s capital assets. It is plaintiff\u2019s position that the term \u201cearnings\u201d as used in the indenture means the excess of the income derived from the company\u2019s business operations over the expenses of operations, and that it does not include any profits realized on the sale or exchange of plaintiff\u2019s capital assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-8\">It is defendant\u2019s contention that the term \u201cearnings\u201d as used in the indenture, includes not only net income from operations, but also any profits realized as a result of capital transactions. Defendant argues that the parties to the indenture must have so intended, because from the time the indenture was entered into in 1926 through 1936, the New York Stock Corporation Law<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> permitted the payment of dividends out of capital gains. Thus defendant urges that the indenture was designed to permit the declaration of dividends from surplus arising from capital gains as. well as from earnings, but defendant seems to concede that the indenture prohibits the declaration of dividends from paid-in surplus and from surplus arising from the upward revaluation of capital assets, even though New York law permits the declaration of dividends from the latter two types of surplus. In further support of its position, defendant states that there is no valid distinction between the terms \u201cearnings\u201d and \u201cprofits\u201d under New York law and that, therefore, the profit in question cannot be excluded from the meaning of the term \u201cearnings\u201d in plaintiff\u2019s indenture.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-9\">It seems to us a somewhat strained interpretation of the language of plaintiff\u2019s indenture to say that in using the simple term \u201cearnings\u201d the parties to the indenture intended to indicate two of the sources (earnings from operations and profit on capital transactions) but not all of the sources from which dividends are payable under New York law, particularly when none of the terms used in the New York law are used in the indenture.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We had supposed that restrictions imposed by state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>corporation law set the minimum standard regarding the payment of dividends applicable to corporations doing business in the state, but that the corporation might, if it saw fit, impose upon itself, by charter, by-laws or contract, more stringent regulations. If the bondholders of plaintiff company had been content with the protection afforded them by the dividend restrictions imposed by New York law, it would not have been necessary to include in the indenture any provision regarding dividends.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> If, as defendant seems to contend, they wished to limit the payment of dividends to payment out of two of the sources mentioned in the New York law, it would have been a simple matter to do so by using the expression \u201csurplus derived from undistributed profits but not from paid-in surplus or capital surplus created by increment in value of capital assets.\u201d Instead, the indenture used the expression \u25a0\u201cearnings and surplus accrued from earnings.\u201d Unless the two expressions are synonymous, we see no reason to suppose that the parties to the trust indenture intended to paraphrase a portion of the New York Corporation Law relating to the payment of dividends.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\"> We do not believe that the expressions are synonymous. The terms \u201csurplus\u201d and \u201cprofits\u201d are both much broader in concept than the term \u201cearnings.\u201d A surplus may result from a number of different circumstances and generally a corporation will keep several surplus accounts. A surplus may be created on the upward revaluation of a capital asset, such as a building. On the company\u2019s books this might be recorded by increasing the book value of the particular asset with a corresponding increase or credit to a capital surplus account. This increase in valuation does not constitute a \u201cprofit\u201d since a profit results only from a completed transaction with an outside party. On the sale or exchange of the same capital asset where more is received by the company than the amount recorded as book value, a profit is realized which may likewise be credited to an earned surplus account.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Neither of the above transactions will clear through the company\u2019s income statement although the latter may be noted therein. Upon the changing of the stated value of a company\u2019s capital stock, a credit would be entered in the capital surplus account; or where a fixed par value is established for capital stock, any sale of such stock at a price above the fixed par value, is credited to the capital surplus account since the excess is regarded as paid-in capital and not profit,</p>\n<p id=\"b877-10\">Earnings are customarily understood as the income from the company\u2019s operations and they are reflected first in the company\u2019s operating or income and expense account which is a periodic account. At the end of each period, the account is closed and the resulting net earnings or loss is credited or charged to an earned surplus account with appropriate identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-11\">\u201cProfit\u201d is a more inclusive term than the term \u201cearnings.\u201d Net earnings realized at the end of an accounting period constitute the company\u2019s profit on its operations. The gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset also is a profit.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-12\">The plaintiff company was a public utility holding company. Its assets consisted largely of investments in the stocks, bonds, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>notes, and open accounts of its own operating subsidiaries. It also held the bond's notes, and open accounts of American Utilities Company and its operating companies. Plaintiff\u2019s earnings were represented -by the interest and dividends received by it from its investments in subsidiary and associated companies. These investments of 'plaintiff company are comparable to the fixed assets, such as land, buildings, and plant, of an industrial company. Upon the sale or exchange of such investments, any resulting gain or profit does not represent \u201cearnings\u201d of the plaintiff company and should not appear in its income and expense account for the period in which the transaction occurred. Such a profit might appear in a summary statement of income made at the end of a period of operations but would be qualified by a notation as to the character of the transaction. Such a profit on the sale or exchange of plaintiff\u2019s investments (assets) might be credited to a capital or to a corporate (earned) surplus account. The accumulations of such profits would not represent a surplus accrued from earnings because such profits themselves were not earnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-4\">In most states, realized surplus of whatever nature is available for distribution as dividends in the absence of some restriction in the corporate charter, by-laws, or in contracts (with preferred stockholders or with bondholders).</p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">Courts have taken great care in distinguishing \u201cnet earnings\u201d from other types of surplus in their interpretations of state laws governing the payment of dividends, and in construing contracts, by-laws and charters containing dividend clauses. In United States v. Riely et al., 4 Cir., 1948, 169 F.2d 542, 543, the court was called upon to interpret a Virginia statute authorizing the payment of dividends by corporations \u201cout of net earnings, or out of its net assets in excess of capital.\u201d For the year in question, the taxpayer-corporation had net earnings but they were not sufficient to restore its capital deficit., No corporate creditors were involved. The court said, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b878-6\">\u201cIf a pure analytical approach be employed, clearly there was here no prohibition of the declaration of dividends. The Statute is couched, not in the terms of a negative prohibition, but rather in the terms of positive authorization. Directors of a corporation are empowered to declare and pay dividends \u2018out of net earnings, or out of its net assets in excess of its capital.\u2019 Manifestly, net earnings (on the one hand) and excess of assets over capital (on the other hand) are utterly and absolutely distinct and separate. Either may exist, or not exist, as to a specified period, with, or without, the other.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b878-7\">\u201cThe words \u2018net earnings\u2019 are followed by a comma; then, before the words \u2018out of its net assets in excess of its capital\u2019 comes the disjunctive conjunction \u2018or\u2019. As the English language is rationally used, this would seem to imply two separate sources of dividends ((1) net earnings; and (2) excess of assets over capital), each with no relation to, no connection with, the other. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b878-8\">\u201cNet earnings are defined in Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary as \u2018Excess of earnings over expenses, sometimes including interest charges, during a given period.\u2019 In Ballentine\u2019s Law Dictionary we find: \u2018The net earnings of a business have been defined as the gross receipts less the expenses of operating the business to earn such receipts.\u2019 States Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (followed by a long citation of sup-, porting cases) : \u2018Net earnings are the excess of the gross earnings over the expenditures defrayed in producing them, and aside from and exclusive of capital laid out in constructing or equipping the works or plant.\u2019 In none of these definitions is any mention made of excess of assets over capital as an inseparable concomitant of, or even as having any relation to, net earnings.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b878-9\">The Circuit Court then cited several cases in which the term \u201cnet earnings\u201d was defined and distinguished from profits of various types and surpluses: Union Pacific Railroad Co. v. United States, 99 U.S. 402, 25 L.Ed. 274; Mobile &amp; Ohio Railroad Co. v. Tennessee, 153 U.S. 486, 14 S.Ct. 968, 38 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>L.Ed. 793; New York, Lake Erie &amp; Western Railroad v. Nickals, 119 U.S. 296, 7 S.Ct. 209, 30 L.Ed. 363. Later in the opinion the court, 169 F.2d at page 545 distinguished the terms \u201cnet profits\u201d and \u201cnet earnings\u201d citing Mengel Co. v. Glenn, D.C., 50 F.Supp. 765, affirmed 6 Cir., 145 F.2d 235, and quoting from Lich v. United States Rubber Co., D.C., 39 F.Supp. 675, as follows: \u201cWhere capital is impaired, annual net earnings, if insufficient to offset the impairment, do not constitute net profits. * * * The term net profits is not synonymous with the term annual net earnings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">In the Riely case, the court goes on to say, 169 F.2d at page 545: \u201cWhile, in Willcuts v. Milton Dairy Co., 275 U.S. 215, 48 S.Ct. 71, 72 L.Ed. 247, the gist of Mr. Justice Sanford\u2019s opinion is clearly indicated, 275 U.S. at page 218, 48 S.Ct. at page 72, * * * where he says: \u2018But it is a prerequisite to the existence of \u201cundivided profits\u201d as well as a \u201csurplus,\u201d that the net assets of the corporation exceed the capital stock.\u2019 Surely neither \u2018undivided profits\u2019 nor \u2018surplus\u2019 is synonymous with the term \u2018net earnings\u2019 used in the Virginia Statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b879-7\">In Agnew et al. v. American Ice Company et al., 2 N.J. 291, 66 A.2d 330, 10 A.L.R.2d 232, the articles of incorporation provided for payment \u201cout of the surplus or net earnings of each fiscal year\u201d of a noncumulative dividend on the preferred stock at a specified rate, before any dividend could be paid on the common stock for that year. It was held that annual net accretions to surplus, not a part of annual net earnings, were not a proper source of dividends on the preferred stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-11\">It has frequently been necessary for the courts to examine carefully into the source of corporate dividends in determining the right to a dividend as between the life beneficiary and the remainderman of a trust. In general, it has been held that dividends paid out of the company\u2019s earnings from operations go to the life beneficiary whereas dividends paid out of capital gains go to the remainderman. See 130 A.L.R., annotations beginning on page 492.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-12\">Although the indenture in the instant suit did not use the term \u201cnet earnings,\u201d its use of the term \u201cearnings\u201d must have meant \u201cnet earnings\u201d since a company does not have any \u201cearnings\u201d unless its income from operations are in excess of its operating expenses for a particular period. We are convinced that plaintiff, by its use of the term \u201cearnings\u201d rather than the term \u201cprofits,\u201d meant the excess of its income from operations over and above operating expenses. That is the meaning usually and normally given to the term by business executives and accountants, particularly in connection with the recording of business transactions, and, as we have shown, it is the meaning understood by the courts and legal text writers in the field of corporate law. The gain here in question, which defendant would tax as undistributed profits, was a gain or profit from the exchange of a capital asset and did not constitute an \u201cearning\u201d of plaintiff company.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b880-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>In its brief, defendant makes a further argument in support of its position, as follows: The payment of a purchase price to its direct or indirect parent company in excess of the actual market value is in effect a distribution without the formal declaration of dividends. Thus, the taxpayer is in no position to complain about the Commissioner\u2019s determination of profit in 1936 and that this profit was available for distribution as dividends, since it had distributed the profits in the guise of excess purchase price.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-4\">This argument appears to void the premises upon which the assessment was made by the Commissioner. If, as the Government argues, the plaintiff effectively distributed its assets to its parent company when these investments were acquired through the medium of an excess purchase price, it could not properly make a further distribution when these investments were later exchanged for book accounts which merely restore the original asset values.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">Since the amount in question does not represent \u201cearnings\u201d of plaintiff company, it was not available for distribution as dividends and plaintiff was entitled to the credit provided for in Section 26(c) (1) of the Revenue Act of 1936.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-6\">Plaintiff advances one further contention. It urges that if the court should accept defendant\u2019s theory that \u201csurplus accrued from earnings\u201d means \u201cearned surplus,\u201d the record shows that plaintiff\u2019s deficit in earned surplus at December 31, 1933, was so large that the gain in question would still leave a large deficit in such earned surplus. It is conceded by plaintiff (for the purposes of this argument) that \u201cearned surplus\u201d would include profit from the sale or exchange of capital assets as well as profits accrued from operations. If we accept defendant\u2019s theory that the profit of $400,283.75 on the sale and exchange of plaintiff\u2019s investments in American Utilities Company should have been credited to plaintiff\u2019s corporate surplus account in 1936 (plaintiff did not maintain an \u201cearned surplus\u201d account but its \u201ccorporate surplus\u201d account was a similar type of account), all of plaintiff\u2019s transactions which were similar in nature to the ones involving American Utilities Company investments, would have to be scrutinized to determine whether or not there was a surplus balance as of December 31, 1935, in plaintiff\u2019s corporate surplus (earned surplus) account.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-8\">Plaintiff\u2019s accounts were not properly stated and its bookkeeping was far from orthodox. Plaintiff\u2019s actual books of account are not in evidence and arguments advanced by both parties regarding the probable state of an earned surplus account, had such an account been actually kept, are hypothetical, and we shall not attempt to resolve them. However, on the basis of the record which is before us, we have found that in 1931 plaintiff had reduced its capital account by the transfer of $30,000,000 to its capital surplus account, and by the end of 1935, its capital surplus balance had been depleted by over $20,000,000 to a balance of $9,741,676. In 1931, plaintiff charged against its capital surplus account, losses of over $10,000,000 upon the sale of its investments in the capital stock of American Utilities Company and Southern Ice Company. Had this loss on investments been charged to plaintiff\u2019s <em>corporate </em>surplus account (earned surplus), there would have resulted a substantial deficit at the end of 1935. We cannot determine the exact amount of that deficit, but it is clear that it was greatly in excess of $400,283.75.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-9\">Judgment will be entered in plaintiff\u2019s favor against defendant for $51,233.39, plus interest at six percent per annum from April 11, 1942, in accordance with Section 804 of the Revenue Act of 1936, Sec. 3771(a) (2) of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 377.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-10\">It is so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>JONES, Chief Judge, and MADDEN, and LITTLETON, Judges, concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b876-5\">.

Trust indentures to secure creditors of a corporation such as the indenture in suit, usually include provisions specifying the conditions under which dividends may be paid as one of the special covenants which would give occasion for declaring a default before there has been a default in the payment of interest or principal. These restrictions are more stringent than those imposed by the applicable state statutes, and will fix, for the life of the indenture, the company\u2019s ability to pay dividends regardless of any change in the state laws, unless, of course, the laws become more restrictive than the covenant in the indenture. See Bogert, Trusts and Trustees, Vol. 2, \u00a7 246, par. 7, p. 788, Vol. 5, \u00a7 1088, Section 5, p. 3279; Ballantine on Corporations (Rev.Ed.1946), p. 497; Fletcher, Cyclopedia Corporations (Per.

As to whether or not a true profit was realized on this transaction in American Utilities Company investments, we do not believe that profits are acquired by the simple expedient of transferring assets from one corporation to another through the control of one common parent corporation, as here. Both the purchase and the sale are controlled by the same board of directors of the head company. Arbitrary values placed upon assets so transferred could readily deplete the true asset values of any one of the group without changing the face value of its book accounts and without the declaration of any dividend by such company. The payment of dividends from profits arising from the exchange of assets within a group of affiliated companies would afford little protection to the bondholders who must look for repayment to the assets of only one member of such group that was committed to pay these bonds. In the chapter on Accounting Statements, Ballantine on Corporations (Rev.Ed.1946) states, at page 548:</p>\n<p id=\"b879-14\">Good accounting practice does not recognize any profit solely on inter-company transactions. Thus if one of the subsidiaries has sold shares or goods to another subsidiary at a price above <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>cost this will show a profit on the books of the seller. But if the securities or goods have not yet been sold to an outsider, the group of corporations as a whole.Ras realized no profit. The goods are still in tbe hands of the group and to show profits on such a transaction would be similar to allowing an individual corporation to show a profit by marking up unsold goods.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b881-5\">WHITAKER, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A8Q\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-6\">Plaintiff was a holding company. Its entire operations consisted of holding and dealing in the stocks of other companies. Its stock -in trade was the stock of other companies. Its income was derived altogether from such activities. Under such circumstances, at least, I think profits derived from a sale of stock in one of its subsidiaries is \u201cearned income.\u201d</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
