On December 30th, 1939, the local governing body \u201crescinded\u201d the consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">On January-13th, 1940, prosecutor made application to the Board of Public Utility Commissioners for \u201capproval\u201d of the consent thus given; and on January 18th ensuing, the borough clerk advised the Utility Board of the rescission of the consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">The Utility Board concluded that, since it had been \u201cformally notified\u201d of the revocation of the consent, it \u201cmust assume that its passage was in accordance with law;\u201d and that the revocation is not a nullity for failure of a hearing on notice to prosecutor, nor for failure of approval by the Utility Board, because \u201cthe statute * * * does not require revocation to be approved by the board until the municipal consent has in fact and in law become a validly approved consent;\u201d and so the rescission was effective, and there was a lack of the statutory prerequisite of municipal consent. This writ was thereupon sued out.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-8\">It is the insistence of prosecutor that, under <em>R. S. </em>1937, 48:4-7, such a consent \u201cin effect\u201d continued \u201cin effect until revoked as therein provided,\u201d and \u201cno such revocation\u201d becomes \u201ceffective until\u201d the Utility Board, \u201cafter hearing, shall approve the same.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b76-9\">The defendants invoke the case of <em>Board of Public Utility Commissioners </em>v. Sheldon, 95 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>408, holding that such consent \u201cis inchoate and ripens into a right only upon the * * * approval\u201d of the Utility Board; and the argument is made that <em>R. S. </em>1937, 48:4-7 refers only to a consent made effective by the approval of the Utility Board, and that until then the municipal governing body has full power to revoke the consent. But the case is controlled in this respect by <em>Hudson County Bus Owners' Association </em>v. <em>Board of Public Utility </em>Commissioners, 6 <em>N. J. Mis. R. </em>1070; 143 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>755. In our view, it is not a distinguishing circumstance that there the attempted withdrawal of the local consent was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>made while the application for its approval was pending before the Utility Board, while the converse of that is the case here. Since that is so, we are not called upon to discuss the statutory interpretations advanced by defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">The judgment is accordingly reversed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
