Both motions were advanced by the appellant on the theory that the testimony for the plaintiffs failed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>to establish that the defendant was guilty of negligence which was the proximate cause of the injury and that the injured plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">TJpon examination of the record, we think both motions were properly denied and that the testimony in the case was such that these issues were correctly left for the jury\u2019s determination. On each question a fact issue was clearly raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">The judgments under review are affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
