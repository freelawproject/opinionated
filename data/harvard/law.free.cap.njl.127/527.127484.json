The issue before us is whether the Essex County Board of Taxation erred in grant<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>ing respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss in part prosecutor\u2019s complaint which sought, pursuant to <em>N. J. S. A. </em>54:3-20, to have included in a personal property assessment for the year 1939, certain intangible personalty allegedly omitted by the assessor.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">On November 28th, 1940, the tax collector of the City of Newark filed his complaint with the Essex County Board of Taxation alleging, generally stated, that respondent was,'on October 1st, 1938, the owner of certain personal property which was wholly omitted from the assessment rolls for the taxing year of 1939. The personal property in question was listed, in a schedule attached to the complaint and by reference made a part thereof as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-5\">\u201cSchedule A.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-6\">Itemized list of specific personal property belonging to Montana Power Company located at 834 Broad Street, Newark, New Jersey, as of October 1st, 1938.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-7\">Investment in associated companies ....... $8,180,554.46</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-8\">Other investments ...................... 69,786.98</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-9\">Sinking funds ....... 55,290.46</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-10\">Cash ................. 1,025,748.56</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-11\">Special deposits ........................ 59,816.67</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-12\">Working funds ......................... 17,669.16</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-13\">Notes receivable ........................ 120,404.60</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-14\">Accounts receivable ..................... 2,159,580.98</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-15\">Subscriptions to capital stock ............

S. A. </em>54:3-20), and that the County Board therefore had no jurisdiction to consider the complaint. The motion prevailed and the Essex County Board of Taxation filed a \u201cdetermination\u201d dismissing the complaint \u201cexcept as to the item of cash,\u201d and directing the parties to offer proofs to justify the making of such further determination as the facts might warrant. The City of Newark sought and obtained a writ of <em>certiorari </em>to review that \u201cdetermination.\u201d Hence the matter is before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\">The statute pursuant to which these proceedings were taken <em>(N. J. S. A. </em>54:3-20) requires that the tax collector <em>specify </em>the property allegedly omitted from the assessment rolls. The purpose is, of course, to apprise the taxpayer of the claims made, in order that he may have an opportunity to prepare his defense, if any he may have, to the proceeding. This court has held, with the approval of the Court of Errors and Appeals, that the taxpayer is entitled to know \u201cwhat precise or specific property\u201d is meant. <em>Milsch </em>v. <em>Township of Riverside, </em>86 <em>N. J. L. </em>603; 92 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>436; <em>Duke Power Co. </em>v. <em>Essex County Board of Taxation, </em>122 <em>N. J. L. </em>589, 591; 7 <em>Atl. Rep. (2d) </em>409; <em>affirmed, </em>124 <em>N. J. L. </em>41; 11 <em>Atl. Rep. (2d) 21. </em>See, also, <em>Duke Power Co. </em>v. <em>Somerset County Board of Taxation, </em>124 N. <em>J. L. </em>481; 12 <em>Atl. Rep. (2d) </em>234; <em>affirmed, </em>125 <em>N. J. L. </em>431; 15 <em>Atl. Rep. (2d) </em>460.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">Without discussing in detail each item of property stated in \u201cSchedule A,\u201d annexed to prosecutor\u2019s complaint, we desire to point out that in our opinion none of these items, except, of course, the item of cash, is properly specified. In no instance, save as to the item of cash, is respondent able to put its finger on any particular item, confident that it is as to that item that prosecutor directs its complaint. The descriptions given are most general not specific. They are characteristic of the descriptions generally appearing in modern skeletonized business statements. Such descriptions fail <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>to satisfy the statutory requirement that the omitted property be specifically stated. <em>N. J. S. A. </em>54:3-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">We have not overlooked the very recent decision by this court in the case of <em>Newark </em>v. <em>Essex County Board of Taxation, </em>127 <em>N. J. L. </em>314; 22 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>(2d) 562, in which it was held that one of the items involved therein, <em>\u201cConsumers </em>Accounts Receivable $47,781.79,\u201d was sufficiently specific and therefore called for a defense. Obviously, reference to this item, both in the headnote to the opinion and in the body of the opinion, as \u201cAccounts Receivable $47,781.79\u201d referred to nothing other than the item which was in issue in that case, namely <em>\u201cConsumers </em>Accounts Receivable $47,781.79.\u201d Thus notwithstanding the various classes of accounts receivable, the taxpayer knew that the precise or specific property meant to be included in the class of omitted property was <em>\u201cConsumers </em>Accounts Receivable.\u201d Not so in the case at bar. Here, the item is \u201cAccounts Receivable $2,159,580.98.\u201d Thus the taxpayer could not tell what class of Accounts Receivable were here meant. It was not properly specified.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">We have examined all other points argued by prosecutor and find them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">The writ is accordingly discharged, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
