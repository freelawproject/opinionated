The jury returned a verdict of \u201cguilty of violation of New Jersey Securities Law <em>R. S. </em>49:1-2, 49:1-4; 49:1-25;\u201d and the challenged judgment was entered thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">There are numerous assignments of error and specifications of causes for reversal. We shall consider only those based upon an instruction to the jury that plainly constitutes reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">The trial judge gave to the jury a <em>verbatim </em>reading of sections 49:1-2, 49:1-3; 49:1-4 and 49:1-25 of the statute. He advised them that plaintiff in error was \u201ccharged with the crime specified within the meaning of the statute to which\u201d' he had \u201cjust referred and the pertinent parts of which\u201d he had \u201cjust read to\u201d them; and, after adverting to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>the evidence and the duty of the jury to determine the facts,' and defining reasonable doubt, he charged as- follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-4\">\u201cIf, however, on considering all the evidence in the case and after deciding where the truth of the matter lies, you find that he has been proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of a violation of the statute, parts of which I read to you and which I will repeat to you again, your verdict should be a verdict of guilty as charged.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">Thereupon, the judge again read section 49:1-4; and he concluded thus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-6\">\u201cNow if this defendant has not been proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of a violation of that statute, then your verdict should simply be a verdict of not guilty. On the other hand, if, as I have said, you are satisfied that he did violate that statute and it has been proven to your satisfaction beyond a reasonable^ doubt, then your verdict will be a verdict of guilty as charged.\u201d <em>&gt;</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">Thus it is that the jury were directed that it was their duty to return a verdict of guilty, if they found that plaintiff in error had committed any of the offenses denominated misdemeanors by the statute; and the verdict, as recorded, is suggestive of such comprehension of the instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">The gist of the offenses so separately laid in the indictment is a willful and fraudulent omission \u201cto disclose\u201d certain alleged material matters of fact relating to the securities sold, <em>i. e., </em>(a) default \u201cin past due interest payments on the issue of securities and bonds then and there sold\u201d to Walz, and their worthlessness, and (b) the existence of \u201ca paramount mortgage lien\u201d on the \u201creal property belonging\u201d to the corporate obligor. By sections 49 :l-4 and 49 :l-25, the use of \u201cany deception, misrepresentation, concealment, suppression, fraud, false pretense\u201d or \u201cfalse promise\u201d is made a misdemeanor; and section 49 :l-2 defines \u201cfraud\u201d as including, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cin addition to the usual construction placed on it and accepted in courts of law and equity,\u201d (a) \u201cAny misrepresentation by word, conduct or in any manner of any material fact, either present or past, and any omission to disclose any such fact;\u201d (b) \u201cAny promise or representation as to the future which is beyond reasonable expectation or is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>unwarranted by existing circumstances;\u201d (d) \u201cGenerally any course of conduct or business which is calculated or put forward with intent to deceive the public or the purchaser of any security as to the nature of any transaction or the value of such security;\u201d and (e) \u201cAny artifice, agreement, device or scheme to obtain money, profit or property by any of the means herein set forth or otherwise prohibited by this chapter.\u201d \u00bb</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">The State adduced evidence tending to show that plaintiff in error induced Walz to exchange certain \u201coil royalties\u201d (purchased by him from plaintiff in error some three years before) for the securities in question, representing that, \u201cby making the exchange,\u201d he (Walz) \u201cwould get\u201d Ms \u201cprincipal back much sooner than if\u201d he \u201cheld on to the oil royalties,\u201d and he \u201cwould also get eight per cent, interest a year;\u201d and it was (and is) the State\u2019s contention that thereby plaintiff in error made \u201cpromises and representations as to the future which were not only beyond reasonable expectation, but entirely unwarranted by the existing circumstances,\u201d and therefore he was guilty of misrepresentation within the intendment of the cited statutory provisions. It is said that, since the indictment averred \u201cmisrepresentation,\u201d the State was justified in \u201ccharging,\u201d as it did, and therefore \u201centitled to prove,\u201d that plaintiff in error \u201cmisrepresented that he, Walz, actually would receive eight per cent, interest on the bonds which he was about to purchase, and that he also would receive his principal much more quickly than by retaining the oil royalties he was to exchange for them,\u201d and so this particular piece of evidence was admissible in proof of \u201ca misrepresentation coupled with an omission to disclose, as charged in the two counts of the indictment.\u201d The further argument is made that, inasmuch as plaintiff in error was found \u201cguilty as charged\u201d (as noted, such is not the language of the verdict), and the indictment \u201ccontained two separate counts, it is apparent that the defendant was found guilty of both, <em>i. e., </em>that the crime was committed in two separate ways.\u201d And the trial judge likewise entertained this view of the issue. In admitting this evidence, he said : \u201cIf it was represented to him [Walz] he would be paid eight <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>per cent, and lie didn\u2019t get his eight per cent., isn\u2019t that for the jury to say whether or not it was false representation?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AX4\">. This conception is at variance with the issue framed, <em>i. e., </em>whether plaintiff in error omitted \u201cto disclose\u201d the \u201cmaterial facts\u201d set out in the indictment. That was the allegation he was called upon to meet. .The particularization rendered the general charge specific; and it was incumbent upon the state to prove the charge as thus laid. <em>Linden Park Blood Horse Association </em>v. <em>State, </em>55 <em>N. J. L. </em>557.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">The verdict is the definitive answer to the jury concerning the matters of fact committed to them for their determination. St<em>ate </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>89 <em>N. J. L. </em>234. And first principles dictate that it be' sufficiently certain and specific to identify the crime and be responsive to the issue raised by the indictment and the plea. If the language employed be such as to engender a reasonable doubt as to whether the accused has been convicted of the offense pleaded in the indictment, the verdict is insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">Thus it is that the judgment under review is tainted with prejudicial error in matter of substance, and must be reversed. We take occasion to reiterate the observation of Mr. Justice Swayze for our court of last resort: \u201cDesirable as it is to punish crime, it is still more important to administer justice according to law; when that is once abandoned, we are adrift without chart or compass.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Levin, </em>92 <em>N. J. L. </em>553.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">The judgment is accordingly reversed, and a <em>venire de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
