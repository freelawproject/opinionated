The assets consisted of cash on deposit in banks.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>The prosecutrix argues that the assessment is contrary to the provisions of statute, <em>N. J. S. A. </em>54:4-3.23, which exempts from taxation cash on hand or on deposit in banks, &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">To avail herself of this exemption it was an indispensable prerequisite for the prosecutrix to have hied a sworn claim of such exemption as provided for in <em>N. J. S. A. </em>54:4-15. <em>Cf. Hardin </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>70 <em>N. J. L. </em>484; affirmed, 71 <em>Id. </em>342; <em>Union Waxed and Parchment Pager Co. </em>v. <em>State Board of Assessors, </em>73 <em>N. J. L. </em>374. This she did not do and for that reason the respondent was right in disallowing the exemption and in affirming the assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">The writ is dismissed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
