Mallcin.</em></attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b356-11\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b356-12\">Heher, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ADq\">Plaintiff was awarded judgment for the value of a coat which defendants undertook to clean and press for a stipulated consideration, including the cost of fire ihsurance coverage; and defendants appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-13\">The agreed ease reveals that defendants \u201cturned the coat over to a cleaning factory\u201d \u2014 a \u201creliable concern in the business of cleaning and dyeing garments\u201d \u2014 \u201cfor the purpose of having it cleaned;\u201d that \u201cwhile the coat was in the custody of the factory, it was destroyed by fire through no fault of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>defendants;\u201d that defendants \u201ccarried a policy of fire insurance on [their] store while the cleaning and dyeing factory carried a policy of insurance on the clothing;\u201d that when plaintiff delivered the coat to defendants, \u201cshe was given a receipt for the same which had printed thereon the words \u2018This garment is insured for loss by fire;\u2019 \u201d and that \u201cshe was to be charged the sum of forty cents of which one cent was to cover the cost of said insurance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">The insistence is that defendants \u201cdid carry the insurance which was promised,\u201d and therefore are not liable for loss of the subject-matter of the bailment. But such is plainly not the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">This was a bailment <em>localio operis faciendi; </em>and defendants\u2019 engagement was to cause the chattel to be insured against loss by fire for the bailor\u2019s benefit until its redelivery to her. That was an integral term of the contract. The parties were at liberty thus to stipulate; and, if the bailees have defaulted in the fulfillment of the promise, they are answerable for the value of the garment. <em>Dale </em>v. <em>See, </em>51 <em>N. J. L. </em>378.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">And there was a failure of performance. It was certainly not evidential of a compliance with the undertaking that the concern to whom the bailees delivered the coat for cleaning \u201ccarried a policy of insurance on the clothing,\u201d presumably that contained in its establishment. The latter\u2019s contractual relations with defendants have not been revealed. There is no showing that the particular article was within the coverage of that policy, and that plaintiff has the status of a creditor-beneficiary entitled to sue Thereon. The insurance bargained for was not supplied, and defendants are liable for the breach.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
