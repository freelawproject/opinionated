Two brothers of prosecutrix have for twelve years conducted an automobile accessories store and service station, and in connection therewith have operated three \u201ccurb\u201d gasoline pumps, on the west side of Broad Avenue, directly opposite her lands. It is said that the proposed \u201cdrive-in\u201d service station on prosecutrix\u2019 lands is to be \u201ca substitute for these curb pumps,\u201d and it is not therefore to be considered \u201ca new and additional gasoline station on Broad Avenue,\u201d but rather as a mere \u201cchange from a \u2018curb station\u2019 to a \u2018drive-in\u2019 station, identical in location in every respect except that it is on the opposite side of Broad Avenue\u201d \u2014 a use that will serve the essential public interest, since it will contribute substantially to the freer movement of traffic and be much less hazardous.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">Prosecutrix\u2019 lands are situate in a district zoned for \u201ctrade or business,\u201d defined as the \u201cselling or dealing in goods, wares and merchandise or property of any kind, either at wholesale or retail,\u201d and kindred uses not here pertinent. There is, however, this specific provision: \u201cOn Broad Avenue, no premises shall be used and no buildings shall be' erected which are arranged, intended, designed or contemplated to be used for a \u2018filling station\u2019 or \u2018gas station.\u2019 \u201d And there is a saving clause covering \u201cnon-conforming\u201d buildings \u201cunder construction or the plans of which have been filed with the inspector of buildings and approved by him within three months prior to the passage\u201d of the ordinance, \u201cprovided the same is completed within six months from the date\u201d thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">The zoning ordinance was enacted on June 27th, 1939. Three days prior thereto, and apparently in anticipation thereof, prosecutrix\u2019 brothers, with her written consent, made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>application to the building inspector for a permit to erect a gasoline service station on the premises in question, and to install three gasoline pumps thereon; and the permits were granted forthwith. There was no construction thereunder, and nothing further was done until May 17th, 1940, when prosecutrix applied to the building inspector for a permit to \u201cbuild a drive-in gasoline service station\u201d on the premises. The application was denied on the ground that it would contravene the cited provision of the zoning ordinance; and thereupon the petition for a variance was addressed to the Board of Adjustment.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">The contention is that a literal enforcement of the ordinance will result in \u201cunnecessary hardship\u201d to prosecutrix, in that \u201cthe effort\u201d of prosecutrix \u201cand her brothers to make this change for the safety and accommodation of the public and of their own customers, and to increase their business, will be frustrated;\u201d that \u201cthere are stores and apartments on the west side of Broad Avenue opposite\u201d prosecutrix\u2019 \u201clot, and it is necessary or at least advisable that these three curb pumps be taken away from that congested location,\u201d and \u201cit is an unnecessary hardship to deny Meyer Brothers\u201d (prosecutrix\u2019 brothers) \u201cthe right to make this improvement;\u201d and that \u201cit is an unnecessary hardship to deny\u201d prosecutrix \u201cthe use of her lot for the purpose for which she apparently bought it and for which it is most suitable.\u201d The further argument is made that, since there are six other gasoline stations \u201cwithin about six hundred feet,\u201d and \u201cso many garages\u201d are located nearby, the plot \u201cis probably better fitted for garage purposes than ior any other purpose for which\u201d prosecutrix \u201cmight seek to use it.\u201d It is also said that \u201csix months is an unreasonably short time for the completion of a station of this sort, under present unsettled business conditions,\u201d and \u201cthere is no apparent reason why a station erected within six months should be permitted while one erected a little later should not be permitted.\u201d We find these points to be without substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">Considerations of safety and general convenience enter largely into the regulation of gasoline service stations; and, unless the denial of such use is indubitably arbitrary, this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>court may not intervene and substitute its judgment for that of the local agency entrusted with the quasi-judicial function of determining such issues. <em>Brandon </em>v. <em>Board of Commissioners of Montclair, </em>124 <em>N. J. L. </em>135; <em>affirmed, </em>125 <em>Id. </em>367; <em>Vogel </em>v. <em>Board of Adjustment, </em>121 <em>Id. </em>236; <em>Schnell </em>v. <em>Township Committee of Ocean Township, </em>120 <em>Id. </em>194; <em>Phillips Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Clifton, </em>120 <em>Id. </em>13; <em>Amon </em>v. <em>City of Rahway, </em>117 <em>Id. </em>589; <em>Essex Investment Co. </em>v. <em>Board of Commissioners, </em>14 <em>N. J. Mis. R. </em>181; <em>Levine </em>v. <em>Board of Adjustment, </em>6 <em>Id. </em>548; <em>Schail </em>v. <em>Senior, </em>97 <em>N. J. L. </em>390. There is a presumption in favor of the validity of the action of the local authority; and the burden is on the landowner to establish by evidence that the denial is arbitrary. <em>Silvester </em>v. <em>Princeton, </em>104 <em>Id. </em>18.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">Here, the landowner did not sustain the <em>onus </em>thus resting upon her. She adduced no evidence before the Board of Adjustment to establish her asserted right to a variation from the terms of the ordinance; and there was therefore no jurisdiction in that tribunal to grant the relief thus sought. The depositions taken after the allowance of the writ herein do not serve prosecutrix in this behalf. <em>Cook </em>v. <em>Board of Adjustment, </em>118 <em>N. J. L. </em>372; <em>Amon </em>v. <em>Rahway, supra; St. Mary\u2019s Church </em>v. <em>Board of Adjustment, </em>14 <em>N. J. Mis. R. </em>288; <em>Shaiman </em>v. <em>Mayor, &amp;c., </em>15 <em>Id. </em>437; <em>Fonda </em>v. <em>O\u2019Donohue, </em>109 <em>N. J. L. </em>584; <em>Schnell </em>v. <em>Township Committee, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">Moreover, in the assignment of reasons to support the claimed variation, prosecutrix evinces a misapprehension of the governing principles. The Board of Adjustment and not the landowner is chargeable with the responsibility of determining whether the statutory prerequisites have been met, and what is required to serve the public need. It is not a good ground for a variance that the non-conforming use will be more profitable or advantageous to the landowner. <em>Brandon </em>v. <em>Board of Commissioners of Montclair, supra; Scaduto </em>v. <em>Bloomfield, </em>127 <em>N. J. L. </em>1. And the evidence adduced in this court furnishes ample support for the finding below that \u201cthere are more than sufficient gasoline stations on Broad Avenue to adequately serve the public need,\u201d and that in other particulars the public interest would not be served by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>the making of this variation. The disapproving action is well-grounded in reasons of public safety, traffic mobility and land use. There is manifestly no merit in the point that the period limited for the exercise of the authority conferred by outstanding permits is unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">The writ is accordingly dismissed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
