He was employed as a gas fitter by the Jersey Central Power and Light Company, prosecutor here and respondent below. On December 2d, 1938, between 11:00 and 11:30 o\u2019clock in the forenoon, while in the course of his employment, he donned a gas mask, and after a fellow workman assisted him in adjusting it, he entered a hole four feet square by three and one-half feet deep for the purpose of catching the .thread of a new fitting on. a gas main. According to the testimony of the fellow employee, the decedent came out of the hole in a minute or a minute and a half after he entered it. When he was about twenty feet from the h'ole, and without removing the mask, the employee testified that decedent\" said, \u201cEverything is all right and the fitting\u00bb is cut straight, too.\u201d Decedent then took off the mask and immediately reeled. He was pronounced dead at 12:50 p. M.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>Respondent, petitioner below, filed a claim petition on January 7th, 1939, in which she stated that the \u201ccause of death was asphyxiation by gas.\u201d Prosecutor answered that \u201cno accident occurred\u201d \u2014 and that death was due to \u201cnatural\u201d and not to \u201ctraumatic causes\u201d which \u201cdid not arise out of decedent\u2019s employment,\u201d that is, he died from heart disease. At the hearings, testimony was introduced by prosecutor to show that a blood clot was found in decedent\u2019s coronary artery during a post mortem autopsy. Prosecutor also introduced testimony to show that a specimen of blood taken from decedent at the autopsy contained less than the ordinary lethal dose of carbon monoxide.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">The Workmen\u2019s Compensation Bureau found that the post mortem autopsy \u201crevealed the presence of a thrombus and that a laboratory analysis of the blood taken from the decedent\u2019s body indicated a presence of carbon monoxide in a quantity too small to have possibly caused the death.\u201d Accordingly, an order was filed on July 12th, 1940, dismissing the claim petition. On appeal to the Monmouth County Court of Common Pleas, Judge Giordano, after reviewing and analyzing the testimony, concluded that the evidence \u201cpreponderates in favor of the conclusion that decedent met his death from carbon monoxide poisoning arising out of and in the course of his employment.\u201d Therefore, the order of the Bureau was reversed and compensation was awarded to respondent. On prosecutor\u2019s application the writ of <em>certiorari </em>was granted. It now becomes our duty to examine the evidence and to determine whether respondent has established, by a preponderance of probabilities, that the employment was one of the controlling causes without which the death would not have happened. <em>Gilbert </em>v. <em>Gilbert Machine Works, Inc., </em>122 <em>N. J. L. </em>533; 6 <em>Atl. Rep. (2d) </em>213; <em>Calicchio </em>v. <em>Jersey City Stock Yards Co., </em>125 <em>N. J. L. </em>112; 14 <em>Atl. Rep. (2d) </em>465. In our consideration of the facts which prosecutor has produced to sustain its defense, by which defense it seeks to avoid liability for a cause for which it is not responsible, we must bear in mind that the burden of proof is upon the prosecutor-employer \u2014 \u201cto show such cause.\u201d <em>Atchinson </em>v. <em>Colgate &amp; Co., </em>3 <em>N. J. Mis. R. </em>451, 452; 128 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>598; <em>affirmed, </em>102 <em>N. J. L. </em>425; 131 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>921. We turn to the proofs.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>1 Dr. Pons, called by prosecutor, and Dr. Eeatherstone, director of prosecutor\u2019s medical department, were both present at the autopsy. Each testified that the clot was an ante mortem one. Dr. Pons, however, on cross-examination, pointed out that a post mortem clot \u201cwould be soft and * * * could be removed very easily without being attached to the blood vessel wall.\u201d He admitted, moreover, that the clot here in question was a \u201cfresh clot,\u201d that it \u201cwas not organized\u201d but was \u201csoft and rubbery and reddish\u201d and was \u201cof very recent origin.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">Although Dr. Hartman, the county physician, testified that the \u201ccause of death was thrombosis of the descending left coronary artery,\u201d he also stated that the clot was a fresh one and that there were \u201cno damaged muscles around where the clot,showed.\u201d His inability to recall his discussion with the \u25a0other doctors and his apparent lack of knowledge of the nature of blood clots \u2014 especially post mortem ones \u2014 tend to render his testimony of little probative value.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">Dr. Morris A. Aaronson, a specialist in X-ray work, was called as a witness by respondent. He testified that approximately ten months prior to decedent\u2019s death he had taken an X-ray of him because of an automobile accident in which the deceased was involved. These X-rays indicated that the heart was apparently normal and that there was no undue sclerosis, callous or calcification. Additionally, he indicated that decedent probably did not die from thrombosis because \u201ccases of coronary thrombosis are long standing progressive conditions, or may -be, and I think just from the X-ray point of view there should be some signs of aortitis or widening of the arch of the aorta or some definite evidence of some kind of widening of the heart musculature, which certainly was not apparent at the time I took these X-rays.\u201d Dr. Pons, called by prosecutor, also testified that the first attack of coronary thrombosis is seldom fatal and that he found no evidence that decedent had suffered from more than this one alleged fatal attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">Dr. McKelvie, called by respondent, testified that he had attended the autopsy, had seen the clot in question and had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>concluded that the death of decedent had not been caused by \u201ccoronary acclusion.\u201d In answer to the question, \u201cDo you know when the clot appeared?\u201d he responded, \u201cNo, none of us knew * * * the only way we would know would be through a laboratory finding.\u201d Prosecutor, although it had the opportunity, did not see fit to make this laboratory finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">The testimony of Dr. Aaronson and Dr. McKelvie, called by respondent, and the statements made by Dr. Pons, called by prosecutor, indicate that the prosecutor has not satisfied its burden of proof of showing, by a preponderance of probabilities, that decedent\u2019s death was caused by an ante mortem thrombosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">Has the respondent, by competent proof, satisfied her burden of establishing, by a preponderance of probabilities, that decedent\u2019s death was caused by gas asphyxiation?</p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">Dr. Boyd, the only attending physician, testified that when he arrived on the scene of the accident the color of decedent\u2019s skin was light pink, <em>i. e., </em>life like and \u201csomewhat active and pink,\u201d which, it is conceded by prosecutor\u2019s doctors, is symptomatic of gas poisoning. Dr. Boyd administered strychnine and adrenalin and the artificial respiration, which had been begun before his arrival, was continued. It was he who pronounced decedent dead 50 minutes after his arrival. Because of \u201cthe history of the man coming out of the excavation and the color he presented, and the odor of the gas coming out of the excavation,\u201d Dr. Boyd concluded that \u201chis death was the result of carbon monoxide poisoning.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b121-9\">The light pink color of the skin, the pink color of the brain, the fiery red color of the blood, muscles and intestines of decedent were admitted to have been present by all the doctors except, perhaps, by Dr. Featherstone and by Dr. Sayre. None of these doctors denied that these signs indicated death by gas asphyxiation. Indeed, prior to the discovery of the clot and the report that a specimen of blood, taken at the autopsy, contained only 5.94% of carbon monoxide, the aforementioned symptoms had led not only Dr. Boyd and Dr. McKelvie, witnesses for the respondent, but also prosecutor\u2019s witnesses, Drs. Edel, Pons and Hartman to conclude that decedent\u2019s death was caused by carbon monoxide.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>True, Dr. Eclel, called by prosecutor, testified that he found only 6.94% of carbon monoxide present in the blood of decedent at the time of the autopsy; and Dr. Gonzales, the chief medical examiner of the City of New York, called by respondent, testified that the \u201cordinary lethal dose of carbon monoxide is considered between 30 and 35% saturation.\u201d It is, however, equally true that the record clearly establishes that decedent\u2019s blood probably did contain a lethal dose of carbon monoxide at the time of his death; but that that concentration had probably been reduced before a sample thereof was taken for chemical analysis. To demonstrate, we turn to the proofs.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">Dr. Edel pointed out that prior to death \u201coxygen will combine with the carbon monoxide and form carbon dioxide\u201d which breaks down the gas and reduces the amount of carbon monoxide very quickly. Likewise, Dr. Gonzales testified that a combination of 95% oxygen and 5% carbon dioxide continually administered in a respirator to a living person would reduce a 35% concentration to less than a 10% concentration in 30 minutes. In the instant case, the evidence is clear that decedent collapsed between 11:00 and 11:30 a. m. ; for 15 or 20 minutes after his collapse, he received artificial respiration and thereafter an inhalator (which supplies both oxygen and carbon dioxide) was applied and the artificial respiration continued until decedent was pronounced dead at 12:50 p. m., by a doctor who had attended him since 12:00 o\u2019clock noon. In addition, Dr. Gonzales testified that \u201cthe cherry red color does not begin, in our observation and the observation of others, till about 20 % concentration, and when there is cherry red color of the blood and the muscles the concentration should be at least more than 20%.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">It would seem clear, therefore, that decedent\u2019s blood, having clearly assumed the cherry red color prior to death, must have contained \u2022 more than 20% of carbon monoxide; and that before a specimen of blood was taken from his body for analysis, the amount of carbon monoxide therein had been substantially reduced during the period that elapsed from the time of his collapse until the time that the attending doctor pronounced him dead \u2014 a period of one and one-fifth hours <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>at least. This, considered in conjunction with the time and place of the collapse and all the other surrounding circumstances, clearly supports the conclusion that decedent did die from gas poisoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">In light of all that has been said, we, therefore, hold that respondent has established, by the preponderance of probabilities, that death resulted from carbon monoxide poisoning, and that prosecutor has failed to satisfy the burden of proving its alleged defense of death from a coronary thrombosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">Accordingly, the judgment appealed from is affirmed, and the writ is dismissed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
