The jury found for the plaintiff; and defendant appeals from the consequent judgment. Error is now predicated on the denial of defendant\u2019s motions for a nonsuit and a directed verdict on grounds presently to be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">The building was erected in 1925 by defendant\u2019s immediate predecessor in title, one Brennan. He devoted one of the two first floor stores to the hardware business, and had the Standard Oil.Company install in the adjacent sidewalk two subsurface gasoline storage tanks and service pumps for the conduct of a filling station. A concrete pavement was then laid; and there is no evidence whatever of a structural defect therein. The equipment remained the property of the Oil. Company; and in 1930, at the instance of Brennan, the Oil Company removed one of the tanks and the attached pump and relaid the pavement at that point. In 1934, this particular business failed; and the Oil Company, again at Brennan\u2019s request, repossessed the second tank and pump and resurfaced the sidewalk as before. Brennan did not himself participate in the work incident to the removal of the chattels. He testified that, after the replacement, he inspected the work and the pavement was \u201clevel as far as\u201d he could \u201cremember.\u201d He did not \u201cremember seeing any holes in it.\u201d And he had forgotten whether the \u201cunlevel condition came about\u201d during his \u201coccupancy of the property.\u201d But evidence was adduced from another witness \u2014 an employee of the operator of a drug business in the abutting store premises \u2014 that from July 15th, 1934, to May 1st, 1940, \u201cthe condition of the sidewalk\u201d was \u201cthe same.\u201d Later in the same year, 1934, Brennan lost the lands through foreclosure of a mortgage lien, and defendant had succeeded to and held the title when the mishap occurred. It was in evidence that the settlement of the pavement was due to a structural deficiency arising from the Oil Company\u2019s omission to provide an adequate base for'the relaid concrete slab after the removal of the second tank and pump \u2014 one that conformed to standard construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>The first point made on the brief is that there was an utter lack of proof that \u201cthe alleged nuisance was caused by any wrongdoing on the part of the defendant or its predecessor in title.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">More specifically, it is said that a stranger to the title, <em>i. </em>e., the Oil Company, was the author of the nuisance, in that the faulty construction was the consequence of its failure \u201cto use cinders or the right quantity thereof;\u201d that the Oil Company \u201cdid not remove the storage tank under the sidewalk at the request\u201d of defendant \u201cafter Brennan went out of business;\u2019'\u2019 that \u201cit had a perfect legal right\u201d to remove the tank; that it was not defendant\u2019s \u201cpredecessor in title;\u201d that \u201cthere is not an iota of proof that a nuisance was actually created that could be seen and recognized when the work of relaying was finished;\u201d and that Brennan did not participate in the creation of the alleged nuisance, nor did he adopt it. The case of <em>Starr </em>v. <em>Adelphia Holding Corp., </em>124 <em>N. J. L. </em>521, is deemed controlling. We do not think so.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">It was fairly deducible from the proofs that the particular equipment was removed by the Oil Company at the instance of the landowner, express or implied. The tanks and pumps were installed under a contract for their mutual benefit and advantage, embodying a provision for their removal and the replacement of the sidewalk by the Oil Company upon the discontinuance of the business. It is the settled rule that he who creates a nuisance in a public highway, or participates in the creation or maintenance thereof, is liable therefor, even though it ensues from work done by an independent contractor. And it follows that there liability for such creation or participation arises where, as here, there is a community of interest and concert of action respecting the matter eventuating in the nuisance. There is, of course, a distinction of substance between such contractor\u2019s mere operative negligence in the performance of the contractual undertaking and negligence productive of a result that constitutes a nuisance. Of this, more hereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">Secondly, it is maintained that the trial judge erred in holding \u201con the motion for direction of verdict that the construction of the sidewalk in question was a nuisance <em>per se</em></p>\n<p id=\"b458-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>More particularly, it is argued that the \u201crelaying of a sidewalk is not of itself a nuisance <em>per se </em>and there is no proof * * * that when\u201d the Oil Company \u201crelaid the sidewalk it was done in a defective and improper manner,\u201d and it was \u201cimmediately and from thenceforth a nuisance;\u201d that, \u201con the contrary, Brennan testified that when the sidewalk was relaid it was relaid level and in a satisfactory manner;\u201d that he (Brennan) \u201cwas not there when the work was done,\u201d and had no means of determining whether the Oil Company had \u201cput cinders under the foundation;\u201d that \u201cwhen the work was done it was either a public nuisance or no nuisance at all,\u201d and there was no proof of nuisance at that time, since \u201cthe testimony is that the walk was laid without holes and in a satisfactory manner;\u201d and that the trial judge erred \u201cwhen he said in effect that that which was not a nuisance <em>per se </em>when constructed may later become a nuisance <em>per se </em>because of alleged improper work and materials when the construction took place, which subsequently caused a change in the work itself.\u201d This point is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">Whether the trial judge, on the motion to direct a verdict, erred in classifying the asserted condition as a nuisance <em>per se </em>rather than <em>per accidens </em>is a matter of no moment. Such classification has reference to the proof and not the remedy. In the former the right to relief is established by proof of the \u201cmere act,\u201d while in the latter proof of \u201cthe act and its consequences\u201d is necessary. <em>Cooley on Torts </em>(4th <em>ed.), </em>\u00a7 405. The essential inquiry is whether there was any evidence of a common nuisance of the character pleaded, attributable to the defendant. Granting that the sidewalk was \u201crelaid level\u201d and \u201cwithout holes,\u201d the work was not done \u201cin a satisfactory manner.\u201d It was structurally faulty, so much so that subsidence to an extent constituting a public hazard was a probability, if not indeed a certainty, in the course of time; and therefore the condition was a nuisance in legal intendment. It resulted from a structural defect and not from the wear and tear of the elements or public use. <em>Rupp </em>v. <em>Burgess, </em>70 <em>N. J. L. </em>7; <em>Braelow </em>v. <em>Klein, </em>100 <em>Id. </em>156; <em>Glass </em>v. <em>American Stores, Inc., </em>110 <em>Id. </em>152; <em>Ford </em>v. <em>Jersey Central Power, &amp;c., Co., </em>111 <em>Id. </em>112; <em>Savarese </em>v. <em>Fleckenstein, </em>111 <em>Id. </em>574; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number><em>affirmed, </em>114 <em>Id. </em>275; <em>Prange </em>v. <em>McLaughlin, </em>115 <em>Id. </em>116; <em>Schwartz </em>v. <em>Howard Savings Institution, </em>117 <em>Id. </em>180; <em>Fasano </em>v. <em>Prudential Insurance Co., </em>117 <em>Id. </em>539; <em>Lindner </em>v. <em>Michel, </em>125 <em>Id. </em>409; <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Fair Oaks Sanatorium, </em>127 <em>Id. </em>255.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">The case of <em>Sarno </em>v. <em>Gulf Refining Co., </em>99 <em>N. J. L. </em>340, cited on this question, is not in point. There, the evidence revealed negligence by an independent contractor in the work of removing a 550-ga,llon gasoline tank from underneath the sidewalk, whereby the gasoline content escaped and flowed along the gutter into a sewer basin and exploded. Negligence was found in the \u201cmanner of operation\u201d of the contractor\u2019s employees, <em>i. e., </em>in their failure to \u201cstop the flow of the fluid, or to impede its unrestricted flow into the sewer,\u201d and the principle applied was that \u201cwhere the owner of lands undertakes to do a work, which in the ordinary mode of doing it is a nuisance, he is liable for any injuries which may result from it to third persons, though the work is done by a contractor exercising an independent employment, and employing his own servants; but when the work is not in itself a nuisance, and the injury results from the negligence of such contractor or his servants in the execution of it, the contractor alone is liable, unless the owner is in default in employing an unskillful or improper person as the contractor,\u201d \u2014 citing <em>Cuff </em>v. <em>Newark and New York Railroad Co., </em>35 <em>Id. </em>17.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">We have no occasion to determine whether a landowner is liable for the continuance of such nuisance created by his predecessor in title, even though he is unaware that the hazardous condition of the sidewalk is due to such structural defect and not to normal wear and tear or the elements, and it is not discoverable by the exercise of reasonable care. <em>Vide Morris Canal and Banking Co. </em>v. <em>Ryerson, </em>27 <em>N. J. L. </em>457; <em>Beavers </em>v. <em>Trimmer &amp; Cole, </em>25 <em>Id. </em>97; <em>Pierson </em>v. <em>Glean, </em>14 <em>Id. </em>36; <em>Fuller </em>v. <em>Andrew, </em>230 <em>Mass. </em>139; 119 <em>N. E. Rep. </em>694; <em>Leahan </em>v. <em>Cochran, </em>178 <em>Mass. </em>566; 60 <em>N. E. Rep. </em>382; <em>Penruddock\u2019s Case, </em>5 <em>Coke </em>100. The point has not been raised by appellant. Such a rule would subject the landowner to liability fox all injuries ensuing from sidewalk defects traceable to negligence in construction as a probable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>hypothesis, although in all seeming the result of normal wear and tear and so not chargeable to the wrongful act of the landowner or his predecessor in title. Compare <em>Schwartz </em>v. <em>Howard Savings </em>Institution, <em>supra. </em>In <em>Braelow </em>v. Klein, supra, for example, the defect was a patent nuisance. As originally constructed, the defendant\u2019s sidewalk \u201cwas approximately three inches above the sidewalk\u201d of the adjoining owner, \u201cand above that of other sidewalks in the block.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AYG\">The judgment is accordingly affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
