S. </em>1937, 43:21-1, <em>et seq., </em>\u201ctips\u201d given directly to the employee by the employer\u2019s patrons are to be considered as a component part of the employee\u2019s \u201cwages,\u201d where the wages to be paid by the employer are established with reference to the <em>quantum, </em>of the \u201ctips\u201d normally received in such employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">The employer here is the operator of the Alexander Hamilton Hotel in the City of Paterson. On March 7th, 1939, it hired the defendant Mathiesen for service as a waiter in the hotel restaurant. The contract of service was reduced to writing. It provided for a \u201cmonthly wage of $33\u201d and \u201ctwo meals a day.\u201d While the writing makes no mention of gratuities, the employer\u2019s manager conceded that the monthly wage was settled thus \u201con the assumption of the hotel that the waiters be allowed to accept tips.\u201d The employee testified that the employer\u2019s head waiter, who negotiated the contract, advised him that \u201cthe job would be good for at least $25 a week in tips and $33 a month wages,\u201d and his meals as well. He was likewise informed, so he said, that he would be obliged to \u201cgive the bus boy 10% of\u201d his \u201ctips.\u201d He was discharged on January 25th, 1940; and he thereupon made application for \u201cbenefits for total unemployment\u201d under <em>R. S. </em>1937, 43 :21-3 and 43 :21-4. It was stipulated that \u201cclaimant\u2019s <em>Exhibits Nos. </em>1 and 2\u201d consist of \u201ctwo small books * * * in which the claimant asserted he kept a day by day record in his own handwriting of tips while he was in the employ of the * * * Hotel, and that entries\u201d therein \u201cindicate that during the claimant\u2019s base year\u201d (1939) \u201che received as tips the sum of $66.15 during the first quarter * * *, the sum of $373.43 * * * during the second quarter * * *, and the sum of $406.35 * * * during the third quarter * *</p>\n<p id=\"b231-9\">The Board of Review found that \u201cboth the employer and the claimant contemplated, at the time of entering into the employer-employee relationship, that the claimant would receive tips;\u201d that \u201cthe expectation of tips was one of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>important inducements which led the claimant to accept the employment;\u201d that the claimant \u201cearned * * * \u25a0 tips\u201d in the stated sums \u201cduring his base year;\u201d that \u201ctips are payments made for personal services;\u201d that here \u201cthe remuneration received by the claimant directly from the employer was so small that the claimant would not have accepted the work had it not been for the possibility of increasing his earnings through the receipt of tips;\u201d that both parties \u201ccontemplated the tips which would be received from customers as a part of the earnings resulting from the employment;\u201d that, \u201cwhile the tips were not paid directly by the employer, they were a part of the remuneration resulting from the employment furnished by\u201d the employer; that the employer \u201cwas able to reduce the amount of remuneration directly payable by it because of the fact that, out of the employment which it provided, the claimant was enabled to receive additional compensation in the form of tips, which compensation was necessary in order to induce the claimant to accept the employment,\u201d and, \u201csince the employer,\u201d under <em>section </em>43:21-7 <em>(d) (2) </em>of the act, \u201cwas liable in the first instance for contributions with respect thereto,\u201d and the parties adjusted \u201cthe wage scale in direct proportion to the amount of tips expected, the tips must be regarded as a part of the remuneration for employment and not as mere gratuities ;\u201d hence, such income is an essential part of the employee\u2019s remuneration upon which the statutory benefits are based.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">This is a misapprehension of the statute. We are enjoined to interpret and apply this enactment in accordance with the expressed legislative will, rather than some supposed unexpressed intention' \u2014 even though, in the view of the interpretative authority, that would be more in consonance with reason and justice. Where the terms employed to declare the legislative purpose are clear and precise, and are not of doubtful meaning, there is no room for construction. The judicial function is to enforce the revealed object as so delimited. It was one of Domat\u2019s rules of interpretation that \u201cLaws ought to be written to the end that the writing may fix the sense of the law, and determine the mind - to conceive a just idea of that which is established by the law, and that it be not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>left free for every one to frame the law as he himself is pleased to understand it.\u201d 1 <em>Cushing\u2019s Ed. </em>108. Of course, the rules laying it down that the intention may be gleaned from other acts in <em>pari materia, </em>and that that which is implied in a statute is as much a part of it as what is expressed, serve only to take cognizance of the disclosed intention of the lawgiver. And legislative enactments should be interpreted according to the natural, obvious and ordinary import of the words used as tokens of intention. When the terms are explicit, they are presumed to express the full intention of the lawmaker. This is a primary canon governing the exposition of a statute. Plain and unambiguous words not rendered dubious by the context cannot be controlled by judicial construction. \u201cLiberal\u201d construction does not connote a disregard of the plain meaning of the language employed to express the legislative object * * * an extension of the boundaries delineated by the terms as commonly used, unless the context clearly discloses a special usage. <em>Fedi </em>v. <em>Ryan, </em>118 <em>N. J. L. </em>516; <em>U. S. Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Hyrne, </em>117 <em>Id. </em>547; <em>Passaic National Bank, &amp;c., Co. </em>v. <em>Eelman, </em>116 <em>Id. </em>279; <em>Public Service Co-ordinated Transport </em>v. <em>State Board of Tax Appeals, </em>115 <em>Id. </em>97; <em>In re Cook\u2019s Estate, </em>118 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>288; <em>Bayonne Textile Corp. </em>v. <em>American Federation of Silk Workers, </em>116 <em>Id. </em>146.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">So viewed, the statute under consideration is not expressive of a legislative purpose to include such gratuities as part of the employee\u2019s remuneration in the calculation of unemployment compensation benefits. The employer\u2019s \u201ccontributions\u201d to the statutory fund are based upon the \u201cwages payable by hpn.\u201d <em>R. S. </em>1937, 43:21-7 <em>(b). </em>And the employee\u2019s \u201ccontributions\u201d thereto are likewise a fixed percentage \u201cof his wages paid by\u201d the \u201cemployer with respect to his employment.\u201d <em>R. S. </em>43 :21-7 <em>(d) </em>(1). The term \u201cwages\u201d is defined as \u201cremuneration payable by employers for employment;\u201d and \u201cremuneration\u201d means \u201call compensation payable for personal services, including commissions and bonuses and the cash value of all compensation payable in any medium other than cash.\u201d <em>R. S. </em>1937, 43:21-19 (o) and 43:21-19 <em>(p). </em>Thus it is that the term \u201cwages\u201d is categorically limited to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>the remuneration \u201cpaid\u201d or \u201cpayable\u201d <em>by the employer </em>to the employee for the latter\u2019s service. And the definition of \u201cremuneration\u201d plainly is confined to such as has been \u201cpaid\u201d or is \u201cpayable\u201d by the employer. It is but fair to presume that, if more were within the intention of the lawmaking body, appropriate language would have been( chosen to give expression to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">The provision of <em>section </em>43:31-7 <em>(d) </em>(3) is not indicative of a more extensive purpose. The phrase \u201cwages * * * from some other employing unit\u201d patently is not embracive of gratuities given to the employer\u2019s servants by the patrons of his restaurant. The definition of the term contained in <em>section </em>43:31-19 <em>(g) </em>resolves any doubt in this regard. The section deals with contributions to the fund; and the particular provision renders the employer liable for the employee\u2019s contributions \u201cin the first instance,\u201d with the right of deduction of such payments \u201cfrom any sums payable\u201d by him to the \u201cother employing unit,\u201d or, \u201cin the absence of such an employing unit, from such individual, in a civil action for debt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">Section 901 of the Federal Social Security Act of <em>1935 (chapter </em>531, 49 <em>U. S. Stat. at L. </em>639; 43 <em>U. S. C. </em>A., \u00a7 1101 <em>(Supp.)) </em>.levies on the employer an excise tax based upon the \u201ctotal wages\u201d of his'servants, defined in section 907 <em>(chapter </em>531, 49 <em>U. S. Stat. at L. </em>643, as amended by <em>chapter </em>680, \u00a7 13 (a). 53 <em>U. S. Stat. at L. </em>1110; 42 <em>U. S. C. A., </em>\u00a7 1107 (Supp.)) as \u201call remuneration for employment including the cash value of all remuneration paid in any medium other than cash;\u201d and the Bureau of Internal Revenue of the Eederal Treasury Department has promulgated regulations excluding from the category of \u201cwages\u201d \u201ctips or gratuities paid directly to an employee by the customer of an employer and not accounted for by the employee to the employer.\u201d Conceding that the Eederal Social Security Act was \u201cdrafted as a pattern upon which the state laws were to be drawn,\u201d defendants nevertheless insist that \u201cinterpretations by federal administrative authorities\u201d of the Eederal act are without \u201cbearing upon the interpretation of the New Jersey law,\u201d and the cited regulation \u201cis not binding or controlling\u201d in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>\u201cadministration of\u201d the state statute. Of course, such interpretation is in no sense conclusive. As stated, we are constrained to effectuate the legislative will as written. Yet it is not wholly without significance, for it has some force, even though far from determinative, as a contemporary construction of like terms in the Federal act. The Federal and State statutes are interrelated to achieve the common object of social security <em>(chapter </em>531, 49 <em>U. S. Stat. at L. </em>626, as amended; 42 <em>U. S. C. A., </em>\u00a7 501-1110 (Supp.)); and if a literal interpretation of these provisions of the former act serve the legislative intention, so also is that the case with the latter enactment. Its language does not reasonably admit of a broader construction. The avowed purpose is, through an excise, to achieve economic and social security and betterment in the exercise of the police power <em>(R. S. </em>1937, 43 :21-2); and it is elementary in the canons of interpretation that such an imposition is not to be extended beyond the clear import of the language by which it is laid. <em>Vide Gould </em>v. <em>Gould, 245 U. S. 151; 38 S. Ct. 53; 62 L. Ed. 211.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">Pointing out that the question is one of novel impression, defendants find an analogy in cases interpreting the workmen\u2019s compensation acts in this country and in England. But they are of no aid, for they depend upon the particular language employed, viewed in the light of the context and the object of the statute. Moreover, our Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act embodies a policy different from most. In defining the term \u201cwages,\u201d it specifically excludes \u201cgratuities received from the employer or others.\u201d <em>R. S. </em>1937, 34:15-37. The absence of this or like phrase from the statute under review is of no significance, for the language there used categorically conveys that meaning, while such is not the case with the cited provision of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, apart from the qualification.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">The judgment of the Board of Review is accordingly reversed, but without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
