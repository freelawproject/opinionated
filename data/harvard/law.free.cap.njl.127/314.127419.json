The complaint was filed pursuant to <em>N. J. S. A. </em>54:3-20, and sought to have omitted property entered on the duplicate pursuant to the statute. The property alleged to be omitted was described as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>\u201cWater \u2014 Eixed capital ............... $161,545.18</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-4\">Cash ........................... 315.09</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-5\">Consumers Accounts Receivable ........ 47,781.74</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-6\">$309,641.01\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">The County Board held that the classification of \u201cCash $315.09\u201d was sufficient. <em>Duke Power Co. </em>v. <em>Somerset County Board, </em>124 <em>N. J. L. </em>481; <em>affirmed, </em>125 <em>Id. </em>431. There seems to be no dispute as to the correctness of this characterization. The item \u201cWater \u2014 Eixed Capital $161,545.18\u201d does not sufficiently specify property. <em>Duke Power Co. </em>v. <em>Essex County Board, &amp;c., </em>122 <em>Id. </em>589; <em>affirmed, </em>124 <em>Id. </em>41.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">Eixed capital may or may not be personalty having a <em>situs </em>in the City of Newark. Our Board of Public Utility Commissioners, pursuant to the statute, have prescribed a uniform system of accounts for our utilities. Capital moans all property devoted to the business. In such classification, land would be included as well as personalty.' Clearly, the taxpayer is entitled to have a specification of what property is intended to be included within the category of omitted property.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-9\">The prosecutor, with respect to the item \u201cAccounts Receivable,\u201d relies upon <em>Duke Power Co. </em>v. <em>Somerset County Board, &amp;c., supra. </em>It was there held that the characterization as to the money item was proper. What was said in that case seems to apply to the item \u201cAccounts Receivable $47,781.74.\u201d The taxpayer and the taxpayer alone knows what is claimed. To list the accounts receivable would require an examination of the taxpayer books. Without that the assessor could not be more specific. \u201cConsumers Accounts Receivable\u201d in the sum of $47,781.74 calls for a defense. Such classification conforms to the requirements of <em>N. J. S. A. </em>54:3-30.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-10\">The judgment under review will be affirmed in part and reversed in part, in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
