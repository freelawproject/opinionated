J. L. </em>73.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-13\">The revenue anticipated for the budget year included $60,000 from the sale of real estate theretofore \u201cacquired\u201d by the municipality \u201cfor unpaid taxes,\u201d and $50,000 for rents from such properties. The Commissioner deleted the first item, but increased the second to $80,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-14\">The propriety of the deletion is the sole question at issue. It is defended as the elimination of an improper \u201citem of miscellaneous revenue,\u201d in that \u201ca true anticipated revenue\u201d of that class \u201cunder the Budget Act is an item which appears <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>for the first time in the budget of a given year, not as an-account receivable arising from the transaction of a previous year, but which arises anew in each annual budget; such as interest and costs on delinquent taxes, franchise and gross receipts taxes, fines and penalties, fees and permits, &amp;c.\u201d Thus, a distinction in this behalf is made between \u201can item which creates a new revenue each year and one which is a recovery of a revenue or an asset which occurred for the first time as such years before.\u201d The former is termed \u201cnew annual revenue\u201d and the latter \u201cthe liquidation or collection of accounts receivable.\u201d It is said that the sales of \u201cforeclosed properties\u201d do not constitute \u201cnew revenues in that particular year, but are recoveries of assets of former years,\u201d and are therefore \u201cnot true anticipated miscellaneous revenues as defined in the budget act.\u201d <em>R. S. </em>1937, 40:2-15, 40:2-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">The question is one of statutory construction. <em>R. S. </em>1937, 40:2-53, as amended by chapter 396 of the Laws of 1939 <em>(Pamph. L., pp. </em>943, 946; <em>N. J. S. A. </em>40:2-53), invests the Commissioner with jurisdiction to \u201cdetermine upon the basis of information and data available whether: a. All estimates of revenue are reasonable, accurate, correctly stated and in accordance with the provisions of this chapter and the regulations of the board.\u201d <em>Section </em>40:2-15 classifies \u201canticipated revenues\u201d as \u201csurplus revenue appropriated;\u201d \u201cmiscellaneous revenues;\u201d \u201creceipts from delinquent taxes\u201d (to the extent permitted by.section 40:2-25, as amended by chapter 7 of the Laws of 1939 <em>[Pamph. L., p. </em>18; <em>N. J. S. A. </em>40:2-25] of this title); \u201camount to be raised by taxes;\u201d and \u201cdedicated revenues.\u201d Section 40:2-16 defines \u201csurplus revenue\u201d to include \u201creceipts from miscellaneous revenues during any fiscal year which are in excess of. the aggregate amount of the classified miscellaneous revenues as stated in the budget of such year.\u201d <em>Section </em>40:2-17, <em>as supplemented by chapter </em>21 <em>of Laws of </em>1939 <em>(Pamph. L., p. </em>33; <em>N. J. S. A. </em>40:2-17) defines \u201cmiscellaneous revenues\u201d as \u201csuch amounts as may reasonably be expected to be realized in cash during the budget year from known and regular sources, or from sources reasonably capable of anticipation, and lawfully applicable to the appropriations made in the budget, other than dedicated reve<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>lines, revenues from taxes to be levied to support the budget, receipts from delinquent taxes, and surplus revenue.\u201d And <em>section </em>40:2-25, <em>as amended, </em>provides that, in the budget of a municipality oil a \u201cfull cash basis\u201d (it seems to be conceded that prosecutor is in this category), there shall be included among the \u201canticipated revenues, under the caption ^receipts from delinquent taxes,\u2019 a proportion of all taxes levied for prior fiscal years, including the lien value of tax titles to real estate standing in the name of the municipality, unpaid and owing to the * * * municipality * * * at the beginning of the budget year, not in excess of the proportion of all such taxes so unpaid and owing at the beginning of the next preceding fiscal year and not subsequently abated, canceled, or remitted, which was collected or realized in cash during such next preceding fiscal year.\u201d In statutory intendment, the holder of the \u201ctax title\u201d is the possessor of the tax sale certificate. <em>R. S. </em>1937, 54:5-60, 54:5-61.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">Thus it is that \u201cmiscellaneous revenues\u201d explicitly comprehend such \u201camounts\u201d as may \u201creasonably be expected to be realized in cash\u201d in the course of the budget year both from \u201cknown and regular sources\u201d and \u201csources reasonably capable of anticipation,\u201d excepting, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201creceipts from delinquent taxes,\u201d which by other sections <em>(R. S. </em>40:2-15, 40:2-25, <em>as amended) </em>embrace the \u201clien value of tax titles\u201d and are classified as \u201canticipated revenue\u201d in proportion to the cash yield from the same source during the preceding fiscal year. Certainly, it was not the legislative design to exclude from this category of reasonably anticipated miscellaneous revenue the moneys which in all likelihood would be realized from sales during the budget year of lands acquired in foreclosure of tax liens. <em>Section </em>40 :2-17, <em>as supplemented, </em>is all inclusive. That category reaches to all \u201csources reasonably capable of anticipation.\u201d There is no discernible reason of policy for the anticipation of payments of delinquent taxes made by or on behalf of the landowner and the converse as to payments effected through foreclosure of the tax lien and sale of the lands. As in the case of delinquent taxes, the anticipation is founded on the experiences of the prior year. It is limited to the \u201camount actually realized in cash from the same source <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>during the next preceding fiscal year,\u201d unless the state auditor \u201cshall determine upon application of the governing body that the facts clearly warrant the expectation that\u201d a greater \u201camount will actually be realized in cash during the budget year.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">Chapter 60 of the Laws of 1934 <em>(Pamph. L., p. </em>163; <em>R. S. App. </em>A:4-19) and chapter 77 of the Laws of 1935, as amended by chapter 241 of the Laws of 1936 <em>(Pamph. L. </em>1935, <em>p. </em>186; <em>Pamph. L. </em>1936, <em>p. </em>745; <em>R. S. </em>1937, 40:1-1) are of no aid in determining the sense of these provisions, constituting as they do a comprehensive legislative scheme for the economic management of our municipalities.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">The Commissioner classifies such revenue as the proceeds of the \u201csale of a physical asset as distinguished from an item which is annually recurring, such as licenses, fines and penalties, fees and permits, franchise and gross receipts taxes, interest penalties on delinquent taxes and similar items\u201d \u2014 in short, as \u201ccapital revenue\u201d not classable as \u201cincome\u201d for the current year \u201cin any accounting practice, commercial or municipal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">But it is \u201crevenue\u201d nevertheless; and the statute does not make the distinction for which the Commissioner cites \u201caccounting practice.\u201d Of course, we are not at liberty to import the principles of accounting into the statute in contravention of its explicit provisions. We are enjoined to interpret and enforce the legislative will as written, and not according to some supposed unexpressed intention. These are not deeme'd \u201ccapital assets\u201d in the usual connotation of the term. Foreclosure is resorted to for the purpose of collecting the tax arrearages; and the lands are not held as a capital asset, but converted into cash as soon as may be. The change of form effected by foreclosure of the delinquent tax lien is without essential significance in the municipal economy. The Commissioner acknowledged that the municipalities \u201ccarry\u201d such '\u201cproperties\u201d in the \u201ccurrent account,\u201d and that he does not require that they be included in the \u201ccapital -account.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">The secretary of the defendant board testified that such revenue is not \u201ccurrent income;\u201d that, \u201cas a matter of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>accounting practices,\u201d it is not classable as \u201cmiscellaneous revenue,\u201d since it is \u201cnot recurring;\u201d and that such classification \u201ccould well result in a dislocation of the financial structure of the municipality.\u201d In illustration, he referred to a shore municipality which has \u201cin foreclosed property an item which approximates fifty per cent, of the total assessed valuations;\u201d and he deduced that, if this item be considered, the \u201canticipation would be ridiculous\u201d and \u201cwould simply invite disaster.\u201d He insisted that a distinction \u201cbetween property which is acquired for public purposes and property which has been acquired not for public purposes\u201d is inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\">This reasoning overlooks the specific requirement of reasonableness, and likewise the provision of <em>section </em>40:2-53, <em>as </em>amended, charging the Commissioner generally with the duty of determining \u201cupon the basis of information and data available\u201d whether \u201cAll estimates of revenue are reasonable\u201d in the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">Since the Commissioner and the defendant Board were not guided by the correct principle in the exercise of their respective statutory functions, the judgment is reversed, without costs; and the cause is remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
