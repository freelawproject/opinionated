Penney suffered a fatal injury by an accident which arose out of and in the course of his employment with the defendant corporation; and the question at issue is whether his widow, Theresa, a mental defective who was then and for years had been an inmate of institutions for the insane at public expense, was a dependent within the intendment of <em>R. S. </em>1937, 34:15-13.</p>\n<p id=\"AUv\">This is a mixed question of law and fact. And these are the essential facts: On May 3d, 1922, Theresa was committed to the State Hospital for the Insane at Morris Plains by the judge of the Eirst Criminal Court of Jersey City, pending an inquiry into her sanity; and on November 16th, 1923, while still under such restraint, she was adjudged insane and indigent in the Hudson Court of Common Pleas and ordered confined in that institution at the expense of the state. The decedent made affidavit that he was without means to meet maintenance charges. Until so committed, Theresa <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>had been a member of the decedent\u2019s household during the whole of their marital life. Three children were born of the marriage, all of whom were above the age of sixteen years at the time of the father\u2019s death. After incarceration for \u201ca short while,\u201d Mrs. Penney was released. She thereupon returned to the decedent\u2019s household, and remained there until March 18th, 1927, when she was again adjudged insane and indigent by a judge of the Hudson Court of Common Pleas, and committed to the Hudson County Hospital for the Insane, \u201cat the expense of the County of Hudson,\u201d subject to reimbursement \u201cby James Penney at the rate of $3.78 per week, exclusive of proper and necessary charges for the clothing of said patient.\u201d On August 26th, 1927, a further order was made by a judge of that court, adjudging Mrs. Penney insane and indigent, and recommitting her to the last-named institution, \u201cat the expense\u201d of the county, minus a provision for reimbursement. The decedent had paid but $20 or thereabouts under the first commitment to the county hospital. Prom time to time his wife visited the family home for varying periods, depending upon her mental condition, until 1931, when her derangement became such that she was not thereafter permitted to leave the institution. The decedent made no contribution toward his wife\u2019s maintenance except as stated and items of wearing apparel furnished by him on occasion. Most of her clothing was provided at public expense. The order directing her confinement at the expense of the county seems to have been predicated upon her husband\u2019s asserted lack of means to defray maintenance costs. It is now made to appear that he had been regularly employed for some years before his death. His services to the defendant-employer were compensated at the rate of $45 per week.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">The case is ruled by <em>Comparri </em>v. <em>James Readding, Inc., </em>120 <em>N. J. L. </em>168; <em>Alexander </em>v. <em>Cunningham Roofing Co., Inc., </em>124 <em>Id. </em>390; <em>affirmed, </em>125 <em>Id. </em>277, and <em>Koerner </em>v. <em>J. I. Hass Co., Inc., </em>126 <em>Id. </em>193.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">The employer perceives a distinction between the instant case and those cited, in that here the deceased \u201chad been relieved of all dependency and all responsibility for the maintenance\u201d of his wife \u201cby the order of the court, in committing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>her * * * at the expense\u201d of the county. But there is none in principle. The cited cases have laid it down that dependency in statutory intendment has reference to the duty imposed upon the husband by the law \u201cof fully and wholly maintaining\u201d his wife, and that it \u201cis not governed in the slightest degree by the amount of money actually contributed to or expended upon\u201d the wife, since the husband\u2019s failure of duty in this regard \u201cdid not render\u201d the wife \u201cany less dependent.\u201d If there is a separation through the \u201cfault\u201d of the wife, or she consents or acquiesces therein or asserts her \u201ccomplete independence of her husband,\u201d there is a cessation of dependency in the legal sense. We are not at liberty to interpret the statute differently. The adjudications of other jurisdictions interpreting statutory dependency clauses are of no avail.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">And the deceased was not relieved of the obligation of maintenance by the order adverted to. It is not a differentiating circumstance that thereby the court \u201cplaced the entire burden\u201d of support upon the county, with no provision for reimbursement by the deceased. The latter\u2019s liability for such institutional care and maintenance of his wife remained unimpaired. <em>R. S. </em>1937, 30:4-66; 30:4-70; 30:4-71; 30:4-74. <em>Vide Warren County </em>v. Harden, 95 <em>N. J. L. </em>122. The husband\u2019s obligation in such circumstances is still primary; the county\u2019s, secondary.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">Thus it is that, at the time of the employee\u2019s death, his wife was \u201cwholly dependent\u201d upon him within the meaning of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">The judgment is accordingly reversed, with costs; and the cause is remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
