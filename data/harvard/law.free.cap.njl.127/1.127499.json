The transcript of the proceedings of the Board of Adjustment reveals no basis whatever for the conclusion of \u201cunnecessary hardship.\u201d Only the defendant Conte gave evidence in support of the application; and his testimony was confined to these matters: The period of his ownership \u2014 eight months; the character of the dwellings in \u201cthe <em>neighborhood\u201d </em>\u2014 i. <em>e., </em>\u201cone- and two-family houses;\u201d and an \u201cexplanation\u201d of \u201cthe type of business he intended to use the stores for.\u201d The board\u2019s approving resolution recites that, in addition to receiving the testimony of this witness, \u201call of the members * * * inspected the site of the proposed stores and considered the plans;\u201d and the determination was rested upon these grounds: \u201cImmediately adjoining the premises and also on the southwest corner of North Fifteenth Street and First Avenue there are already erected several stores which were permitted after the area was zoned for residential purposes; * * * the location of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>proposed stores is not solely suitable for residential purposes, especially in view of the already existing stores adjoining the plot, and to enforce the strict letter of the ordinance will, under existing conditions, work an unnecessary hardship; * * * substantial justice will be done by granting the application;\u201d and \u201cit will not be contrary to public interest\u201d but \u201cwill be in harmony with the general purpose of the zoning ordinance to make the exception applied for.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">In the making of a variance under <em>R. S. 1937, </em>40:55-39, it is a jurisdictional <em>sine qua non </em>that, due to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the ordinance would result in \u201cunnecessary hardship.\u201d The essential inquiry is whether in the circumstances the specific application of the general regulation would constitute an unnecessary and unjust invasion of the fundamental right of property. The statutory provision for relief against \u201cunnecessary hardship\u201d thus ensuing was designed to permit of the reasonable use of the particular property, and thus to guard against an unwarranted interference with the right of private property, <em>i. e., </em>to secure reasonable zoning. This is a quasi-judicial function in essence discretionary, controlled by the policy of the statute and of the ordinance so far as is consistent therewith. And there must be a finding of such jurisdictional prerequisite substantially grounded in competent evidence. The criterion of \u201cunnecessary hardship\u201d is whether the use restriction, viewing the property in the setting of its environment, is so unreasonable as to constitute an arbitrary and capricious interference with the basic right of private property. Is the environment such that the lot is not reasonably adapted to a conforming use? It is not <em>per se </em>a sufficient reason for a variation that the nonconforming use is more profitable to the landowner. <em>Brandon </em>v. <em>Board of Commissioners of Montclair, </em>124 <em>N. J. L. </em>135; <em>affirmed, </em>125 <em>Id. </em>367.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">So appraised, the judgment here is untenable. The evidence does not afford a rational basis for the finding of \u201cunnecessary hardship\u201d within the intendment of the statute; <em>e contra, </em>it was found that the land is \u201cnot <em>solely </em>suitable\u201d for residential purposes, \u201cespecially in view\u201d of the stores on the adjacent lands. There is in that circumstance no ground for a variation; quite the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>We are not to indulge the presumption that sufficient reason for the exception was revealed by the board\u2019s inspection of the <em>locus. </em>First, as said, it was rested upon an affirmative finding palpably insufficient; and, secondly, there was no disclosure in the findings of knowledge derived from the view to warrant the variance as consonant with the statutory design. Moreover, the true purpose of an inspection ordinarily is the better to apprehend, appraise and apply the evidence adduced from the witnesses. Of course, where the inquiry is as to a physical fact definitely ascertainable by a view without more, a mere inspection generally suffices. Compare <em>G. H. Heublein, Inc., </em>v. <em>Second National Bank, </em>115 <em>Conn. </em>168; 160 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>898. If the finding of \u201cunnecessary hardship\u201d be permitted to rest upon the undisclosed matters found on the view, the parties in interest would be denied the essence of a hearing, for they would be kept in ignorance of the things deemed controlling by the board. Only by disclosure may the rights of the parties be protected both in the trial tribunal and on review.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">It is plainly not a sufficient ground for a mere exception that there are \u201cseveral stores\u201d in the vicinity, \u201cpermitted after the area was zoned for residential purposes.\u201d If that were so, one variation would sustain if it did not compel others, and thus the general regulation would eventually be nullified. <em>Berry </em>v. <em>Recorder\u2019s Court of West Orange, </em>124 <em>N. J. L. </em>385; <em>affirmed, </em>125 <em>Id. </em>273. There is no contention that, as respects prosecutors\u2019 lands, the general regulation is, by reason of the previously granted variances, or otherwise, arbitrary or unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">In the circumstances, there is no occasion to consider the point made as to the sufficiency of the notice of the hearing before the Board of Adjustment.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">The resolutions are accordingly vacated, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
