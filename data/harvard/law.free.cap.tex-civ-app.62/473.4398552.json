Lumber &amp; Milling Company, answered by general demurrer, special exception, and general denial, and specially denied that either defendant in error, Eastwood, or his assignors, did any work upon the property described in defendant in error Eastwood\u2019s original petition in the court below, and specially alleged that the plaintiff Eastwood and his assignors' worked only for the defendants, Terrell &amp; Kayser; that said work was of the nature only of cutting and sawing logs and timber, and was not such work as under the Constitution and laws of the State of Texas gave the plaintiff or his assignors a lien upon the property of plaintiff in error. Plaintiff in error further specially pleaded that all of the property described in defendant in error Eastwood\u2019s petition, upon which he sought to' foreclose a lien, is and was the property of plaintiff in error, and never was the property of defendants, Terrell &amp; Kayser, but same was leased by the plaintiff in error to defendants Terrell &amp; Kayser.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">The trial in the court below without a jury resulted in a judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>in favor of the plaintiff for the full amount of his claim against the defendants, Terrell \u2022&amp;' Kayser, and for foreclosure of the lien claimed by plaintiff. The decree further directed that execution should first issue against Terrell &amp; Kayser and, if plaintiff was unable to make the amount of his judgment by such execution, that an order of sale of the property described in the petition, or so much thereof as might be required to satisfy plaintiff\u2019s judgment, should issue, and if said property, or a sufficient amount thereof to satisfy plaintiff\u2019s judgment, should not be found, execution should issue against plaintiff in error.

Wiliams; and Walter Brown, which affidavit was made by Chas. Harvey; the question of the validity or invalidity of the claims of the character of the ones in controversy being made by an agent or representative of the laborer, to be submitted to the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">\u201cThat all of the logs cut, hauled and delivered by the several laborers, as aforesaid, aggregating about three hundred thousand feet, were delivered to said Bush Bros. Lumber &amp; Milling Company at Minnock Switch on the said I. &amp; G. H. R.

L. Kayser.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">\u201cThat on March 12, 1908, the defendant, Bush Bros. Lumber &amp; Milling Company, entered into a contract with the defendant A. L. Kayser by which the defendant A. L. Kayser was to cut saw-logs from timber owned by Bush Bros. Lumber <em>&amp; </em>Milling Company on the Richard Vince half league of land in Montgomery County, Texas, and deliver the same on the cars of the T. <em>&amp; </em>G. K. R. R. at Minnock Switch for three dollars and fifty cents per thousand, said logs to be scaled at the mill of the defendant\u201d company. At the same time Bush Bros. Lumber &amp; Milling Company agreed to furnish and lend to defendant Kayser an engine, logging cars, railroad iron, fish plates, etc., with which to build a tram road on which to operate said engine and logging cars for the purpose of transporting the logs from the woods to said railroad at Minnock Switch in order that said logs might be loaded on the cars of the I. <em>&amp; </em>G. N.. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>B. B. and shipped to the defendant Bush Bros. Lumber &amp; Milling Company. Said engine, logging cars, iron and steel rails, etc., being the same that the plaintiff is endeavoring to foreclose a lien on in this suit. That the defendant, Bush Bros. Lumber &amp; Milling Company, did deliver said engine, logging cars, iron and steel rails, etc., to defendant A. L. Kayser and he constructed a tram road upon which to operate said engine and logging cars, and did operate the same in hauling logs thereon until after the performance by plaintiff and his assignors of the labor and services sued for herein, since which time the defendant Bush Bros. Lumber &amp; Milling Company have retaken possession of said engine, cars, logging cars, iron and steel rails, etc., and are now in possession of same.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\">Under an appropriate assignment of error plaintiff in error complains of the judgment of the court below on the ground that upon the facts disclosed by the record defendant in error had no lien upon the property of plaintiff in error to secure the indebtedness due him.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">Article 3339a of Sayles\u2019 Civil Statutes, upon which defendant in error bases his claim of lien and which is section 1 of chapter 151 of General Laws of 1897, reads as follows: \u201cWhenever any clerk, accountant, bookkeeper, artisan, craftsman, factory operative, mill operative, mechanic, quarryman or common laborer, farm hand, male or female, may labor or perform any service in any office, store, saloon, hotel, shop, mine, quarry, manufactory or mill of any character, or upon any farm, under or by virtue of any contract or agreement, written or verbal, with any person, employer, firm, corporation, or his, her or their agent or agents, receiver or receivers, trustee or trustees, in order to secure the amount due by such contract or agreement, written or verbal, the hereinbefore mentioned employees shall have a first lien upon all products, machinery, tools, fixtures, appurtenances, goods, wares, merchandise, chattels or thing or things of value of whatsoever character that may b\u00e9 created in whole or in part by the labor of such persons, or necessarily connected with the performance of such labor or service, which may be owned by or in the possession of the aforesaid employer, person, firm or corporation, or his, her or their agent or agents, receiver or receivers, trustee or trustees; provided, that the lien herein given a farm hand shall be subordinate to the landlord\u2019s lien now provided by law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">In order to fix a lien under the provisions of this statute it must be shown that the person claiming such lien is within the class named in the statute, and that the labor or services performed by such person was performed under the conditions named in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">It may be conceded that the defendant in error and his several assignors are within the class named in the statute, but unless it can be held that the labor or services performed by them was performed under the conditions named in the statute they acquired no lien to secure the amount die them for such labor.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">The statute only gives a lien to the class of persons named therein who \u201cmay labor or perform service in any office, store, saloon, hotel, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>shop, mine, quarry, manufactory or mill of any character, or upon any farm, etc.\u201d While this statute should not be so strictly construed as to defeat the manifest intent of the Legislature, it should not be construed so as to give a lien for services not included in those named in the Act merely because such services are apparently as much entitled to protection as those named. We think the term \u201cin any manufactory or mill of any character\u201d should be construed to mean in or about any such place, and the laborer performing services at a mill and in immediate connection with its operation would have a lien for such services if performed outside of the buildings in which the machinery of the mill is operated, or the actual business of the mill carried on, but we do not think that the lien is given when the services for which the lien is claimed are wholly performed at a place miles distant from the mill and have no immediate connection with the actual operation of the mill, though they may be in furtherance of the business of the mill. In the instant case the defendant in error and his assignors were not working for the owner of the mill, and their services were performed in a different county and many miles distant from the mill, and we think it would be judicial legislation for the courts to say that they are entitled to a lien which the statute only gives to secure compensation for services performed \u201cin a mill.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">If the contention of the defendant in error is sound, then one who labors in picking cotton belonging to the owner of a cotton gin or factory, such labor being performed on a farm distant from the cotton gin or mill, would be given a lien under this statute for labor performed \u201cin the mill,\u201d because the cotton so picked was intended for manufactory in said cotton mill and was so used. The statute can not be so construed.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">There may be no sound reason for giving a lien to those* who work in the mill and denying it to persons who perform services at some other place for the' benefit of and in furtherance of the business of the mill, but the law is so written and it is for the Legislature and not for the courts to correct this inequality, if it be one.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">Such being our conclusion on this question it is unnecessary to discuss the other assignments of error presented in brief of plaintiff in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">We are of opinion that the judgment of the court below should be reversed and judgment here rendered for plaintiff in error, and it is so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">\n<em>Reversed cmd rendered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
