The Court refused to admit the proof, and the defendant excepted to the decision of the Court.

Ev. 586 ; 3 T. R. 418 ; Chit. on Cont. 81, 222; 2 Saund. on Plead. and Ev, 527, 528. A written instrument may be impeached by extrinsic evidence, on the ground of fraud, even in the case of a record, 3 Stark. Ev. 995, 1015. Parol evidence is admissible to defeat a written instrument, on the ground of fraud, mistake, &amp;c. 3 Stark. Ev. 995. Fraud may be proved by parol evidence, or any circumstances, however contrary to apparent facts or statements, in the written instrument. 2 Saund. on Plead, and Ev. Fraud is an extrinsic collateral act, which vitiates all transactions, even the most solemn proceedings of courts of justice. Lord Coke says, it avoids all judicial acts, ecclesiastical or temporal. 2 Stark. Ev., Fraud 340, et seq. and notes. Where fraud depends on the real intention of the parties, that intention is a question of fact for - the jury. 2 Stark. Ev. 358 and notes. Where the fraud can be clearly established, courts of law exercise a concurrent jurisdiction with courts of equity ; and will relieve, by malting void the instrument obtained by such corrupt agreement or fraud. 1 Tomlin\u2019s Diet. 840, Fraud, referring to 1 Burr. 396; Wood\u2019s Just. 296. Every kind of fraud is equally cognizable and adverted to in a court of law; [as it is in a court of equity ;] and some frauds are cognizable only there, as fraud in obtaining a devise of lands, which is always sent out of the equity courts, to be there determined. 3 Blac.

They relied on 4 Peters\u2019 Cond.

Numerous errors are assigned, predicated on the exclusion of various matters, offered to be given in evidence by the defendant, on the trial. That embraced in the thirteenth assignment will alone be considered ; as it is clear from the character of the proof excluded, the decision by which such proof was excluded is erroneous.</p> <p id=\"b130-8\" pgmap=\"130\">It appears, that the evidence offered was tendered with the expressed design of impeaching the preemption granted, on the ground of fraud. The testimony offered and rejected, was, that the preemption, under which the lessor of the plaintiff claimed to have entered and purchased the premises in question, was obtained by the said lessor, by fraud and collusion, between him and the land officers who allowed such preemption.</p> <p id=\"b131-4\" pgmap=\"131\">The single proposition then, arising out of the evidence offered and excluded, is, whether the certificate of purchase and sale, by preemption, of a tract of land of the United States, can be impeached on the ground of fraud, in its obtention, between the preemptor and the officers granting it. Fraud, it is said, vitiates all acts, as between the parties to it; nor can there be a doubt, that fraud is cognizable in a court of law, as well as equity. It is an admitted principle, that a court of law has concurrent jurisdiction with a court of equity, in cases of fraud. <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b131-5\" pgmap=\"131\">The evidence offered went directly to the validity of the certificate of preemption purchase. If it had its inception in fraud, it was certainly competent for the defendant to show the fact; and if the officers granting it were parties to the fraudulent act, it was no doubt void ; and might be impeached in. an enquiry in which the precmptor was a.party.</p> <p id=\"b131-6\" pgmap=\"131\">The exclusion of the evidence offered, was evidently erroneous, and for such cause the judgment should be reversed, and the cause remanded, with instruction to the Circuit Court to award a venire facias de novo.</p> <p id=\"b131-7\" pgmap=\"131\">Judgment reversed.</p> <footnote label=\"(1)\"> <p id=\"b131-21\" pgmap=\"131\"> 8 Peters 244; 12 Peters 11; 1 Peters\u2019 Cond.
