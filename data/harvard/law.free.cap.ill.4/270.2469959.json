Scammon, attorn'ey at law, did, at the last Circuit Court in Cook county, in open Court, on or about the twenty-filth day of April, eighteen hundred and forty, deliver to this respondent, a paper or papers, which the said Scammon then and there stated, as near as he now recollects, was a writ of mandamus from the Supreme Court. But what was the date of the writ, and what were its precise words, this respondent does not now recollect; but his impressions are that it was directed to him, and not to the sheriff of said Cook county, which last fact, among other things, induced this respondent to think that there was some error in the clerk of the Supreme Court, in its phraseology and direction.</summary><summary data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b291-12\" pgmap=\"291(93) 292(22)\">\u201c This respondent would further answer and say, that the duties of his office were so urgent at the said term, that he could not find an opportunity to give the subject that examination which it deserves, and since which time or adjournment, he has been necessarily engaged in urgent private business, until he left Springfield, on the tenth instant, on his way to Juliet, Will county, his place of residence; passing through many counties where he had formerly practised law, and with a view, in part, to collect long standing debts which have remained, for want of attention, since his election to the office of judge in the 7th judicial circuit.</summary><summary data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b292-5\" pgmap=\"292\">\u201c To the second interrogatory, \u2018 Have you, John Pearson, made a return to said writ of mandamus ? If so, when, how, and where ? And where is said writ of mandamus ? And when was it last in your possession ? What have you done with it ?\u2019</summary><summary data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b292-6\" pgmap=\"292\">\u201c This respondent further answers, that the said writ of mandamus is now, as he believes, at his residence in Juliet, or was there when he left home, which was soon after the adjournment of Court, and without time to examine that and other papers and cases taken under advisement. This respondent has made no return to said writ of mandamus, if such was its character. Because first, that on the trial of this cause in eighteen hundred and thirty-nine, this respondent, as judge, signed a correct bill of exceptions for the said defendant, as he believed, and then thought his duty as a judge was fully discharged, according to the law as understood by him; secondly, because the rule or conditional mandamus obtained from this Court, as this respondent has incidentally learned, but which has never been read or seen by him, to his knowledge, was attempted to be served on him by one Justin Butterfield, an attorney at law, in open Court, at the November term, eighteen hundred and thirty-nine, in Cook county, and accompanied at the time of pretended service, with rude and offensive words and manner. This respondent, at the time, believed the law to be different as to the service of said writ, and confidently relied upon it for protection from the rudeness thus practiced by the attorney. This respondent, then, entertaining this view of the service of said paper, which was placed on the bench in front of this respondent, unopened, this respondent required the said Butterfield to take back, or away, the said paper, and on his refusal so to do, this respondent did then shove off the bench the paper aforesaid, and it has not been in respondent\u2019s possession, or seen by him since, to his knowledge, and he does not know, of his own knowledge, what said paper contained.</summary><summary data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b292-7\" pgmap=\"292(168) 293(454)\">\u201c But this respondent will here remark, that if it had been a rule or conditional mandamus from the Supreme Court, and served on this respondent by the sheriff legally authorized to serve writs, requiring this respondent to appear in this Court to show cause why a bill of exceptions should not be signed, that he would, if in his power, and not prevented by sickness, as was the case in December last, the last term of this Court, have appeared in the Supreme Court, and respectfully asked this Court if it had jurisdiction of the subject matter in a case where the law had given a discretionary power in the Circuit Courts to sign bills of exceptions, the correctness of them to be determined by .the judge : and whether the Circuit Court is such an inferior Court as was known at common law, to which writs of mandamus only could issue, and also\" this respondent would respectfully have placed the question upon the ground of the great burthen and hardship upon circuit judges, to be required, twice in each year, to be compelled to employ counsel, or attend to answer rules, obtained against them ex parte, and some other reasons might have been urged to this Court, with its permission, had the service of this writ of mandamus or rule been served by an officer: and if, upon a full view of the case, the Supreme Court had decided that it had the power to take cognisance of this specific case, then, and in that event, this respondent would, if not prevented by unforeseen circumstances, have appeared in the Supreme Court at that or some other term, to obey its mandates. This respondent would have, in such a case, felt himself bound to comply with the rule of law as laid down by the highest Court in Illinois, although he might honestly understand the rule of law differently; for, believing as he does, and upon his expressed opinions at all proper times, that courts, whether of superior or of inferior jurisdiction, can only act as interpreters, and not as makers of law. This respondent further answers, that he has not made a return of the writ of mandamus thus delivered to him by J. Y. Scammon, in April, eighteen hundred and forty, in open Court, because he still believed that the lawyer in the case, had no authority or right to interrupt the business of the Circuit Court, by coming into open Court and serving this or any other writ on the Court, and thus considered it no service ; and this respondent did not then know, and not until recently, that Jesse B. Thomas, Esq., had filed any brief, or had consented to any order to be made in this cause, acknowledging the alternative mandamus or rule as served by the said Butterfield, in November, eighteen hundred and thirty-nine, and he was not aware upon what grounds the Supreme Court had proceeded in awarding this last writ of mandamus, and could not understand fully, the first part of the opinion of this Court, handed to him some time after the service as aforesaid, in April, eighteen hundred and forty, wherein this Court says, 1 An alternative mandamus having been issued to the judge of the 7th Judicial Circuit Court, and he having made no formal return to the writ, nor returned the writ itself, but through the medium counsel filed what purports to be an argument against the power of this Court to take cognizance of the case, the Court are compelled to treat the case as one in which its authority has been disregarded.\u2019</summary><summary data-order=\"89\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b293-5\" pgmap=\"293(102) 294(553) 295(164)\">\u201c This respondent had never given, in his recollection, Judge Thomas, or any one, power or authority to acknowledge the service of Justin Butterfield to be a legal service, or any notice, but this respondent always believed that the Supreme Court would not consider the service of a writ of mandamus, by an attorney, a legal service, although they might, after a proper service by an officer on the Circuit Court, proceed to take jurisdiction. This respondent further believed that this Court, although its order might give the party the writ of mandamus, that it was no way pointing out, or directing the manner of service; but that in the opinion of this Court, this respondent supposed that this writ was to be executed, like all other writs issuing out of any court competent to grant a mandamus, as the Circuit Courts may do by the act of sixth January, eighteen hundred and twenty-seven. Upon this ground mostly, this respondent supposed the attorney, J. Y. Scammon, had mistaken the law as to the manner of service, and more especially after his answer to the rule herein spoken of; and, therefore, with this view of the subject, this respondent thought that this Court would not consider its authority disregarded, in not returning this last writ thus served, in April, eighteen hundred and forty, and more especially was this conviction forced on. the mind of this respondent, from the fact that he had not given any one power, or used language, as he thought, from which service could even be inferred or claimed. This respondent has never understood, and does not now understand it to be the opinion of this Court, that an attorney can come into the Circuit Courts and serve writs of mandamus on the judges thereof, while presiding. But this respondent inferred from the expression quoted from the learned judge\u2019s opinion, handed to him in April or May last, and from J. Y. Scammon\u2019s answer, that this respondent had waived or acknowledged the service of the writ, as attempted to be served by the said Butterfield, or had, in this manner, by permitting his counsel to file a brief, acknowledged the service in that case only, and if so, that in relation to the law of jurisdiction, that this respondent had (though conscientiously) taken quite a different view of this subject, from this Court, yet never doubting or supposing that this respondent would differ at all with this Court as to-the manner of serving writs of mandamus. If, however, this respopdent should be wrong in his opinion as to the manner of service, he has been so sincerely, and not with a view or determination to contemn the power or orders of the Supreme Court, to whose exposition of the laws of Illinois, he, as an officer under oath, is bound to acquiesce, unless the order required an act against conscience. This respondent will, with the permission of this Court, under this interrogatory, remark that the brief, as it is called in the judge\u2019s opinion, was only made and sent to counsel, because of sickness, and as an index to some of the objections which presented themselves to this respondent, against the exercise of the powers claimed by the attorney; and it was never intended to be filed or offered to this Court as an argument to be preserved on file. The cases there put by this respondent, are for illustration only, against the supposed just exercise of the specific power thus set up by the attorney. They were, in short, but points from which this respondent hoped his able counsel, with the permission of this Court, on the motion drawn up, might satisfy the Supreme Court against the exercise of a power which, to this respondent, seemed incompatible with the correct and legal discharge of the multifarious duties of the Circuit Courts, and might, in the absence of the judge and his inability to comply with the rule, do absolute injustice to the parties, and to conscience, in requiring him to sign a bill of exceptions which was at war with truth. It was a new question here, and one on which this respondent confidently believed that this honorable Court would be willing, at all proper times, to receive arguments in illustration of this new and important subject. But this Court, on that branch of jurisdiction, seem to have been satisfied without any arguments from this respondent\u2019s counsel, and he feels no disposition now to run contra to that rule, as laid down by the highest Court in Illinois. It is only as to the motives of this respondent, in refusing to obey that rule, when that rule has legitimately come to his knowledge, that this honorable Court will (it is apprehended,) enquire into, which must acquit or condemn this respondent.</summary><summary data-order=\"90\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b295-5\" pgmap=\"295\">\u201c In relation to the third interrogatory, 1 Did you, as judge of the Circuit Court, at the time the said J. Y. Scammon delivered to you the said writ of mandamus, direct the clerk of the said Circuit Court to enter a rule against the said J. Y. Scammon, to show cause why he (the said Scammon,) should not be fined or imprisoned, or both, for a contempt of Court ?\u2019 In answer, this respondent says he did, he thinks, cause such an order to be entered, because this respondent then believed, from what he had formerly said in another case, that J. Y. Scammon knew the opinion of this respondent, as to the legality of such service by the attorney, and that, with a full knowledge of this repondent\u2019s expressed opinions on this subject, to so many different persons, this respondent did cause the order, or one very much like it, to be entered for a supposed contempt. But when J. Y. Scammon answered the rule, and quoted from the said brief, as filed by judge Thomas, in this cause, and then for the first time known to this respondent as filed, though Mr. Scammon had mistaken its meaning\u2014and further, upon the assurance of the said Scammon, that no contempt was intended\u2014this respondent, then acting as a Court, did, and for that reason, cheerfully discharge the rule, and from a desire then, and at all times, so to act as not to use the law for his personal gratification, but for the protection of the law itself.</summary><summary data-order=\"91\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b295-6\" pgmap=\"295(150) 296(160)\">\u201cTo the fourth interrogatory, \u2018 At the time the said Scammon answered said rule, did you not state in open Court, that you would not obey said writ of mandamus, or sign the bill of exceptions recited in the said writ, or words to that effect ?\u2019 This respondent cannot say now what words were used by him at the time alluded to; but his impressions are, that he did not say he would not obey said writ of mandamus, and believes he did not use words to that effect. But this respondent did then request the said Scammon to take back the said writ, and have the same served on him by the sheriff, which he, Scammon, refused; and in that case, it is now his recollection, as it was his design, to meet the question fairly and upon its merits. This respondent believes he did then, also, inform the said Scammon that he could not, and as he then understood the law and has always believed, allow attorneys to interrupt the proceedings of the Court, by any future attempt to serve there writs\u2014but when they were served in a legal way, by an officer appointed by the law, that then this respondent, as a Court, would answer to the Supreme Court in such a manner as he hoped would be satisfactory, or .words to that effect, as this respondent now recollects, but does not pretend to state the exact words then used. And this respondent might have used stronger language, from the fact that he was thoroughly convinced that a contempt had been intended by the former service of these writs, and he wished hereafter not to suffer the court house to be, instead of an orderly place for the transaction of business, one of disorder and confusion, by this course of proceedings.</summary><summary data-order=\"92\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b296-5\" pgmap=\"296\">\u201c This respondent has now, to the best of his ability, answered the several interrogatories propounded, and he relies upon his answers, with full ^confidence in their truth, to acquit him of any attempt, on his part, to contemn the laws, or any orders of this honorable Court. Believing as he does, that he, as an humble agent under oath, selected by the people to give efficacy to their laws, and not to set them at defiance, has done all in his power to prove that in law only there is true liberty, and without law and' its just observance, the liberty is but a mere name. This respondent, thus feeling conscious of the correctness of his motives to uphold the laws and all courts that are constituted to sustain them, he is confident that this Court will see in his conduct, in the premises, no wish or intention to contemn its orders or powers.</summary><summary data-order=\"93\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b296-6\" pgmap=\"296\">\u201c John Pearson.</summary><summary data-order=\"94\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b296-7\" pgmap=\"296\">\u201c Sworn to and subscribed before me, this 23d day of June, 1840.</summary><summary data-order=\"95\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b296-8\" pgmap=\"296\">\u201c J.

At the December term, 1839, it appearing that due service had been made of the alternative mandamus, and that the judge had refused to obey the writ, or show any good cause why he did not comply with its injunction, a peremptory mandamus was awarded.</p> <p id=\"b298-12\" pgmap=\"298(186) 299(68)\">At the June term, 1840, affidavits were read, showing that the writ of mandamus had been duly served upon the judge in open Court, by the attorney in the original suit, and that the judge had not only treated the writ contemptuously, by threatening to fine and imprison the attorney for .serving the writ, but actually caused him to appear and answer for a supposed contempt, in thus making such service. It also appeared that he had entirely disregarded the writ, and refused and neglected to make any return thereto. An attachment for this contempt was awarded at the June term aforesaid. During that term, the defendant was arrested on the attachment, and brought into Court, and admitted to bail. Interrogatories were thereupon filed, with the view of affording him an opportunity to purge himself of the contempt. To these interrogatories, answers were filed; after which, the Court heard the defendant, at great length, by able counsel, and with the view to give the defendant the benefit of a most mature and deliberate consideration of the case, as well as to ascertain whether the Court, in the previous steps it had taken, had acted in conformity to the well settled principles of law, as it regarded the rights and obligations of the judge, in the premises, as also to determine what was proper to be done for the protection of suitors in the courts of this State, so as to secure to them a faithful administration of justice.</p> <p id=\"b299-5\" pgmap=\"299\">After the argument, the cause was continued until the December term, 1840. At this term, the defendant came and suggested to the Court that he had resigned the office of judge of the Seventh Judicial Circuit of this State, and moved to be discharged from the attachment, because this Court had, by the act of resignation, been ousted of its jurisdiction, and had therefore no longer any compulsory power over him.</p> <p id=\"b299-6\" pgmap=\"299\">After a full hearing of the case on the part of the defendant, at that time, the cause was continued until the present term, with a view of affording the defendant an opportunity of a re-hearing before the Court, as now organized.</p> <p id=\"b299-7\" pgmap=\"299\">A re-argument at this term having been declined, and the case submitted, it becomes necessary to come to a final determination of the whole matter in controversy. This Court cannot, for a moment, entertain a doubt, but that it has jurisdiction to award a mandamus to a circuit judge; nor can they doubt that the facts of this case imperiously call upon them to exercise the power.</p> <p id=\"b299-8\" pgmap=\"299\">From an examination of the answers of the defendant to the interrogatories propounded to him, no satisfactory conclusion can be drawn, to exempt him from the charge, that his whole course, in his repeated refusals to obey the mandates of the Court, have unfortunately had their origin in a spirit of contumacy and resistance to the authority of the Court, or in a degree of ignorance not possible to be imputed to a person holding the important station of a judge of the Circuit Court.</p> <p id=\"b299-9\" pgmap=\"299\">The defendant seems, throughout, to seek to shelter himself upon the ground of a want of due service of the writs of mandamus, both alternative and peremptory, because they were served upon him in open Court, by the attorneys for the party, and not, as he contends they should have been, by the sheriff.</p> <p id=\"b299-10\" pgmap=\"299(121) 300(548) 301(21)\">Be that as it may, when the writs were directed to him, and commanded him to do a particular act, or as in the case of the alternative mandamus, or to show cause why he refused to do the act, he should, at least from self respect, have complied, and not sought to shelter himself under a pretence that the sheriff was the only person who could lawfully serve the writ. When, however, the defendant had learnt, as he did by the decision in relation to the service of the alternative mandamus, <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> that such a ground was not tenable, he should have yielded obedience to the peremptory mandamus. But what is his conduct on the occasion of the service of this writ ? An attempt to punish the attorney for serving the writ, and an utter disregard of the writ itself. Could this Court then hesitate, on the establishment of these facts, to award the attachment? It was demanded by every consideration of duty, and a due regard for the rights of suitors in courts of justice. It is now, however, contended, that whatever may have been the duty of the Court originally, in awarding the attachment, and coercing the defendant to sign the bill of exceptions, it has no longer jurisdiction over the person of the defendant, because he has ceased to occupy the judicial station, which he held when-attached. It is doubtless true, that the defendant, being no longer judge, cannot be coerced to do an official act, or exercise a judicial function, and for such reason we have directed in the cause, in which he has refused to sign the bill of exceptions, that the bill should be considered a part of the record, but still it does not follow, that because this Court cannot imprison the defendant until he shall sign the bill of exceptions, that it has no power to punish the defendant for his contempt of the law, in his refusal to obey the writ. This Court having jurisdiction over the defendant, while he was judge, to compel him to perform the required act, for the purpose of enabling it to do justice between the litigant parties, cannot be divested of the power to punish for the contempt, by the defendant\u2019s resigning the office of judge. \u25a0 The offence being complete while he was judge, and subject to the authority of the Court, no act of the party can release or bar the punishment. One object in punishing contempts by imprisonment, it is conceded, is to coerce the party to do the required act; but because this object cannot be obtained, it by no means follows that no punishment should be inflicted. Punishment looks to example, as well as suffering. Both those objects are still attainable. But inasmuch as the defendant cannot perform the required act, it is the duty of the Court, to enquire if the objects of the law cannot as well be accomplished without, as with imprisonment. Imprisonment is the extreme rigor of the law, and as in this case it cannot accomplish one of its main designs, this Court deems it proper only to impose a fine. In the just and necessary exercise of this power, it would have afforded the Court pleasure to have seen, in the case, any mitigating circumstances from which any reasonable inference could fairly be drawn, that the course the defendant has permitted himself to adopt throughout the whole of this protracted affair, had been the result of unintentional error and misconception. But when it is seen that the facts disclosed, show not only wilful contumacy, in the first instance, but when the defendant had been informed from the written opinion of the Court, on the application for the peremptory writ of mandamus, what was the true position in which he stood, to persist again, under a flimsy and virtually overruled pretext, to disobey the writ, shows an obstinate determination to resist the authority of the law, in utter disregard of the rights of the injured party, and of the duties of his station.</p> <p id=\"b301-5\" pgmap=\"301\">It is certainly matter of deep regret, that a case thus marked, should have called for the exercise of the summary powers of the Court, to inflict punishment on judicial delinquency. To pass it over lightly, would be a dereliction of duty. Every consideration of justice, and a sacred regard to the maintenance of the supremacy of the law, solemnly admonishes this Court, that those who violate its mandates, must expect a punishment to be inflicted commensurate to the wrong done; but more especially should it take care, that those, to whom is committed the sacred duty of the execution of the laws, do not escape, where they are themselves guilty of their infraction.</p> <p id=\"b301-6\" pgmap=\"301\">With these views before us, and in the discharge of a duty which we may not omit, it is considered that the defendant, John Pearson, is, and he is hereby adjudged to be, guilty of a high contempt, in refusing to obey the command of a writ of peremptory mandamus heretofore awarded by this Court, by the cause of Robert C. Bristol v. John F. Phillips, and duly served on him, and that for such his contempt aforesaid, it is adjudged and decreed that he pay to the people of this State, a fine of $100, and the costs of all the proceedings in relation to the writs of mandamus and attachment, and that the people have execution therefor.</p> <author id=\"b301-7\" pgmap=\"301\">Breese, Justice,</author> <p id=\"AY5\" pgmap=\"301\">delivered the following separate opinion :</p> <p id=\"b301-8\" pgmap=\"301\">I did not hear any of the arguments in this cause, and consequently, am not prepared to express a definite opinion upon its merits. From the examination I have given the papers, I was inclined to the opinion, that the action of the defendant might be based on the ground of a misapprehension of his rights and duties as a judge of the Circuit Court, and not to a spirit of disobedience to the mandates of this Court. A just respect for the judicial tribunals of the country, acting within the line of their duty, requires that their decisions solemnly made should be regarded; if they are not, their usefulness will be greatly abridged, or wholly destroyed.</p> <p id=\"b301-9\" pgmap=\"301\">I do not doubt the power of this Court to award a peremptory mandamus to the Circuit Court, nor the duty of the Court to which it is sent to obey it. It is a just and necessary exercise of power, promotive alike of the ends of justice, and of the rights of suitors. If it is disobeyed, there is no alternative but the imposition of a fine or imprisonment. In adopting the former mode, under the circumstances of this case, the judge having resigned his office, since the attachment was issued, seems to be in harmony with acknowledged principles in such like cases.</p> <p id=\"b301-10\" pgmap=\"301\">Douglass, Justice, having been of counsel for the defendant, gave no opinion.</p> <p id=\"b301-11\" pgmap=\"301\">Judgment against defendant.</p> <p id=\"b302-4\" pgmap=\"302\">J.
