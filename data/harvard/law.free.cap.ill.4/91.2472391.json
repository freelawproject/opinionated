The breach to all the counts is, that the defendant did not pay said sums of money, although requested, on the 12th day of May, 1840.</p> <p id=\"b108-5\" pgmap=\"108\">To this declaration the defendant demurred generally, and the Court overruled the demurrer.</p> <p id=\"b108-6\" pgmap=\"108\">The defendant then pleaded, first, non assumpsit; secondly, payment by Penseneau ; and, thirdly, commencing as a plea to the whole cause of action, he then averred that Penseneau purchased goods of the .plaintiffs, to the amount of $752.41, part of the sum in plaintiffs\u2019 declaration mentioned, of which the defendant guarantied the payment, and for which Penseneau gave his note, at six months, &amp;c.; and which amount was paid and discharged by Penseneau; and concluded with a verification.</p> <p id=\"b108-7\" pgmap=\"108\">There was a joinder on the first plea, and a replication and joinder on the second plea. The plaintiffs demurred to the third, and the Court sustained the demurrer.</p> <p id=\"b108-8\" pgmap=\"108\">On tire issues joined on the first and second pleas, a trial was had, and verdict for the plaintiffs, and motions for a new trial, and in arrest of judgment, made and denied.</p> <p id=\"b108-9\" pgmap=\"108\">The first error assigned is, that the Court erred in overruling the demurrer to the declaration. The defendant can take nothing by this assignment of error. It has been repeatedly decided by this Court, that where a party abandons his demurrer, he cannot assign for error the decision .of the Court in overruling it. The defendant, by pleading to the declaration, abandoned his demurrer.</p> <p id=\"AWQ\" pgmap=\"108\">The second assignment of error is, that the Court erred in sustaining the demurrer to the defendant\u2019s third plea. This plea professes to answer the .whole cause of action, but in truth only answers part, and is, therefore, bad on demurrer. <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b108-11\" pgmap=\"108\">It is, however, contended, that the plaintiffs, by demurring to the plea, without taking judgment, by nil (Licit, for the part unanswered, thereby discontinued their action. The plaintiffs, by demurring to a plea professing to answer the whole cause of action, do not discontinue. <footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark> Besides, the doctrine of discontinuance does not apply, where, as in this case, there are pleas denying the entire cause of action.</p> <p id=\"b108-12\" pgmap=\"108\">The third and last assignment of error relied on, is, that the Court erred in overruling the motion in arrest of judgment, the \u2022declaration being defective.</p> <p id=\"b109-4\" pgmap=\"109\">Where a general verdict is given, on several counts, the same shall not be set aside, or reversed, if any one or more of the counts be good. <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> Without enquiring into the sufficiency of the first and second counts of the declaration, there can be no doubt as to the third. It is the common count, on an account stated.</p> <p id=\"b109-5\" pgmap=\"109\">Perceiving no errors in the proceedings of the Court below, we affirm the judgment with costs.</p> <p id=\"b109-6\" pgmap=\"109\">Judgment affirmed.</p> <footnote label=\"(1)\"> <p id=\"b108-13\" pgmap=\"108\"> 1 Chit. Plead. 554.</p> </footnote> <footnote label=\"(2)\"> <p id=\"ACi\" pgmap=\"108\"> 1 Chit. Plead. 555.</p> </footnote> <footnote label=\"(1)\"> <p id=\"b109-14\" pgmap=\"109\"> R.
