Van Lines, Inc.\u2019s application of July 10, 1959, under \u00a7 207 of the Interstate Commerce Act [49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 307], to operate as a common carrier by motor vehicle over irregular routes in the transportation of \u201chousehold goods\u201d between points in Arizona, California, Idaho, Oregon, Utah and Washington, and between points in those States and points in Colorado, Louisiana, Missouri, Montana, New Mexico, Texas and Wyoming [T.E.K. Van Lines, Inc., Common Carrier Application, 86 M.C.C. 139 (1961)].</p>\n<p id=\"b350-15\">Jurisdiction of this Court is invoked under 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 17(9) and 305(g), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1336, 1398, 2284, 2321-2325, and 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1009.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-17\">The material facts are not in dispute, and it would serve no useful purpose to recount them here, other than to say that the orders under attack presage for plaintiffs a new competitor in the business of \u201cnationwide\u201d and \u201ccoast-to-coast\u201d transportation of \u201chousehold goods\u201d. [See Movers\u2019 Conf. of America v. United States, 205 F.Supp. 82 (S.D.Cal.1962).]</p>\n<p id=\"b350-18\">Plaintiffs\u2019 application to enjoin the Commission <em>pendente lite </em>from issuing a certificate of convenience and necessity in accordance with the challenged orders was denied at the outset of this proceeding, since it appeared to us interlocutorily that no prospect of irreparable injury to plaintiffs could be shown, beyond a possible loss of some trade which might be suffered by plaintiffs, if T.E.K. should proceed to operate under the certificate before the case could be determined upon the merits. We therefore concluded, upon balance of probable detriment and inconvenience which would result, that the equities opposed the granting of a preliminary injunction. [See Railway Express Agency, Inc. v. United States, Interstate Commerce Commission and United Parcel Service, by Harlan, J., 82 S.Ct. 466, 7 L.Ed. 432 (1962).]</p>\n<p id=\"b350-19\">Briefly stated, plaintiffs\u2019 contentions here are that the Commission erred: (1) \u201cin certificating a new carrier service absent probative, evidence that the services and abilities of present carriers are deficient or inadequate, (2) in certificating a new carrier service without probative evidence reflecting a need for the service between the points so certificated, and (3) in making and relying upon evidentiary findings contrary to the record evidence\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-20\">Turning to the first contention, adequacy of the \u201cservices and abilities of present carriers\u201d is only one phase of the problem that confronted the Commission. [Cf. I. C. C. v. J-T Transport Co., 368 U.S. 81, 88, 82 S.Ct. 204, 7 L.Ed. 2d 147 (1961).] Subject to the restrictions of \u00a7 210 as to \u201cdual operation\u201d, \u00a7 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>207 declares that \u201ca certificate shall be issued to any qualified applicant therefor * * * jf is found * * * that the proposed service * * * is or will be required by the present or future public convenience and necessity * * [49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 307; and see id. \u00a7 310.]</p>\n<p id=\"ANH\">Such a finding, the Court observed in United States v. Detroit, etc. Navigation Co., 326 U.S. 236, 66 S.Ct. 75, 90 L.Ed. 38 (1945), \u201centails a prophecy so far as future requirements are concerned. * * * If the Commission were required to deny these applications unless it found an actual inability on the part of existing carriers to acquire the facilities necessary for future transportation needs, a limitation would be imposed on the power of the Commission which is not found in the Act. The Commission is the guardian of the public interest in determining whether certificates of convenience and necessity shall, be granted. For the performance of that function the Commission has been entrusted with a wide range of discretionary authority. * * * Forecasts as to the future are necessary to the decision.\u201d [326 U.S. at 240-241, 66 S.Ct. at 77; see also: United States v. Pierce Auto Lines, 327 U.S. 515, 531-532, 66 S.Ct. 687, 90 L.Ed. 821 (1946); I. C. C. v. Parker, 326 U.S. 60, 64, 65-66, 65 S.Ct. 1490, 89 L.Ed. 2051 (1945); Lang Transportation. Corp. v. United States, 75 F.Supp. 915, 929 (S.D.Cal.1948).]</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">Here, as the Commission\u2019s report points out:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-7\">\u201cCensus statistics and growth rate projections for the western States, offered through an assistant professor of economics of a western university, show * * * that they had an aggregate population growth of 46 percent, as compared with a national growth rate of 14.5 percent between 1940 and 1950; that their growth rate exceeded the overall national growth by 30.8 percent to 15 percent between 1950 and 1957; and that the projected growth rate for each, with one exception, would exceed the projected national growth rate of 27.4 percent, for the period 1958 through 1975. This witness was of the opinion that the availability of adequate transportation would contribute to their development and growth.\u201d [86 M.C.C. at 143.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b351-10\">Plaintiffs\u2019 second contention may also be answered in the language of the Court: \u201cTo consider the weight of the evidence before the Commission, the soundness of the reasoning by which its conclusions were reached, or whether the findings are consistent with those made * * * in other cases, is beyond our province.\u201d [Virginian R. Co. v. United States, 272 U.S. 658, 663, 47 S.Ct. 222, 224, 71 L.Ed. 463 (1926); see also: Universal Camera Corp. v. N.L.R.B., 340 U.S. 474, 488, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951); Rochester Tel. Corp. v. United States, 307 U.S. 125, 139-140, 59 S.Ct. 754, 83 L.Ed. 1147 (1939) ; I. C. C. v. Union Pac. R. Co.,. 222 U.S. 541, 547-548, 38 S.Ct. 108, 56 L.Ed. 308 (1912).]</p>\n<p id=\"b351-12\"> We have been unable to find any basis for plaintiffs\u2019 third contention that the Commission made and relied upon \u201cevidentiary findings contrary to the record evidence\u201d. Nor does there appear any basis for criticism of the Commission\u2019s exercise of discretion under \u00a7 5(2) [49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 5(2)], in approving the control of T.E.K. Van Lines, Inc., by other motor carriers [see: 86 M.C.C. at 142, 147-148; McLean Trucking Co. v. United States, 321 U.S. 67, 87, 64 S.Ct. 370, 88 L.Ed. 544 (1944)].</p>\n<p id=\"b351-13\">Judging the orders of the Commission under review at bar, as all orders of the Commission are entitled to be judged, by \u201cthe report, read as a whole\u201d [United States v. Louisiana, 290 U.S. 70, 80, 54 S.Ct. 28, 33, 78 L.Ed. 181 (1933)], and by \u201cthe record as a whole out of which the report arose\u201d [City of Yonkers v. United States, 320 U.S. 685, 695, 64 S.Ct. 327, 88 L.Ed. 400 (1944)], the orders are supported by findings which are neither arbitrary nor capricious, but are adequately sustained by the record [cf. United States v. Carmack, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>329 U.S. 230, 243-244, 67 S.Ct. 252, 91 L.Ed. 209 (1946)]; and there is rational basis for the administrative conclusion [Miss. Valley Barge Line Co. v. United States, 292 U.S. 282, 286, 287, 54 S.Ct. 692, 78 L.Ed. 1260 (1934)].</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">\u201cThe judicial function is exhausted when there is found to be a rational basis for the conclusions approved by the administrative body.\u201d [Miss. Valley Barge Line Co. v. United States, supra, 292 U.S. at 286-287, 54 S.Ct. at 693. ]</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">This action to annul the Commission\u2019s orders of May 12 and December 26, 1961 [86 M.C.C. 139], must therefore be dismissed. I '</p>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">Solicitors for defendants will lodge with the Clerk findings of fact, conclusions of law and judgment of dismissal pursuant to Local Rule 7, West\u2019s Ann. Code, within ten days.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
