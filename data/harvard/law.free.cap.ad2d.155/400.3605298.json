Inasmuch as that is not the case in this instance, the petition is denied and the proceeding is dismissed. Even if we were to consider the instant proceeding as an application for a writ of prohibition, we would deny it <em>(see, Matter of Lipari v Owens, </em>70 NY2d 731). We note that we have not reached the underlying merits of the petitioner\u2019s legal arguments. Mangano, J. P., Bracken, Brown and Spatt, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
