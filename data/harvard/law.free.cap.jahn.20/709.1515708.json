The real issue in the c\u00e1se was whether the note was given for a good consideration, to-wit, for moneys owing from the maker of the note to her; and we think that her right to recover on the note cannot be affected, even if she knew the effect of taking the note and the mortgage to secure the same would be to take property that would have gone to other creditors if she had not secured or enforced her claim.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
