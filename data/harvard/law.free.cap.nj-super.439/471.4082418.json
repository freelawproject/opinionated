July 1, 2012), <em>available at </em>http://www.njsp. org/divorg/invest/pd7adtu/070912_dwi_standardstatement.pdf (hereinafter <em>Standard </em>Statement).] <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">In <em>Chun, </em>our Supreme Court found the Alcotest was a scientifically reliable breath test, and held its results could be admissible to prove a per se violation of the DWI statute. <em>Chun, supra, </em>194 <em>N.J. </em>at 65, 943 A.2d 114. The Court said the Alcotest \u201coperator must retain a copy of the AIR and give a copy to the arrestee.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 82, 943 A.2d 114.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-10\">On February 5, 2013, Patrol Officer Christopher Nelson observed defendant\u2019s vehicle \u201cjump[ ]\u201d into the left lane of Route 23, drift into the center and right lanes, and then drift back to the left lane, all without using a turn signal. When the officer turned on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>his emergency lights, defendant almost caused an accident trying to get to the shoulder. Her eyes were bloodshot and watery, her eyelids were droopy, and her vehicle smelled of alcohol. After she failed several psycho-physical sobriety tests, she was arrested for DWI. Patrol Officer William Juliano transported defendant to the police station for an Aleotest.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">At the station, Officer Nelson read defendant the Standard Statement. Officer Juliano served as the Aleotest operator. While he observed defendant, she burped. After restarting the twenty-minute observation period, he conducted the test. The Aleotest equipment printed the AIR, which showed defendant\u2019s BAC was 0.12%. At the bottom of the AIR \u201cCopy Given to Subject\u201d was preprinted. The officer made a copy of the AIR and gave it to a superior officer, but did not give a copy to defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">Officer Juliano advised Officer Nelson of the test results. Officer Nelson then issued defendant summonses for \u201cDriving While Intoxicated, [N./.R.A] 39:4-50,\u201d unsafe lane change, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-88(b), and careless driving, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-97.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">Defendant appeared before the Municipal Court. At the beginning of the hearing, defense counsel announced that defendant was \u201cconceding that the observations, the driving, the psycho-physical tests, [and] the other indicia are sufficient under the [DWI] statute to establish [she was] under the influence.\u201d Both sides agreed the issue was \u201ca 90 day or a seven month suspension,\u201d that is, whether defendant was guilty only of an observation violation, or also a per se violation. The parties agreed to hold a pre-trial hearing under <em>N.J.R.E. </em>104 to determine the admissibility of the Aleotest BAC results. In the \u201c104 hearing,\u201d Officer Nelson and Officer Juliano testified about the Aleotest, and were found credible by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-9\">In the 104 hearing, defense counsel argued that the Aleotest results must be suppressed because <em>Chun </em>required that Officer Juliano provide the AIR to defendant in the station, and that defendant did not have to show any prejudice from his failure to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>do so. The prosecutor doubted whether any police department in the State gave a copy of the AIR to the arrestee.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">The Municipal Court was concerned that a copy of the AIR was not given to defendant, as preprinted on the form, and urged the State to either give a copy of the AIR to arrestees, or change the form. However, the court ruled that failure to give defendant a copy of the AIR was not sufficient to suppress the BAC results. The court rejected defendant\u2019s other suppression arguments, including that defendant\u2019s burp compromised the test. The court admitted the AIR and the Alcotest results into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">Defense counsel said defendant wanted to enter \u201ca conditional guilty plea, in other words, conceding the observations as we discussed earlier.\u201d The Municipal Court made clear to defendant that the conditional plea would allow her to appeal the \u201cdecision concerning the 104 hearing and the [ ] admission of the Alcotest readings,\u201d but would not affect her \u201cguilty plea as to the 90 day loss of license based on the observations.\u201d Defendant indicated she understood.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">In her guilty plea colloquy, defendant admitted to driving \u201cunder the influence of alcohol\u201d because she had \u201c[o]ne glass of wine.\u201d The Municipal Court asked for more facts, and Officer Nelson gave the observation testimony above. The court found a factual basis for the guilty plea \u201cbased upon the statements of the defendant, as well as the officer in regard to observations.\u201d Under the plea bargain, the court dismissed the charges of careless driving and unsafe lane change.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">The Municipal Court sentenced defendant to a fine of $306 and a license suspension of seven months based upon \u201cthe reading of .12 percent.\u201d The court also sentenced her to twelve hours detainment in the IDRC program, a $200 Drunk Driving Fund assessment, and various fees, surcharges, and court costs. On the ticket, the court noted \u201c.12\u201d and a \u201cconditional plea.\u201d The court stayed the sentence pending appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>Defendant appealed to the Law Division, where defense counsel argued that the Alcotest results had to be suppressed because of the burp and the failure to provide defendant a copy of the AIR at the police station. The prosecutor argued that the officer\u2019s reading of the Standard Statement informed defendant of her right to get a copy of the AIR, that <em>Chun </em>did not require the immediate presentation of the AIR, and that defendant was not prejudiced because she requested the AIR at the beginning of the legal proceedings and received it in a timely fashion.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">The Law Division judge rejected defendant\u2019s argument about the burp. The court credited that Officer Nelson read defendant the Standard Statement, and that defendant was informed of her rights. However, the court ruled \u201cdefendant\u2019s motion to suppress is granted on the grounds that the State failed to provide a copy of the AIR at the time of the defendant\u2019s arrest as required by <em>Chun:\u2019</em></p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">The Law Division judge then stated \u201cas I understand it there\u2019s no contest as to the observational standard.\u201d When defense counsel agreed, the court immediately proceeded to sentencing. The court stated that defendant had been \u201cconvicted under the observational standard,\u201d and imposed the required $250 fine and license suspension of three months. The court also imposed a $6 assessment, a $100 Drunk Driving Fund assessment, and the same IDRC detainment, fees, surcharges, and court costs imposed by the Municipal Court. The Law Division\u2019s March 10, 2014 order stated \u201cthat Defendant\u2019s Motion to Suppress the Alcotest Results is GRANTED,\u201d and that defendant was guilty of DWI \u201cunder the observational standard.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">This court granted the State\u2019s unopposed motion for leave to appeal. Meanwhile, defendant served the three-month license suspension, and then her driving privileges were restored.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-10\">We first address defendant\u2019s claim that the State\u2019s appeal is barred by double jeopardy. Defendant\u2019s argument is contrary to proper appellate procedure and double jeopardy law.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>The Supreme Court addressed the proper appellate procedure in <em>State v. Greeley, </em>178 <em>N.J. </em>38, 834 A.2d 1016 (2003). There, \u201c[w]ith the prosecution\u2019s consent, defendant entered a conditional guilty plea [in Municipal Court], expressly preserving his right to challenge the denial of his motion to suppress the breathalyzer readings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 50, 834 A.2d 1016. The Court held this was \u201cthe proper procedure\u201d to preserve such an issue for appeal. <em>Id. </em>at 50-51, 834 A.2d 1016. It allows a defendant to appeal the denial of the motion to the Law Division de novo, to this court, and to the Supreme Court. <em>See id. </em>at 42, 834 A.2d 1016. If one of those courts grants defendant\u2019s appeal, the State may appeal to a higher appellate court, which may reverse the suppression of the BAC results \u201cand reinstate defendant\u2019s conviction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 40, 42, 834 A.2d 1016.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">Here, defendant admittedly entered not only a conditional plea to the per se violation, but also an unconditional guilty plea to the observation violation. Thus, when she appealed and the Law Division suppressed the BAC results, defendant\u2019s unconditional guilty plea to the observation violation was unaffected. The Law Division proceeded to sentence defendant on her observation violation, imposing the three-month license suspension required by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4 \u2014 50(a)(l)(i). Nonetheless, under proper appellate procedure, the State retained the right to appeal the Law Division\u2019s suppression of the BAC results and to seek reinstatement of the Municipal Court\u2019s sentence for the per se violation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>Nevertheless, defendant contends that the State\u2019s appeal violates the constitutional prohibitions of double jeopardy. <em>U.S. Const, </em>amend. V, XIV; <em>N.J. Const, </em>art. I, 1111; <em>see State v. Widmaier, </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>475, 489-96, 724 A.2d 241 (1999). She asserts the Law Division acquitted her of a per se violation. However, that court never purported to acquit defendant. Rather, the court simply reversed the denial of the motion to suppress the BAC results, and then sentenced defendant based on her unconditional plea to the observation violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">Defendant argues that the Law Division\u2019s ruling was an acquittal regardless of its label. \u201cUnder both the state and federal double jeopardy clauses, an appeal from an acquittal is impermissible if \u2018the ruling of the judge, whatever its label, actually represents a resolution, correct or not, of some or all of the factual elements of the offense charged.\u2019 \u201d <em>Widmaier, supra, </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>at 490, 724 A.2d 241 (quoting <em>United States v. Martin Linen Supply Co., </em>430 <em>U.S. </em>564, 571, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>1349, 1354-55, 51 L.Ed.2d 642, 651 (1977)). However, the Law Division did not find defendant had a BAC of less than 0.10%, or otherwise resolve any of the factual elements of the per se violation. Instead, the court only ruled her 0.12% BAC result had to be suppressed because the operator did not give her a copy of the AIR in the police station.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">In these circumstances, even if the Law Division had said defendant was \u201cacquitted\u201d or \u201cnot guilty,\u201d it would not have affected the State\u2019s ability to appeal. In <em>State v. Sohl, </em>363 <em>N.J.Super. </em>573, 574, 833 A.2d 1104 (App.Div.2003), the defendant entered a conditional plea to a per se violation in Municipal Court, and appealed to the Law Division. The Law Division suppressed the BAC results, \u201c \u2018reversed\u2019 the conviction of the municipal court and entered a judgment of \u2018not guilty.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 575, 833 A.2d 1104. The State appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">We ruled that, \u201c[a]s defendant entered a conditional guilty plea in municipal court, the Law Division judge should not have entered a judgment of acquittal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 580-81, 833 A.2d 1104 (citing <em>State v. Golotta, </em>354 <em>N.J.Super. 477, </em>483, 808 A.2d 135 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>(App.Div.2002), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>178 <em>N.J. </em>205, 837 A.2d 359 (2003)). \u201cThe <em>de novo </em>appeal of the motion was limited to the legal issue of the admissibility of the [BAC results]. The case was not heard on its merits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 581, 833 A.2d 1104. \u201cThe Law Division judge was empowered to make his findings and, upon reversal of the municipal court\u2019s ruling, return the case to the municipal court for further proceedings in accordance with his ruling.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Because the Law Division failed to remand, the \u201c[defendant did not return to the municipal court where his plea remained viable. He did not retract his guilty plea. Therefore, the Law Division judge was unable to enter a finding of not guilty as defendant\u2019s plea of guilt remained entered upon the record in municipal court.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Thus, in <em>Sohl, </em>we reversed the suppression ruling and remanded to the Municipal Court, \u201cwhere defendant is to comply with the terms of his sentence.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">In <em>Golotta, supra, </em>354 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 480, 808 A.2d 135, the Law Division similarly reversed a denial of suppression and entered a \u201cjudgment of acquittal.\u201d We rejected \u201cdefendant\u2019s argument that [the State\u2019s] appeal is barred by the constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 484, 808 A.2d 135. We stressed that \u201c[t]he State will be barred from seeking review of an acquittal only \u2018if the ruling of the judge, whatever its label, actually represents a resolution, correct or not, of some or all of the factual elements of the offense charged.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>Widmaier, supra, </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>at 490, 724 A.2d 241 (internal quotation marks omitted)). We held that \u201c[t]he disposition by the Law Division judge of the motion to suppress was in no sense a resolution of the merits of the charged offense. Thus, the use of the phrase \u2018judgment of acquittal\u2019 is not a bar to the State\u2019s appeal.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Although we affirmed on the merits, <em>ibid., </em>the Supreme Court addressed the State\u2019s appeal on the merits and reversed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>suppression ruling. <em>State v. Golotta, </em>178 <em>N.J. </em>205, 209, 229, 837 A.2d 359 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">Under <em>Golotta </em>and <em>Sold, </em>the State\u2019s appeal does not violate double jeopardy. Defendant notes that double jeopardy is meant to prevent the State from making \u201crepeated attempts to convict the accused.\u201d <em>State v. Barnes, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>362, 370, 420 A.2d 303 (1980). However, the State\u2019s appeal here will not result in multiple trials. If we reverse the Law Division\u2019s suppression ruling, defendant remains subject to a valid conditional guilty plea to the per se violation, and we need only remand to the Municipal Court so that defendant can \u201ccomply with the terms of [that court\u2019s] sentence\u201d under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50(a)(l)(ii). <em>Sohl, supra, </em>363 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 581, 833 A.2d 1104.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">Defendant\u2019s conditional guilty plea distinguishes this case from the cases cited by defendant in which a trial and acquittal regarding a DWI charge barred a subsequent conviction on the same DWI charge. <em>E.g., State v. Cuneo, </em>275 <em>N.J.Super. </em>16, 18, 22, 645 A.2d 151 (App.Div.1994); <em>State v. Costello, </em>224 <em>N.J.Super </em>157, 159, 539 A.2d 1258 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>111 <em>N.J. </em>596, 546 A.2d 519 (1988); <em>State v. Lanish, </em>103 <em>N.J.Super </em>441, 442-44, 247 A.2d 492 (App.Div.1968), <em>aff'd o.b., </em>54 <em>N.J. </em>93, 253 A.2d 545 (1969); <em>cf. State v. Kashi, </em>360 <em>N.J.Super </em>538, 544-45, 823 A.2d 883 (App.Div.2003) (distinguishing Lanish), <em>aff'd o.b., </em>180 <em>N.J. </em>45, 848 A.2d 744 (2004)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Here, the State\u2019s appeal will not subject defendant \u201cto a conviction after an acquittal, or to the possibility of conviction of a more serious offense, or of an offense carrying a higher penalty\u201d than the per se violation to which she pled guilty. <em>State v. Kashi, </em>180 <em>N.J. </em>45, 48-49, 848 A.2d 744 (2004). Therefore, we hold there is no double jeopardy violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">We now turn to the merits of the Law Division\u2019s interpretation of <em>Chun. </em>\u201cA trial court\u2019s interpretation of the law\u201d is \u201cnot entitled to any special deference,\u201d and its \u201clegal conclusions are reviewed de novo.\u201d <em>State v. Gamble, </em>218 <em>N.J. </em>412, 425, 95 A.3d 188 (2014). We hew to that standard of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">The Law Division ruled that \u201cthe failure of the State to provide the defendant with a copy of the AIR on the date of [her] arrest warrants suppression of the proffered BAC results.\u201d The court reasoned that <em>Chun\u2019s </em>\u201cuse of the term \u2018arrestee\u2019 rather than defendant contemplates that a copy of the AIR be given to the individual while under arrest, and not at a later time upon request or during discovery once charges are brought against the defendant.\u201d The court found support in the report of the Alcotest Special Master. King, P.J.A.D., Special Master, <em>Findings and Conclusions Submitted to N.J. Supreme Court </em>(Feb. 13, 2007) (hereinafter <em>Special Master\u2019s Report), </em>reprinted in <em>State v. Chun, </em>No. 58, 879, 2007 <em>N.J. LEXIS </em>39 (Feb. 13, 2007) (\u201cLEXIS\u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The <em>Special Master\u2019s Report </em>noted: \u2018With the Alcotest 7110 a permanent record, the AIR, is printed out and a copy given to the suspect after the test is completed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 248, LEXIS at *285.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">However, the Special Master\u2019s comment was not a recommendation of a legal requirement. Rather, it is part of his technical comparison of the Alcotest machine and the breathalyzer machine. Specifically, the comment occurs in his discussion of why, \u201c[u]nlike the breathalyzer, the Alcotest 7110 is not operator dependent.\u201d <em>Ibid., </em>LEXIS at *284. The breathalyzer only showed the BAC results \u201cwhere the needle indicator stopped on the dial,\u201d and the \u201coperator simply wrote down his observation of the reading.\u201d <em>Ibid., </em>LEXIS at *285. By contrast, the Alcotest machine is attached to a printer which automatically prints an AIR containing the results. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>As the Special Master stated: \u201cNo contemporaneous, machine-generated permanent record was produced by the breathalyzer. With the Alcotest 7110 a permanent record, the AIR, is printed out and a copy given to the suspect after the test is completed.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The Special Master\u2019s emphasis was that the Alcotest\u2019s \u201centire process is automatic,\u201d resulting in \u201caccuracy, contemporary documentation of the result, and elimination of the ability of the operator to falsify or exaggerate the test outcome. This independence from potential operator influence and a permanent machine-printed record are decided advantage over the breathalyzer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 249, LEXIS at *285-86.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">Further, the Special Master\u2019s comment about giving a copy of the AIR to the suspect derived not from the law, but from the practices of the Alcohol Drug Testing Unit (ADTU) of the New Jersey State Police. \u201cThe ADTU instructs operators to give one copy to the local police department, retain one copy, and give a copy to the subject.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 43, LEXIS at *48. \u201cUpon completion of a test, the ADTU recommends that the operator give a copy of the AIR to the subject.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 116-17, LEXIS at *135-36. The Special Master made no mention of requiring such a practice in his findings of fact or conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">Our Supreme Court\u2019s comment that the \u201coperator must retain a copy of the AIR and give a copy to the arrestee\u201d was similarly part of a technical discussion, not a legal discussion. <em>See Chun, supra, </em>194 <em>N.J. </em>at 82, 943 A.2d 114. The comment came in the section of the Court\u2019s opinion addressing <em>\u201cHow the Alcotest Works.\u201d Id. </em>at 75-84, 943 A.2d 114. The Court made the comment as part of its \u201cdescription of the manner in which the device operates in practice,\u201d discussing \u201c[o]ne of the claimed advantages of the Alcotest, as compared to the breathalyzer, [namely] that it is not operator-dependent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 79, 943 A.2d 114.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">The Court did not reference that comment again in its lengthy and thorough opinion. Most pointedly, there was no mention of the comment in the Court\u2019s detailed section addressing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>its <em>\u201cRequirements Prior to the Admissibility of Alcotest Evidence,\u201d id. </em>at 134-49, 943 A.2d 114, including its requirements for <em>\u201cAlcohol Influence Report Admissibility,\u201d id. </em>at 145, 943 A.2d 114. Further, no such requirement is mentioned in the Court\u2019s extensive order specifying conditions under which the AIR \u201cis admissible as evidence of\u2019 a defendant\u2019s BAC. <em>Id. </em>at 149-54, 943 A.2d 114. Although that section and the order required the \u201cfoundational documents\u201d to be produced in discovery, <em>id. </em>at 134-35, 144-45, 148, 153, 943 A.2d 114, they did not similarly dictate when the AIR had to be produced. Thus, the context in which the Court made, and did not make, its comment suggests that it was not establishing a legal requirement, despite the word \u201cmust.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">We recognize that \u201c \u2018an expression of opinion on a point involved in a case, argued by counsel and deliberately mentioned by the court, although not essential to the disposition of the case ... becomes authoritative[ ] when it is expressly declared by the court as a guide for future conduct.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Rose, </em>206 <em>N.J. </em>141, 183, 19 A.3d 985 (2011) (quoting 21 <em>C.J.S. Courts </em>\u00a7 230 (2006)). Even \u201cwell-reasoned dictum\u201d from our Supreme Court is \u201cworthy of and entitled to the utmost respect. Indeed, as an intermediate appellate court, we consider ourselves bound by carefully considered dictum from the Supreme Court.\u201d <em>State v. Breitweiser, </em>373 <em>N.J.Super. </em>271, 282-83, 861 A.2d 176 (App.Div.2004), <em>certif. denied, </em>182 <em>N.J </em>628, 868 A.2d 1031 (2005); <em>see State v. Dabas, </em>215 <em>N.J. </em>114,136-37, 71 A.3d 814 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>Here, however, we are faced with a countervailing command, namely the Legislature\u2019s specific determination of when a copy of breath test results must be given to the person tested. The Legislature provided that \u201ca copy thereof ... shall be furnished or made available to the person so tested\u201d \u201cupon his request.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50.2(b). That statutory requirement has long been the controlling law, and is reflected in the statutorily-required Standard Statement. \u201c \u2018Once the Legislature has made that decision, and has made it within constitutional bounds, our sole function is to carry it out.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. French, </em>437 <em>N.J.Super. </em>333, 337, 98 A.3d 603 (App.Div.2014) (quoting <em>State v. Des Marets, </em>92 <em>N.J. </em>62, 65-66, 455 A.2d 1074 (1983)).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">We do not believe the Legislature would have mandated that the police turn over a copy of the breath test results upon request, or that the police tell the persons tested they have a right to receive a copy upon request, if the Legislature believed the police were also required to give a copy simultaneously to those same persons. If the Legislature had intended that the police be required to give a copy to the persons tested at the police station, we see no reason why the Legislature would not have stated that requirement in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50.2, rather than only requiring the police to provide a copy upon request. If the Legislature had intended to give the persons tested the right to automatically receive a copy at the police station, we see no reason why the Legislature would have required the police to advise the persons tested only that they had the right to get a copy if they made a request. Regardless of the merits of providing the persons tested with a copy of the breath test results at the police station, or requiring the police to do so without a request, it does not appear that the Legislature envisioned that requirement or intended to impose it, and we cannot interpret <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50.2 to encompass such a requirement. <em>See State v. Williams, </em>218 <em>N.J. </em>576, 586, 95 A.3d 721 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">After carefully reviewing <em>Chun, </em>we cannot find that our Supreme Court deliberately intended to contravene the statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>standard in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50.2(b). The Court did not cite <em>N.J.S.A </em>39:4-50.2 or the Standard Statement. The Court gave no inkling that it considered and replaced the Legislature\u2019s standard that a copy of the breath test must be provided to the tested person only \u201cupon request,\u201d <em>ibid., </em>with a requirement that the copy must be furnished to the tested person at the police station without a request. The Court\u2019s opinion contains no reasoning why the Legislature\u2019s standard could be superseded. Although the Court stated that some \u201cconditions upon admissibility we impose as a matter of constitutional imperative,\u201d <em>Chun, supra, </em>194 <em>N.J. </em>at 65, 943 A.2d 114, the Court never referenced providing a copy at the police station as one of those conditions, or indicated that providing a copy on request would be constitutionally inadequate. Nor did the Court invoke its \u201csupervisory powers over the administration of criminal justice\u201d to justify such a change. <em>See State v. Ramseur, </em>106 <em>N.J. </em>123, 252 n. 56, 524 A.2d 188 (1987) (declining to exercise its supervisory powers because \u201c[t]he Legislature has spoken in this area\u201d). We believe that if the Supreme Court had intended to change the Legislature\u2019s standard, it would have referenced <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50.2(b) and expressly explained that it was altering the statutory standard and that the Standard Statement should be similarly revised.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">Indeed, subsequent cases contain no indication that the Court made such a change. Three times since <em>Chun, </em>our Supreme Court has discussed at length the requirements of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50.2 and the adequacy and accuracy of the Standard Statement. <em>State v. O\u2019Driscoll, </em>215 <em>N.J. </em>461, 465-81, 73 A.3d 496 (2013) (addressing the reading of an outdated Standard Statement with incorrect penalties); <em>State v. Schmidt, </em>206 <em>N.J. </em>71, 72-89, 19 A.3d 457 (2011) (addressing the alleged incompleteness of the Standard Statement); <em>State v. Marquez, </em>202 <em>N.J. </em>485, 489-515, 998 A.2d 421 (2010) (addressing the need to make the Standard Statement intelligible to the suspect); <em>see also State v. Spell, </em>196 <em>N.J. </em>537, 538-40, 959 A.2d 1209 (2008) (addressing suggested changes to the Standard Statement). The Court quoted and referenced the Standard Statement\u2019s language that a copy of the test results will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>be provided \u201con request\u201d under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50.2(b). <em>Schmidt, supra, </em>206 <em>N.J. </em>at 75, 82, 19 A.3d 457; <em>accord O\u2019Driscoll, supra, </em>215 <em>N.J. </em>at 467, 73 A.3d 496; <em>Marquez, supra, </em>202 <em>N.J. </em>at 492, 500, 998 A.2d 421.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">For all these reasons, we hold that the Court\u2019s terse comment in <em>Chun </em>did not reject <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50.2(b)\u2019s standard for when a police officer is required to provide a copy of the results of a breath test.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Nor do we feel it appropriate to rewrite <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50.2(b) ourselves.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Accordingly, we reject the Law Division\u2019s finding of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">In any event, <em>Chun </em>did not discuss whether disclosure of the AIR on request, rather than in the police station, would require suppression. We hold that suppression of the AIR is not an appropriate remedy in the absence of prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-9\">The Law Division suggested that suppression was required because <em>Chun </em>\u201cdemanded that, as a precondition for admissibility of the results of a breathalyzer, the State was required to establish that: (1) the device was in working order and had been inspected according to procedure; (2) the operator was certified; and (3) the test was administered according to official procedure.\u201d <em>Chun, supra, </em>194 <em>N.J. </em>at 134, 943 A.2d 114 (citing <em>Romano v. Kimmelman, </em>96 <em>N.J. </em>66, 81, 474 A.2d 1 (1984)).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>Here, it was undisputed that the Alcotest device \u201cwas in good working order and that the operator of the device was appropriately qualified to administer the test.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Furthermore, the Municipal Court and the Law Division found that the test itself \u201cwas administered according to official procedure.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Both courts rejected defendant\u2019s challenges to the procedure of the test itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">By contrast, the issue here concerns only the timing of when a person receives a copy of the AIR \u2014 at the police station, on request, or in discovery. It in no way affects the validity of the already-completed Alcotest, or the already-recorded BAC. Delivery of a copy thus differs from the protocol designed to ensure the Alcotest is properly conducted and the test results are accurate. The Special Master stated that \u201cthe multiple-step testing protocol must be meticulously followed before the test result is admitted in evidence,\u201d and \u201c[i]f the test protocol or instructions are violated in any respect, the BAC reading must be rejected as evidence.\u201d <em>Special Master\u2019s Report, supra, </em>at 230, 234, 242, LEXIS at *267, 271, 280. He did not state that the timing of copy delivery should invalidate a valid test.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">Defendant here expressly declined to make a showing of prejudice from receiving the AIR at the beginning of the litigation rather than at the police station. Therefore, we see no basis to suppress her valid test results. <em>See State v. Wolfe, </em>431 <em>N.J.Super. </em>356, 363, 69 A.3d 164 (App.Div.2013) (refusing to exclude the AIR, despite the State\u2019s delay in providing a copy of the Alcotest foundational documents to the defendant, because he made \u201cno significant argument of prejudice\u201d), <em>certif. denied, </em>217 <em>N.J. </em>285, 87 A.3d 771 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">The Law Division also asserted that suppression was warranted because \u201cfailing to provide a copy of the AIR substantially interferes with the defendant\u2019s right to obtain independent testing under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50.2. By [ ] immediately providing a copy of the results, the individual is given a meaningful opportunity to challenge the results of the AIR.\u201d Thus, the Law Division rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>soned, \u201cthe failure to give the AIR deprives the defendant of a potential defense!.]\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">However, a tested person does not need a copy of the AIR to obtain independent testing under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50.2(c). Since 1982, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50.2(c) has provided that \u201cthe person tested shall be permitted to have such samples taken and chemical tests of his breath, urine or blood made by a person or physician of his own selection.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Defendants long have exercised that right without getting a copy of the breath test results at the police station.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">Furthermore, the AIR does not advise a tested person of their right to obtain independent testing. Rather, pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50.2(e), that advice is given when the officer reads the Standard Statement to the person, stating \u201cyou have the right, at your own expense, to have a person or physician of your own selection take independent samples of your breath, blood or urine for independent testing.\u201d <em>Standard Statement, supra. </em>The Law Division found that Officer Nelson read the Standard Statement to defendant. She has never contended she was unaware of her right to independent testing or was prevented from exercising it because she did not get a copy of the AIR at the police station.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">We recognize that giving tested persons a copy of the AIR at the police station informs them of their BAC results, as well as details about the test. However, the State long used breathalyzers which did not produce a printout with the BAC results. Nevertheless, neither the Legislature in drafting <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50.2(b), nor the Executive Branch in crafting the Standard Statement, found the right of independent testing required officers to inform persons at the police station of the BAC found by a breath test. Other than advising a defendant of the rights expressly set <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>forth in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50.2(b) and (c), \u201cthe statute sets forth no other affirmative duties on the part of the police.\u201d <em>Greeley, supra, </em>178 <em>N.J. </em>at 43, 834 A.2d 1016; see <em>State v. Howard, </em>383 <em>N.J.Super. </em>538, 549, 892 A.2d 751 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>187 <em>N.J. </em>80, 899 A.2d 303 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">Defendant already had an incentive to obtain independent testing to show she was not driving with an elevated BAC. She knew that her breath had been tested for BAC, and that she was being charged with drunk driving. An independent test might contradict any BAC found by the State\u2019s Aleotest, or undermine any testimony that she was observed \u201coperating] a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">In any event, it is defendant\u2019s burden to show that she would have sought independent testing absent the allegedly improper police conduct, and that \u201csuch an examination could have been conducted in a reasonable period of time so as to produce relevant or probative evidence.\u201d <em>State v. Hicks, </em>228 <em>N.J.Super. </em>541, 551 &amp; n. 4, 550 A.2d 512 (App.Div.1988), <em>certif. denied, </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>324, 604 A.2d 599 (1990); <em>see State v. Jalkiewicz, </em>303 <em>N.J.Super. </em>430, 434-35, 697 A.2d 155 (App.Div.1997). \u201c[S]o long as a defendant is informed of the right to an independent test, police conduct will warrant suppression of BAC test results only if that conduct affirmatively interferes with or thwarts a defendant\u2019s good-faith attempt to obtain an independent test.\u201d <em>Greeley, supra, </em>178 <em>N.J. </em>at 45, 834 A.2d 1016. Here, defendant has failed to carry her burden to show such prejudice, or that the police conduct \u201crender[ed] the statutory right meaningless.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 43, 834 A.2d 1016; <em>see Hicks, supra, </em>228 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 549, 550 A.2d 512. Because there was no \u201carbitrary deprivation of the right to an independent test, we reverse the [Law] Division\u2019s judgment suppressing the breath[ ] results and reinstate defendant\u2019s conviction.\u201d <em>Greeley, supra, </em>178 <em>N.J. </em>at 50, 834 A.2d 1016.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">Our decision is supported by consideration of the cost and benefit of suppressing the AIR that showed defendant\u2019s blood <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>alcohol level was 0.12%. Even when constitutional protections against search and seizure are at stake, courts: consider that \u201c \u2018[t]he exclusionary rule generates substantial social costs, which sometimes include setting the guilty free and the dangerous at large\u2019 are \u201c \u2018cautious against expanding it\u2019 and apply it only \u201c\u2018where its deterrence benefits outweigh its substantial social costs.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Gioe, </em>401 <em>N.J.Super. </em>331, 339, 950 A.2d 930 (App.Div.2008) (quoting <em>Hudson v. Michigan, </em>547 <em>U.S. </em>586, 591, 126 <em>S.Ct. </em>2159, 2163, 165 L.Ed.2d 56, 64 (2006)), <em>certif. denied, </em>199 <em>N.J. </em>129, 970 A.2d 1046 (2009). \u201cSometimes, the cost of excluding evidence is not justified by the rule and its purposes.\u201d <em>State v. Herrerra, </em>211 <em>N.J. </em>308, 330, 48 A.3d 1009 (2012). Such an analysis is even more crucial where no constitutional rights are at issue, as here. <em>E.g., Gioe, supra, </em>401 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 341-44, 950 A.2d 930 (declining to suppress evidence seized in violation of a rule).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">Suppressing a defendant\u2019s valid BAC results, and eliminating or substantially reducing the license suspension, subjects the public to a danger the Legislature sought to prevent. \u201c[T]he primary purpose behind our drunk driving laws is to remove intoxicated drivers from our roadways and thereby \u2018to curb the senseless havoc and destruction\u2019 caused by them.\u201d <em>Chun, supra, </em>194 <em>N.J. </em>at 71, 943 A.2d 114 (quoting <em>State v. Tischio, </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>504, 512, 527 A.2d 388 (1987)). The Legislature created the per se offense of driving with a BAC of 0.10% or higher \u201cto take into account \u2018mounting scientific findings,\u2019 to the effect that almost all drivers suffered reduced driving ability at a BAC of 0.10 percent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 72, 943 A.2d 114 (quoting <em>Tischio, supra, </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>at 516, 527 A.2d 388). The Legislature subsequently increased the period of license suspension for a first-offender to seven months. <em>Id. </em>at 74, 943 A.2d 114. License suspensions \u201c \u2018are mainly designed to protect the public by removing the offenders from the road.\u2019 \u201d <em>N.J. Div. of Motor Vehicles v. Egan, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>350, 357, 511 A.2d 133 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>On the other hand, providing a copy of the AIR to the suspect at the police station, rather than on request or in discovery, may produce benefits in limited circumstances. Persons being breath tested may be intoxicated, experiencing their first arrest, and unrepresented by counsel. Providing a copy of the AIR at the police station may benefit persons who, despite hearing the Standard Statement, fail to understand their right to request a copy, and do not make a request themselves, through counsel, or in discovery. Here, defendant did not claim she failed to understand the Standard Statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">Given the significant costs of suppressing valid BAC results, the limited benefits of the new obligation defendant seeks to impose, and her failure to show prejudice, we find suppression unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">In any event, we would not apply a new obligation requiring suppression retroactively. \u201c \u2018[A] case announces a new rule when it breaks new ground or imposes a new obligation on the State[.]\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Molina, </em>187 <em>N.J. </em>531, 543, 902 A.2d 200 (2006). The \u201c \u2018purpose of the [new] rule\u2019 \u201d must be weighed against \u201c \u2018the degree of reliance placed on the old rule\u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018the effect a retroactive application would have <em>on </em>the administration of justice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Here, law enforcement has long relied on <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50.2(b). Moreover, given the many Alcotests performed since the Attorney General approved the Alcotest for use in 1999, <em>see </em>31 <em>N.J.R. </em>770(b) (eff. Feb. 19,1999), retroactivity could have a substantial effect and \u201cwould expose the judicial system to the undue burden of resolving numerous concluded matters,\u201d <em>Olds v. Donnelly, </em>150 <em>N.J. </em>424, 450, 696 A.2d 633 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">Further, \u201cnew procedural rules generally do not apply retroactively.\u201d <em>State v. J.A., </em>398 <em>N.J.Super. </em>511, 526, 942 A.2d 149 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>196 <em>N.J. </em>462, 957 A.2d 1171 (2008). Moreover, where \u201cthe predominant purpose of the new rule is to deter illegal police conduct,\u201d that \u201cdeterrence purpose will not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>appreciably advanced by retroactive application to police conduct that has already occurred, [and] the new rule will be given prospective effect only.\u201d <em>State v.

I write separately because I differ with portions of the main opinion\u2019s discussion within Parts IV and V.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">My colleagues rightly acknowledge that \u201cproviding a copy of the AIR to the suspect at the police station, rather than on request or in discovery, may produce benefits in limited circumstances.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 496, 110 A.3d at 111. They also properly recognize that both the State Police and the Attorney General prescribe the AIR be supplied contemporaneously to the arrestee when the test is completed. <em>Id. </em>at 497-98, 110 A.3d at 112. They also recognize, as the State\u2019s attorney conceded before us at oral argument, that supplying the AIR to an arrestee on the spot is not apt to impose a great burden on the police. <em>Ibid. </em>They urge, as I do, that this recommended practice be followed. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">I part company with my colleagues because I support the Law Division judge\u2019s conclusion that immediate turnover of the AIR to an arrestee should be more than an aspirational goal. Because alcohol in a human\u2019s body dissipates quickly, time is of the essence. <em>See Missouri v. McNeely, </em>\u2014 U.S.-,-, 133 <em>S.Ct. </em>1552, 1560, 185 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>696, 706 (2013) (\u201cIt is true that as a result of the human body\u2019s natural metabolic processes, the alcohol level in a person\u2019s blood begins to dissipate once the alcohol is fully absorbed and continues to decline until the alcohol is eliminated.\u201d); <em>Schmerber v. California, </em>384 <em>U.S. </em>757, 771, 86 <em>S.Ct. </em>1826, 1836, 16 L.Ed.2d 908, 920 (1966) (noting that \u201cthe percentage of alcohol in the blood begins to diminish shortly after drinking stops, as the body functions to eliminate it from the system\u201d); <em>see also Chun, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number><em>ante, </em>194 <em>N.J. </em>at 76, 943 A.2d 114 (stating that \u201c[elimination of alcohol also starts as soon as the person begins to drink\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">An arrestee\u2019s right to obtain an independent test to challenge the police\u2019s AIR readings is essentially worthless if the arrestee does not act right away. The AIR contains various forms of material information, including the critical BAC levels that can indicate whether it might be worthwhile for the driver to take immediate action to obtain an independent test or to have her blood drawn for that purpose. <em>See Chun, ante, </em>194 <em>N.J. </em>at 82-83, 943 A.2d 114 (describing the information contained in the AIR); <em>see also </em>Ramsey, <em>N.J. Drunk Driving Law, ante, </em>\u00a7 10:25 at 390 (stating that \u201c[t]he alcohol influence report (AIR) is the key piece of discovery in an Aleotest 7110 case\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">For instance, if the BAC levels are borderline, an independent test potentially might produce levels that are below the legal limits, thereby rebutting the State\u2019s burden to prove guilt of DWI beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Campbell, </em>436 <em>N.J.Super. </em>264, 269, 93 A.3d 416 (App.Div.) (stating that \u201cwe have long required the State to establish the elements of a DWI offense by the heightened criminal standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d), <em>certif. denied, </em>220 <em>N.J. </em>208, 104 A.3d 1076 (2014). Conversely, the AIR may show that the driver\u2019s BAC is way above the limits, and further indicate no irregularity on its face, thereby suggesting that independent testing will be a fruitless exercise.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">Because DWI based on BAC levels is essentially a strict liability offense, the arrestee should act quickly, most likely in an emergent telephone consultation with an attorney, to decide whether to pursue independent testing. It is therefore important that the AIR be turned over to the arrestee as soon as the report is generated by the Aleotest device. In fact, the standard documents presently used statewide in the process reflect that a copy of the AIR is to be given on the spot to the driver. <em>See ante </em>at 479, 110 A. 3d at 101-02 (noting, in this case, the printing of the phrase \u201cCopy Given to Subject\u201d at the bottom of the AIR).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>Unlike my colleagues, I am not persuaded that the \u201con request\u201d language in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50.2(b) should be read to signify that the police are to turn over the AIR report only upon an arrestee\u2019s request.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Of course, if an arrestee makes such a request, the report certainly should be supplied. That said, I doubt that the Legislature has foreclosed the Judiciary, within its supervisory authority over the adjudication of DWI cases, from directing that the AIR be routinely turned over after the test has been administered, regardless of whether the arrestee specifically requests it. What could be the harm in that?</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">I do not construe the statute to require the police to withhold the AIR unless the arrestee specifically requests it. Nor do I read the statute to preclude the Judiciary from enhancing the procedural protections afforded to the tested driver. Indeed, the Supreme Court imposed in <em>Chun </em>various procedural and administrative requirements concerning the use of the Alcotest that go beyond what the statutes explicitly require. <em>See Chun, ante, </em>194 <em>N.J. </em>at 145, 943 A.2d 114 (noting, among other things, that the State must produce the most recent calibration report, the most recent new standard solution report, and the certificate of analysis of the 0.10 simulation solution used in defendant\u2019s test prior to admission of the AIR).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">Like the Law Division judge, I read the Court\u2019s statement in <em>Chun </em>that the Alcotest \u201coperator must retain a copy of the AIR and give a copy to the arrestee,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 82, 943 A.2d 114, as a sensible mandate, not a mere recommendation. The term \u201cmust\u201d within that passage is consistent with that interpretation. <em>See Thomas, ante, </em>188 <em>N.J. </em>at 149-50, 902 A.2d 1185; <em>Harvey, ante, </em>30 <em>N.J. </em>at 391, 153 A.2d 10 (observing that generally \u201cthe words <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>\u2018must\u2019 and \u2018shall\u2019 are ... mandatory\u201d). It is also consistent with the <em>Special Master\u2019s Report, ante.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">If the Supreme Court did not intend to require contemporaneous turnover of the AIR, or if it agrees with my colleagues that the statute forbids such a judicial gloss, then perhaps the Legislature might revise <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50.2(b) to require such automatic turnover. Doing so would be in the interests of justice, fairness, and the attainment of evidentially-sound dispositions in DWI cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">Despite the grave dangers and undeniable societal costs of drunk driving, it is well established that judicial suppression of BAC results may be an appropriate remedy in certain cases. <em>See McNeely, supra, </em>- <em>U.S. </em>at -, 133 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1567-68, 185 L.Ed.2d at 714-15; <em>see also Chun, ante, </em>194 <em>N.J. </em>at 145-49, 943 A.2d 114. Of course, the State may still prove guilt by other means, such as observation evidence, as potentially could have been done here. <em>See, e.g., State v. Kent, </em>391 <em>N.J.Super. </em>352, 383-85, 918 A.2d 626 (App.Div.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-10\">That said, I do not construe the law to require the automatic suppression of an Alcotest\u2019s BAC readings in every instance where, as in the present case, the police slip up and neglect to give the AIR contemporaneously to the arrested driver. As my colleagues point out, suppression of the BAC readings is not an appropriate remedy unless a defendant shows that a procedural error caused him or her actual prejudice. <em>Ante </em>at 492,110 A.3d at 109; <em>see also Greeley, ante, </em>178 <em>N.J. </em>at 45-46, 834 A.2d 1016.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-11\">No such actual prejudice is demonstrated in the present record, in which defendant\u2019s BAC reading of .12 is not borderline and where no arguable irregularity on the face of the AIR has been identified. In this respect, I believe the Law Division judge erred in treating the lack of turnover of the AIR as a compulsory basis for suppression. Instead, a case-by-case assessment of prejudice should be undertaken before the Alcotest results are excluded. An inconsequential failure by the police to turn over the AIR <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>report at the station house should not jeopardize an otherwise valid DWI prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">I also agree with my colleagues, <em>see ante </em>at 497-98, 110 A.3d at 112, that principles of suppression, if they were to be adopted in this context, would be prospective only, thereby affording law enforcement officials a reasonable opportunity to adjust to such potential future consequences. Since the Office of Attorney General (which, notably, is also the issuer of the Standard Statement that must be read to the arrestee) and the State Police already call for the AIR to be turned over on the spot to arrestees, it does not appear that a lengthy period of transition would be required.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">Having made these observations, I join in the reversal of the Law Division\u2019s judgment insofar as it vacated defendant\u2019s conviction under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4 \u2014 50(a)(l)(ii).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b528-7\"> The present situation differs from <em>Spell, ante, </em>395 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 337, 928 A.2d 921, cited by my colleagues, <em>see ante </em>at 491-92, 110 A.3d at 109, because automatic turnover of the AIR is, in my view at least, mandated by the Supreme Court in <em>Chun, ante, </em>194 <em>N.J. </em>at 82-83, 943 A.2d 114, and is not an innovation being crafted by this court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
