Wojtkowiak appeals from the finding by the Division on Civil Rights (Division) that there is no probable cause justifying her complaint under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5 \u2014 12(f) of New Jersey\u2019s Law Against Discrimination (LAD), <em>N.J.S.A </em>10:5-1 to - 42. The central issue on appeal is whether the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission (MVC) discriminated against her by requiring her to appear at the nearest MVC location to be photographed for her driver\u2019s license. We hold that where the extent of a LAD claimant\u2019s disability is relevant to the reasonableness of the accommodations offered or demanded, the claimant must establish it by expert medical evidence. Because the extent of complainant\u2019s disability is not readily apparent from her medical evidence, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-11\">The Division conducted an investigation of complainant\u2019s claim. The Division\u2019s Findings of Investigation included the following facts concerning the MVC photo requirement. In about 2002, the MVC began to require digital driver\u2019s licenses containing a digital picture, for which all applicants had to appear in person at the motor vehicle agency. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>39:3 \u2014 lOf; <em>see also N.J.S.A. </em>39:3-29.4. Around 2011, the MVC instituted the Enhanced Digital Driver\u2019s License (EDDL) system to comply with federal laws <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>imposing more stringent requirements for State identification cards.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">The EDDL system does not merely take photographs. Instead, it captures and stores photographic images, and scans all of the other photographic images in the camera system\u2019s photo database for duplicates. The EDDL camera system is highly sensitive. It requires a particular pose, and any deviation from that pose, such as a tilt of the head or an exaggerated facial expression, causes the associated computer software to indicate that the image does not comply with the requirements. The EDDL system then integrates the photograph with other driver\u2019s license information and imbeds the photograph into the driver\u2019s license. This is an integral part of the document\u2019s security features which ensures the digitally-reproduced image is resistant to forgery and substitution. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>39:3-10h.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">Shortly before the January 31, 2006 expiration of her driver\u2019s license, complainant wrote to the MVC. She said she suffered from agoraphobia and could not go to the MVC to renew her license, given the closure of the Berlin MVC location a few miles from her home. She requested an exception from the requirement that she appear in person to renew her license.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>The MVC responded that all applicants had to appear in person at a motor vehicle agency to have their digital photograph taken for the new digital driver\u2019s licenses, and that this requirement \u201cmay not be waived.\u201d The letter advised complainant that the MVC had opened a new motor vehicle agency in Turnersville on June 26, 2006, which \u201cmay be accessible to you by car.\u201d If not, the MVC added, complainant could make arrangements to be driven by a non-profit entity providing transportation for the disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">Around May 2007, the MVC also offered complainant the option of using their Mobile Unit when it was in her area. However, she did not utilize it before such mobile service ended, allegedly for budgetary reasons, in December 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">In August 2012, complainant again wrote the MVC, revealing she had been driving with an expired license almost every day for six years. She added that she had \u201cmade huge feats driving going further and not driving will make my progress regress.\u201d Complainant asked for a document that would allow her to drive and would serve as a government-issued photo ID. She complained that without an ID, she was unable to write checks, do banking, obtain a passport, or add her name to the deed of her home. Complainant asserted that the MVC\u2019s requirement that she appear at a MVC facility to have her photograph taken for license renewal was discriminatory. She again asked for waiver of the requirement, and offered to supply a recent photo of herself.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>Complainant provided the MVC with an August 1, 2012 letter, addressed \u201cTo Whom It May Concern,\u201d from a doctor of osteopathic medicine. The doctor\u2019s letter stated in full:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-5\">Robin Wojtkowiak is a 46 year old woman who is well known to our practice, having been our patient since 1998.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-6\">Robin has a longstanding history of agoraphobia and gets uncomfortable and anxious when out of her comfort zone. However, she is slowly progressing with exposure and desensitization techniques, and I am very hopeful for the future. I understand there is a question of her ability to drive. There is nothing medically to contraindicate her driving, and she tells me that she is totally able to drive comfortably within her safety zone of five miles from her home. She tells me she drives everyday [sic] to stores, restaurants, gym, etc.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-7\">Therefore, I do believe that Robin is physically and mentally able to handle the responsibilities of driving short distances alone. If I can be of any further assistance to you regarding this patient\u2019s medical condition, please do not hesitate to contact my office.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b38-8\">The MVC responded to complainant, acknowledging her claim that her agoraphobia \u201climits [her] travel to a \u2018comfort zone\u2019 of five miles\u201d was \u201ccorroborated\u201d by her doctor\u2019s letter. The MVC explained why it could not agree to waive the requirement. The MVC suggested that she appear at its nearest facility in Cherry Hill, and offered to schedule her appointment ahead of time, to arrange for her to be the first customer of the day, and to expedite her visit.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-9\">Complainant filed a complaint with the Division charging the MVC with discrimination. She alleged that \u201cdue to her disability, she is unable to venture the distance to personally visit [the MVC\u2019s] nearest office.\u201d She also alleged that she provided the MVC with the August 1, 2012 \u201cmedical certification of her disability and her limitations, specifically, her inability to drive any further than.five miles from her home.\u201d She argued the MVC could have waived its photo requirements or reactivated its mobile unit. She demanded relief including compensatory damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-10\">The MVC\u2019s answer admitted that complainant had been diagnosed with agoraphobia, and that it had received her doctor\u2019s August 1, 2012 letter. However, the MVC denied complainant had shown she was unable to venture the distance to the MVC\u2019s nearest office, \u201cleaving [her] mileage restrictions to her proofs.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>The MVC again noted the nearest location was in Cherry Hill, \u201capproximately 11 miles away\u201d from her home.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The MVC offered to open its facility \u201cearly or late in order that she would not be near any crowds. This accommodation has worked well with agoraphobic [persons] who have problems with crowds.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">The MVC\u2019s answer explained why it was necessary for complainant to be photographed using the EDDL system. It also reiterated the EDDL system\u2019s \u201clack of mobility.\u201d \u201cAn EDDL machine costs approximately $30,000 and needs to interface with multiple federal and state databases in order to create a driver[\u2019]s license. It is not a stand alone camera like the days when the mobile unit existed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">On June 6, 2013, after conducting an investigation, the Director of the Division issued a finding of \u201cno probable cause to credit the allegations of the complaint.\u201d In its Findings of Investigation, the Division correctly noted complainant was asking the MVC either \u201cto waive the EDDL\u201d photograph requirement by accepting a photograph taken with another camera, or to let her \u201cobtain a new license without going to the motor vehicle office\u201d by making the EDDL system mobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-8\">The Division found that for legal, technological, and security reasons the MVC could only accept a digital photograph taken on the EDDL camera system. The Division also found that the EDDL system is not mobile, and currently cannot be adapted to a mobile unit. The EDDL camera is mounted to the counter at the MVC locations, and moving the camera would invalidate the warranty and maintenance agreement with the vendor. Although the MVC was looking into the possibility of creating a mobile unit capable of taking an EDDL photograph, the MVC was unable to predict when that would be accomplished due to the complex technology involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>The Division concluded that \u201c[t]he investigation did not support Complainant\u2019s claim that she was discriminated against because of her disability. Rather, the investigation found that [the MVC] offered alternative access to its services.\u201d The Division\u2019s investigation also \u201cfound that accommodating Complainant\u2019s request ... would mean fundamentally altering the nature of [the MVC\u2019s] services.\u201d Because the investigation found \u201cinsufficient evidence to support Complainant\u2019s allegation of unlawful discrimination under the LAD,\u201d the Director ordered the file closed. Complainant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">The Legislature established the Division to administer and enforce the LAD. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-6. The Division has \u201cexpertise in recognizing acts of unlawful discrimination, no matter how subtle they may be.\u201d <em>Clowes v. Terminix Int'l, Inc., </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>575, 588, 538 A.2d 794 (1988); <em>see also Terry v. Mercer Cnty. Bd. of Chosen Freeholders, </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>141, 157, 430 A.2d 194 (1981) (noting the \u201cunique discretion and expertise\u201d of the Director to effectuate the policies underlying the LAD).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-8\">Under the LAD, a person claiming unlawful discrimination has the choice to \u201cinitiate suit in Superior Court,\u201d or file with the Division, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-13, taking advantage of the more expeditious administrative process. <em>See Hermann v. Fairleigh Dickinson Univ., </em>183 <em>N.J.Super. </em>500, 504-05, 444 A.2d 614 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>91 <em>N.J. </em>573, 453 A.2d 884 (1982). After conducting an investigation, the Director must determine whether there is probable cause of discriminatory conduct. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-14; <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:4-10.2(a). Probable cause exists if there is \u201creasonable ground of suspicion supported by facts and circumstances strong enough in themselves to warrant a cautious person in the belief that the [LAD] ... has been violated[.]\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:4-10.2(b). The Director\u2019s finding of no probable cause is a final order which may be appealed to this court. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-21; <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:4-10.2(c), (e).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>We accord \u201ca \u2018strong presumption of reasonableness\u2019 to an administrative agency\u2019s exercise of its statutorily delegated responsibilities.\u201d <em>Lavezzi v. State, </em>219 <em>N.J. </em>163, 171, 97 A.3d 681 (2014). \u201c[T]he Appellate Division\u2019s initial review of [the Director\u2019s] decision is a limited one. The court must survey the record to determine whether there is sufficient credible competent evidence in the record to support the agency head\u2019s conclusions.\u201d <em>Clowes, supra, </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>at 587, 538 A.2d 794. \u201c \u2018[T]his standard requires far more than a perfunctory review; it calls for careful and principled consideration of the agency record and findings[.]\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">We must give \u201c \u2018due regard also to the agency\u2019s expertise.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid. </em>We may reverse the Director\u2019s decision only if \u201cthe Director\u2019s \u2018finding is clearly a mistaken one and so plainly unwarranted that the interests of justice demand intervention and correction.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 588, 538 A.2d 794. \u201cUnder that standard of review, an appellate court will not upset an agency\u2019s ultimate determination unless the agency\u2019s decision is shown to have been \u2018arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable, or [ ] not supported by substantial credible evidence in the record as a whole.\u2019 \u201d <em>Barrick v. State, </em>218 <em>N.J. </em>247, 259, 94 A.3d 895 (2014); <em>In re Arenas, </em>385 <em>N.J.Super. </em>440, 443-44, 897 A.2d 442 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>188 <em>N.J. </em>219, 902 A.2d 1236 (2006). We must hew to our limited standard of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-8\">The LAD and its accompanying regulations have evolved to protect the disabled from discrimination. <em>Victor v. State, </em>203 <em>N.J. </em>383, 398-407, 4 A.3d 126 (2010). The LAD provides in <em>N.J.S.A. 10:5-4:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-9\">All persons shall have the opportunity ... to obtain all the accommodations, advantages, facilities, and privileges of any place of public accommodation ... without discrimination because of ... disability, ... subject only to conditions and limitations applicable alike to all persons. This opportunity is recognized as and declared to be a civil right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b42-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>It is unlawful discrimination to refuse, withhold, or deny that opportunity, or to discriminate in furnishing it, on account of disability. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-12(0(1); <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:13-4.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">The MVC does not dispute its locations are places of public accommodation. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-5(7); <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:13-4.2. \u201c[A] place of public accommodation shall, to the extent reasonable, afford goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, and accommodations to a person with a disability in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of that person.\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:13-4.4(a). Generally, such a place \u201cshall make reasonable accommodations to the limitations of a patron or prospective patron who is a person with a disability, including making such reasonable modifications in policies, practices, or procedures, as may be required to afford goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations to a person with a disability.\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:13-4.11(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">Accordingly, under the LAD, a claimant \u201cmust show that he or she (1) had a disability; (2) was otherwise qualified to participate in the activity or program at issue; and (3) was denied the benefits of the program or otherwise discriminated against because of his or her disability.\u201d <em>J.T. v. Dumont Pub. Schs., </em>438 <em>N.J.Super. </em>241, 264, 103 A.3d 269 (App.Div.2014). The claimant must also show \u201cwhether the accommodation was reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 264, 103 A.3d 269; <em>see Hall v. St. Joseph\u2019s Hosp., </em>343 <em>N.J.Super. </em>88, 109, 777 A.2d 1002 (App.Div.2001), <em>certif. denied, </em>171 <em>N.J. </em>336, 793 A.2d 715 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">Here, complainant showed she had a disability and was qualified to apply for a driver\u2019s license. To establish she was denied that opportunity because of her disability, she must show that the accommodations offered were not reasonable and that the accommodations demanded were \u201crequired\u201d to afford the services sought. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:13-4.11(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">Even if the accommodation sought would be required to provide the services, modification is not required if \u201cthe place of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>public accommodation demonstrates that making the accommodations would impose an undue burden on its operation.\u201d <em>Ibid.; Lasky v. Moorestown Twp., </em>425 <em>N.J.Super. </em>530, 544-46, 42 A.3d 212 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>212 <em>N.J. </em>198, 52 A.3d 176 (2012). \u201cIn determining whether an accommodation is unreasonable because it will impose an undue burden on the operation of a place of public accommodation, factors to be considered include\u201d the \u201coverall size\u201d of the entity, \u201c[t]he nature and cost of the accommodation sought,\u201d and \u201c[w]hether the accommodation sought will result in a fundamental alteration to the goods, services, program or activity offered.\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:13-4.11(b)(l)-(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">Here, complainant seeks to avoid \u201cconditions and limitations applicable alike to all persons,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-4, namely the MVC\u2019s requirement that an applicant for a driver\u2019s license must appear at a MVC location to be photographed using the EDDL system. She rejects the MVC\u2019s proposed accommodations to photograph her in that \u201cmost integrated setting.\u201d <em>N.J.AC. </em>13:13-4.4(a). Instead, she argues the MVC must bring the EDDL camera within her five-mile self-described \u201csafety zone,\u201d or forego full use of the EDDL system. However, she has not shown that the extent of her disability is such that the accommodations she demanded were \u201crequired\u201d to allow her to be photographed to obtain a valid license, or that the MVC\u2019s proposed accommodations were unreasonable. <em>N.J.AC. </em>13:13^4.11(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">A plaintiff claiming a mental disability has the burden to prove that disability. <em>Viscik v. Fowler Equip. Co., </em>173 <em>N.J. </em>1, 16-17, 800 A.2d 826 (2002). \u201cWhere the existence of a handicap is not readily apparent, expert medical evidence is required.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 16, 800 A.2d 826; <em>see Clowes, supra, </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>at 597, 538 A.2d 794 (rejecting a plaintiffs disability claim because there was no expert medical evidence he was an alcoholic). Similarly, a plaintiff has the burden to show the extent of the mental disability if the extent is relevant to the accommodations requested or offered. When the extent of the disability is not readily apparent, expert medical evidence is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>It is undisputed that complainant\u2019s agoraphobia is a \u201cdisability.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-5(q); <em>see N.J.AC. </em>13:13-1.8, -4.2; <em>see also Reeves v. Johnson Controls World Servs., Inc., </em>140 F.3d 144, 156 (2d Cir.1998). The Division and MVC also accepted as true her doctor\u2019s August 1, 2012 letter describing her condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">However, the doctor\u2019s letter did not explain which definition of agoraphobia he adopted in diagnosing complainant. <em>See, e.g., Reeves, supra, </em>140 F.3d at 148 n. 2 (defining agoraphobia as anxiety about being in situations from which escape might be difficult); <em>Sanchez v. ACAA, 247 </em>F.Supp.2d 61, 64 (D.P.R.2003) (fear of crowds); <em>State v. Freeman, </em>223 <em>N.J.Super. </em>92, 110, 538 A.2d 371 (App.Div.1988) (fear of open places), <em>certif. denied, </em>114 <em>N.J. </em>525, 555 A.2d 637 (1989). Complainant\u2019s appellate brief cites a definition from the website of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> but there is no indication that the doctor applied that definition, or that it fully applies to complainant, who is admittedly capable of traveling in a car. The doctor\u2019s failure to explain what definition he was applying to complainant compromises her ability to show the unreasonableness of the MVC\u2019s accommodations, such as allowing her to appear outside normal business hours, when crowds are absent.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">More important, the doctor\u2019s letter did not support the complaint\u2019s allegation that complainant\u2019s disability created an \u201cinability to drive any further than five miles from home.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Instead, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>letter simply stated that complainant was \u201ctotally able to drive comfortably within her safety zone of five miles from her home,\u201d and that she \u201cgets uncomfortable and anxious when out of her comfort zone.\u201d Discomfort and anxiety do not necessarily equate to total inability. Moreover, the doctor added that complainant \u201cis slowly progressing with exposure and desensitization techniques, and [he was] very hopeful for the future,\u201d which suggest that complainant could progress to drive slightly further on one occasion to be photographed.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">Equally important, the doctor, in reaffirming complainant\u2019s ability to \u201cdriv[e] short distances alone,\u201d did not explicitly address her ability to be transported by another driver. The doctor did not state whether similar discomfort and anxiety could or would be likely to arise for her as a passenger, or whether removing the challenges and worries of driving would lessen or remove her discomfort or anxiety. Moreover, the doctor did not address whether any discomfort and anxiety as a passenger would pose a safety concern, whether they would be addressable with medication, or whether they would render her unable to be transported as a passenger. Thus, the doctor\u2019s letter was inadequate to support the complaint\u2019s allegation that complainant was \u201cunable to venture the distance necessary to personally visit [the MVC\u2019s] nearest office.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">In sum, the doctor\u2019s letter failed to establish that complainant was incapable of driving, or being driven, for more than five miles on a single occasion. Even if it could be argued that such a conclusion was \u201cimplicit in the letter, we see no reason why, if that were the doctor\u2019s opinion, he could not have simply said [so] in unequivocal language.\u201d <em>Heitzman v. Monmouth Cnty., </em>321 <em>N.J.Super. </em>133, 141, 728 A.2d 297 (App.Div.1999). Accordingly, the doctor\u2019s letter \u201cfalls far short of the kind of expert medical opinion required to support a handicap discrimination claim.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(rejecting a disability discrimination claim because of the vagueness of the letter from plaintiffs doctor about the disability).</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>Indeed, complainant herself was less than definitive in asserting the effect of her disability on her ability to drive. In 2006, she told the MVC that she was comfortable driving within her boundaries, but that she did venture further on some days. In 2012, she stated that the nearest MVC office was beyond her boundaries, but that she had \u201cmade huge feats driving going further.\u201d She asked to be exempted from the driver\u2019s test \u201c[s]o if and when I do make it to the nearest [MVC], I could just renew.\u201d She later informed the Division\u2019s investigator that she \u201cmay be able to gradually increase her ability to go beyond her five mile limit.\u201d In any event, her assertion is inadequate to prove the extent of her disability because it is not sufficiently supported by expert medical evidence. <em>See Clowes, supra, </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>at 597-98, 538 A.2d 794.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">The LAD, unlike the federal statutes barring discrimination against the disabled, does not \u201crequire that the disability substantially limit a major life activity.\u201d <em>Victor, supra, </em>203 <em>N.J. </em>at 410 n. 11, 4 A.3d 126; <em>Tynan v. Vicinage 13 of the Superior Court, </em>351 <em>N.J.Super. </em>385, 397, 798 A.2d 648 (App.Div.2002). Nonetheless, the lack of sufficient expert medical evidence that complainant was incapable of driving, or being driven, more than five miles on a single occasion is crucial in considering the reasonableness of the accommodations offered and demanded. <em>See Tynan, supra, </em>351 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 398, 798 A.2d 648 (noting that, by defining disability broadly, the Legislature focused scrutiny on the accommodations \u201cin light of whatever physical or mental limitations the [complainant] presents\u201d). Absent such expert medical evidence, complainant cannot show that the MVC failed to \u201cmake reasonable accommodations to the limitations of a patron or prospective patron who is a person with a disability.\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:13-4.11(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">Similarly, without sufficient expert medical evidence, she cannot show that either of the accommodations she demanded were \u201crequired to afford\u201d her the photographic services and driver\u2019s license she sought. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:13-4.11(a), (b). First, she asserted the MVC had to remove the mounted EDDL camera and transport it to a location within five miles of her home to take her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>photograph, a process that risked damaging or disabling the expensive camera and voiding its warranty and maintenance agreement. Second, she contended the MVC had to allow her to substitute a digital photograph taken with a regular camera, which would not possess the sensitivity of the EDDL camera. Both alternatives also posed the problem of uploading a photograph taken remotely into the EDDL system to allow its computers and software to determine whether the photograph met its requirements, to compare it to the photographs in the EDDL database, and to imbed the photograph into the license with the integrated information.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">Where employment discrimination is alleged, the LAD \u201cdoes not cloak the disabled employee with the right to demand a particular accommodation,\u201d and \u201cnot every accommodation demand is a reasonable one.\u201d <em>Victor, supra, </em>203 <em>N.J. </em>at 423, 4 A.3d 126. If more than one reasonable accommodation is available, an employer \u201chas the ultimate discretion to choose between effective accommodations, and may choose the less expensive accommodation or the accommodation that is easier for it to provide.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 424, 4 A.3d 126 (internal quotation marks omitted). The same is true for a place of public accommodation. <em>See Estate of Nicolas v. Ocean Plaza Condo. Ass\u2019n, </em>388 <em>N.J.Super. </em>571, 588, 909 A.2d 1144 (App.Div.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">Here, complainant failed to show that the accommodations offered by the MVC were unreasonable. Therefore, we need not and do not determine whether either of the alternate accommodations complainant demanded would be: (1) possible given any technological and budgetary constraints; (2) compatible with security requirements; (3) permissible under federal and New Jersey law; or (4) reasonable if she had shown her disability rendered her incapable of driving, or being driven, more than five miles on a single occasion to be photographed.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-8\">We also need not resolve the issue raised by the parties and the Director, namely, whether an accommodation that permits complainant to obtain a driver\u2019s license without having her photograph <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>taken at a MVC location would \u201cimpose an undue burden on the operation of\u2019 the MVC. <em>See N.J.A.C. </em>13:13-4.11(a), (b). We acknowledge that such a decision could have substantial consequences for complainant and the MVC, that it may arise in the future for her or other plaintiffs, and that determining whether places of public accommodation are required to take their services to the disabled is a question of great import. However, we decline to resolve that question in this case \u201cbecause, in the end, this record is a poor vehicle in which to find the definitive answer to that important question.\u201d <em>Victor, supra, </em>203 <em>N.J. </em>at 422-23, 425, 4 A.3d 126 (declining to resolve an important legal question regarding disability, despite the plaintiffs \u201clong medical and psychological history that qualifies him as disabled,\u201d because there was no medical evidence of the particular disability on which his claim rested).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">Accordingly, \u201c[t]he Director\u2019s finding of no probable cause was not an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Sprague v. Glassboro State Coll., </em>161 <em>N.J.Super. </em>218, 225, 391 A.2d 558 (App.Div.1978). In reaching this conclusion under our standard of review, we by no means intend to minimize the genuine difficulties encountered by the many persons who suffer from agoraphobia. Nor do we minimize their rights to be protected from discrimination. Our conclusion affirming the Director\u2019s final agency decision is based upon the specific record in this matter. We hope that the analysis in this opinion will provide some guidance in the future, including to disabled persons seeking to substantiate their need for reasonable accommodations with sufficient competent proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-8\">Complainant also challenges the Division\u2019s investigation. The LAD\u2019s discovery procedures, like the probable cause determination, is designed to \u201cenabl[e] the agency to deal with large numbers of complaints as swiftly as possible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 226, 391 A.2d 558. After a complaint is filed, the Director \u201cshall cause prompt investigation to be made.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>10:5-14; <em>N.J.A.C. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>13:4M.l(b); <em>see N.J.S.A. </em>10:5 \u2014 8(d), (h). The Director may \u201cconduct such discovery procedures ... as shall be deemed necessary by the [Director] in any investigation.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5 \u2014 8(i). This \u201cdiscretionary authority to investigate\u201d is reviewable for an abuse of discretion. <em>Gallo v. Salesian Soc\u2019y, Inc., </em>290 <em>N.J.Super. </em>616, 650, 676 A.2d 580 (App.Div.1996); see <em>Howard Sav. Inst v. Francis, </em>133 <em>N.J.Super. </em>54, 60, 335 A.2d 80 (App.Div.1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">Here, the Division interviewed complainant. The Director then assigned an investigator who offered to receive written and oral information from complainant. The Division requested and obtained documents and information from the MVC, including the MVC\u2019s EDDL photo capture standards. The investigator also interviewed the MVC\u2019s information technology (IT) technicians. They explained why the EDDL Image Capturing System was not mobile and why taking the EDDL picture at a MVC location was necessary to comply with the facial recognition requirements. The investigator confirmed that the EDDL equipment was bolted down, and witnessed a demonstration of its use. The investigator reported this information to complainant, who had no response other than to demand an exception for herself. The investigator found complainant could not provide any pertinent information which would alter the outcome of the investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">Complainant argues that the investigator should have asked why the MVC could not have accepted a digital photo so long as it was in JPEG format, or why the EDDL system cannot be mobile. In fact, the investigator inquired into those issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-8\">Complainant also asserts the investigator should have asked the size of the MVC\u2019s budget, how much the MVC spends in accommodating disabled persons, and how much it would cost to provide the accommodations complainant requested. There is no indication she asked the investigator to ask those questions. Moreover, those questions pertain to the \u201cundue burden\u201d inquiry, and thus would not have changed the outcome, given complainant\u2019s failure to show her disability required those accommodations.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>In any event, if complainant wished to control the investigation, she \u201chad the alternative right to file a complaint in the Superior Court which would normally culminate in a full-scale plenary trial.\u201d <em>Sprague, supra, 161 N.J.Super. </em>at 225, 391 A.2d 558 (citing <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-27); see <em>also N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-13. \u201cHowever, having chosen to pursue her grievance administratively, that chosen remedy is exclusive while it is pending and when it has been concluded.\u201d <em>Hermann, supra, </em>183 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 504, 444 A.2d 614.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">Complainant proffers additional documents in her appellate appendix. She attaches advertising from the website of MorphoTrust USA, the manufacture of EDDL, stating its EDDL camera tower weighs 24.5 pounds, is mountable with a \u201cbolt down option\u201d that \u201c[s]eeures critical equipment,\u201d and is connected to computer monitors and data storage units using biometric identification and automated search engine software. She also includes an internet page about Florida\u2019s Licensing on Wheels mobile program which does not specify what photographic system is used in Florida\u2019s mobile units.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">There is no indication that complainant supplied those documents to the Director, even though she was given an opportunity to do so during the investigation. Moreover, those documents, and the news clippings indicating that the MVC uploaded many millions of photographs into its database, do not necessarily impugn the Director\u2019s investigation or conclusions. In any event, complainant\u2019s claim fails because she did not provide sufficient expert medical evidence of the extent of her condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-9\">Accordingly, we affirm the Director\u2019s finding of no probable cause. We add the following thoughts.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-10\">First, we must express our concern that complainant admittedly drove without a valid driver\u2019s license frequently from 2006 to 2012, and may be continuing to drive without a valid license. \u201cNo person shall drive a motor vehicle on a public highway in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>State unless the person ... is in possession of a ... basic driver\u2019s license\u201d issued to her in accordance with the motor vehicle laws. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:3-10. We in no way condone complainant\u2019s driving with an expired license.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">Second, our decision is based on the expert medical evidence before the Division, and addresses only the allegations of discrimination predating the decision of the Director. Because the need for a driver\u2019s license is continuing in nature, complainant is free to make a new request to the MVC to accommodate her disability, if it is supported by new and materially different expert medical evidence showing her disability at that time requires greater accommodation than the MVC offered in this litigation. The MVC would be obligated to consider such a request, and any subsequent refusal to provide \u201creasonable accommodations to the limitations of\u201d complainant\u2019s disability may be actionable under the LAD and its regulations. <em>See N.J.A.C. </em>13:13-4.11(a). Nothing in our opinion should be read to foreclose such a future request, relieve the MVC of the obligation to consider whether additional accommodations are required, or preclude an allegation of subsequent discrimination under the LAD. Nor does this opinion remove the need for the Division to address thoroughly any challenge to the reasonableness of any accommodations and any claim of an undue burden, based on the then-current technology, costs, and budgets that may exist at that time.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Deputy Attorney General representing the Division acknowledged at oral argument such a request would not be inappropriate because technology and complainant\u2019s medical condition can change.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">We recognize that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-27 provides that the Division\u2019s final determination \u201cshall exclude any other action, civil or criminal, based on the same grievance of the individual concerned.\u201d However, a claim of subsequent acts of discrimination, supported <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>by new and materially different expert medical evidence of complainant\u2019s limitations at that time, would not pose the same grievance.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b36-8\">The REAL ID Act of 2005 included a section on \"Improved Security for Driver's Licenses and Personal Identification Cards,\u201d <em>Pub.L. </em>No. 109-13, 119 <em>Stat. </em>311, reprinted as \u00a7\u00a7 201 to 207 (2005).
