(hereinafter the Division).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b167-11\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b167-12\">GUADAGNO, J.A.D.</author>\n<p id=\"b167-13\">We are asked again to determine when a parent\u2019s use of corporal punishment exceeds the boundaries of acceptable discipline and enters the proscribed area of child abuse. This perplexing issue is further complicated when the parents are confronted with a child who suffers from behavioral issues. The strain of dealing with an oppositional child can exact a toll on parents and occasionally lead to a reaction where the child is harmed. This case presents such a scenario.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-14\">In response to a profanity-laced outburst by her then fifteen-year-old son, S.H. (Scott),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> defendant S.H. (Susan) initiated a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>physical altercation with Scott which began with throwing a shoe at him and progressed to hitting him with her hands, striking him with a golf club, and biting him on his shoulder. The Division intervened and sought a finding of child abuse against Susan and her husband, M.H. (Mark).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">After a fact-finding hearing, the Family Part found that the parents did not abuse or neglect Scott. Rather, the judge found that Scott had provoked his mother and that her actions in striking and injuring him were therefore justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">The Division appeals the decision as to Susan only and argues that the judge erred in concluding that she did not abuse her son. The Law Guardian agrees with the Division that Susan abused Scott by inflicting excessive corporal punishment. For the reasons that follow, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-8\">Scott is the youngest of three children born to Susan and Mark. In 2012, Scott lived at home with his parents<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and two older sisters, Sa.H. (Sara), then age twenty-one, and So.H. (Sophie), then age nineteen. On Monday, December 10, 2012, Scott was at home sitting on a couch watching television when Sara noticed that several personal items were missing from her room, including a watch, sunglasses, a necklace, two gold rings, and two gold chains. Sara told Susan about the missing items, and Susan confronted Scott.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-9\">Scott got up from the couch and angrily responded to Susan, \u201cWhy the fuck you always blaming me for something?\u201d Susan then threw a shoe with a heel at Scott. When Susan threw a second shoe at him, Scott deflected it. Scott tried to walk away, but Susan grabbed him and began to hit him with her hands. When Scott again attempted to leave, Susan held him back. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>Eventually, Susan grabbed a golf club and began hitting Scott\u2019s legs with it. During the confrontation, Susan yelled, \u201cI told you to stop disrespecting me.\u201d Scott yelled back, \u201cGet the fuck off of me.\u201d When Scott took the first golf club away from Susan, she grabbed another, which Scott also took. During the struggle, Susan bit Scott at least three times on the back.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Mark entered the room and attempted to intervene. He later called the police. Before Scott left the home, he kicked several windows, breaking two of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">Later that day, Susan put Scott\u2019s bed, his clothing, and some of his possessions outside of the home. Scott did not return to the home for two days. During this time he did not eat or sleep, and, with no place to stay, he \u201cwalked the streets.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">When Scott returned home on December 12, 2012, a police officer was there. After Scott spoke with the officer, she left without taking any action. Scott slept on the couch that night and on Thursday, December 13, 2012, he returned to his high school. Before leaving the home that morning, Mark gave Scott money to buy lunch.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">Scott had been diagnosed with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and was enrolled as a special education student in his high school\u2019s Behavior Disability Program. Scott\u2019s high school developed an individualized education program (IEP)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>him, and the school\u2019s behaviorist, Alece Dickerson, was assigned as his case manager.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">On December 13, 2012, one of Scott\u2019s teachers informed Dickerson that Scott had bruises, scratches, and bite marks. Dickerson spoke with Scott and observed three large bite marks on his left shoulder and contusions and swelling on his left shin and knee. After consulting with the school nurse, Dickerson called the Division and reported the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">Caseworker Sharece Mitchell responded to the high school that afternoon. She observed and photographed Scott\u2019s injuries and conducted an extensive interview. In addition to describing the events of December 10, 2012, Scott informed Mitchell that he had been disciplined \u201cwith belts and other items around the home\u201d since the age of eight, but the corporal punishment had ended approximately two years before, once he was big enough to fight back. Scott explained that currently, he is disciplined by his parents by being put out of the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">Mitchell then contacted Susan, who refused to come to the high school to discuss the matter. Mitchell drove Scott home and, upon seeing the caseworker, Susan raised her hands in the air and stated, \u201c[Tjake me to jail.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">Mitchell attempted to discuss a family plan to address the problems with Scott, but Susan simply stated that she \u201cis done with [Scott].\u201d Mitchell told Susan that Scott\u2019s injuries required medical attention, but Susan replied that Scott is grown and if he needs medical attention, he can take himself to the hospital. Despite Mitchell\u2019s urging, Susan refused to engage in any discussion of the December 10, 2012 incident, Scott\u2019s injuries, appropriate Division services, or a plan moving forward.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-9\">When Mitchell stepped outside to consult with her supervisor, Scott overheard a conversation between Susan and one of his sisters. The sister told Susan, \u201c[H]e called DYFS on us.\u201d Susan replied, \u201cI should\u2019ve broke his leg.\u201d Scott relayed the conversation to Mitchell and said he had to get out of the home.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>When Mitchell attempted to reengage Susan about seeking medical attention for Scott\u2019s injuries, Susan said that both Mitchell and Scott had to leave the home. As the caseworker left with Scott, Susan told Mark, \u201cI told [Mitchell] to take him. I\u2019ll go to court. They think they can do better, let them take him and see.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">Mitchell took Scott to a hospital, where he was diagnosed with human bites, lower leg contusions, and swelling on his shin. He was prescribed antibiotics for the bite wounds, and was placed in a shelter that night.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">On December 14, 2012, Mitchell again attempted to discuss a plan for the family with Susan to no avail. Susan stated that she had \u201cslept like a baby\u201d the night before, and was no longer \u201cdoing anything for\u201d or \u201cworrying about\u201d Scott.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">On December 17, 2012, the Division filed a complaint and was granted custody of Scott. On December 31, 2012, Mitchell contacted Susan to attempt to schedule a meeting to discuss services and a reunification plan. Susan again refused, repeating several times that she \u201cis not doing anything\u201d for Scott. Susan did state that Scott could return home if he wanted to, but Scott initially refused and remained in a foster placement. He later reconsidered and was permitted to return home in May 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">The Division sought findings of abuse or neglect against both parents. A fact-finding hearing was conducted over three days in April and May 2013. The Division called caseworker Mitchell and Alece Dickerson. Susan called her daughters Sara and Sophie.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-9\">The judge issued an oral decision concluding that neither parent had abused or neglected Scott, and that Susan\u2019s actions did not rise to the level of abuse. The court found that Scott\u2019s use of profanity \u201cprovoked\u201d Susan\u2019s acts, which were therefore justified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-10\">I think a mother being cursed at with the F word when she approaches [her] son who is lying on the couch continuing behavior that has been problematic to her otherwise stable and happy family and is confronted with the F word spoken to her face has a right to be angry, or has a \u2014 understandably can be angry at that. And that just might be a trigger that could set someone off, that would set her to throw something like a shoe.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>She \u2014 I look [at] that provocation and I look at what she was clearly dealing with with [Scott\u2019s] behavior, him not coming home, with him being constantly disrespectful to her, to him cutting school, to causing all kinds of problems. Apparently ... this was something she was unaccustomed to ... because her daughters, at minimum, finished high school without causing any trouble. And so she was provoked.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">The judge concluded that Dickerson\u2019s referral of Scott\u2019s injuries and the subsequent response by the Division was a \u201csecond provocation\u201d of Susan by Scott. The court dismissed Susan\u2019s comment that she should have broken Scott\u2019s legs as \u201csomeone speaking in anger and speaking in frustration----\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">Although Susan did not testify, the judge appeared to excuse her refusal to cooperate with the Division by finding that she \u201cwas annoyed, upset, and embarrassed for a couple of weeks\u201d over the incident. The judge found that at the time of the fact-finding, Susan was \u201cextremely remorseful\u201d and \u201cdesperate to engage in services now.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">Our review of a trial court\u2019s fact-finding function is limited. <em>Cesare v. Cesare, </em>154 <em>N.J. </em>394, 411, 713 A.2d 390 (1998). These findings are binding on appeal when supported by adequate, substantial, and credible evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 411-12, 713 A.2d 390 (quoting <em>Rova Farms Resort, Inc. v. Investors Ins. Co., </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>474, 484, 323 A.2d 495 (1974)). That said, our review is less constricted when the \u201cfocus is not on credibility but alleged error in the trial judge\u2019s evaluation of the underlying facts and the implications to be drawn therefrom.\u201d <em>N.J. Div. of Youth &amp; Family Servs. v. C.S., </em>367 <em>N.J.Super. </em>76, 112, 842 A.2d 215 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>180 <em>N.J. </em>456, 852 A.2d 192 (2004). Likewise, the trial court\u2019s interpretation of the law is not entitled to deference on appeal. <em>N.J. Div. of Youth &amp; Family Servs. v. I.S., </em>202 <em>N.J. </em>145, 183, 996 A.2d 986 (2010) (citing <em>Manalapan Realty, L.P. v. Twp. Comm. of Manalapan, </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>366, 378, 658 A.2d 1230 (1995)).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>A Title Nine inquiry should focus on harm to the child, rather than on the intent of the caregiver. <em>G.S. v. Dep\u2019t of Human Servs., </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>161, 180, 723 A.2d 612 (1999). Indeed, a parent is liable for both the intended and unintended harms that result from his or her intentional acts. <em>Id. </em>at 178, 723 A.2d 612. \u201cChild abuse\u201d thus covers \u201csituations ranging from slight inadvertence to malicious purpose to inflict injury.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">\u201cExcessive corporal punishment\u201d is not defined by statute, but is determined on a case-by-case basis. <em>N.J. Div. of Youth &amp; Family Servs. v. K.A., </em>413 <em>N.J.Super. </em>504, 511, 996 A.2d 1040 (App.Div.2010), <em>appeal dismissed as improvidently granted, </em>208 <em>N.J. </em>355, 28 A.3d 1244 (2011). As the trial court relied on <em>KA, </em>we discuss that case in detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">In <em>KA, </em>a mother who was helping her daughter with her homework admitted to striking the child four or five times with a closed fist on her shoulder when the child would not obey her instructions to complete the homework, and then refused to stay in her room when she was sent there for a time-out. <em>Id. </em>at 505-06, 996 A.2d 1040. At the time of the incident, the child was eight years old and had been diagnosed with pervasive development disorder and attention deficient disorder. <em>Id. </em>at 506, 996 A.2d 1040. The child suffered four small bruises and one slightly larger bruise that caused a mild discoloration of the skin. <em>Ibid. </em>The mother admitted to striking the child, and explained that \u201cshe was very stressed and overwhelmed in caring for [the child] because [her] father worked until approximately nine o\u2019clock in the evening and then took work calls ... until midnight every night.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 506-07, 996 A.2d 1040.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">The Division sought a finding of abuse or neglect against the mother. An administrative law judge found that the Division had not met its burden of proving that the mother used excessive corporal punishment. <em>Id. </em>at 508, 996 A.2d 1040. The Director rejected those findings, concluding that the act of repeatedly hitting the child with a closed fist, with sufficient force to leave bruises, qualified as abuse. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>The panel reversed, noting that \u201cthe force used did not lacerate the child\u2019s skin and did not require any type of medical intervention.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 512-13, 996 A.2d 1040. Because there was no proof of \u201cper se excessive corporal punishment,\u201d the panel \u201cexamine[d] the circumstances facing K.A. to determine whether striking [the child] five times on the shoulder with a closed fist amounted to <em>excessive </em>corporal punishment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 512, 996 A.2d 1040. The panel found that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-5\">K.A. was confronted with a psychologically disruptive child, unable or unwilling to follow verbal instructions or adhere to passive means of discipline such as a timeout. K.A. was alone, without support from either her spouse/co-parent or fi-om other members of her extended family, such as an experienced mother or aunt. Out of sheer frustration, or through an ill-advised impulse, she struck her child five times. These blows, though undoubtedly painful, did not cause the child any permanent harm, did not require medical intervention of any kind, and were not part of a pattern of abuse.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-6\">[.Ibid.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">The panel also noted that the mother \u201caccepted full responsibility for her actions, was contrite, and complied with Division-sponsored counseling.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">We find that <em>K.A. </em>is readily distinguishable from the facts herein, primarily due to the nature and extent of the injuries to Scott and the instrumentalities used to inflict them. In <em>N.J. Div. of Youth &amp; Family Servs. v. P.W.R., </em>the Court held that a stepmother\u2019s occasional slaps to her sixteen-year-old\u2019s face did not constitute excessive corporal punishment as a matter of law because they did not leave any bruises or marks. 205 <em>N.J. </em>17, 36,11 A.3d 844 (2011). In contrast, excessive corporal punishment was found where a mother used a belt to hit her six-year-old son and left visible welts. <em>N.J. Div. of Youth &amp; Family Servs. v. B.H., </em>391 <em>N.J.Super. </em>322, 340, 918 A.2d 63 (App.Div.2007). Similarly, a mother inflicted excessive corporal punishment by beating her daughter with a paddle in the face, arms, and legs. <em>N.J. Div. of Youth &amp; Family Servs. v. C.H., </em>414 <em>N.J.Super. </em>472, 476, 999 A.2d 501 (App.Div.2010). In both <em>B.H. </em>and <em>C.H., </em>our conclusions were based on the use of an instrument to hit the child with such force that visible marks were left, the unreasonable and disproportion<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>ate parental response, and the fact that the incidents were not isolated but part of a pattern of physical punishment. <em>See B.H., supra, </em>391 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 338-40, 918 A.2d 63; <em>C.H., supra, </em>414 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 481, 999 A.2d 501.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">Similarly, Susan\u2019s undisputed use of golf clubs and her teeth in causing Scott\u2019s injuries, along with the resulting trauma, distinguishes this case from the \u201coccasional slap\u201d discipline in <em>P.W.R. </em>In addition, Scott\u2019s use of profanity did not justify Susan\u2019s unreasonable and disproportionate response.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">We also reject the judge\u2019s conclusion that Scott\u2019s injuries did not manifest excessive corporal punishment because the Division \u201cdid not find that the injuries required immediate attention____\u201d The Division did not learn of Scott\u2019s injuries for three days. After viewing the bite marks on Scott\u2019s back and the bruising to his leg, caseworker Mitchell informed Susan that Scott had \u201csustained injuries\u201d and asked her if she would be willing to take him to the hospital \u201cto be seen by a doctor.\u201d When Susan refused, Mitchell took Scott to the emergency room at Muhlenberg Hospital. When Mitchell learned that Muhlenberg was too crowded, she took Scott to the emergency room at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital. There he was seen by Dr. Michael Bernstein, who ordered x-rays of Scott\u2019s left shoulder, tibia, and fibula.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-9\">Dr. Bernstein diagnosed Scott with a contusion of the lower extremity and human bites. While no fractures were detected, Dr. Bernstein prescribed Augmentin, an antibiotic, and a follow-up visit with a primary care physician within two to three days. The court\u2019s conclusion that the Division did not find that Scott\u2019s injuries required immediate attention and that the trip to the emergency room was part of a routine pre-placement physical is contradicted by these facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-10\">We also reject the court\u2019s conclusion that Susan\u2019s actions were provoked by Scott. Neither Susan nor Scott testified at the fact-finding hearing and the Family Part judge was left to determine the facts through statements they made to third parties, Mitchell <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>and Dickerson, and the observations of Sara and Sophie. Based on this record, several facts are undisputed: Scott was sitting on a couch watching television when Susan accused him of stealing items from his sister\u2019s room. Scott angrily denied the allegations and employed the \u201cf-word\u201d expletive. The use of this profanity apparently prompted Susan to throw two shoes at Scott, strike him in the legs with a golf club, and bite him several times on the shoulder. It is also undisputed that Scott attempted to leave the room but was prevented from doing so by Susan, who grabbed him and attempted to hold him back.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">While we do not condone the use of coarse or vulgar language by a child when directed at a parent, we find no evidence in the record that Scott\u2019s denial of his mother\u2019s accusation, which included a passing expletive, was intended to provoke Susan\u2019s actions. Indeed, as the conflict escalated with Susan throwing a shoe at Scott, he attempted to defuse it by leaving the room. It was Susan who fueled the escalation by grabbing Scott in an attempt to keep him in the room. The assault with the golf club and the biting followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">The court\u2019s conclusion that Scott\u2019s \u201cbringing the Division to [Susan\u2019s] home\u201d constituted a \u201csecond provocation\u201d is unsupported by any facts in the record and inapposite to controlling law. First, it was not Scott who reported the incident to the Division. Dickerson testified that she called the Division after one of Scott\u2019s teachers told her of his injuries. Moreover, Dickerson was statutorily obligated to report the injuries to the Division, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.10, and the Division, in turn, was obligated to investigate the incident. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.18. The court\u2019s suggestion that Scott was responsible for the referral and did so to provoke his mother finds no support in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">We also note the incongruity in the court\u2019s conclusion that the utterance of a single profanity by Scott justified Susan\u2019s assault, while her own statement that she should have broken Scott\u2019s legs was dismissed as \u201csomeone speaking in anger and speaking in frustration____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>Nor do we find evidence to support the court\u2019s conclusion that Susan was remorseful. The record shows the opposite. Susan refused to take Scott to the hospital after being told that Scott\u2019s injuries required medical attention; she initially refused to participate in services including counseling; and refused to even meet with the caseworker to discuss reunification. We are especially doubtful as to the court\u2019s conclusion that when Susan raised her hands and told the caseworker to \u201ctake me to jail,\u201d she was somehow expressing remorse.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">While Susan ultimately agreed to participate in services and permitted Scott to move back into the house, this did not occur until almost six months after Scott\u2019s removal, during which time he lived in a shelter over Christmas and then a foster home. We find little if any evidence to support the court\u2019s conclusion that Susan ever expressed remorse or'contrition for her actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">Finally, given the judge\u2019s reliance on <em>K.A., </em>we take this opportunity to clarify our understanding of comments made by the <em>K.A. </em>panel regarding the consideration that must be extended to a parent confronted with misbehavior by a child with behavioral disorders.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">The panel held that \u201cthe trying circumstances which [the mother] was undergoing due to [her child\u2019s] psychological disorder\u201d was a factor to be considered in determining whether the defendant used excessive corporal punishment. <em>K.A., supra, </em>413 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 512, 996 A.2d 1040.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-9\">Similarly, Scott was enrolled in special education classes and by his own admission suffered from ADHD. As the judge remarked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A8N\">He does appear to me lo be a slightly out-of-control kid. Maybe not oven slightly. He appears to me to be out of control and presenting challenges that the mother is \u2014 and father are having difficulty dealing with and clearly are in need of the services of the Division!. ]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b177-10\">We do not read <em>KA. </em>to suggest that the test for determining excessive corporal punishment should be any different when the child has a disability. While these children may be more difficult to control, present additional challenges to a family, and be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>unresponsive to traditional forms of discipline, they are entitled to the same protection under Title Nine as non-disabled children. We read <em>KA </em>to hold only that the underlying behavior of a child, with or without a disability, can be a relevant factor among the totality of circumstances in assessing the reasonableness of the parent\u2019s response to the child\u2019s outburst. The panel in <em>K.A. </em>found that the child\u2019s repeated defiance despite her mother\u2019s oral instructions created a trying situation that was relevant in determining the reasonableness of the mother\u2019s response. Here, Scott\u2019s use of profanity did not justify Susan\u2019s violent response.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">As noted earlier, we defer to the trial judge\u2019s finding of the facts, but we owe no deference to the legal conclusion drawn by the judge from those facts. It is here that we part company with the trial judge\u2019s decision and conclude that the injuries inflicted on Scott by Susan are sufficient to support a finding of abuse or neglect. Given this finding, we need not consider the Division\u2019s contention that Susan abandoned Scott by refusing to have him medically evaluated, and demanding that the Division remove him from the family home.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">Reversed and remanded for the entry of an order finding that Susan abused or neglected Scott.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b167-15\"> We employ pseudonyms to protect the privacy of the minors and for ease of reference.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b168-10\"> Mark also resides in Delaware but returns to the New Jersey home when his work permits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b169-9\"><em> </em>Scott stated to a Division caseworker that Mark bit him and tried to hit him, and that Susan bit him while he was struggling with Mark. Sara testified that Mark did not become involved physically, and that Susan bit Scott. The trial court credited Sara's version of these events, under which Mark was not involved in the assault, and Susan was the only person biting Scott. As the doctor found three separate bite marks on Scott, the court's finding leads to the conclusion that Susan bit Scott three times.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b169-13\"> An IEP is a comprehensive written plan developed by a team consisting of the student\u2019s parents, teachers, and representatives of the local educational agency. 20 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1414(d).
