He challenges the imputation of income to the parties for the purpose of calculating child support and limited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>duration alimony payable to plaintiff Jordana Elrom. Defendant also challenges supplemental child support added for child care and extracurricular activities, the allocation of assets equitably distributed, and appeals from a February 21, 2018 order denying reconsideration of the FJOD\u2019s terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">Following our review of the issues raised on appeal, in light of the record and the applicable law, we agree the judge erred in increasing child support by work-related child-care costs during a period of plaintiffs unemployment and the cost of the children\u2019s everyday extracurricular activity expenses, which generally are included in the amount of child support. In all other respects, including the imputation of income, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">The facts pertinent to our review are taken from the five-day trial record. The parties appeared self-represented and presented testimony regarding their incomes, along with fact testimony from plaintiffs father and expert testimony. Numerous documents were introduced into evidence regarding the parties\u2019 respective incomes, expenses, and assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">The parties, who are now thirty-eight, were married in February 2005 and separated in September 2010. They have two young children, who were born in 2008 and 2010. Prior Family Division proceedings between the parties were consolidated into this matter (FD-02-435-11) or dismissed. Although the parties litigated custody and parenting time at trial, they successfully mediated an agreement, largely resolving custody issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-9\">Plaintiff is an attorney, licensed to practice in New York and New Jersey. When she married defendant, she worked in Newark earning an annual salary of $102,000. Thereafter, she took a position with a New York firm, earning $175,000 per year. In early 2008, just prior to the birth of the parties\u2019 first child, plaintiff was laid off. She testified the parties agreed she would stay home to raise the children, possibly working part-time. In 2009, plaintiff commenced part-time employment, working ten to fifteen hours per week. When the parties separated, she earned $67.50 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>per hour, working approximately twenty-six hours per week. Plaintiff next secured an associate\u2019s position earning $80,640, but lost her job prior to trial. Asserting child-care obligations required she \u201cfocus her job search on New Jersey firms,\u201d plaintiff intended to seek a New Jersey position and asked \u201cthe [cjourt impute [to] her a salary of $80,640.00.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">Defendant is a software engineer, technical writer, web developer, and entrepreneur. In the past, he held positions with Sigma, HBO, Weight Watchers, and MTV. During an earlier non-dissolution matter, he earned $193,375 per year as a consultant for HBO. Before trial, he changed jobs, and was employed as the chief technical officer for ChatAnd Inc. (ChatAnd), earning a base salary of $120,000, with potential to earn as much as $295,000. Defendant also owned Elrom LLC, which performed consulting services, sponsored an annual technology trade show, and participated in several start-up companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">At trial, plaintiff produced documents evincing defendant\u2019s income, and explained he was not compliant with her discovery demands. Plaintiff asserted during the marriage, defendant received income from \u201cclients on the side\u201d and royalties from three books he authored. Plaintiff also discovered defendant started a company in Las Vegas on February 2, 2012, called Effective Idea, LLC, and withdrew funds from Elrom LLC\u2019s account, which he transferred to an account at Banca Privada d\u2019Andorra. Defendant stipulated the Andorra account held $67,978.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">As to the marital standard of living, plaintiff explained the parties lived an \u201cupper middle class, at times, lavish lifestyle\u201d before the children were born. They owned a New York City apartment. When they moved to Englewood in anticipation of the birth of their second child, they rented their apartment. After separating, defendant moved to New York City, while plaintiff and the children moved into her parents\u2019 home in Montville.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>had residential custody of the children. She sought alimony and listed her actual expenses \u201cto the penny\u201d in an amended case information statement (CIS).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">Larry Frankel, CPA, CFF, plaintiffs expert forensic accountant, examined monies deposited into the parties\u2019 various bank accounts to calculate defendant\u2019s annual income. Frankel concluded deposits into Elrom LLC\u2019s account from January 2009 to February 2012, totaled $903,241. Reducing the sums by an estimated twenty to thirty percent for overhead, he asserted profit, exclusive of taxes, amounted to seventy to eighty percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">Defendant countered with testimony from his forensic employability expert Gary Young, whose vocational evaluations addressed the likely earnings of the parties. Young\u2019s reports were not provided in the appellate record.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">Young concluded defendant was likely to earn $120,000 annually as a software engineer and technical writer. He based this opinion on his review of defendant\u2019s resume and a telephone interview, but acknowledged he was not provided with defendant\u2019s ChatAnd contract, and did not consider defendant\u2019s earning capacity as a consultant.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">Young also offered testimony regarding plaintiffs employability, although he did not interview her. After considering her degrees and bar admissions, he conducted research using Internet sources and suggested her earning possibilities, primarily in New York City, ranged from \u201c$108,740 to $177,850.\u201d Young did not factor parenting responsibilities, the children\u2019s special needs, or day care availability into this calculus.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-9\">Defendant next offered Jonathan Klopchin, a credentialed IT recruiter. His report is not included in the record. Evaluating defendant\u2019s experience with \u201cFlash, Flex, Front and implementation\u201d technologies, which Klopchin explained were declining in demand, he asserted a full-time Flex engineer could make $100,000 to $150,000, although some Flex developers could garner more than $200,000, which was \u201cmore the exception than the rule.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>He stated a Flex consultant would be \u201cfortunate to get [$]90 an hour\u201d and \u201ca lead developer\u201d could earn $165,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">During defendant\u2019s direct testimony, he asserted the actual gross receipts of Elrom LLC for 2010 were merely $145,000. He argued Frankel\u2019s use of deposits inflated estimated income because it included rental receipts from the New York City apartment and funds withdrawn but re-deposited. However, defendant later admitted he received receipts of $19,000 in royalties and $88,000 from consulting, and spent $11,000 in payroll expenses. The sums, along with his salary, make his total 2010 income $252,000. Defendant discussed his reported receipts in 2011, as captured on Schedule C of his federal tax return, which totaled $250,000.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He mentioned $206,000 in consulting fees from HBO, a position he lost. Defendant also asserted ChatAnd just terminated his services, and his last paycheck was July 27, 2012. Defendant suggested $120,000 per year should be imputed to him, as opined by Young.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">Following trial, the judge issued a written opinion granting plaintiffs request for divorce. Addressing the collateral issues arising upon the dissolution of the marriage, the judgment awarded plaintiff limited duration alimony for three years in the amount of $1,000 per week \u201cbased upon the differential in their earnings, [pjlaintiff s needs and [defendant's ability to pay.\u201d The judgment further ordered defendant to pay child support in the amount of $697 per week, which included insurance premiums and work-related child care, plus fifty percent of the children\u2019s uncovered medical costs, exceeding $250 per child, and fifty percent of the children\u2019s extracurricular and sporting activity fees, provided defendant consents to their participation in advance. Defendant received an $8,702 credit for overpayment of work-related childcare expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>In calculating support, the judge found plaintiffs income was represented by her last full-time job, as an associate attorney in New Jersey, and imputed $80,640 per year. The judge rejected defendant\u2019s argument to limit his earning ability to $120,000. Rather, after considering defendant\u2019s historic earnings, which were \u201creadily ascertainable from his limited liability company and personal bank statements over the past three years ... as examined and quantified by [pjlaintiffs forensic accounting expert, [Frankel],\u201d the judge imputed gross income to defendant of $230,731.42 per year, calculating the three-year average gross receipts and factoring an \u201cexpense-out rate of 20%.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">Equitably distributing the parties\u2019 marital assets, she ordered: an equal division of the bank account associated with rental receipts from their former New York City apartment; plaintiff receive $11,000 to equalize the values of the parties\u2019 respective automobiles; plaintiff retain her three retirement accounts and personal property; and defendant retain Elrom LLC, any other start-up companies in which he held an interest, and his personal property.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">Both parties moved for reconsideration of the provisions of the FJOD. The motions were denied and this appeal followed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">On appeal, defendant attacks the imputed income levels for each party, arguing the income level imputed to him was too high and the level imputed to plaintiff was too low. Defendant also argues the judge erred in adding child-care and the children\u2019s extracurricular activity costs as additional child support. Finally, defendant challenges the equitable division of the parties\u2019 assets. We consider these issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">Our review of a trial judge\u2019s factual findings, following a non-jury trial, is limited. <em>Cesare v. Cesare, </em>154 <em>N.J. </em>394, 411, 713 A.2d 390 (1998). Generally, \u201cfindings by the trial court are binding on appeal when supported by adequate, substantial, credible evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 411-12, 713 A.2d 390. In matrimonial matters, this \u201c[djeference is especially appropriate when the evidence is largely testimonial and involves questions of credibility,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 412, 713 A.2d 390 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted), because the trial judge has \u201ca feel of the case\u201d and is in the best position to \u201cmake first-hand credibility judgments about the witnesses who appear on the stand.\u201d <em>N.J. Div. of Youth &amp; Family Servs. v. E.P., </em>196 <em>N.J. </em>88, 104, 952 A.2d 436 (2008).

Consequently, when a reviewing court concludes there is satisfactory evidentiary support for the trial court\u2019s findings, \u201c \u2018its task is complete and it should not disturb the result____\u2019\u201d <em>Beck v.

Weis, </em>430 <em>N.J.Super. </em>552, 568, 66 A.3d 157 (App.Div.2013). Finally, legal conclusions are always re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>viewed de novo. <em>Manalapan Realty, L.P. v. Twp. Comm. of Manalapan, </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>366, 378, 658 A.2d 1230 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">Defendant <em>urges </em>income imputation is reserved for parties who, without just cause, are intentionally and voluntarily unemployed or underemployed. Because he was working, he argues his circumstances do not trigger income imputation and his salary should have been accepted as an appropriate earning level when fixing support. Defendant also argues imputation principles require an increase in plaintiffs income, not mere acceptance of the modest salary she last earned. We reject the legal premise as applied, and note the facts of record belie defendant\u2019s contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">\u201c \u2018Imputation of income is a discretionary matter not capable of precise or exact determination!;,] but rather require[es] a trial judge to realistically appraise capacity to earn and job availability.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gnall v. Gnall, </em>432 <em>N.J.Super. </em>129, 158, 74 A.3d 58 (App.Div.2013) (quoting <em>Storey v. Storey, </em>373 <em>N.J.Super. </em>464, 474, 862 A.2d 551 (App.Div.2004)), <em>certif. granted, </em>217 <em>N.J. </em>52, 84 A.3d 601 (2014). While an \u201cabuse of discretion ... defies precise definition,\u201d we will not reverse the decision absent a finding the judge\u2019s decision \u201crested on an impermissible basis,\u201d considered \u201cirrelevant or inappropriate factors,\u201d <em>Flagg v. Essex Cnty.

Caplan, </em>182 <em>N.J. </em>250, 268-70, 864 A.2d 1108 (2005) (stating parent\u2019s ability to earn income, or \u201chis [or her] human capital,\u201d should be \u201ctheoretically activated for the purpose of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>evaluating his [or her] support obligation\u201d and the amount of income that \u201cshould be imputed to him [or her]\u201d). \u201c \u2018In treating the matter of support, our courts have always looked beyond the [parent\u2019s] claims of limited resources and economic opportunity.

The Guidelines state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-7\">[i]f the court finds that either parent is, without just cause, voluntarily underemployed or unemployed, it shall impute income to that parent according to the following priorities:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-8\">a. impute income based on potential employment and earning capacity using the parent\u2019s work history, occupational qualifications, educational background, and prevailing job opportunities in the region.

Tash, </em>353 <em>N.J.Super. </em>94, 99, 801 A.2d 436 (App.Div.2002). Imputation may also be justified when examining income reported by self-employed obligors, who control the means and the method of their earnings. <em>See Donnelly v. Donnelly, </em>405 <em>N.J.Super. </em>117, 128-29, 963 A.2d 855 (App.Div.2009) (noting a self-employed obligor is \u201c \u2018in a better position to present an unrealistic picture of his or her actual income than a W-2 earner\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Larbig v.

Accordingly, \u201c[b]oth when setting child support and in reaching a proper alimony award, a judge must examine not only each party\u2019s income, but also his or her earning ability.\u201d <em>Gnall, supra, </em>432 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 159, 74 A.3d 58.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">We focus on the facts supporting imputation. Contrary to defendant\u2019s current claims of full-time employment, he specifically testified he was released from his position at ChatAnd. When pressed on whether his circumstances would change once ChatAnd received requested financing, defendant insisted his employment was terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">Historically, defendant received wages and other payments from one main company, such as Sigma, HBO, and ChatAnd, along with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>royalties and separate consulting fees. The level of earnings proffered by Frankel, who analyzed defendant\u2019s business deposits, along with defendant concessions, evinced his 2010 gross income of at least $252,000; 2011 fees from HBO alone were $206,000 and reported gross receipts totaled $250,000. Additional unrefuted proofs showed defendant received supplemental earnings, not only from self-employment through consulting, but also reoccurring royalty receipts.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">Significant to rejecting defendant\u2019s suggested earnings level was the trial judge\u2019s credibility findings. In light of the documented historic earnings, the judge found defendant \u201cattempted to portray himself as lacking the skills and education to sustain a salary in the $250,000.00 range, when all the evidence is to the contrary.\u201d Further, she rejected as unsupported defendant\u2019s claim he accepted the lower salary position at ChatAnd to spend more time with the children. Several times in her opinion she found defendant was being dishonest with the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">The judge considered and rejected the testimony of the defendant\u2019s experts. Young\u2019s opinion defendant might earn $80,000 to $100,000 was labeled \u201cborderline preposterous in light of the documented proofs that [defendant's income has been 2.5 to 3 times more [than that amount] for the past three years.\u201d Young ignored defendant\u2019s employability and earnings as a consultant, and his employment contract, allowing possible earnings up to $295,000. Even Klopchin testified defendant\u2019s salary range was higher than defendant\u2019s and Young\u2019s estimates. Nevertheless, the judge rejected the expert\u2019s suggested earning level simply because for years, defendant\u2019s salary always exceeded Klopchin\u2019s estimates.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">In light of all of this evidence, we reject as factually unsubstantiated and legally insufficient the notion imputation does not apply when determining this defendant\u2019s income because he held a full-time position. We determine the evidence supports the judge\u2019s findings that defendant\u2019s field of expertise, as well as his employment and salary history, demonstrate a substantial earning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>capacity, well in excess of his last documented base salary of $120,000 per year, and provided a sound basis to impute additional income.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">We further discern no abuse of discretion in using a three-year average of defendant\u2019s earnings from all sources, demonstrated by deposits into his business account. Overall, we conclude this was a fair and reasonable methodology to fix an appropriate level of income for consideration of support based on \u201csufficient credible evidence present in the record after consideration of the proofs as a whole.\u201d <em>Rolnick v. Rolnick, </em>262 <em>N.J.Super. </em>343, 360, 621 A.2d 37 (App.Div.1993) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">Defendant alternatively argues the court should have appointed an expert to determine his earning capacity, because Frankel\u2019s use of deposits and an estimated overhead expense was hypothetical and failed to consider his actual earnings and expenses. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">Although the court may appoint an expert to resolve an economic issue, <em>R. </em>5:3-3(c), defendant had an affirmative obligation to provide the requested discovery, which included proof of his earnings and expenses through employment and his closely held businesses. Defendant controlled the documentation on this issue and chose not to fully reveal all the facts. Defendant even chose to not provide relevant facts to his retained experts, resulting in a distorted analysis. Defendant\u2019s lack of credibility, demonstrated by his refusal to disclose information or respond to inquiries, was properly weighed in rejecting his claims of limited earnings. <em>See Cesare, supra, </em>154 <em>N.J. </em>at 412, 713 A.2d 390. Moreover, the judge\u2019s reliance on plaintiffs exhibits, Frankel\u2019s expert opinion, and defendant\u2019s own admissions, provided substantial credible evidence to impute income without the need to appoint a court expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">Defendant next argues the judge abused her discretion when imputing income to plaintiff. Defendant notes plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>earned as much as $175,000 as an attorney in New York City. Further, he relies on Young\u2019s testimony stating attorneys in New York City can earn between $108,000 and $178,850. He thus asserts use of $80,640 per year was error. We reject these arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">At trial, plaintiff was unemployed after being \u201cdismissed\u201d from her job. Prior to obtaining that position, she worked part-time. Her last full-time New York City job was in 2008, four years prior to trial. During the intervening years, plaintiff bore two children and, since separation served as the primary residential parent. The parties\u2019 children are young: one is seven and has special medical needs because the child is \u201cseverely allergic to daily, eggs, nuts and seeds[,]\u201d and the other is only four. Defendant\u2019s parenting time, set forth in the FJOD, is limited to seven and one-half hours on alternate Saturdays and Sundays, with no parenting time during the workweek. Taken together, these facts support the imputed income level determined by the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">Considerations involving children must be weighed when imputing income. The first factor listed by the Legislature in guiding a judicial determination of a fair child-support award is serving the \u201c[njeeds of the child----\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-23(a)(l). Also, the Guidelines discuss the need to account for young children\u2019s needs when imputing income to the parent of primary residence, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ArQ\">In determining whether income should be imputed to a parent and the amount of such income, the court should consider: (1) what the employment status and earning capacity of that parent would have been if the family had remained intact or would have formed, (2) the reason and intent for the voluntary underemployment or unemployment, (3) the availability of other assets that may be used to pay support, and (4) the ages of any children in the parent\u2019s household and child-care alternatives.. . When imputing income to a parent who is caring for young children, the parent\u2019s income share of child-care costs necessary to allow that person to work outside the home shall be deducted from the imputed income. [Pressler &amp; Vemiero, <em>supra, </em>comment 12 on Appendix IX-A to <em>B. </em>o:6A at 2635.J</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b467-9\">On this issue, the Supreme Court has \u201cnoted that \u2018[t]he key to both the [Guidelines and the statutory factors is flexibility and the best interest of children.\u2019 \u201d <em>Caplan, supra, </em>182 <em>N.J. </em>at 266, 864 A.2d 1108 (first alteration in original) (quoting <em>Pascale v. Pascale, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>140 <em>N.J. </em>583, 594, 660 A.2d 485 (1995)). The importance of addressing a child\u2019s needs because of health or tender years may dictate the proximity of parental employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">Finding plaintiff accessible to address the children\u2019s needs \u201cparamount,\u201d the judge determined plaintiffs decision to limit her employment search to New Jersey was reasonable. Plaintiffs sole responsibility for the children\u2019s care during the workweek and a need to be available if the older child suffers anaphylaxis support this decision. We agree the children\u2019s needs were properly weighed and found to limit plaintiffs work schedule and confine her employment search to New Jersey.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">Young\u2019s testimony regarding plaintiffs earning capacity was rejected by the trial judge for several reasons. First, the trial judge noted Young had no <em>experience in </em>the legal field. Second, he \u201cconducted little if no research [and] failed to test plaintiff,\u201d \u201cadmitting that he did nothing more than an internet engine search of New York job opportunities.\u201d Third, Young \u201cfailed to consider [pjlaintiffs parenting responsibilities and desire to work within New Jersey to remain in close proximity to the children,\u201d and, therefore, eliminated consideration of New Jersey opportunities. Finally, Young\u2019s evaluation did not examine \u201c[plaintiffs skill set [] in the financial and banking areas,\u201d a legal specialty he admitted put her at \u201ca disadvantage in today\u2019s market,\u201d because of limited available positions.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">We determine the amount of wages imputed to plaintiff was based on her immediate prior position with a large New Jersey firm, headquartered in a major city. This is appropriate. Young\u2019s testimony was properly rejected as a generalized statement of New York City <em>attorney wages, </em>rather than an opinion of what plaintiff could earn. Accordingly, we find no abuse of discretion in imputing plaintiffs income as guided by her past wages.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-9\">Challenging the child support award, defendant asserts the judge erred by requiring him to contribute to what he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>characterized as \u201cexorbitant child-care expenses\u201d at a time plaintiff was unemployed, and to pay, as additional support, one-half the cost of the children\u2019s extracurricular activities. Plaintiff acknowledged she was not working, but insisted \u201c[t]he need for childcare was evident,\u201d rationalizing she was \u201cconsumed with an intense, though unsuccessful search for employment\u201d and \u201cpreparation for trial,\u201d which she characterized as \u201ca full-time job.\u201d Finally, plaintiff urged the need for child care to prevent disruption to the children\u2019s \u201cestablished routine\u201d and because preschool \u201cspace was limited,\u201d making it \u201cimpossible to obtain a spot again if either [child] was taken out for a period of time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">Following our review, we find plaintiffs assertions unavailing. We agree with defendant the judge erroneously added child-care and extracurricular activity costs as additional support.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">The Guidelines state: \u201cThe average cost of child care, including day camp in lieu of child care, is <em>not factored into </em>in the schedules. The net cost (after tax credits) of work-related child care should be added to the basic obligation if incurred.\u201d Pressler &amp; Verniero, <em>supra, </em>comment 9 on Appendix IX-A to <em>R. </em>5:6A at 2632. The Guidelines do not sanction child-care expenses as additional support when a party is unemployed. <em>Ibid. </em>Rather, the Guidelines\u2019 recognition of child care is factored when imputing income to the custodial parent. Pressler &amp; Verniero, <em>supra, </em>comment 12 on Appendix IX-A to <em>R. </em>5:6A at 2635. Thus, an equitable adjustment to the custodial parent\u2019s imputed earnings accounts for the economic reality of parental employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">As to the cost of children\u2019s activities, the Guidelines specify a child support award includes entertainment expenditures, specifically \u201c[f]ees, memberships and admissions to sports, recreational, or social events, lessons or instructions, movie rentals, televisions, mobile devices, sound equipment, pets, hobbies, toys, playground equipment, photographic equipment, film processing, video games, and recreational, exercise or sports equipment.\u201d Pressler &amp; Verniero, <em>supra, </em>comment 8 on Appendix IX-A to <em>R. </em>5:6A at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>2631-32. Guidelines support may be supplemented by court approved extraordinary expenses, which are</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A3o\"><em>;predictable and recurring </em>expenses for children that may not be incurred by average or intact families such as private elementary or secondary education, special needs of gifted or disabled children, and NCP/PAK time transportation expenses. The addition of these expenses to the basic obligation must be approved by the court. If incurred, special expenses that are <em>not predictable and recurring </em>should be shared by the parents in proportion to them relative incomes (i.e., the sharing of these expenses should be addressed in the general language of the order or judgment). Special expenses not included in the award should be paid directly to the parent who made or will make the expenditure or to the provider of the goods or services.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-5\">[Pressler &amp; Verniero, <em>supra, </em>comment 9 on Appendix IX-A to <em>R. </em>5:6A at 2633.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">Finally, use of the Guidelines is rebuttable, as \u201c[t]he [Gjuidelines may be modified or disregarded by the court [ ] where good cause is shown,\u201d including \u201cthe presence of other relevant factors which may make the [Guidelines inapplicable or subject to modification ____\u201d <em>R. </em>5:6A.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">In her opinion, the trial judge did not explain why she deviated from the Guidelines by adding child-care and extracurricular activity costs as supplemental support. Reviewing the record we find plaintiffs assertions of need were not evidentially supported; they merely reflect her opinion. Such testimony fails to establish the \u201cgood cause\u201d necessary for disregarding the Guidelines provisions. <em>Ibid. </em>Further, the record is silent on a timeline for plaintiffs resumption of full-time employment, or her specific efforts to resume working. In light of this record, we do not find a legal basis to require payment of child-care expenses. The costs could be added as additional support once plaintiff resumes employment. At the same time, the court\u2019s calculation of child support failed to reduce plaintiffs imputed income by her share of imputed child-care expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">In her merits brief, plaintiff seeks to validate the inclusion of child-care expenses by suggesting the sums represent extra support authorized because the parties\u2019 incomes exceed the maximum net income to which the Guidelines apply. <em>See </em>Pressler &amp; Verniero, <em>supra, </em>Appendix IX-F to <em>R. </em>5:6A at 2708 (showing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>maximum combined net weekly income of parents listed on the schedule for computing Guidelines support is $3,600). Plaintiff correctly states the judge has discretion to award supplemental support when net income exceeds the specified gross income threshold of $187,200.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Pressler &amp; Verniero, <em>supra, </em>comment 20 on Appendix IX-A to <em>R. </em>5:6A at 2645. <em>See also Isaacson v. Isaacson, </em>348 <em>N.J.Super. </em>560, 579-80, 792 A.2d 525 (App.Div.) (\u201cWe have generally recognized that where the parties have the financial wherewithal to provide for their children, the children are entitled to the benefit of financial advantages available to them.... Children are entitled to not only bare necessities, but a supporting parent has the obligation to share with his children the benefit of his financial achievement.\u201d (citations omitted)), <em>certif. denied, </em>174 <em>N.J. </em>364, 807 A.2d 195 (2002). However, the judge\u2019s opinion, although thoroughly addressing the underpinnings supporting her conclusion on other issues, is silent on the need for or basis of imposing supplemental support.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\"><em>\u201cRule </em>1:7-4 requires a judge to provide findings of fact and conclusions of law on every [decision] decided by a written order that is appealable by right.\u201d <em>Fodero v. Fodero, </em>355 <em>N.J.Super. </em>168, 170, 809 A.2d 840 (App.Div.2002). <em>See R. </em>1:7-4 (requiring a trial judge to accompany all opinions with findings of fact and conclusions of law). The omission of critical factual findings, supporting the basis to supplement the Guidelines support award, impedes our review and requires a remand limited to this issue. <em>See Ducey v. Ducey, </em>424 <em>N.J.Super. </em>68, 74, 35 A.3d 703 (App.Div. 2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">Defendant next suggests the court failed to make adequate findings of fact and conclusions of law regarding its distribu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>tion of the parties\u2019 marital property. Defendant urges reversal of FJOD provisions permitting plaintiff to retain her retirement accounts and permitting each party to retain the marital property in his or her possession. We reject these arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">\u201c[T]he goal of equitable distribution ... is to effect a fair and just division of marital [property].\u201d <em>Steneken v. Steneken, </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>290, 299, 873 A.2d 501 (2005) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). To fashion an equitable distribution award, the trial judge must identify the marital assets, determine the value of each asset, and then decide \u201chow such allocation can most equitably be made.\u201d <em>Rothman v. Rothman, </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>219, 232, 320 A.2d 496 (1974). In addition, the judge must consider, but is not limited to, the sixteen statutory factors set forth in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-23.1. Fashioning an equitable distribution of marital assets and debts requires more than simply \u201cmechanical division\u201d; it requires a \u201cweighing of the many considerations and circumstances ... presented in each case.\u201d <em>Stout v. Stout, </em>155 <em>N.J.Super. </em>196, 205, 382 A.2d 659 (App.Div.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">The trial judge properly reviewed all the evidence and performed the three-step <em>Rothman </em>analysis. Specifically discussing plaintiffs IRA and two 401(k) accounts, the judge noted \u201csignificant portions,\u201d that is two of three accounts, were \u201cpre-marital,\u201d and not subject to equitable distribution. <em>See Painter v. Painter, </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>196, 214, 320 A.2d 484 (1974) (\u201c[A]ny property owned ... at the time of marriage will remain [ ] separate property of such spouse and ... will not qualify as an asset eligible for distribution.\u201d). The third account resulted from a job held for approximately fourteen months. The court acknowledged the exact values of plaintiffs retirement assets were \u201c[u]nknown\u201d and, also stated \u201c[n]o evidence was presented as to the value of [defendant's ... companies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">Defendant identifies nothing in this record to refute the judge\u2019s conclusions the assets held in the parties\u2019 respective possession had limited value and, therefore, should be offset. Her opinion noted \u201cthe parties agree that there is little by way of assets or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>liabilities to divide.\u201d On this record, we cannot conclude the judge erred in implementing the practical approach of offsetting these minimal assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">Regarding personal property, the parties separated in 2010. Each argued the other took significant personalty. The judge found the parties\u2019 respective assertions of undivided assets were unsupported. Specifically, defendant offered \u201c[n]o proofs as to the value of the furniture or wedding gifts\u201d he claimed plaintiff took, and plaintiff did not provide support for her claims defendant retained a Rolex watch, a Tiffany wedding band, and expensive electronics (although she produced an email exchange showing defendant took the marital bedroom and dining set). Following review, with the proofs in equipoise, we find no error in denying additional relief. <em>Pacifico v. Pacifico, </em>190 <em>N.J. </em>258, 269, 920 A.2d 73 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">In light of our opinion, we need not separately review the appeal of the order denying reconsideration. As noted, the judge\u2019s findings regarding imputation of income to fix support will not be disturbed, except sums added as supplemental support, which must be vacated. We reverse that limited provision of the FJOD and remand for further review. On remand, the judge must consider the propriety of adding child-care costs and whether good cause for a separate allocation of specific extracurricular activities is warranted. To the extent defendant paid unsupported childcare or activity expenses, the judge shall determine the applicable credit and the method for repayment.
