Government Employees Insurance Company, </em>433 <em>N.J.Super. </em>377, 80 A.3d 749 (App.Div.2013), the plaintiff insured asserted a claim for underinsured motorist (UIM) benefits and a bad faith claim against his carrier. Although the trial court bifurcated the claims for trial, holding the bad faith claim in abeyance, it compelled discovery to proceed on all claims. We held it was an abuse of discretion for the trial court to order that discovery on both claims proceed simultaneously. In this case, the initial decision to deny the severance motion came after some discovery related to the bad faith claim had been provided and before <em>Procopio </em>was decided. This interlocutory appeal presents the question whether the disclosure of some bad faith-related materials brings the denial of a severance motion and the decision to compel related discovery within the scope of the trial court\u2019s proper exercise of discretion. We hold that it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>Plaintiff Lori A. Wacker-Ciocco<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> had an automobile insurance policy issued by defendant Government Employees Insurance Company (GEICO) that provided uninsured/underinsured motorist benefits in the amount of $300,000 per accident. She was seriously injured in a motor vehicle accident on April 5, 2011, when she was rear-ended by a vehicle operated by John Laratta, and incurred medical expenses that exceeded $300,000. Laratta\u2019s vehicle was insured by a policy that provided coverage of $100,000 per accident. Plaintiff sought and obtained GEICO\u2019s permission to settle her claim against Laratta within his policy limits for $99,000. She then notified GEICO of her demands for $200,000 in UIM benefits and for arbitration of her UIM claim.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">Plaintiffs complaint, filed in December 2012, asserts a claim for UIM benefits as well as a claim that GEICO acted in bad faith. In support of her bad faith claim, plaintiff alleged that GEICO declined to participate in arbitration, failed to make a reasonable effort to settle the UIM claim and demanded documents unrelated to the UIM claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">In the relevant motion practice, plaintiff sought to obtain, and then compel, the depositions of GEICO\u2019s UIM claims adjusters and documents related to the bad faith claim. GEICO filed motions to sever the bad faith claim and stay discovery on that issue. In July 2013, GEICO submitted claim records to plaintiffs counsel.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> GEICO simultaneously filed a motion to sever and stay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>plaintiffs bad faith claim and discovery relative to that claim until the underlying UIM action was concluded. In support of its motion, GEICO referred to correspondence previously sent to plaintiff\u2019s counsel in which it asserted there was a dispute regarding \u201ccausation and quantum of damages that warranted discovery prior to good faith realistic settlement negotiations.\u201d* *<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> To support its claim that causation was a legitimate issue, GEICO quoted the January 30, 2012 report of plaintiffs treating physician, in which he stated, \u201c[a]t this point, I am not certain to the exact etiology of avascular necrosis in the left hip; however it is possible that the accident could have been the cause of her avascular necrosis that then led to the need for subsequent total hip <em>replacement.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">The motion judge looked for guidance in <em>Taddei v. State Farm Indem,. Co., </em>401 <em>N.J.Super. </em>449, 455, 951 A.2d 1041 (App.Div.2008), <em>certif. granted, </em>203 <em>N.J. </em>580, 4 A.3d 1026 (2010), <em>appeal dismissed, </em>203 <em>N.J. </em>433, 3 A.3d 1223 (2010), which concerned a first party claim for uninsured motorist (UM) benefits by a plaintiff who announced an intention to file a bad faith claim at trial. In <em>Taddei, </em>we were not reviewing whether a motion to sever a bad faith claim should be granted or not. The matter had proceeded to verdict on the insured\u2019s UM claim alone and the principal issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>before us was whether the insured was entitled to the full amount of damages awarded by the jury or the policy limits on his UM coverage. <em>Id. </em>at 452, 951 A.2d 1041. Nonetheless, we discussed joinder of a bad faith claim with an underlying claim for coverage<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and suggested the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-4\">To respect the rights of all parties, the underlying claim could be severed from the bad faith claim, with the latter being held in abeyance until conclusion of the former. The severed bad faith claim would then be activated, triggering the possibility for the right to discovery, motions, and, if necessary, a separate trial. In this way, the plaintiffs ability to pursue a potential bad faith claim would be preserved, but the insurer would not be required to produce its claim file prematurely, otherwise, privileged material may be disclosed which would jeopardize the insurance company\u2019s defense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-5\"><em>[Id. </em>at 465-66, 951 A.2d 1041 (internal citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">Finding that GEICO had provided such materials in discovery and therefore, \u201cthe cat [was] out of the bag,\u201d the motion judge here declined to follow our suggestion. By order dated July 26, 2013, he denied GEICO\u2019s motion to sever and stay the bad faith claim, compelled the depositions of GEICO\u2019s UIM adjusters, and ordered GEICO to \u201canswer interrogatories ... and provide the full electronic and paper claim file.\u201d GEICO\u2019s motion for reconsideration was denied by order dated October 25, 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">In November 2013, GEICO filed a motion seeking, inter alia, to vacate a May 2013 order that dismissed its answer and suppressed its defenses for failure to provide more specific answers to interrogatories. In support, GEICO represented it had complied with all outstanding discovery demands that were the subject of that order. Plaintiff filed a cross-motion to compel the depositions of GEICO\u2019s UIM adjusters. Prior to oral argument of this motion, we decided <em>Procopio </em>which, counsel urged, required the denial of plaintiffs application to compel those depositions.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>In <em>Procopio, </em>we noted the benefits of severing and staying a bad faith claim as suggested in <em>Taddei:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-5\">fill promotes judicial economy and efficiency by holding in abeyance expensive, time-consuming, and potentially wasteful discovery on a bad faith claim that may be rendered moot by a favorable ruling for the insurer in the UM or UIM litigation. This procedure also avoids the premature disclosure of arguably privileged materials to the prejudice of the insurer\u2019s defense while, at the same time, preserving the insured\u2019s pursuit of its bad faith claim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-6\"><em>[Procopio, supra, </em>433 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 381, 80 A.3d 749.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">We reviewed the reasoning and holding in <em>Bartlett v. John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company, </em>538 A.2d 997 (R.I. 1988), as well as cases in other jurisdictions that addressed the severance issue in similar cases. Observing \u201cthere can be no cause of action for an insurer\u2019s bad-faith refusal to pay a claim until the insured first establishes that the insurer breached its duty under the contract of insurance,\u201d the Rhode Island Supreme Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-8\">IA] plaintiff cannot obtain <em>complete </em>discovery of a defendant\u2019s claim file by bringing simultaneous breach-of-contract and bad-faith claims. A plaintiff must first show that he or she is entitled to recover on the contract before he or she can prove that the insurer dealt with him or her in bad faith.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-9\">[M. at 1000-01 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b637-10\">The view that the right to coverage must be established as a prerequisite to proceeding with discovery on a bad faith claim was echoed as well in cases from other jurisdictions that addressed a similar severance issue. <em>See Procopio, supra, </em>433 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 382-83, 80 A.3d 749. We found this reasoning compelling:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-11\">Preserving the insured\u2019s ability to pursue his or her bad faith claim while deferring discovery thereon until resolution of the UM or UIM claim best accommodates the varying interests involved.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-12\"><em>[Id. </em>at 383, 80 A.3d 749.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b637-13\">We recognized the obvious toll upon judicial economy imposed by allowing simultaneous discovery that would be \u201crendered needless if the insurer prevails on plaintiffs UM or UIM claim.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>In addition to concerns regarding judicial economy, we noted other relevant considerations, such as the potential prejudice to the insurer\u2019s defense of the UM or UIM claim by the disclosure of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>privileged materials and the risk of encouraging abusive pleading practice:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-4\">Indeed, if an insured attempting to prove the validity of his or her claim against an insurer could obtain the insurer\u2019s investigative files \u2014 showing exactly how the company processed the claim, how thoroughly it was considered and why the company took the action it did \u2014 merely by alleging the insurer acted in bad faith, then there would be an open invitation to all plaintiffs to include such allegations with every breach of contract claim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-5\">\n<em>[Ibid.]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">We concluded, \u201c[w]hatever, therefore, the benefits of simultaneous discovery, they are substantially outweighed by the burdens exacted both institutionally and individually.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 383-84, 80 A.3d 749.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">Another Law Division judge reviewed the November 2013 motion; it was not the judge who denied GEICO\u2019s first motion to sever and stay the bad faith claim. Reasoning that the first motion judge found <em>Taddei </em>did not apply because there had been disclosure of the carrier\u2019s file and other information, the judge entered an order dated December 6, 2013, that compelled the depositions of the UIM adjusters.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-8\">We granted GEICO\u2019s request for interlocutory review of the order dated July 26, 2013, that denied defendant\u2019s motion to sever and stay plaintiff\u2019s bad faith claim and pertinent discovery; the order dated October 25, 2013, which denied GEICO\u2019s motion for reconsideration; and the order dated December 6, 2013, which granted plaintiffs motion to compel the depositions of GEICO UIM adjusters. In this appeal, GEICO argues that it was an abuse of discretion to deny its motion for severance and a stay and asks us to vacate these orders and to order that plaintiffs bad faith claim be severed and stayed until such time as plaintiff establishes her entitlement to coverage for UIM benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-9\">GEICO\u2019s motion for severance was governed by <em>Rule </em>4:38-2(a), which permits the court to order a separate trial of any claim \u201cfor the convenience of the parties or to avoid prejudice.\u201d Like the other issues raised by GEICO\u2019s motion \u2014 the scope of discovery and the decision whether to grant a stay \u2014 this was a matter within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>the discretion of the trial court. <em>See Tobia v. Cooper Med. Ctr., </em>136 <em>N.J. </em>335, 345, 643 A.2d 1 (1994) (decision to grant severance rests in the trial court\u2019s discretion); <em>Procopio, supra, </em>433 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 379-80, 80 A.3d 749 <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> That standard requires us to defer to the trial court\u2019s decision \u201cunless the court has abused its discretion or its determination is based on a mistaken understanding of the applicable law.\u201d <em>Pomerantz Paper Corp. v. New Cmty. Corp., </em>207 <em>N.J. </em>344, 371, 25 A.3d 221 (2011). The nature and requirements of a bad faith claim weigh heavily in the determination of the severance motion here.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">As a preliminary matter, the insured who alleges bad faith by the insurer must establish the merits of his or her claim for benefits. If there is a valid question of coverage, i.e., the claim is \u201cfairly debatable,\u201d the insurer bears no liability for bad faith. <em>Pickett v. Lloyd\u2019s, </em>131 <em>N.J. </em>457, 473-74, 621 A.2d 445 (1993). This standard continues to apply to bad faith claims. In <em>Badiali v. New Jersey Manufacturers Insurance Group, </em>220 <em>N.J. </em>544, 107 A.3d 1281 (2015), the Supreme Court affirmed the applicability of this standard, <em>id. </em>at 558-59, 107 A.3d 1281, and recited the following principles:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-6\">[T]o establish a first-party bad faith claim for denial of benefits in New Jersey, a plaintiff must show \u201cthat no debatable reasons existed for denial of the benefits.\u201d <em>[Pickett, supra, </em>131 <em>N.J. </em>] at 481 [621 A.2d 445].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-7\">Under the salutary \u201cfairly debatable\u201d standard enunciated in <em>Pickett, </em>\u201ca claimant who could not have established as a matter of law a right to summary judgment on the substantive claim would not be entitled to assert a claim for an insurer\u2019s bad-faith refusal to pay the claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 473 [621 A.2d 445].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number><em>[Id. </em>at 554-55,107 A.3d 1281, (citation omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b640-4\"><em>See also Wadeer v.

Co., </em>220 <em>N.J. </em>591, 604, 110 A.3d 19, 2015 <em>WL </em>668229 (2015); <em>Procopio, supra, </em>433 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 382-83, 80 A.3d 749; <em>Taddei, supra, </em>401 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 460-61, 951 A.2d 1041.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> If the insured is unable to establish a right to the coverage claimed, the bad faith claim must be dismissed. <em>Pickett, supra, </em>131 <em>N.J. </em>at 473, 621 A.2d 445. <em>See also, Bldg. Materials Corp. of Am. v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>424 <em>N.J.Super </em>448, 482 n. 12, 38 A.3d 644 (App.Div.) (noting that, where insured failed to establish the existence of a covered loss, its bad faith claim was not sustainable and need not be addressed), <em>certif. denied, </em>212 <em>N.J. </em>198, 52 A.3d 176 (2012); <em>Am. Wrecking Corp. v. Burlington Ins. Co., </em>400 <em>N.J.Super. </em>276, 285 n. 2, 946 A.2d 1084 (App.Div.2008) (stating because the court sustained the exclusion on which the insurer relied, \u201cthe bad faith claim must also be dismissed with prejudice\u201d); <em>Universal-Rundle Corp. v. Commercial Union Ins. Co., </em>319 <em>N.J.Super. </em>223, 249-51, 725 A.2d 76 (App.Div.) (applying the holding in <em>Pickett </em>to claim for bad faith failure to conduct thorough investigation), <em>certif. denied, </em>161 <em>N.J. </em>149, 735 A.2d 574 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">Bad faith is an intentional tort. <em>Pickett, supra, </em>131 <em>N.J. </em>at 473, 621 A.2d 445. To establish bad faith, a plaintiff must show the lack of a reasonable basis for denying the claim or unreasonably delaying its processing, and the insurer\u2019s knowledge or reckless disregard that it was acting unreasonably. <em>Id. </em>at 473-74, 621 A.2d 445. This claim cannot be sustained by evidence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>negligence, mistake or delay in payment without some showing of the insurer\u2019s wrongful intent. <em>Id. </em>at 474, 621 A.2d 445; e.g., <em>Badiali, supra, </em>220 <em>N.J. </em>at 563, 107 A.3d 1281 (holding that rejection of arbitration award not bad faith where carrier\u2019s position \u201cwas at least fairly debatable and based on a reasonable and principled reading of its policy language\u201d); <em>see also Universalr-Rundle Corp., supra, </em>319 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 249, 725 A.2d 76 (\u201cWhile [the insurer\u2019s] decision as such was erroneous, that is not the equivalent of bad faith.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">Plaintiff argues that her bad faith claim is an integral part of her UIM claim and should not be severed. She notes that GEICO gave no reason for failing to pay her UIM claim before suit was filed and that the claims file it has produced in discovery reveals no valid reason for failing to effectuate prompt payment and settlement of her UIM claim. She argues that <em>Procopio </em>is distinguishable because the motion to sever in that case was made before any discovery relating to the bad faith claim was provided, while in this case, proof of her bad faith claim has already been revealed in the information in GEICO\u2019s file produced in discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">GEICO argues that the application of <em>Procopio </em>does not turn on whether or not some bad faith-related discovery has been provided and further, that such discovery is not complete here because it has not turned over all its claim files. We agree and conclude that the denial of GEICO\u2019s motion to sever and stay and the orders compelling discovery pertaining to the bad faith claim were based upon a mistaken understanding of the applicable law.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-8\">In this case, plaintiff pled both her UIM and bad faith claims in her complaint, as was her right. She has argued here that GEICO failed to show a reasonable basis for its actions in failing to settle her UIM claim in a timely manner. But even her conclusory statements fail to establish wrongful intent, as opposed to mere negligence or mistake. <em>See Pickett, supra, </em>131 <em>N.J. </em>at 474, 621 A.2d 445.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>In <em>Procopio, </em>we clearly endorsed the principle that proof an insured is entitled to coverage as a matter of law is a necessary pre-requisite to pursuing discovery regarding a bad faith claim. <em>See Procopio, supra, </em>433 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 383, 80 A.3d 749. This principle does not become inapplicable simply because some discovery relevant to the bad faith claim was produced here. GEICO maintains that it has not provided all documents related to the bad faith claim.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This is borne out by plaintiffs continuing efforts to compel additional discovery and the depositions of the UIM adjusters as well as by the first order that denied GEICO\u2019s severance motion and ordered GEICO to \u201canswer interrogatories ... and provide the full electronic and paper claim file.\u201d Therefore, the competing interests implicated by ordering simultaneous discovery on both the coverage and bad faith claims remained in play. We conclude the motion judges were mistaken in concluding that the disclosure of some bad faith-related discovery resolved the issue of potential prejudice to GEICO and paved the way for simultaneous discovery without regard to whether plaintiff had shown she was entitled to coverage as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">The orders of July 26, October 25, and December 6, 2013, which denied GEICO\u2019s motions to sever and stay the bad faith claim and related discovery until the underlying UIM claim was decided, and compelled the depositions of UIM adjusters and further discovery related to plaintiffs bad faith claim are reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b634-6\"> The complaint also alleged a per quod claim on behalf of Michael J.

Neither the policy nor the letter referenced are included in the record before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b635-10\"> GEICO later provided more specific answers to interrogatories in which it stated that, based upon information in plaintiff's medical records and the opinions and conclusions in its expert's report on his independent medical examination, it had concluded that plaintiff's injuries were not causally related to the motor vehicle accident. It stated further that her accident-related injuries were not permanent as to overcome the verbal threshold and that she had been fully compensated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b636-8\"> We note the Supreme Court has \"refer[red] to the Civil Practice Committee, for review and study the entire controversy doctrine, <em>Rule </em>4:30A, to consider whether to allow first-party bad faith claims to be asserted and decided after resolution of an underlying, interrelated UM action.\" <em>Wadeer v.
