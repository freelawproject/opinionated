The Law Division reached this decision after conducting a de novo review of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>the trial record developed in the Secaucus municipal court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> pursuant to <em>Rule </em>3:23-8. Defendant raises a number of substantive arguments attacking the legal validity of his conviction. However, as a threshold issue, defendant argues the Law Division erred in failing to declare his conviction in the Secaucus municipal court void <em>ab initio </em>because he was prosecuted by a private attorney who did not comply with the requirements the Supreme Court established in <em>State v. Storm, </em>141 <em>N.J. </em>245, 661 A.2d 790 (1995) and subsequently supplemented and codified in <em>Rule </em>7:8-7(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">We agree with defendant that his conviction for harassment is proeedurally defective and cannot stand as matter of law. The record of the municipal court proceedings presented for de novo review to the Law Division shows that the Secaucus Municipal Court permitted the private attorney retained by the complaining witness to assume the authority ordinarily reserved to duly appointed municipal prosecutors without adhering to the procedural requirements of <em>Rule </em>7:8-7(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">Specifically, the private attorney retained by the complaining witness prosecuted the ease against defendant without submitting the certification required by <em>Rule </em>7:8-7(b). The municipal court erred in permitting this private attorney to exercise prosecutorial authority without adhering strictly to the rules governing such practices. Failure to follow the procedures established in <em>Storm </em>violated defendant\u2019s due process rights and did not \u201cpreserve the integrity of municipal courts, protect the rights of defendants, and [] make the system work.\u201d <em>Storm, supra, </em>141 <em>N.J. </em>at 254-55, 661 A.2d 790.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">Defendant is an attorney admitted to practice law in this State. In that capacity, he represents the Liberty Humane Society, an organization that purports to be \u201ca non-profit animal shelter dedicated to promoting animal welfare in our communities by providing progressive animal sheltering, behavioral therapy and adoption services designed to give every animal a chance at a lifelong, loving home.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Defendant claims Donna Lerner filed this harassment complaint against him in retaliation for a civil action alleging \u201charassment and defamation\u201d brought by Liberty Humane Society against Lerner and other members of what defendant characterizes as a \u201cfringe animal rights group.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">On January 31, 2011, defendant attended a board of directors meeting of the Liberty Humane Society to update the board members on the status of the civil litigation against Lerner. The incident that gave rise to Lerner\u2019s harassment complaint against defendant occurred at this meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">The meeting, which was held in a room inside the City Hall of the City of Jersey City, was initially open to the public.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Lerner, who was also in attendance, sought to record the board\u2019s discussions during the public session. However, when the discussions reached defendant\u2019s litigation update, the board members asked Lerner and other members of the public to leave the room. According to defendant, the board members explained that the meeting was being closed to the public to permit defendant, as the attorney representing the organization, to privately discuss confidential information concerning the status of the litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">After the meeting room was cleared of public attendees, defendant took certain personal items attendees had left inside the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>meeting room and placed them outside on the hallway floor. According to Lerner, defendant told her to get away from the meeting room door. She also claimed defendant told her that he was going to have her escorted out of the building. Lerner described defendant\u2019s demeanor as confrontational and physically menacing. She alleged defendant \u201cgot several inches away\u201d from her face, pointed his finger at her, yelled at her, and followed her when she stepped back. Although Lerner testified that defendant\u2019s alleged misbehavior continued unabated for approximately fifteen to twenty minutes, she also indicated that she continuously walked in and out of the meeting room, in apparent defiance of the board\u2019s decision to close the meeting to the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">The Law Division judge found that at some point during this confrontation with Lerner, defendant asked both security and Jersey City Police Officers for assistance to physically remove Lerner from the scene. The trial court found, however, that the police officers refused to accede to defendant\u2019s request because Lerner was lawfully in a public building and was not acting inappropriately. Lerner was later permitted to attend the public session of the board meeting without further incident. Her charge of harassment against defendant is thus exclusively based on her interactions with defendant immediately after the board\u2019s decision to close the meeting to the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">Although the Secaucus Municipal Court disposed of several other cases involving Donna Lerner and other individuals who had some connection with the Liberty Humane Society, this appeal concerns only what occurred during the prosecution of the harassment charges filed by Lerner against defendant.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> However, the <em>Storm </em>issue raised by defendant in this appeal was not directly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>addressed by the municipal court on June 5, 2012, the day defendant\u2019s ease was scheduled for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">The following colloquy occurred before the start of the trial against defendant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-6\">DEFENDANT: I\u2019m sorry, Your Honor. Is [Lerner\u2019s private attorney] prosecuting on this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-7\">MUNICIPAL COURT JUDGE: My understanding is she is. I received an application to do so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-8\">DEFENDANT: I haven\u2019t received an application for her to prosecute this matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-9\">LERNER\u2019S ATTORNEY: Judge, that\u2019s not true. We went through this probably four sessions ago where he objected to my prosecuting at that time, and Your Honor reviewed the <em>Stom </em>application. Your Honor addressed the issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-10\">DEFENDANT: It\u2019s not a party\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-11\">LERNER\u2019S ATTORNEY: And one of the \u2014 the big issue\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-12\">MUNICIPAL COURT JUDGE: Mr. Myerowitz, you filed a motion to disqualify [Lerner\u2019s attorney]. And I did go through all of the reasons on the record, and I-\u2014 and I went through all of it. So\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-13\">DEFENDANT: Yes, but she only applied to prosecute Ms. [Jeffrey]. She never applied to prosecute me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-14\">MUNICIPAL COURT JUDGE: No, she did. And your brief addressed both. Your brief was addressing in caption to <em>Re: State v. Diana Jeffreys </em>[sic], <em>Re: State v. Howard Myerowitz. </em>So it addressed it and I addressed all the issues.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-15\">Ultimately, the municipal court judge found that she had addressed and rejected defendant\u2019s <em>Storm </em>related objections:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-16\">I believe that I have on more than one occasion indicated that [Lerner\u2019s private attorney] can appear in this matter. You have filed a brief in opposition to her appearing. I said that she can appear. And so ... this has been on the calendar forever with today as the day to go forward.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-17\">The municipal court judge\u2019s reference to a prior ruling deciding this issue relates to a hearing that occurred on September 6, 2011, the first day of trial of the harassment charges filed by Lerner against defendant\u2019s wife, Diana H. Jeffrey, whom defendant represented as defense counsel. On that day, Lerner\u2019s private attorney entered her appearance and announced to the municipal court that she had \u201cfiled a <em>Storm </em>motion on behalf of Donna Lerner.\u201d After considerable discussion concerning defendant\u2019s ability to represent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>himself and his wife in these matters<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>, Lerner\u2019s private attorney addressed the municipal court as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-6\">Judge, I don\u2019t represent Ms. Lerner in a complaint by Ms. Jeffrey. I did file two <em>Storm, </em>certifications. I seek to represent \u2014 to prosecute the matter against Diana Jeffrey in <em>State v. Diana Jeffrey </em>where Donna Lerner is the complainant. There\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-7\">MUNICIPAL COURT JUDGE: Well .. let\u2019s stick with what I have. Let\u2019s\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-8\">Let\u2019s go back a minute. There is no complaint by Mr. Myerowitz against Ms. Lerner. That\u2019s my point.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-9\">DEFENDANT: Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-10\">LERNER\u2019S ATTORNEY: That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-11\">MUNICIPAL COURT JUDGE: So then the next issue becomes \u2014 if I\u2019m correct, your remaining argument is that Mr. Myerowitz should not be appearing on behalf of Ms. Jeffrey as defense counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-12\">LERNER\u2019S ATTORNEY: That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-13\">MUNICIPAL COURT JUDGE: In the absence of \u2014 of him prosecuting one of these matters, I\u2019m having a difficult time then seeing where the conflict would be. The <em>State v. Storm </em>conflict comes up if he prosecutes one of these matters.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-14\">Lerner\u2019s attorney agreed with the municipal court judge\u2019s analysis of the <em>Storm </em>question as it related to defendant\u2019s ability to represent Jeffrey in the harassment case Lerner filed against her. The question related to whether Lerner\u2019s private attorney could assume the role of prosecutor resurfaced when defendant, acting as Jeffrey\u2019s defense counsel, objected to Lerner\u2019s private attorney\u2019s <em>Storm </em>application. Defendant based his objection on two grounds: (1) the absence of cross-complaints between Jeffrey and Lerner; and (2) Lerner\u2019s counsel\u2019s failure to submit a certification in conformance with the requirements of <em>Rule </em>7:8-7(b). The municipal court judge rejected defendant\u2019s arguments and the case against Jeffrey went forward with Lerner\u2019s private attorney acting as prosecutor.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>The municipal court judge found Lerner\u2019s attorney did not use the form certification approved by the Administrative Director of the Courts (Director) as required by <em>Rule </em>7:8-7(b). The municipal court judge nevertheless permitted Lerner\u2019s attorney to prosecute Jeffrey, finding the privately drafted certification submitted by the attorney was in \u201csubstantial compliance\u201d with the form approved by the Director. The municipal court judge provided the following explanation in support of her ruling:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-5\">[Lemer\u2019s private attorney] submitted a certification to the Court dated February 7, 2011. It is not on the form [prescribed] by the [Administrative Office of the Courts], but it is in substantial compliance with it. It provides in part that she requests to prosecute this matter on behalf of her client, that she\u2019s an attorney at law, that she is supplying this certification in \u2014 to the Jersey City Municipal Court in \u2014 pursuant to <em>Rule </em>7:8-7(b) and <em>State v. Storm </em>and that she will fill out any form that was provided to her by the Municipal Court. <em>She\u2019s asking that she he appointed as an impartial private Prosecutor for Donna Lerner, the complaining witnesses in-in this matter.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-6\">I don\u2019t find that the form not being provided to her by Jersey City is fatal to her prosecution in this matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-7\">With whether or not these matters are cross-complaints, I said earlier in this day and with regard to another matter I find that they are cross-complaints. I understand that there is no identity of dates, but there are identity of parties and there are [identity] of issues in this matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-8\">The parties are in a dispute apparently over ... I [may be] using the wrong title for it ... Hudson County Animal Shelter. It may be the Jersey City Animal Shelter. I\u2019m not familiar enough with the facts having not heard them yet but only reviewed the motions in this matter. The dispute [may be] ... over control over this animal shelter. The parties got into disputes over how they should discuss it, whether or not one party was harassing the other, using harassing language over it. All of these parties are people who had something [to] do with this shelter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-9\">While there may not be an identity of dates meaning you allege I harassed you on Date A while I allege you harassed me on Date B, the allegations are similar enough and the parties are similar enough so that I can consider these to be cross-complaints.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-10\">If I say to you something on Monday and you answer me on Tuesday because we\u2019re using electronic communication meaning that we\u2019re using e-mail or Face Book [sic] or any of the other means that people communicate with today, text, and so I don\u2019t get it in an instant time but I get it the next day, that is contemporaneously enough that I would consider these to be cross-complaints.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-11\">[ (Emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>The certification Lerner\u2019s private attorney submitted to the Jersey City Municipal Court in support of her <em>Storm </em>application, which the Secaucus Municipal Court found \u201csubstantially complied\u201d with the requirements of <em>Rule </em>7:8-7(b), is replicated in its entirety and attached here as Exhibit A to this opinion. In the interest of clarity, we recite the following pertinent paragraphs of the certification:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-6\">2. This Certification is being supplied to the Jersey City Municipal Court pursuant to the provisions of <em>R. </em>7:8 \u2014 7(b) and <em>State v. Storm, </em>141 <em>N.J. </em>245 [661 A.2d 790J (1995) to provide the Court and the Municipal Prosecutor with all facts that may foreseeably affect the fairness of the proceedings to enable the court to determine whether I may be appointed as an impartial private prosecutor for Donna Lerner, the complaining witnesses in the above matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-7\">3. The complaining witnesses are individuals.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-8\">4. There is no actual conflict of interest arising from my representation of and fee arrangement with, the complaining witnesses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-9\">5. The municipal prosecutor can elect not to conduct the prosecution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-10\">6. Neither I nor any member of my firm will represent the complaining witness in any civil litigation concerning the same or similar facts as are contained in the complaint.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-11\">7. There are no other facts that could reasonably affect the impartiality of the private prosecutor and the fairness of the proceedings or otherwise create an appearance of impropriety.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-12\">I hereby certify that the foregoing statements made by me are true. I am aware that if any of the foregoing statements made by me are willfully false, I am subject to punishment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-13\">As Exhibit A attached hereto shows, this certification dated February 7, 2011, uses a caption identifying only the case of <em>State v. Diana H. Jeffrey, </em>Complaint No. S2010 009052 0906, leaving any reasonable reader to conclude this private attorney was seeking leave of the court to assume the role of prosecutor on behalf of the complaining witness only in that case. The letter the attorney wrote to the then Presiding Judge of the Jersey City Municipal Court dated February 14, 2011, transmitting this personally drafted version of a <em>Storm </em>certification, also corroborates this inference. The \u201creference\u201d section of the letter again identifies the subject matter as the case of <em>\u201cState v. Diana Jeffries </em>[sic], Complaint No. S2010 009052 0906.\u201d Finally, in an effort to dispel any ambiguity or confusion, the attorney wrote: \u201cIf the Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>agrees to permit me to serve as a private prosecutor in this matter, please have your clerk file the enclosed Notice of Appearance and send me a copy marked filed in the enclosed stamped self-addressed envelope.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> No other case is mentioned in the letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">On appeal to the Law Division, defendant again argued that Lerner\u2019s private attorney was not legally authorized to prosecute the harassment complaint filed against him by Lerner because the attorney did not submit a <em>Storm </em>certification in his case. The State, this time represented by an Assistant Prosecutor from the Hudson County Prosecutor\u2019s Office, argued that the municipal court judge considered and rejected defendant\u2019s arguments under <em>Storm </em>in the ease against Jeffrey.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">The Law Division Judge accepted the State\u2019s argument in this respect. The trial judge found that the municipal court judge \u201cmade it clear that she was <em>\u2018lumping </em>\u2019 all the matters together.\u201d (Emphasis added). After naming the various cases in which the charges were eventually withdrawn by all of the complaining witnesses, the Law Division Judge found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-7\">It was clear to Mr. Myerowitz that all the matters were addressed jointly, but would have its own trial, as he addressed in the caption of his brief to <em>Re: State v. Diana Jeffrey, Re: State v. Howard Myerowitz. </em>This makes it clear that there are overlapping issues and essentially, he addressed them jointly.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b380-9\">Against this record, defendant raises the following arguments on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-10\">\n<em>POINT i</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-11\">THE CONVICTION MUST BE REVERSED BECAUSE THE TRIAL JUDGE IMPROPERLY ALLOWED A PRIVATE ATTORNEY TO PROSECUTE THE DEFENDANT, HOWARD Z. MYEROWITZ, ESQ.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-12\">A. The Private Attorney Did Not File An Application To Prosecute The Defendant, Howard Z. Myerowitz, Esq.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>B. Even If The Private Attorney Had Piled An Application To Prosecute The Defendant, Howard Z. Myerowitz, Esq., It Would Have Been Plain Error For The Trial Judge To Grant It Because The Rules Only Allow A Private Prosecutor To Be Appointed When There Are Cross Complaints And No Civil Litigation [Existed] Between The Parties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-5\">\n<em>POINT II</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-6\">THE CONVICTION MUST BE REVERSED BECAUSE THE TRIAL JUDGE IMPROPERLY ALLOWED THE PRIVATE PROSECUTOR TO CALL A WITNESS WHO THE DEFENDANT HAD NOT BEEN NOTIFIED OF.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-7\">\n<em>POINT III</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-8\">THE CONVICTION MUST BE REVERSED BECAUSE THE TRIAL JUDGE IMPROPERLY FOUND THE DEFENDANT GUILTY OF COMMITTING ACTS NOT ALLEGED IN THE CRIMINAL COMPLAINT.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-9\">\n<em>POINT IV</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-10\">THE CONVICTION MUST BE REVERSED BECAUSE THE FACTS AS ALLEGED IN THE COMPLAINT DO NOT CONSTITUTE HARASSMENT AS A MATTER OF LAW AND THE FACTS ADDUCED AT TRIAL DID NOT ESTABLISH ALL THE ELEMENTS OF <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:33-4(a).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-11\">\n<em>POINT V</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-12\">THE CONVICTION MUST BE REVERSED BECAUSE THE TRIAL JUDGE IMPROPERLY USED FACTS ADDUCED IN A DIFFERENT MATTER, AND FACTS NOT ADDUCED AT TRIAL BUT ALLEGEDLY KNOWN TO THE JUDGE PERSONALLY, TO REACH HER DECISION.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-13\">\n<em>POINT VI</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-14\">THE CONVICTION MUST BE REVERSED BECAUSE THE TRIAL JUDGE IMPROPERLY FAILED TO DISCLOSE HER PRIOR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE CITY OF JERSEY CITY AND HER PRIOR EMPLOYMENT WITH JERSEY CITY CORPORATION COUNSEL.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-15\">\n<em>POINT VII</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-16\">THE CONVICTION MUST BE REVERSED BECAUSE THE DEFENDANT DID NOT RECEIVE A FAIR TRIAL BEFORE AN IMPARTIAL JUDGE IN VIOLATION OF HIS CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS AND THE TRIAL JUDGE IMPROPERLY HAD AN EX PARTE COMMUNICATION WITH THE PRIVATE PROSECUTING ATTORNEY.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-17\">We will start our analysis by addressing defendant\u2019s argument challenging the Law Division\u2019s ruling upholding the municipal court judge\u2019s decision to allow Lerner\u2019s private attorney to prosecute the harassment charge against him. Our review of the record leads us to conclude that the private attorney who prosecuted this case against defendant did not submit the certification required by <em>Rule </em>7:8-7(b), and was thus not vested with the authority to represent the State at the time she prosecuted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>defendant. In permitting this attorney to assume the role of prosecutor in this case, the municipal court judge mistakenly relied on a eertificatiop this same attorney submitted in support of an application to prosecute a case against defendant\u2019s wife, Diana Jeffrey. The Law Division erred in upholding the municipal court judge\u2019s decision under these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">We further hold that the failure of the municipal court to enforce the requirements of <em>Rule </em>7:8-7(b) renders defendant\u2019s conviction void <em>ab initio. </em>As we stated in <em>State v. Valentine, </em>374 <em>N.J.Super. </em>292, 297-98, 864 A.2d 433 (App.Div.2005), judicial oversight in this context and adherence to the requirements of the rule are necessary to prevent a \u201cstructural rift in the framework of the entire judicial process[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">The public policy concerns involved in permitting a private attorney to assume the role of prosecutor and represent the State in a particular case were articulated by Justice Pollock on behalf of a unanimous Court in <em>Storm. </em>The Court grappled to strike a proper balance between two seemingly irreconcilable propositions. As Justice Pollock noted, \u201c[t]he challenge is to respect the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial while preserving the contribution of private prosecutors to the disposition of complaints in the municipal courts.\u201d <em>Storm, supra, </em>141 <em>N.J. </em>at 252, 661 A.2d 790.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">The Court was particularly concerned with the erosion of public confidence caused by the inherent lack of impartiality associated with a privately retained prosecutor.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-8\">The overarching argument against private prosecutors is the risk they pose to a defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial. A private prosecutor\u2019s dual responsibilities to the complaining witness and to the State breed numerous problems. Representation of the complainant in a related civil action could invest the prosecutor with a monetary interest in the outcome of the matter. That risk is particularly high if the prosecutor has agreed to receive a contingent fee in the civil action. Even in the absence of actual conflict, the appointment as prosecutor of an attorney for an interested party creates the appearance of impropriety.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-9\">Conflicting interests, moreover, can undermine a prosecutor\u2019s impartiality. The loss of impartiality can affect the prosecutor\u2019s assessment of probable cause to proceed; the disclosure of exculpatory evidence; and the willingness to plea bargain. Also implicated are the prosecutor\u2019s ethical obligation \u201cto see that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>defendant is accorded procedural justice and that guilt is decided upon the basis of sufficient evidence.\u201d In addition, private prosecutions pose the risk that the complainant will use the municipal court proceeding to harass the defendant or to obtain an advantage in a related civil action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-6\"><em>[Id. </em>at 252-53, 661 A.2d 790 (internal citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">On the other side of the scale were the equally important interests of preserving and expanding access to a forum for resolutions of minor disputes that, if left unaddressed, could escalate into more serious violent confrontations. As more eloquently stated by Justice Pollock:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-8\">A municipal court is \u201cthe people\u2019s court.\u201d Municipal courts remain a place in which people, sometimes on the verge of violence, can seek relief. In effect, municipal courts provide a safety valve for society. By providing access to impartial judges, municipal courts forestall violence and encourage the peaceful resolution of disputes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-9\"><em>[Id. </em>at 254, 661 A.2d 790.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b383-10\">The Court concluded that the effectiveness of the municipal court as a forum for dispute resolution depended upon the public\u2019s confidence in its ability to deliver impartial justice. This could be achieved only if both complainant and defendant trusted the impartiality of the proceedings. <em>Ibid. </em>There is the rub. As the <em>Storm </em>Court ultimately acknowledged, \u201c[t]o earn that trust, the prosecutor, like the judge, must be impartial. <em>Inevitably, private prosecutions undermine confidence in the integrity of the proceedings.\u201d Ibid. </em>(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-11\">With this admonition in mind, we will focus our discussion on how the Supreme Court decided to respond to this challenge. <em>Rule </em>7:8-7(b) authorizes the municipal court to permit a private attorney to assume the role of municipal prosecutor and represent the State in a particular case, only after determining on the record that certain specific conditions exist, and that the attorney has submitted a certification, in the form approved by the Administrative Director of the Courts, addressing all of the questions contained therein.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-12\">The court may permit an attorney to appear as a private prosecutor to represent the State in eases involving cross-complaints. Such private prosecutors may be permitted to appear on behalf of the State only if the court has first reviewed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>pi\u2019ivate prosecutor\u2019s motion to so appeal- and an accompanying certification submitted on a form approved by the Administrative Director of the Courts. The court may grant the private prosecutor\u2019s application to appear if it is satisfied that a potential for conflict exists for the municipal prosecutor due to the nature of the charges set forth in the cross-complaints. The court shall place such a finding on the record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-5\"><em>[R. </em>7:8-7(b)J</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">Distilled into manageable subparts, the first step under <em>Rule </em>7:8 \u2014 7(b) requires the municipal court judge to determine whether the parties have filed cross-complaints against each other. In such a scenario, the municipal prosecutor is placed in an untenable situation because each party is a defendant in one ease and a complaining witness in the other. Here, the record shows defendant did not have a cross-complaint against Lerner. Although defendant represented the Liberty Humane Society in a pending civil action against Lerner, there is no evidence that defendant had a pending personal complaint against Lerner before the municipal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">In the absence of actual cross-complaints that create an insurmountable conflict of interest for the prosecutor, there are no legal grounds for the municipal court to permit a private attorney to represent the State. Because public policy favors that prosecutions be conducted by duly appointed independent prosecutors, the municipal court judge should obtain a statement from the municipal prosecutor, on the record, confirming the existence of this conflict of interest, requiring his or her recusal in the case. However, \u201c[i]f the municipal prosecutor insists on proceeding with the prosecution, the prosecutor\u2019s decision should be final.\u201d <em>Storm, supra, </em>141 <em>N.J. </em>at 255, 661 A.2d 790.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">The second step under <em>Rule </em>7:8 \u2014 7(b) requires the municipal court to review the private attorney\u2019s motion to assume the role of prosecutor. This motion must be accompanied by a <em>\u201ccertification submitted on a form approved by the Administrative Director of the Courts.\u201d R. </em>7:8-7(b) (emphasis added). Here, the Law Division\u2019s finding that the municipal court judge consolidated defendant\u2019s case with Jeffrey\u2019s case is not supported by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>record. Lerner\u2019s attorney did not file a formal motion seeking leave to prosecute the case against defendant or submit the certification required by <em>Rule </em>7:8-7(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">The Law Division Judge referred to a brief captioned <em>\u201cState v. Diana Jeffrey, Re: State v. Howard Myerowitz </em>\u201d in his memorandum of opinion. In this appeal, however, the State has not refuted defendant\u2019s claim that no such brief ever existed. The record corroborates defendant\u2019s claim that Lerner\u2019s attorney did not submit a <em>Storm </em>certification requesting leave to prosecute the case against him. As noted <em>infra, </em>the letter from Lerner\u2019s attorney transmitting her personally drafted version of the certification required by <em>Rule </em>7:8-7(b) only refers to the case of <em>\u201cState v. Diana Jeffrey, </em>Complaint No. S2010 009052 0906,\u201d and she sought only to be permitted to serve as a private prosecutor <em>in that matter. </em>(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">In the interest of clarity, and to guide the Law Division and the municipal courts, we have attached as Exhibit A the certification filed by Lerner\u2019s attorney purporting to comply with the requirements of <em>Rule </em>7:8-7(b). We have also attached as Exhibit B the certification form approved by the Administrative Director of the Courts. Even a cursory comparison of these two documents shows that the unapproved, personally drafted certification submitted by Lerner\u2019s attorney fails to materially comply in several respects with the requirements of <em>Rule </em>7:8-7(b) or the Court\u2019s impartiality concerns in <em>Storm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">By way of example, the personally drafted certification indicates only that neither she nor any member of her firm <em>will </em>represent the complaining witness in any civil litigation concerning the same or similar facts as are contained in the complaint. The approved form requires the attorney to certify that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-8\">There is no civil litigation, <em>existing or anticipated, </em>between the complaining witness and the defendant concerning the same or similar facts as are contained in the complaint. In the event of such civil litigation, I have informed the complaining witness that neither I nor any member of my firm will undertake the complaining witness\u2019 representation in that matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-9\">[ (Emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>The approved form requires the attorney to inform the municipal court whether the defendant \u201cis or is expected to be represented by counsel.\u201d The personally drafted certification does not address this issue. Finally, the personally drafted certification states, \u201c[t]he municipal prosecutor <em>can elect not to conduct the prosecution.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). By contrast, the approved form requires the attorney to certify that \u201c[t]he municipal prosecutor <em>has elected not to conduct the prosecution. </em>Check if correct. [ ] If not, please explain[.]\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">Despite these material deviations from the approved form, the municipal court judge found the unapproved certification was in \u201csubstantial compliance\u201d with the requirements of <em>Rule 7:8-</em>7(b). We caution municipal court judges against adopting such a lax approach to the requirements of this Rule. As we made clear in <em>Valentine, supra, </em>\u201c[a] plain reading of <em>[Rule </em>] 7:8-7(b) does not permit an interpretation that its application is discretionary.\u201d 374 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 297, 864 A.2d 433. Use of the form approved by the Administrative Director of the Courts is not discretionary. The questions contained in the form, including the precise phraseology used, constitutes the expressed method adopted by the Supreme Court to accommodate the public policy concerns expressed in <em>Storm, supra, </em>141 <em>N.J. </em>at 254, 661 A.2d 790.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">The certification form attached here as Exhibit B was approved by the Administrative Director of the Courts in 1999 to comply with the mandate of <em>Rule </em>7:8-7(b). The certification is electronically available to all of the municipal courts of this State. Municipal Courts have an obligation to provide this certification form to any private attorney seeking leave to assume the role of prosecutor in a given case.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">The municipal court\u2019s failure to enforce the requirements of <em>Rule </em>7:8~7(b) rendered defendant\u2019s conviction for the petty disorderly offense of harassment void <em>ab initio. </em>Thus, we need not reach the remaining issues raised by defendant in this appeal. We remand this matter for a new trial. We do not retain jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">Reversed and remanded.
