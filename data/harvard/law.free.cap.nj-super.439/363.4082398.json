(mother) appeals a final judgment entered by the Family Part terminating her parental rights to her daughter, Ann,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> born in 2012. Ann has been in the custody of the Division of Child Protection and Permanency (the Division) since she was six days old. At the time of trial, Ann was in the physical custody of a family friend, Beth, who has had physical custody of Ann since she was six weeks old and wishes to adopt her. The identity of Ann\u2019s father is unknown. For the reasons that follow, we remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-13\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b393-14\">On the day Ann was born, the Division received a referral that the mother and baby tested positive for Phencyclidine (PCP). The Division filed a verified complaint for the care, custody, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>supervision of Ann pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.21, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4C-12, and <em>Rule </em>5:21-1, and subsequently obtained legal custody of the baby.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">The mother has a long-standing history of abusing PCP. Despite participating in numerous substance abuse treatment programs, she has been unable to overcome her addiction. When Ann was born the mother had two other children, but both had been removed from her care; a relative now has kinship legal guardianship over these children. Four months after Ann\u2019s birth, the mother moved to Colorado and has visited Ann only three times since. The mother did not comply with any court ordered services and, throughout the litigation, tested positive for drugs or refused to submit to drug tests, creating the inference she would have tested positive had she submitted a urine sample to the Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">On July 25, 2013, the Division filed a complaint for guardianship. At a compliance review hearing held on October 21, 2013, the mother informed the court that she was part Native American, specifically, Cherokee, as were both of her parents. She was not, however, an \u201cenrolled\u201d or \u201cregistered\u201d member of any Cherokee tribe. At that time, the mother provided the names of her parents and three out of her four grandparents, including the maiden name of one grandmother. She did not know the birth dates of either parent or any of her grandparents, but was instructed to submit this information to the Division. The mother was not asked to provide any other information.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">The mother did not give the Division the requested information or provide any other details about her forebears\u2019 Cherokee heritage, but during a pretrial conference held on January 9, 2014, the court indicated the Division planned to contact K.T.D.\u2019s mother for additional information about the family\u2019s Native American background. The guardianship trial was held shortly thereafter, on January 23 and 30, 2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">During the trial the Division called psychologist Linda Jeffrey, Ph.D., as an expert witness. The court found Dr. Jeffrey \u201chighly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>credible.\u201d She testified the mother had a \u201cvery serious constellation of issues,\u201d which included not only a marked and unrelenting dependence on substances, but also severe mental health afflictions. These included unspecified schizophrenia spectrum disorder, borderline paranoia, and intermittent explosive disorder. The expert opined the mother was not able to safely parent Ann, and there was no bond between the child and the mother. Ann, however, was securely attached to Beth; if Ann were removed from Beth\u2019s care, Ann would suffer severe and enduring harm. In addition to Dr. Jeffrey, a Division caseworker also testified and recounted the services made available to the mother in both New Jersey and Colorado.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">K.T.D.\u2019s mother, Edna, testified that two of Ann\u2019s great, great grandmothers were part Native American. One great, great grandmother was from K.T.D\u2019s father\u2019s side and the other was from Edna\u2019s side of the family. One was half Cherokee, but Edna did not know if she had ever been registered or affiliated with a tribe. Edna provided the name and maiden name of this relative. The other great, great grandmother was \u201chalf Indian,\u201d but was never affiliated or registered with any tribe. Edna mentioned her name and testified that she was \u201cstill digging\u201d to find out if other members of the family were affiliated with a Native American tribe.</p>\n<p id=\"pAtq\">At the conclusion of the guardianship trial, the trial court found that the Division met the four prongs in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4C-15.1(a)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>by clear and convincing evidence and terminated the mother\u2019s parental rights to Ann.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">A Family Part\u2019s decision to terminate parental rights will not be disturbed when there is substantial credible evidence in the record to support the court\u2019s findings. <em>N.J. Div. of Youth &amp; Family Servs. v. F.M., </em>211 <em>N.J. </em>420, 448, 48 A.3d 1075 (2012) (citing <em>N.J. Div. of Youth &amp; Family Servs. v. M.M., </em>189 <em>N.J. </em>261, 279, 914 A.2d 1265 (2007)). \u201cOnly when the trial court\u2019s conclusions are so \u2018clearly mistaken\u2019 or \u201cwide of the mark\u2019 should an appellate court intervene and make its own findings to ensure that there is not a denial of justice.\u201d <em>N.J. Div. of Youth &amp; Family Servs. v. E.P., </em>196 <em>N.J. </em>88, 104, 952 A.2d 436 (2008) (quoting <em>N.J. Div. of Youth &amp; Family Servs. v. G.L., </em>191 <em>N.J. </em>596, 605, 926 A.2d 320 (2007)). Further, appellate courts should defer to decisions made by a Family Part judge that are heavily dependent upon the judge\u2019s credibility determinations. <em>N.J. Div. of Youth &amp; Family Servs. v. R.G., </em>217 <em>N.J. </em>527, 552-53, 90 A.3d 1258 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">Here, we find unassailable the trial court\u2019s conclusion that all four prongs in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4C-15.1 were proven by clear and convincing evidence. The mother\u2019s claim that the Division failed to prove these statutory factors is devoid of merit and does not warrant discussion in a written opinion. <em>R. </em>2:11 \u2014 3(e)(1)(E). However, the mother also argues a remand is warranted so that the Cherokee tribes and the Department of Interior, Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), can be notified of the termination proceedings. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">The Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978, 25 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1901-1963 (ICWA) was enacted to protect and preserve Native <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>American families by limiting the ability of state courts to remove an Indian child from his or her family. <em>See Miss. Band of Choctaw Indians v. Holyfield, </em>490 <em>U.S. </em>30, 32, 109 <em>S.Ct. </em>1597, 1599-600, 104 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>29, 36 (1989). The legislative history of the ICWA emphasized that the \u201cseparation of Indian children from their families is perhaps the most tragic and destructive aspect of American Indian life today.\u201d <em>H.R. Rep. </em>No. 95-1386 (1978). The Congressional findings accompanying the ICWA state that Indian children are essential to the continued existence and integrity of Indian tribes, 25 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1901(3), and vests in the ICWA control over the custody, adoption, and termination of parental rights of Indian children. <em>In re Adoption of Child of Indian Heritage, </em>219 <em>N.J.Super. </em>28, 31, 529 A.2d 1009 (App.Div.1987), <em>aff'd </em>111 <em>N.J. </em>155, 543 A.2d 925 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">The ICWA contains a provision requiring that in any termination of parental rights proceeding where a state court knows or has reason to know that the child involved is an \u201cIndian child,\u201d the child\u2019s tribe or, if the tribe cannot be identified, the BIA, must be notified of the proceeding. 25 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 1912(a). The purpose of giving notice is to give the Indian tribe the opportunity to determine whether the child is an \u201cIndian child\u201d as defined by the ICWA, <em>see In re Jeffrey A., </em>103 <em>Cal.App.4th </em>1103, 127 Cal.Rptr.2d 314, 317 (2002), and, if so, to intervene in the termination proceeding. Indian tribes have exclusive authority to determine who is a member or eligible for membership in a tribe. <em>Ordinance 59 Ass\u2019n v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Interior Sec\u2019y, </em>163 <em>F.</em>3d 1150, 1153 n. 3 (10th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">Indian tribes have the right to intervene under the ICWA because they have an interest in Indian children that is commensurate with that of a parent. \u201cThe numerous prerogatives accorded the tribes through the ICWA\u2019s substantive provisions ... must ... be seen as a means of protecting not only the interests of individual Indian children and families, but also of the tribes themselves.\u201d <em>Miss. Band of Choctaw Indians, supra, </em>490 <em>U.S. </em>at 49, 109 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1609, 104 L.Ed.2d at 47; <em>See In re Adoption of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number><em>Halloway, </em>732 P.2d 962, 969 (Utah 1986) (Indian tribes have \u201can interest in the child which is distinct from but on a parity with the interest of the parents.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">Moreover, under the ICWA the burden of proof imposed upon the party seeking to terminate a party\u2019s parental rights is beyond a reasonable doubt. 25 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1912(f). Specifically, the moving party in a termination proceeding must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the child is likely to suffer serious emotional or physical damage if left in the parent\u2019s custody. <em>Ibid. </em>Further, if an Indian child is to be adopted, in the absence of good cause to the contrary, preference must be given to placement with a member of the child\u2019s extended family, other members of the Indian child\u2019s tribe, or other Indian families. 25 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1915(a). The failure to give notice can have very serious consequences. A tribe can petition a court to invalidate a judgment terminating parental rights if notice was not provided in compliance with the ICWA. 25 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1914.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">The ICWA defines an \u201cIndian child\u201d as \u201cany unmarried person who is under age eighteen and is either (a) a member of an Indian tribe or (b) is eligible for membership in an Indian tribe and is the biological child of a member of an Indian tribe.\u201d 25 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1903(4). Tribes have different criteria of what constitutes being a member of a tribe, and being registered or enrolled is not necessarily determinative of whether a person is a member of a particular tribe. <em>See U.S. v. Broncheau, </em>597 F.2d 1260, 1263 (1979). Some tribes recognize a person as a member if he is a descendant of a tribal member who was listed on the tribal rolls as of a specific date. For example, the Constitution of the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> states that one can be a citizen of that tribe if he or she is either an original enrollee or a descendant of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>original enrollee who was listed on the Dawes Commission Rolls.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Const, of the Cherokee Nation, </em>art. Ill, \u00a7 I. Other tribes require a certain quantum of tribal blood or residency on a reservation to be deemed a member. <em>Broncheau, supra, </em>597 F.2d at 1263.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">The BIA has issued guidelines to assist in interpreting the ICWA. <em>See Guidelines for State Courts; Indian Child Custody Proceedings, </em>44 <em>Fed.Reg. </em>67584 (Nov. 26, 1979). While not binding upon state courts, they are helpful in interpreting provisions in the ICWA. <em>See In re Adoption of a Child of Indian Heritage, supra, </em>219 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 41, 529 A.2d 1009 (citing <em>In re Junious M., </em>144 <em>Cal.App.3d </em>786, 193 <em>Cal.Rptr. </em>40 (1983)). The guidelines address the circumstances under which a court should have reason to believe a child is Indian. <em>Guidelines for State Courts; Indian Child Custody Proceedings, </em>44 <em>Fed.Reg. </em>67584, 67586 (Nov. 26, 1979). These non-exclusive circumstances occur when:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-7\">(i) any party to the case, Indian tribe, Indian organization or public or private agency informs the court that the child is an Indian child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-8\">(ii) any public or state licensed agency involved in child protection services or family support has discovered information which suggests that the child is an Indian child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-9\">(iii) the child who is the subject of the proceeding gives the court reason to believe he or she is an Indian child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-10\">(iv) the residence or the domicile of the child, his or her biological parents, or the Indian custodial is known by the court to be or is shown to be a predominately Indian community.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-11\">(v) an officer of the court involved in the proceeding has knowledge that the child may be an Indian child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-12\"><em>[Guidelines for State Courts; Indian Child Custody Proceedings, </em>44 <em>Fed. </em>Reg. 67584, 67586 (Nov. 26,1979).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-13\">Only paragraph (i) is implicated in this case. Here, the mother reported during a compliance review hearing that ancestors on both her mother\u2019s and father\u2019s side of the family were part <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>Native American. The mother provided the names of some of these ancestors. During the guardianship trial, K.T.D.\u2019s mother testified she had an ancestor that was half Cherokee and that K.T.D.\u2019s father had an ancestor that was \u201chalf Indian.\u201d K.T.D.\u2019s mother also provided some identifying information about the descendants of these two ancestors. Given what K.T.D. and her mother reported to the court, there was sufficient reason to know or believe Ann might be an Indian child as defined under the ICWA. Even if there were any uncertainty, \u201c \u2018it is preferable to err on the side of giving notice.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Guardianship of J.O., </em>327 <em>N.J.Super. </em>304, 315, 743 A.2d 341 (App.Div.) (quoting <em>Family Independence Agency v. Maynard (In re Maynard), </em>233 <em>Mich. App. </em>438, 592 N.W.2d 751, 757 (1999)), <em>cert. denied, </em>165 <em>N.J. </em>492, 758 A.2d 651 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">Accordingly, under 25 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 23.11, the Cherokee tribes and the BIA should have been notified of, among other things, the guardianship proceeding and the tribes\u2019 right to intervene. To the extent of its knowledge, the Division was also obligated to provide those details about Ann\u2019s genealogy required in the regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">The Division argued that, because the mother failed to supply the information about Ann\u2019s genealogy<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> required in the regulation, the Division was relieved of its obligation to send any notices. We disagree. The regulation requires that such information be provided only to the extent it is known. Further, because the ICWA presumes that it is in an Indian child\u2019s best interests that he or she not be separated from family and tribal heritage, the mother\u2019s actions or inactions should not affect the protections afforded to Ann under the ICWA.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>The Division also assumed that, in order to be a member of a tribe, one has to be formally enrolled or registered. However, not only is that incorrect but also Indian tribes have exclusive authority to determine who is a member of a tribe. <em>Ordinance 59 Ass\u2019n, supra, </em>163 F.3d at 1153 n. 3. Further, because the information provided to the Family Part was not sufficient to determine the identity of the tribe to which K.T.D.\u2019s paternal ancestors may have belonged, the Division was required to send a notice to the BIA providing, among other things, \u201cas much information as is known on the Indian child\u2019s direct lineal ancestors.... \u201d <em>See </em>25 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 23.11(b). Once it receives an appropriate notice, the BIA must make reasonable efforts to locate and notify the appropriate tribe of the termination proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">We are thus compelled to remand this matter so that the appropriate notices can be provided to the Cherokee tribes and the BIA in accordance with the ICWA and its implementing regulations. <em>See </em>25 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 1912(a); 25 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 23.11. Although it is imperative that notice be provided at the earliest possible time to avoid undue disruption or delay of Guardianship proceedings, notice must be provided even at this late stage.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">To minimize the delay in securing permanency and stability for Ann, the trial court shall ensure that the notices are sent forthwith. The judgment terminating parental rights shall be deemed affirmed if after being served with the requisite notices under the ICWA: (1) no tribe responds to the notices within the time provided under the ICWA; (2) no tribe determines within the time allotted under the ICWA that Ann is an Indian child as defined by the ICWA; or (3) the court determines, after the tribes have been given an opportunity to intervene, that the ICWA does not to apply to this matter. If Ann is determined to be an Indian child under the ICWA, the judgment terminating parental rights shall be vacated and the trial court shall hold further proceedings consistent with the ICWA. All proceedings shall be conducted as expeditiously as practicable in accordance with the overarching goal of attaining permanency for Ann.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>Remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.
