This is simply stated as a ground of the.motion for new trial, and is not verified in any manner so that it can be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-13\">The second ground of the motion for new trial is thus stated: Because, no plea of not guilty was made or entered by the defendant herein, nor by anyone for him, neither did he decline or refuse to enter such plea. This is in no way verified. The judgment recites that, the defendant pleaded not guilty. As this matter is presented it can not be considered, especially in view of the fact that the recital of the judgment shows the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-14\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-15\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
