It is unnecessary to discuss this question. Such an indictment has recently been passed upon by this court in Chapman v. State, 63 Texas Crim. Rep., 494, 140 S. W., 441, and such an indictment held fatally defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">The officers and grand jury seem to be misled by the decision of this court in Purvis v. State, 52 Texas Crim. Rep., 343, and Singleton v. State, 53 Texas Crim. Rep., 625. These cases were modified or .overruled by this court in an opinion by Presiding Judge Davidson in Purvis v. State, 62 Texas Crim. Rep., 302, 137 S. W., 701. Pnder the authority of the Chapman case, supra, and the Purvis case, 62 Texas Crim. Rep., 302, 137 S. W., 701, the judgment in this case must be reversed and the cause, ordered dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
