She recognized the appellant as that man and testified positively on the stand that it was he. She was confirmed by the neighbor lady who testified she awoke on Mrs. Caldwell\u2019s screaming and when she awoke she saw the man. He had gotten up and she saw him turn and walk out of the back gallery. The husbands of the two ladies were at that time returning home and had gotten pretty close, heard the scream, ran to the house but saw no one when they got there. Two other persons, going towards the town to their homes, beyond the Caldwell residence, heard the woman scream and soon afterwards met a man running from that direction. About an hour and a half, or two hours later, a policeman arrested the appellant on the streets of the town; when the arrest was first attempted he started to run, but upon the officer presenting his pistol he desisted. The officer searched him and found on his person one silver dollar, two quarters, a dime and a nickel. On the night of the burglary Mrs. Caldwell had a purse lying on her machine in the room where she and the others were 'asleep the night the burglary occurred. In the purse she had one silver dollar, two quarters and a nickel. Appellant made no explanation of where he got, or how he came by the money when the officer searched him, or at any other time. On the trial, however, one witness testified that he paid him that day $1.25, or $1.50 and gave him an order on another for $1.75 which he collected. Neither of these witnesses and no other, testified of what the money they paid him consisted, whether of currency, or silver or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>of what denomination, if silver. None of the witnesses, except Mrs. Caldwell, could identify the appellant as the burglar. As stated above, however, she did so positively.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">The court gave a correct charge in the ease. No attack is made on the charge other than defendant complains the court did not charge on circumstantial evidence. As appellant was positively identified as the burglar it would have been improper for the court to have charged on circumstantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">The court in his charge not only properly directed the jury that they must believe beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant committed the burglary with intent to steal, but in a separate paragraph expressly told them that they must believe beyond a reasonable doubt that it was the appellant and if they had a reasonable doubt on that point they would acquit him. In addition to this, he gave a special charge at appellant\u2019s request to the effect that \u201cif you believe from the evidence that the person seen by Mrs. Caldwell, if you believe that she did see someone there, might have been some one else, or if you have a reasonable doubt as to whether it was the defendant, you will find the defendant not guilty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">Appellant requested several other special charges. We have examined each of these charges and the court did not err in refusing all of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">Appellant has one bill of exceptions to this effect: It states that' upon \u25a0 the trial of the cause, the State placed Frank Glasgow on the witness stand and asked him this question: \u201cQ. After you arrested him, did you search him? A. Wes, sir.\u2019 Q. How much money did you find on him? A. \u2018My recollection is '$1.65.\u2019 Q.\u2018 What kind of money was it?\u2019 At this juncture appellant\u2019s attorney said: \u2018We object to any testimony as to the money, unless the money is identified by Mrs. Caldwell as the money she lost that night.\u2019 The court: T overrule the objection.\u2019 Whereupon the witness answered there was a silver dollar. The county attorney then asked him, \u2018Did he have any quarters or dollars ?\u2019 Whereupon, appellant\u2019s attorney said: T object to counsel leading this witness.\u2019 The court: \u2018I sustain the objection,\u2019 after which remark of the court counsel for the State asked the following question: \u2018Q. What kind of silver money was it?\u2019 A. \u2018My recollection is it was a dollar, two quarters and a dime and a nickel.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b532-9\">The above is the substance in full of the bill as allowed by the court. As the matter is presented it shows no error whatever. The testimony was admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-10\">Another bill by appellant states that while this case was on trial and said Glasgow was testifying for the State, on direct examination, he testified as follows: \u201c\u2018Q. Where was the defendant when you arrested him?\u2019 A. \u2018On East Walnut Street.\u2019 Q. \u2018Do you know where he boards?\u2019 A. \u2018Yes, sir.\u2019 Q. \u2018Where is it?\u2019 A. \u2018At McDonald\u2019s boarding house, on West Elm Street.\u2019 Q. \u2018With, reference with whether he was going towards the boarding house, or going west?\u2019 A. \u2018He was going di<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>rectly east on Walnut Street.\u2019\u201d The appellant objected to this upon the ground \u201cThat it was immaterial and irrelevant to any issue involved and that it in no way tended to connect the defendant with the alleged crime, and prejudicial to the rights of the defendant.\u201d The court overruled this objection. The bill as presented points out no error. The testimony was admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">By another bill appellant shows that he asked, on cross-examination, said witness Glasgow if it was not a fact that he had some boys in jail not long ago and because they would not confess to vagrancy he slapped one of them with his hand after he had him in jail. The witness answered that he did not. The county attorney then said: \u201cI think the court can see the character of cross-examination counsel expects and desires,to pursue,\u201d and he objected to it that it was immaterial, had nothing to do with the case and was an effort by defendant\u2019s counsel to try to lug in something by questions of what might have been done, but sheds no light on the issue in this case. Appellant\u2019s attorney thereupon stated: \u201cWe want to offer this character of evidence on cross-examination of this witness to show that this particular officer is handy with his gun and uses it that way for the purpose of forcing prisoners to confess to crimes, whether they committed them or not. He admits he did hit this defendant with his gun when he was carrying him up the street, and he does do this and did so in this case, and we can show he does it for the purpose of getting confessions out of the men whom he has arrested, and it is material in this case, because he has tried that process on this defendant and don\u2019t have his confession here to the crime he is charged with.\u201d The court sustained the objection and at the request of the county attorney instructed the jury that they were trying the case by the law and evidence and not according to remarks of counsel. Appellant\u2019s attorney then said, \u201cWe except.\u201d This is in substance the whole of the bill. This witness had testified on cross-examination that after he arrested the appellant and was taking him to the jail that he attempted to escape, and that he struck him with his pistol and then drew his pistol on him to prevent his escape. The way this matter is presented no error is shown by this bill. Ho purported confession by the appellant was in any way offered in evidence in this case, nor is there any intimation that the appellant made any. Certainly the fact, if it be a fact, that the officer at some other time may have mistreated some other prisoner in an attempt to get a confession out of him was inadmissible in this case for any purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">By another bill appellant shows that when his attorney was cross-examining Mrs. Caldwell he asked her: \u201cQ. If he had on boots they were just like his pants?\u201d she having theretofore, in her testimony, identified appellant as the party who made the entry into her house and she had testified she knew him by his dress and clothing. The State objected to this because it called for a conclusion. The court sustained the objection and excluded the testimony to which appellant excepted. The court, in approving the bill, qualified it by stating: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>\u201cThe witness had testified that she did not know whether the defendant had on boots or shoes\u2014that she did not notice his feet.\u201d As this bill present's the matter no error is shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">Another bill shows that while the case was being tried and Mrs. Caldwell was testifying for the State, this occurred: \u201cQ. \u2018Where was your purse that night?\u2019 A. \u2018Lying in the room where we were, lying on the machine close to Mrs. Pitts.\u2019 Q. \u2018Did you find it after you had seen the defendant in your room ?\u2019 A. \u2018We did not look for it until the next morning.\u2019 Q. \u2018Is that it you have there?\u2019 A. \u2018Yes, sir.\u2019 Q. \u2018Where did you find it then ?\u2019 A. \u2018Under the floor of the front' gallery porch.\u2019 Q. \u2018Had there been anything in it the night before ?\u2019 A. \u2018Yes, sir.\u2019 Q. \u2018How much ?\u2019 A. \u2018$1.55.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">The appellant objected to this on the grounds that it was an attempt to introduce in evidence the purse which it was not shown was stolen or taken from the house; that the defendant had at no time been seen with it and that the purse or its contents which were found on the premises the following day could in no way have anything to do with the guilt or innocence of the appellant and that the whereabouts of the purse until it was shown to have at some time been in the possession of the defendant was immaterial, irrelevant and tended to prejudice the jury against the rights of the defendant, and that it was an attempt to get the purse in evidence as recently stolen property and should not have been admitted, unless shown by positive evidence that the defendant had the same in his possession. The court admitted this testimony over these objections. The testimony was clearly admissible under the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-8\">As shown in the statement of the case above, this purse with $1.55 in it was on Mrs. Caldwell\u2019s machine in the room where she and others were asleep at the time the burglar was in her house. The purse, without any money in it, was found the next day under Mrs. Caldwell\u2019s house.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-9\">The evidence was amply sufficient to sustain the verdict. There is no other question raised necessary to be decided. The judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-10\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
