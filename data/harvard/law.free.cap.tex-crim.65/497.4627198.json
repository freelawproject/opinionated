C. Clark or bearer $7:50</p>\n<p id=\"b524-9\">Seven fifte..................................... Dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-10\">T. E. Booe.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b524-11\">The instrument introduced in evidence is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b524-12\">\u201cSherman, Texas, Nov. 15, 1909.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-13\">THE COMMEECIAL NATIONAL BANK OP SHEEMAN, TEXAS.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-15\">Pay to W. C. Clark seven and 50/100 Dollars ($7.50).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-16\">C. N. B. T. E. Booe.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b524-17\">An inspection of these two instruments show they are not the same in words and figures. The instrument declared on in the indictment says: \u201cPay to W. C. Clark or bearer $7.50\u201d with the words \u201cSeven fifte Dollars. T. E. Booe.\u201d The instrument introduced in evidence contains this language: \u201cPay to W. C. Clark seven and 50/100 Dollars ($7.50) C. N. B.\u201d Endorsed on back. W. C. Clark. This constitutes such a variance under the law of forgery that this conviction can not be sustained. Looking to the face of the two instruments it is plainly discerhable that they are not'the same. The instrument introduced in evidence must correspond with that set out in the indictment. This necessitates a reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-18\">There are some other interesting questions suggested. Upon another trial the misconduct of the jury may not arise. The jury discussed the failure of the defendant to testify, and emphasized the fact that he did not write his name so that the jury could inspect it during the trial and compare it with the writing as shown on the instrument. This can not be considered in view of the fact that there were no affidavits attached to the motion for new trial, and the only evidence in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>the record was filed after the conclusion of the term of court. But we call attention to it so this may not occur upon another trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">The evidence is not satisfactory that appellant forged the note. The State witness Booe testified he did not give appellant authority to sign his name to it. The State relied for a conviction practically upon Wilson\u2019s testimony to the effect that he traded for the check from appellant, and in his judgment the name W. C. Clark written by appellant on the check was the same as the handwriting of the name in the check.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">Because of a variance between the instrument declared on and that introduced in .evidence the judgment will be reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
