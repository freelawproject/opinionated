The information in this case charges that appellant \u201cdid habitually associate with a prostitute, to wit: Bertha Pearson, the said Bertha Pearson then and there being a prostitute.\u201d In no part of the complaint is appellant said to be a \"male person,\u201d nor is any allegation used from which it could be inferred that he was a man, unless it be the fact that he was named \u201cJim.\u201d This is a name generally given to persons of the masculine gender, and we are not authorized to conclusively so presume in passing on the sufficiency of the indictment. It is not an offense for a woman to associate with a prostitute under the provisions of the Act. The information is insufficient to charge an offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">Again, we hardly think the evidence would support the conviction. The statute was intended to reach a class of persons who associated with prostitutes as their equals, or who associated with them in public, and was not intended to make a vagrant of a person who, at night, went occasionally to the room of a woman of loose morals, and yet who at no other time was seen in her company. The word \u201chabitually\u201d has a definite and fixed meaning in law, and in saying \u201chabitually associated with prostitutes\u201d it was intended to reach a class of persons who made a habit of associating with them, either in public or private, and going to their room occasionally at night, even though it was for an immoral purpose, would not bring one within the definition of this offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">We have a statute denouncing as an offense one who habitually has carnal intercourse with a woman, it being fornication or adultery, as the facts may show, and if a person made a habit of going to a woman\u2019s house, it would come within the definition of these offenses, but not within the terms of the Vagrancy Act, for it is a different offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-9\">The judgment is reversed and the prosecution ordered dismissed because of the insufficiency of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-11\">\n<em>Dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
