There is no such motion in the record, and no bill of exceptions was reserved to the action of the court in overruling same, if any such motion was- presented. Wesley v. State, 60 Texas Crim. Rep., <em>299.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b74-26\">The newly discovered evidence alleged is insufficient to authorize a reversal of the case. The fact that the alleged injured party had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>once been sent to the penitentiary for theft, hut had been pardoned and his citizenship restored, would not affect the admissibility of his evidence. It might affect his credit as a witness, but it has been expressly held by this court in Barber v. State, 35 Texas Crim. Rep., 70, that newly discovered evidence will not authorize a new trial if the purpose of such evidence be merely to impeach or discredit a witness who has testified. on the trial. See also Butts v. State, 35 Texas Crim. Rep., 364; Scruggs v. State, 35 Texas Crim. Rep., 622; Franklin v. State, 34 Texas Crim. Rep., 203; Grate v. State, 23 Texas Crim. App., 458.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">The court did not err in not presenting the issue of aggravated assault. The defendant\u2019s testimony, if believed, presented self-defense, and this was fully presented in the charge of the court, and there is no complaint in the motion for a new trial that the cour-t did not fairly submit that issue. The State\u2019s case would make a case of assault to murder. The evidence shows that appellant and Jim Peterson had trouble in the morning in the field while plowing. That he run from Peterson, and then went to a residence, secured a Winchester rifle, and that afternoon returned to the field and demanded a settlement. Failing to get it, he shot Peterson while he was running from him. As before stated, the evidence from the State\u2019s standpoint fully supports the verdict, while the evidence of the defendant would justify him in his action, but does not present a state of facts that if death had resulted would reduce the offense to manslaughter, if he was guilty of any offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">These are all the grounds stated in the motion for a new trial, and we are not permitted under the decisions of this court to consider grounds stated in the assignments of error, filed- later on, not included in the motion for a new trial.
