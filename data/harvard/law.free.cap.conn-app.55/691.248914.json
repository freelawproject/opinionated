J.</author>\n<p id=\"ANYs\">The plaintiff, Christie Mikolinski, appeals from the trial court\u2019s judgment dismissing her appeal from the decision of the defendant commissioner of motor vehicles (commissioner). The court sustained the commissioner\u2019s suspension of the plaintiffs license to operate a motor vehicle on the ground that she had operated her vehicle while her blood alcohol content was in excess of the limit prescribed in General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 14-227b (f), now \u00a7 14-227b (g).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The plaintiff claims that the court improperly concluded that (1) the initial stop of her vehicle was constitutionally valid, (2) her detention by the police for further investigation was proper and (3) there was probable cause to find that she was operating her vehicle on a public highway. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>The following facts and procedural history are relevant to this appeal. Between 11 p.m. on May 23, 1997, and 3 a.m. on May 24, 1997, the Southington police department conducted a sobriety checkpoint of eastbound and westbound traffic in the area of 1199 Meri-den-Waterbury Turnpike. Signs were posted in each direction alerting motorists to the checkpoint, and routes exiting the turnpike were available to motorists in each direction who chose not to enter the checkpoint.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">On May 24, 1997, at approximately 1:35 a.m., the plaintiff entered the checkpoint and stopped her vehicle. While the plaintiff was stopped, a police officer asked her a number of questions. He then directed the plaintiff to an adjacent parking lot where a second officer conducted a detailed investigation. Upon approaching the plaintiffs vehicle, the second officer smelled a strong odor of alcohol on the plaintiffs breath and noticed that her eyes were red and glassy. He administered several sobriety tests, all of which the plaintiff failed. The second officer then placed her under arrest for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of liquor in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The plaintiff was transported to the Southington police station, where she was advised <em>of </em>her lights and given an opportunity to contact an attorney. After electing not to call an attorney, she agreed to submit to a blood alcohol test, the results of which indicated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>that her blood alcohol content exceeded the statutory limit.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">On May 30,1997, the commissioner sent a suspension notice to the plaintiff advising her that due to the results of the blood alcohol test, her license to operate a motor vehicle would be suspended for a ninety day period commencing on June 23, 1997. The notice offered the plaintiff an opportunity, pursuant to \u00a7 14-227b, to attend a hearing to contest the suspension prior to the effective date of the suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">The hearing was held before a hearing officer, acting for the commissioner, who determined that the four requirements of \u00a7 14-227b (f) were met.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The plaintiff appealed to the trial court, which affirmed the decision of the commissioner and dismissed the appeal. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b716-8\">REVIEWABILITY</p>\n<p id=\"b716-9\">We must first address the threshold question of whether this appeal is reviewable. The record on appeal does not contain a written memorandum of decision or a transcribed copy of an oral decision signed by the trial court. See Practice Book \u00a7 64-1 (a), formerly \u00a7 4059 (a).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The duty to provide this court with a record adequate for review rests with the appellant. Practice Book <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>\u00a7 61-10, formerly \u00a7 4007; <em>Auric Answering Service, Inc. </em>v. <em>Glenayre Electronics, Inc., 54 </em>Conn. App. 86, 87, 733 A.2d 307, cert. denied, 250 Conn. 926, 738 A.2d 653 (1999). This court has repeatedly emphasized the importance of compliance with Practice Book \u00a7 64-1 and has frequently declined to review claims when the appellant fails to provide the court with an adequate record for review. <em>State </em>v. <em>Beliveau, </em>52 Conn. App. 475, 480-81, 727 A.2d 737, cert. denied, 249 Conn. 920, 733 A.2d 235 (1999); <em>Chase Manhattan Bank/City Trust </em>v. <em>AECO Elevator Co., </em>48 Conn. App. 605, 608-609, 710 A.2d 190 (1998); <em>Emigrant Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Erickson, </em>46 Conn. App. 51, 53-54, 696 A.2d 1057, cert. denied, 243 Conn. 921, 701 A.2d 341 (1997); <em>State </em>v. <em>Rios, </em>30 Conn. App. 712, 714-15, 622 A.2d 618 (1993). More specifically, we have declined to afford review where the \u201crecord on appeal\u201d failed to contain a signed copy of the trial court\u2019s oral memorandum of decision. <em>Chase Manhattan Bank/City Trust </em>v. <em>AECO Elevator Co., </em>supra, 607-609; <em>Emigrant Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Erickson, </em>supra, 53-54.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">The requirements of Practice Book \u00a7 64-1 are not met by simply filing with the appellate clerk a transcript of the entire trial court proceedings. <em>Tolchinsky </em>v. <em>East Lyme, </em>43 Conn. App. 456, 457, 683 A.2d 747 (1996); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Yopp, </em>35 Conn. App. 740, 749-50, 646 A.2d 298 (1994) (declining review when neither written memorandum of decision nor transcript signed by trial court was included in record). A transcript is not even required to be filed in all appeals. See Practice Book \u00a7 63-4 (a) (3), formerly \u00a7 4013.* ****<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Moreover, a transcript <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>of colloquies between the trial court and counsel is of limited, if any, assistance to the reviewing court. Thus, we have held that the signature of the trial court on an entire trial transcript does not satisfy Practice Book \u00a7 <em>64-1. Auric Answering Service, Inc. </em>v. <em>Glenayre Electronics, Inc., </em>supra, 54 Conn. App. 88. Perhaps of greater significance is the fact that the Appellate Court is not even required to consult a transcript, although it may do so in a proper case. Practice Book \u00a7 67-1, formerly \u00a7 4064.* *<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Thus, it is more than possible that significant matters that are only in the transcript and not in the briefs or appendices may not come to the attention of the reviewing court. This is because they are not in the \u201crecord on appeal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">A discussion of what we mean by the \u201crecord on appeal\u201d may be helpful. The chief clerk of the Appellate Court is responsible for the preparation and certification of the record on appeal. Practice Book \u00a7 68-2, formerly \u00a7 4085.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \u201cCounsel have no responsibility for the preparation of the record other than [that] the appellant and appellee must submit (1) a preliminary statement of issues on appeal; (2) a designation of the specific trial pleadings that they deem necessary to include in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>the record; and (3) a docketing statement detailing certain background information on the case and the parties. If a party believes the trial record is defective or inadequate, he must resort to a motion for rectification or articulation.\u201d C. Tait, Connecticut Appellate Practice and Procedure (2d Ed. 1993) \u00a7 4.3 (a). An example of a defective or inadequate record requiring rectification would be the omission by the clerk of the trial court\u2019s written or transcribed oral decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-4\">\u201cTo determine what to include, the chief clerk must study the case with sufficient care and study the designation of contents of records required to be submitted by the parties. In preparing the record, the chief clerk is permitted to confer with counsel and with the clerk of the court. Although the clerk is responsible for the preparation of the record, the appellant should double check to [e]nsure that all necessary portions are included because an inadequate record may generate an appellate remand or refusal to review.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., \u00a7 4.4 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">\u201cIn a case tried to the court, the record must contain the decision of the trial judge. If the decision was in writing, the record should include the memorandum of decision. If the decision was oral, the record should include the court reporter\u2019s transcription of the court\u2019s decision, signed by the judge.\u201d*<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Id., \u00a7 4.4 (b). We note that our rales of practice do not provide for the inclusion of the trial transcript as part of the record on appeal. In fact, the contrary is true. \u201cThe rules state that no portion of the transcript of evidence should be designated for inclusion, a proscription that also applies to the clerk in the actual printing of the record.\u201d Id., \u00a7 3.20; see Practice Book \u00a7 63-4 (a) (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>In the present case, therefore, we could decline to review the appeal on the ground that the trial court\u2019s oral decision, as transcribed, was not included in the record on appeal. On occasion, however, there have been cases in which we have reviewed claims of error despite an unsigned transcript because the transcript contained a sufficiently detail\u00e9d and concise statement of the trial court\u2019s findings.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Emerald Ridge Property Owners Assn. </em>v. Thornton, 54 Conn. App. 6, 8, 732 A.2d 804 (1999); <em>State </em>v. <em>Sandra O., </em>51 Conn. App. 463, 465, 724 A.2d 1127 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">This is one of those cases. Although the plaintiff was derelict in her duty to furnish an appropriate record, the defendant has come to her rescue by including, in his appendix, an unsigned copy of the transcript of the trial court\u2019s oral decision.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The posture of this appeal, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>therefore, is that we have before us an unsigned copy of the couxt\u2019s decision although the plaintiff has failed to make it a part of the record on appeal. To refuse to review the appeal because it was furnished by the wrong paxty and because the couxt\u2019s signature is lacking would exalt foim over substance. <em>Connecticut National Bank </em>v. <em>Browder, 30 </em>Conn. App. 776, 778-79, 622 A.2d 588 (1993) (where transcript contained detailed and concise statement of trial court\u2019s findings and conclusions, this court reviewed defendants\u2019 claim on appeal in absence of written memorandum or signed ti\u2019anscxipt of oi'al decision so as not to exalt form over substance). Accordingly, because we can discern the court\u2019s reasoning from the material furnished to us by the defendant, we will exercise our discretion and review the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">CONSTITUTIONALITY</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">The plaintiff first claims that there was insufficient evidence of probable cause for her arrest because the initial stop was unconstitutional. We commence our analysis by xxoting that review of the commissioner\u2019s action is highly restricted. <em>O\u2019Rourke </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, </em>33 Conn. App. 501, 506, 636 A.2d 409, cert. denied, 229 Conn. 909, 642 A.2d 1205 (1994). Neither the trial court nor this court, may retry the case or substitute its judgment for that of the commissioner. <em>Buckley </em>v. <em>Mustio, </em>200 Conn. 1, 3, 509 A.2d 489 (1986). \u201cIn order to sustain an administrative decision, all that is required is that the determination be reasonably supported by the evidence in the record. . . . [T]he plaintiff bears the burden of proving that the commissioner\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>decision to suspend a motor vehicle operating privilege was clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative and substantial evidence on the whole record.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Costello </em>v. Kozlowski, 47 Conn. App. 111, 114-15, 702 A.2d 1197 (1997). Substantial evidence exists if the administrative record affords a substantial basis of fact from which the fact in issue reasonably could be inferred. <em>Sweetman </em>v. <em>State Elections Enforcement Commission, </em>249 Conn. 296, 331, 732 A.2d 144 (1999). Accordingly, \u201cif there is evidence . . . which reasonably supports the decision of the commissioner, [the trial court] cannot disturb the conclusion reached by him.\u201d <em>DiBenedetto </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, </em>168 Conn. 587, 589, 362 A.2d 840 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">The plaintiff contends that the checkpoint stop was an unconstitutional seizure. It is well established law that even though stopping a vehicle at a checkpoint is a seizure under both the federal<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and state<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> constitutions, such investigatory seizures and detention are permitted under both constitutions. <em>Michigan Dept. of State Police </em>v. <em>Sitz, </em>496 U.S. 444, 450, 110 S. Ct. 2481, 110 L. Ed. 2d 412 (1990);<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Boisvert, </em>40 Conn. App. 420, 426, 671 A.2d 834, cert. denied, 237 Conn. 903, 674 A.2d 1332 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>This court has held that a roadside checkpoint, established for the purpose of detecting violations of \u00a7 14-227a (a), does not violate our state constitution. <em>State </em>v. <em>Boisvert, </em>supra, 40 Conn. App. 426. We concluded in that decision that \u201csobriety checkpoints are a valid exercise of police power under our state constitution, that no requirement of a \u2018reasonable or articulable suspicion\u2019 must exist for the initial stop, and that the balancing test ... is the proper test to be utilized. That test determines whether the strength of the public interest in combating the threat to public safety of operators of motor vehicles whose ability to operate may be impaired due to the consumption of intoxicating liquor, and the effectiveness of roadside checkpoints outweigh the minimal intrusion on a motorist\u2019s privacy.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-4\">In balancing the public interest in safety against the privacy rights of motor vehicle operators, \u201c[minimal intrusion in the interest of public safety may be allowed in the form of checkpoint stops when the stop is conducted pursuant to a practice embodying neutral criteria.\u201d Id. The proper approach is to apply the balancing test on a case-specific basis to ensure that \u201c[a] citizen\u2019s reasonable right to privacy [is not] subject to random or arbitrary intrusions merely at the whim of law enforcement.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">Itr the present case, the record reflects that the South-ington police set up a checkpoint, stopped traffic going in both directions, posted signs alerting drivers to the checkpoint\u2019s existence and provided them with the opportunity to exit the turnpike prior to the checkpoint. All vehicles that entered the checkpoint were stopped. The officers asked specific questions to each operator and looked for signs that the operator might be under the influence of intoxicating liquor or drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">Our review of the circumstances surrounding the checkpoint satisfies us that the stop of the plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>vehicle did not subject her to a random or arbitrary intrusion. The court reasonably could have concluded that the checkpoint was operated according to neutral guidelines,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and that the underlying facts justified the hearing officer\u2019s conclusion that the need to deter fatal and personal injuries clearly outweighed the minor intrusion on the operator\u2019s right to privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">ARTICULABLE SUSPICION<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">The plaintiff next claims that the police improperly detained her for further investigation. As stated in part II of this opinion, there is no requirement of a reasonable or articulable suspicion to effectuate a valid stop at a checkpoint. Id. For the officer to continue his investigation, however, he must have a reasonable and articulable suspicion that the person has committed or is about to commit a crime. See <em>Price-Crowley </em>v. <em>Kozlowski, </em>49 Conn. App. 481, 485, 714 A.2d 719, cert. denied, 247 Conn. 919, 722 A.2d 811 (1998). The plaintiff argues that, because the record does not evidence a reasonable or articulable suspicion as to why the first officer detained the plaintiff for additional questioning, the continued detainment was unconstitutional. More specifically, the plaintiff bases her argument on the fact that the A-44 police form was completed by the second officer, and not the first officer. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">\u201c[I]f the administrative record provides substantial evidence upon which the hearing officer could reasonably have based his finding . . . the decision must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>upheld.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Bialowas </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, </em>44 Conn. App. 702, 709, 692 A.2d 834 (1997). Under the substantial evidence rule, evidence is sufficient to sustain an agency\u2019s finding if it affords a substantial basis of fact from which the fact in issue reasonably can be inferred. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-4\">Here, the original officer stopped the plaintiff when she entered the checkpoint. Upon questioning her, the first officer directed her to pull into a nearby parking lot for further investigation by a second officer. The plaintiff claims that there is no articulable suspicion for continuing the investigation with a second officer because there is nothing in the record from the first officer to support it. The second officer, who continued the investigation, clearly stated in his A-44 form that he smelled a strong odor of alcohol as he approached the plaintiff and that her eyes were red and glassy.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The hearing officer logically could have inferred that, if the second officer noticed a strong odor of alcohol and observed the plaintiffs red, glassy eyes, those characteristics existed moments before and that the first officer relied on them as his articulable suspicion for the extension of the initial stop. Accordingly, we conclude that there was substantial evidence to support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>the finding that a reasonable and articulable suspicion existed to warrant further investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">PUBLIC HIGHWAY</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">The plaintiffs final claim is that the police lacked probable cause to arrest her for operation of a motor vehicle on a public highway.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The plaintiff relies on the fact that the A-44 form is defective because the police officer failed to put a check mark in a box on the form labeled \u201cOperation on a Public Road.\u201d This argument must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">A similar omission occurred in <em>Volck </em>v. <em>Muzio, </em>204 Conn. 507, 518, 529 A.2d 177 (1987), where the endorsement by a witness to the refusal to take a blood alcohol test was omitted from the police report. Because no objection was raised to the admission of the report at the license suspension hearing, our Supreme Court held that consideration of it by the hearing officer was not improper and the absence of the endorsement did not preclude reliance on the form to justify suspension of the plaintiffs license to operate a motor vehicle. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-8\">In the present case, the plaintiff attempts to distinguish <em>Volck </em>on the grounds that the plaintiff in <em>Volck </em>failed to object to the defective report, whereas the plaintiff in this case objected to its admission. The plaintiff, however, expressly stated, through counsel, that she had no objection to the admission of the A-44 form, although she did object to the narrative attached thereto.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Additionally, at the hearing before the trial court, the plaintiffs counsel expressly acknowledged the failure to object to the admission of the A-44 form <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>at the motor vehicle hearing.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Accordingly, <em>Volck </em>is directly on point.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-4\">The plaintiff further argues that there is nothing in the record from which a hearing officer reasonably could infer that the location where the plaintiff was stopped was a public highway. The question of whether a roadway is a public highway is a question of fact. <em>Ventres </em>v. <em>Farmington, </em>192 Conn. 663, 666-67, 473 A.2d 1216 (1984). Except for the missing check mark, there is nothing in the A-44 form, or the narrative attached thereto, that gives any suggestion that the Meriden-Waterbury Turnpike is not a public highway. In fact, the opposite is true. To conclude that it was not a public highway, we would have to commence with the assumption that the Southington police went onto private property to set up a sobriety checkpoint. Without supporting evidence, that, is not a reasonable assumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">Furthermore, this was not, a criminal prosecution in which the state had the burden of proving every element beyond a reasonable doubt. This was an appeal from an administrative hearing in which the plaintiff had the burden of showing that the commissioner, through his hearing officer, acted contrary to law and in abuse of his discretion. <em>Demma </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, </em>165 Conn. 15, 17, 327 A.2d 569 (1973). The silence of the record as to an issue does not satisfy the plaintiffs burden of proof. See <em>Grillo </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>4 Conn. App. 205, 207, 493 A.2d 275 (1985). This claim, therefore, has no merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b714-8\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 14-227b (f), now \u00a7 14-227b (g), provides in relevant part: \u201cThe hearing shall be limited to a determination of the following issues: (1) Did the police officer have probable cause to arrest the person for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or drug or both ...

The problem arose when appellate counsel failed to take the necessary steps to have the transcribed oral decision signed and filed as part of the record on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b720-7\"> The trial court in an oral decision stated as follows: \u201cI\u2019m prepared to rule on this case. Regarding the issue of the checkpoint stop. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Boisvert, </em>40 Conn. App. 420, [426, 671 A.2d 834, cert. denied, 237 Conn. 903, 674 A.2d 1332 (1996)] the court holds: \u2018Minimal intrusion in the interest of public safety may be allowed in the form of checkpoint stops when the stop is conducted pursuant to a practice embodying neutral criteria.\u2019 Now in that case, which of course was a criminal case and involved an operating under the influence checkpoint, they did have extensive information about the state procedures that were followed, the state police procedures. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b720-8\">\u201cNow, as to the second issue that [the plaintiffs counsel] raises, when you send someone from the checkpoint for further testing, reasonable, articulable suspicion has to exist. I think, you know, that for the purposes of an administrative appeal, it\u2019s not the weight of the evidence, it\u2019s whether substantial evidence exists, and I think it\u2019s a reasonable inference to make that if the other officer shortly after notices a strong odor of alcohol as he approached [the plaintiffs] vehicle, that odor of alcohol would have existed shortly before that, and her reddened, glossy eyes would similarly have existed before that.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-9\">\u201cOn the public highway issue, I\u2019ve looked at the cases cited, and the cases that involve administrative hearings are the parking lot cases, which I think <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>are distinguishable from this case. The reference to the Meriden-Waterbury Turnpike suggests a public highway, the fact that the Southington police chose this road to establish a checkpoint also suggests that it\u2019s a public highway. Sol find that 1 here is substant ial evidence that it is a public highway.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-8\">\u201cClearly, she was operating, the officers had probable cause, as clearly demonstrated in the report, and she was tested and exceeded the limits, and was, of course, arrested.
