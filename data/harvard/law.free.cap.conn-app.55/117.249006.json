The defendant claims that the trial court improperly found him in contempt for wilfully depriving the plaintiff of moneys to which she was entitled under the dissolution judgment by voluntarily resigning his post of employment just prior to receiving a bonus in 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">Because the defendant has failed to provide us with an adequate record, we decline to review his claim. \u201cThe duty to provide this court with a record adequate for review rests with the appellant.
