The plaintiff claims that the board improperly (1) reversed the commissioner\u2019s decision to adjust the plaintiffs benefits cap under General Statutes \u00a7 7-433b (b)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to include overtime earnings prospectively from the date of the Supreme Court decision in <em>Szudora </em>v. <em>Fairfield, </em>214 Conn. 552, 573 A.2d 1 (1990),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and (2) reversed the commissioner\u2019s award of interest and attorney\u2019s fees. We affirm the board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">The following procedural history and facts are necessary to a resolution of this appeal. The plaintiff was employed by the city of Bridgeport (city) as a police officer. On October 16,1981, he suffered a heart attack, was in a coma for eighteen days and sustained considerable brain damage. On November 27,1984, the commissioner issued a finding that the plaintiffs heart disease <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>had resulted in his total incapacity to work and awarded him disability benefits pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 7-433c,1 *<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> commonly referred to as the Heart and Hypertension Act. Benefits conferred pursuant to \u00a7 7-433c are subject to the limitation imposed by \u00a7 7-433b (b) so that they \u201cshall not exceed one hundred per cent of the weekly compensation being paid, during their compensable period, to members of such department in the same position which was held by such member at the time ol'his . . . retirement. . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 7-433b (b). Accordingly, it was determined that the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>tiff was entitled to a maximum compensation rate of $310 per week, which was the base salary, exclusive of overtime, of a similarly situated Bridgeport police officer at that time. No appeal was taken from that 1984 decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">In April, 1990, our Supreme Court decided <em>Szudora </em>v. <em>Fairfield, </em>supra, 214 Conn. 552. <em>Szudora </em>expanded the definition of maximum \u201cweekly compensation\u201d available under \u00a7 7-433b (b) to include overtime earnings as well as base compensation. In 1994, the plaintiff sought to adjust his \u00a7 7-433b (b) benefits cap to account for the inclusion of overtime payments made to similarly situated police officers since April 10, 1984, the plaintiffs date of retirement. On January 31, 1997, the commissioner determined that Szudora\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 7-433b (b) should be applied prospectively,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> from the date of the <em>Szudora </em>decision, to any benefits due the plaintiff. The commissioner, therefore, found that the plaintiff was entitled to an adjusted pay cap that included overtime earnings as well as base compensation, starting in April, 1990. The commissioner further ordered an award of attorney\u2019s fees and interest for the city\u2019s delay in payment of those overtime adjustments.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-6\">The city appealed to the board from the commissioner\u2019s decision, and, while the appeal was before the board, our Supreme Court decided <em>Marone </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>244 Conn. 1, 707 A.2d 725 (1998), which addressed the applicability of the <em>Szudora </em>decision. <em>Marone </em>held that awards that were not pending when <em>Szudora </em>was decided were not entitled to retroactive or prospective application of <em>Szudora. </em>Relying on <em>Marone, </em>the board reversed the commissioner\u2019s decision, and the plaintiff appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-7\">Our standard of review in workers\u2019 compensation cases is well settled. Our role is to determine whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>the board\u2019s decision results from an incorrect application of the law to the subordinate facts or from an inference unreasonably drawn from them. <em>Aurora </em>v. <em>Miami Plumbing &amp; Heating, Inc., </em>6 Conn. App. 45, 47, 502 A.2d 952 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">The present case is controlled by <em>Marone</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and we therefore consider Marone\u2019s two part test for determining whether the plaintiff is entitled to a recalculation of his benefits under <em>Szudora. </em>First, we must determine whether the original award was a pending matter at the time <em>Szudora </em>was decided. If the award was not a pending matter when <em>Szudora </em>was decided, then the plaintiff is not entitled to retroactive application of <em>Szudora. </em>See <em>Marone </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>supra, 244 Conn. 11, n.10. Second, we must address whether the commissioner had the authority to modify the award pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-315.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b815-8\">Here, the plaintiffs 1984 benefits award was a final judgment and was not a pending matter when <em>Szudora </em>was decided in 1990. \u201cGeneral Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 31-301a<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and 31-301b<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> govern the finality of workers\u2019 compensation awards, which become final when and if the parties fail to appeal within the statutory time period.\u201d <em>Marone </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>supra, 244 Conn. 13. Because the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>filed neither an appeal nor a motion to correct the commissioner\u2019s November 27, 1984 finding and award, that decision became final after the appeal period expired, well before <em>Szudora </em>was decided. Thus, the award was not pending when <em>Szudora </em>was decided and, unless the commissioner had the authority to modify the award pursuant to \u00a7 31-315, the plaintiff is not entitled to retroactive or prospective application of <em>Szudora. </em>Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">Although the plaintiffs award was a final judgment and not a pending matter, final judgments may be modified pursuant to statutory authority. Section 31-315 confers authority on the workers\u2019 compensation commission to modify \u00a7 7-433c benefits in certain limited situations.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In the present case, however, the commissioner lacked the authority to modify the award because \u00a7 31-315 does not authorize modifications based on a new interpretation of law such as that contained in <em>Szudora. Marone </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>supra, 244 Conn. 15. The commissioner, therefore, lacked the authority to recalculate the plaintiffs benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>Finally, we are not persuaded by the plaintiffs argument that the commissioner\u2019s adjustment of his benefits cap to include overtime earnings was merely an \u201cenforcement\u201d of the earlier award and not a \u201cmodification\u201d controlled by \u00a7 31-315. The commissioner\u2019s November, 1984 finding and award clearly established the benefits cap to include only the base salary of a similarly situated police officer. There is nothing in the record to suggest that the commissioner\u2019s original award was intended to include overtime compensation as well as base salary in determining the benefits cap. On the contrary, it is evident that the commissioner intended the November 27, 1984 award to be limited to the base compensation of a similarly situated police officer. The plaintiffs efforts to increase his benefits to include overtime payments is clearly an attempt to modify his original 1984 award. For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that modification of the award would be improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">Because the commissioner\u2019s January 31,1997 finding and award improperly modified the plaintiffs benefits to include overtime compensation, it also was improper for the commissioner to have awarded attorney\u2019s fees and interest on outstanding overtime compensation not paid to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">The decision of the workers\u2019 compensation review board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b812-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 7-433b (b) provides: \u201cNotwithstanding the provisions of any general statute, charter or special act to the contrary affecting the noncontributory or contributory retirement systems of any municipality of the state, or any special act providing for a police or firemen benefit fund or other retirement system, the cumulative payments, not including payments for medical care, for compensation and retirement or survivors benefits under section 7-433c shall be adjusted so that the total of such cumulative payments received by such member or his dependents or survivors shall not exceed one hundred per cent of the weekly compensation being paid, during their compensable period, to members of such department in the same position which was held by such member at the time of Ms death or retirement.

Third, \u2018[t]he commissioner shall also have the same power to open and modify an award as any court of the state has to open and modify ajudgment of such court.\u2019 This provision extends the commission\u2019s power to open and modify judgments to cases of accident; <em>Hayden </em>v. <em>Wallace &amp; Sons Mfg.

The final clause of \u00a7 31-315 allows the commission to retain jurisdiction over claims during the entire compensable period.
