The defendant claims that the trial court improperly (1) denied (a) his motion for a continuance to prepare for a hearing on whether to videotape the testimony of the victim pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-86g, (b) granted the state\u2019s motion to videotape the victim\u2019s testimony, (c) denied his motion for a court-ordered expert examination of the victim and (d) denied his motion for a mistrial, (2) precluded the testimony of defense character witnesses not disclosed prior to trial and (3) denied his motion to redact a portion of a videotaped interview with the victim that was conducted nearly two years before trial. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-9\">The following facts are relevant to our disposition of this appeal. From September through November, 1994, the defendant\u2019s daughter-in-law left her four year old daughter, M, and her one and one-half year old son, A, with the defendant and his wife, the children\u2019s grandparents, while she went to work part-time. When the defendant and his wife took care of the children, the children would spend the prior night with them.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>On or about November 10, 1994, when M\u2019s mother came to the grandparents\u2019 house to take the children home, the defendant\u2019s wife told M\u2019s mother that M had wet her pants while playing. M\u2019s mother decided to wait until she got home to change M. She gave both A and M baths. While drying M, she noticed that M\u2019s vaginal area was red and puffy, and asked what was wrong with her \u201cpee-pee.\u201d M responded that she did not know, but when asked if someone had touched her there, M responded, \u201cYes.\u201d When M\u2019s mother asked who had touched her, M responded that the defendant had touched her.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">Elaine Yordan, a physician, examined M on November 21, 1994. Yordan found that M\u2019s vaginal area was normal and noted that her finding was not inconsistent with M\u2019s statement. The next day, Diane Edell, program coordinator and interviewer at the child abuse diagnostic center at Saint Francis Hospital and Medical Center, interviewed M. That interview was videotaped. M stated that the defendant had touched her \u201cpee-pee\u201d with his hand while they were lying on a couch. Additional facts will be set forth where necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b742-8\">The defendant claims that the trial court improperly (1) denied his motion for a continuance to prepare for a midtestimony hearing pursuant to \u00a7 54-86g <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (2) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>granted the state\u2019s motion to videotape M\u2019s testimony, (3) denied the defendant\u2019s motion to have a court-ordered expert examine M and (4) denied his motion for a mistrial. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">The following additional facts are necessary for our resolution of these claims. The state called M as a witness on Friday morning, September 13, 1996. During direct examination, after answering approximately 100 questions, M broke down on the witness stand and began to cry when asked about the details of the assault.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court declared a recess. The victim\u2019s advocate, Linda Heslin, in the presence of the jury, picked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>up M and removed her from the courtroom.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court later recalled the jury and stated: \u201cLadies and gentlemen, it has become clear to us that we\u2019re not going to be able to resume the testimony at this point, at least not until after lunch.\u201d When court resumed that afternoon, the state\u2019s attorney made a motion for a hearing pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Jarzbek, </em>204 Conn. 683, 529 A. 2d 1245 (1987), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 1061, 108 S. Ct. 1017, 98 L. Ed. 2d 982 (1988), to allow the state to videotape the remainder of M\u2019s testimony outside the presence of the defendant pursuant to \u00a7 54-86g. The defendant received the state\u2019s motion at 1:57 p.m. on Friday afternoon. The defendant requested a continuance until the next court session, the following Tuesday morning, so that he could review the relevant law.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court denied the defendant\u2019s motion and held the hearing required by \u00a7 54-86g that afternoon. Additional facts will be set forth where necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">The defendant claims that the trial court improperly denied his motion for a continuance to prepare for the <em>Jarzbek </em>hearing. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>\u201cAppellate review of a trial court\u2019s denial of a motion for a continuance is governed by an abuse of discretion standard that, although not unreviewable, affords the trial court broad discretion in matters of continuances.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>DeCaba, </em>42 Conn. App. 141, 143, 679 A.2d 35, cert. denied, 239 Conn. 915, 682 A.2d 1008 (1996). It is not appropriate for us to decide whether we, as trial judges, would have reached a different result, but, rather, whether the trial court abused its discretion in denying the continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">\u201cIn appellate review of matters of continuances, federal and state courts have identified multiple factors that appropriately may enter into the trial court\u2019s exercise of its discretion. Although the applicable factors cannot be exhaustively catalogued, they generally fall into two categories. One set of factors focuses on the facts of record before the trial court at the time when it rendered its decision. From this perspective, courts have considered matters such as: the timeliness of the request for continuance; the likely length of the delay; the age and complexity of the case; the granting of other continuances in the past; the impact of delay on the litigants, witnesses, opposing counsel and the court; the perceived legitimacy <em>of the reasons proffered, in support of the request; </em>the defendant\u2019s personal responsibility for the timing of the request; the likelihood that the denial would substantially impair the defendant\u2019s ability to defend himself; the availability of other, adequately equipped and prepared counsel to try the case; and the adequacy of the representation already being afforded to the defendant. . . . Another set of factors has included, as part of the inquiry into a possible abuse of discretion, a consideration of the prejudice that the defendant <em>actually suffered </em>by reason of the denial of the motion for continuance. . . . For purposes of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>assessing actual prejudice, the focus is on the adequacy of the defendant\u2019s legal representation subsequent to the trial court\u2019s ruling, as distinguished from its likely adequacy as determined by the trial court at the time of its ruling on the motion for continuance.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis added.) <em>State v. Hamilton, </em>228 Conn. 234, 240-41, 636 A.2d 760 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">The court heard argument from the state and defense counsel regarding the motion for continuance:</p>\n<p id=\"b746-7\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: I\u2019d ask for a continuance to allow me to address this motion. ... I would like a continuance until Tuesday to prepare for this, prepare for evidence, and I may make a motion to have the child examined by an expert. And for those reasons, I would ask the court for a continuance until Tuesday to prepare for the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-8\">* <em>* *</em></p>\n<p id=\"b746-9\">\u201cWhat I\u2019m saying is this has surprised all of us after two years, and I guess I\u2019m asking for time to prepare for this evidentiary hearing. I think it\u2019s only fair to the defendant after the surprise that we\u2019ve had this morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-10\">\u201cThe Court: It shouldn\u2019t affect your ability to proceed with the case. Whether I grant the motion or not, you still have the same rights that you do of confrontation\u2014 the right to cross-examine [M] and to question her. The only difference would be, if I grant the motion, that the testimony is taken outside the presence of the defendant, but he can also hear and watch the testimony that\u2019s being presented. So, I don\u2019t know that there\u2019d be any great prejudice to you from granting this.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-11\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Well, there\u2019s great prejudice in this case because of the fact that we\u2019ve already had [M] in court, seen by the jury, and now the state wants to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>take her outside and have the examination done outside. 1 think this is the worst possible situation that the defense could be in. I think that if this had been done pretrial it would have been even different than it is now. But, for us, it\u2019s the worst situation that could possibly happen. And that\u2019s not the issue. The issue is to be prepared for this evidentiary hearing, and I\u2019m asking for\u2014it\u2019s now Friday afternoon. I guess I\u2019m just asking until the next court session to prepare.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">sfc % *</p>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">\u201c[Prosecutor]: I don\u2019t see how a lot is going to change from this afternoon to Tuesday morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-8\">\u201c [Defense Counsel]: Well, a lot would change in terms of my ability to have time to read the case law and to determine what exactly the issues are and what the cases have said. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b747-9\">\u201c[Prosecutor]: Your Honor, I would have no objection to defense counsel having some time to read through the case law. ... I could provide a copy to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-10\">\u201cThe Court: I just don\u2019t know what a continuance is going to do here. The state does have the burden actually of proving this, [its] request, [its] motion, and it\u2019s not based on\u2014It\u2019s based on what happened here in the courtroom primarily, which we all were a party to. There are not going to be any other expert witnesses testifying. . . . Let me do this. I\u2019m going to take\u2014we\u2019ll take a short recess. I\u2019d like to see counsel in chambers for a moment. We\u2019ll take a short recess and I\u2019ll talk to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-11\">* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b747-12\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: I object to hearing the motion. I move for a continuance so that I can prepare for this evidentiary hearing. I haven\u2019t had a chance to do any legal research in the matter. I have not had a chance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>to even talk to\u2014Well, I talked to [a potential expert witness] just for thirty seconds before you came into court after our conference. I haven\u2019t had a chance to even talk to her about what she might say if called to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">\u201cThe Court: <em>Well, I\u2019ll give you a chance to talk to her if you want that, </em>but\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b748-7\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: . . . I\u2019m asking for a continuance of this matter until 10 a.m. so I can better prepare for this hearing and prepare any motions that I feel [are] appropriate.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b748-8\">In his argument for the continuance, the defendant failed to point to any reasons why he might need it other than to read the relevant case law. The state offered to supply the defendant with copies of the cases, and the court did take a recess shortly thereafter. Whether the defendant received copies of the case law from the prosecutor is not revealed by our review of the transcripts and we will not speculate as to whether he did. When court reconvened after the recess and chambers conference, defense counsel stated that he did not have adequate time to discuss the situation with his expert. The court <em>then offered defense counsel additional time </em>to speak to his expert, but the offer went unanswered. Instead, defense counsel merely repeated his objection and moved again for a continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-9\">The defendant claims that any possible delay the continuance would have caused was de minimis, only three hours of the court\u2019s time. We agree that the continuance requested was not burdensome. The state\u2019s argument that the continuance sought amounted to a four day delay in the proceedings is not relevant. What is significant, however, is that the defendant failed to articulate to the court any meaningful reasons for his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>request. The prosecutor stated that the evidentiary hearing would be based primarily on M\u2019s actions in the courtroom earlier in the day. Defense counsel was granted extra time to consult with his expert, but he refused the offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">Additionally, the defendant did not argue to the court that a failure to grant the continuance would prejudice his client. The only prejudice claimed was that the jury had seen M break down on the stand and the resulting opportunity for the state to examine her outside the defendant\u2019s presence. This claim of prejudice does not relate to the denial of the continuance request, but rather to the heart of whether the court properly could allow the videotaping of M\u2019s testimony pursuant to \u00a7 54-86g.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">The defendant now claims, on appeal, that he was denied effective assistance of counsel by the trial court\u2019s denial of a continuance and cites <em>Powell </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>287 U.S. 45, 53 S. Ct. 55, 77 L. Ed. 158 (1932), to support his contention that his trial counsel did not have sufficient time to prepare. We agree with Justice Sutherland\u2019s classic statement in that case that \u201c[t]he prompt disposition of criminal cases is to be commended and encouraged. But in reaching that result a defendant, charged with a serious crime, must not be stripped of his right to have sufficient time to advise with counsel and prepare his defense. To do that is not to proceed promptly in the calm spirit of regulated justice but to go forward with the haste of the mob.\u201d Id., 59. The defendant in the present case, however, was not deprived of time to consult with his attorney. As we noted, defense counsel failed to articulate any meaningful reasons for needing a continuance. The state did not produce any expert testimony at the hearing, but presented only two witnesses who testified about their observations of M immediately after her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>breakdown. The defendant\u2019s claim of prejudice before us now does not carry weight in light of these events.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">The defendant also claims that he was not afforded a meaningful hearing on the <em>Jarzbek </em>motion as required by <em>State </em>v. <em>Marquis, </em>241 Conn. 823, 699 A.2d 893 (1997). We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-7\">Our Supreme Court has stated: \u201cIf the defendant is entitled to a hearing on the state\u2019s motion for videotaped testimony, he is entitled to have the trial court ensure that such a hearing is meaningful because, as we recognized in <em>Jarzbek, </em>the hearing on the motion serves to protect \u2018the right of an accused to confront witnesses against him as guaranteed by the confrontation clause of both the federal and state constitutions.\u2019 \u201d Id., 837. The Supreme Court did not define the nature of a \u201cmeaningful\u201d hearing. We therefore look to the common meaning of the word. \u201cMeaningful\u201d is defined as \u201cfull of meaning; having significance or purpose.\u201d Webster\u2019s New World Dictionary (2d College Ed.).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-8\">Although the court denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a continuance, it did hold a hearing prior to the videotaping of M\u2019s testimony pursuant to \u00a7 54~86g. That hearing consisted of two witnesses who testified about M\u2019s state of mind immediately after her breakdown. The defendant cross-examined both witnesses. Although the court gave the defendant short notice that it was going forward with the <em>Jarzbek </em>hearing that day, it did not abuse its discretion in doing so. We note again that we do not review abuse of discretion issues based on whether we, as trial judges, would have reached a different conclusion. Rather, we. must review the court\u2019s actions and determine whether it abused <em>its </em>discretion. We conclude that the hearing under \u00a7 54-86g was not rendered \u201cmeaningless\u201d simply because the court did not grant the defendant\u2019s motion for a continuance. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>Thus, the court did not abuse its discretion in denying the defendant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">The defendant next claims that the trial court improperly granted the state\u2019s motion to videotape M\u2019s testimony.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-8\">The primary concern when a court determines whether to allow a witness\u2019 testimony to be videotaped is the effect on the defendant\u2019s sixth amendment right to confront his accuser. The United States Supreme Court addressed the confrontation issue in <em>Coy </em>v. <em>Iowa, </em>487 U.S. 1012, 108 S. Ct. 2798, 101 L. Ed. 2d 857 (1988). In <em>Coy, </em>the court, recognized that the right of confrontation had \u201ca lineage that traces back to the beginnings of Western legal culture. There are indications that a right of confrontation existed under Roman law. The Roman Governor Festus, discussing the proper treatment of his prisoner, Paul, stated: \u2018It is not the manner of the Romans to deliver any man up to die before the accused has met his accusers face to face, and has been given a chance to defend himself against the charges.\u2019 Acts 25:16.\u201d Id., 1015-16. In <em>Coy, </em>a large screen was placed between the victims and the defendant so that the victims could not see the defendant and the defendant could only see a silhouette of the victims. Id., 1014-15. The Supreme Court, while reversing the defendant\u2019s conviction on the basis of a confrontation clause violation, did reserve for a later date the question of what exceptions to the confrontation clause might exist. The court held: \u201cSince there have been no individualized findings that these particular witnesses needed special protection, the judgment here could not be sustained by any conceivable exception.\u201d Id., 1021.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>The court revisited the confrontation clause in <em>Maryland </em>v. <em>Craig, </em>497 U.S. 836, 840, 110 S. Ct. 3157, 111 L. Ed. 2d 666 (1990), in which the state sought to present the testimony of a child witness by way of closed circuit television. A Maryland statute allowed for such a proceeding after a finding by the trial judge that \u201ctestimony by the child victim in the courtroom will result in the child suffering serious emotional distress such that the child cannot reasonably communicate.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 841. In <em>Craig, </em>the court stated that \u201c[w]e have never held, however, that the Confrontation Clause guarantees criminal defendants the <em>absolute </em>right to a face-to-face meeting with witnesses against them at trial.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Id., 844. \u201cIn sum, our precedents establish that the Confrontation Clause reflects a <em>preference </em>for face-to-face confrontation at trial ... a preference that must occasionally give way to considerations of public policy and the necessities of the case . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 849.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">The rule in Connecticut for determining whether a child witness\u2019 testimony in sexual assault cases may be videotaped is set forth in <em>State </em>v. <em>Jarzbek, </em>supra, 204 Conn. 704, in which our Supreme Court stated: \u201c[I]n criminal prosecutions involving the alleged sexual abuse of children of tender years, the practice of videotaping the testimony of a minor victim outside the physical presence of the defendant is, in appropriate circumstances, constitutionally permissible. Our holding that appropriate circumstances may warrant a departure from strict compliance with confrontation requirements does not, however, signal a relaxation of the underlying evidentiary requirement that <em>appropriate circumstances be proven to exist. </em>We emphatically reject the proposal . . . that, in every case allegedly involving the sexual abuse of children, we should presume that the credibility of a minor victim\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>testimony will be improved by excluding the defendant from the witness room during that witness\u2019s testimony. <em>There is no constitutional justification for automatically depriving all criminal defendants of the right of physical confrontation during the videotaping of a minor victim\u2019s testimony. </em>We instead mandate a case-by-case analysis, whereby a trial court must balance the individual defendant\u2019s right of confrontation against the interest of the state in obtaining reliable testimony from the particular minor victim in question. See <em>Globe Newspaper Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>[457 U.S. 596, 609 and n.25, 102 S. Ct. 2613, 73 L. Ed. 2d 248 (1982)].\u201d (Emphasis added.) To satisfy its burden, \u201cthe state must show that the minor victim would be so intimidated, or otherwise inhibited, by the physical presence of the defendant that the trustworthiness of the victim\u2019s testimony would be seriously called into question. Furthermore, the state bears the burden of proving such compelling need by clear and convincing evidence.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Jarzbek, </em>supra, 704-705; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Bonello, </em>210 Conn. 51, 554 A.2d 277, cert. denied, 490 U.S. 1082, 109 S. Ct. 2103, 104 L. Ed. 2d 664 (1989) (affirming <em>Jarzbek </em>standards as providing sufficient measures to protect defendant\u2019s confrontation right).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>The court saw M\u2019s reaction to the defendant\u2019s presence when she began testifying about the assault. M was unable to regain her composure and had to be removed from the courtroom. Heslin testified at the <em>Jarzbek </em>hearing that M stated to her that she was scared. See footnote 8. Heslin testified that M stated that she would not be able to go back into the courtroom because of the defendant. M further told Heslin that she would be able to continue if questioning resumed with the defendant out of the room. M\u2019s father also testified as to M\u2019s condition immediately after being removed from the witness stand. He testified that M did not want to come back into the courtroom and \u201ctalk to all these people, and she specifically said, \u2018the bad grandfather.\u2019 \u201d The father testified that he believed that M was not willing to discuss the events further with the defendant in the courtroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>M indicated to both Heslin and her father that she would be willing to continue with her testimony with the defense counsel in the room. She also indicated that she would be willing to continue testifying in the presence of specified individuals whom she listed. The defendant was not included on that list.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">The defendant argues that the videotaping of M\u2019s testimony only provided relief for M but \u201cdid not enhance the reliability of M\u2019s testimony . . . .\u201d The defendant\u2019s argument misses the mark. The purpose of \u00a7 54-86g is to ensure that the court receives reliable testimony unhindered by the child\u2019s potential trauma at being placed in front of her alleged attacker. Nothing in the statute requires that videotaping a child victim\u2019s testimony must \u201cenhance\u201d its reliability. The court must determine only that the child is \u201cso intimidated, or otherwise inhibited, by the physical presence of the defendant that a compelling need exists to take the testimony of the child outside the physical presence of the defendant in order to <em>insure </em>the reliability of such testimony. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 54-86g (a). In granting the state\u2019s motion to videotape the victim\u2019s testimony, the trial court ruled: \u201cIt\u2019s clear to this court that for whatever reason, she\u2019s not able to proceed, and the evidence satisfies the court that the state has proved by clear and convincing evidence that the child was not able to testify based on the court\u2019s own observation. . . . [I]t appears to me that the child would be intimidated or otherwise inhibited by the presence of the defendant, and therefore her testimony would be unreliable and seriously called into question simply because I don\u2019t think she\u2019d be able to testify, just not able to, and that\u2019s the court\u2019s impression as well.\u201d A decision about \u201c[t]he [ability] of a witness [to testify reliably] is a matter peculiarly within the discretion of the trial court and its ruling will be disturbed only in a clear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>case of abuse or of some error in law.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Marquis, </em>supra, 241 Conn. 836.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">We conclude that the court\u2019s determination that the evidence was clear and convincing that the defendant\u2019s physical presence would have seriously compromised the reliability of M\u2019s testimony was legally and logically correct and is supported by the facts. The court properly granted the state\u2019s motion to videotape M\u2019s testimony.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b756-8\">The defendant claims that the trial court improperly denied his motion to have a court-appointed expert examine M to determine if she could complete her testimony in the courtroom before ruling on the state\u2019s motion to videotape her testimony outside the courtroom. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-9\">The decision to order expert examination of a child witness prior to videotaping her testimony pursuant to \u00a7 54-86g falls within the court\u2019s broad discretion to control discovery. Id., 837-38. We will reverse a court\u2019s ruling only if the court abused its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-10\">Our Supreme Court addressed the issue of requiring expert testimony for a <em>Jarzbek </em>hearing in <em>State </em>v. <em>Spigarolo, </em>210 Conn. 359, 556 A.2d 112, cert. denied, 493 U.S. 933, 110 S. Ct. 322, 107 L. Ed. 2d 312 (1989). Our Supreme Court rejected the contention that expert testimony is necessary to establish the state\u2019s burden of proof in a <em>Jarzbek </em>hearing. \u201cNothing in <em>Jarzbek </em>indicates any such requirement. Indeed, such a requirement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>would ignore the unusual and unfortunate circumstances of cases of sexual abuse of children.\u201d Id., 372. Although <em>Spigarolo </em>addressed primarily the state\u2019s burden of proof, portions of <em>Spigarolo </em>are helpful in deciding whether the defendant is entitled to a court-appointed expert to evaluate M\u2019s ability to testily in front of the defendant: \u201cThe family or guardians of a sexually abused child obviously occupy a unique position to assess the mental and emotional impact of a courtroom confrontation on the minor. We have no doubt that the testimony of such individuals may provide critical insight on a minor\u2019s ability or inclination to speak truthfully in the physical presence of an alleged perpetrator.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">In this case, the state presented two lay witnesses, M\u2019s father and Heslin, who testified that M was apprehensive about continuing her testimony in the presence of the defendant, and that they believed M would be better able to testify if the defendant were not in her presence while she testified.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Neither M\u2019s father\u2019s nor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>Heslin\u2019s testimony was presented as expert testimony. In fact, the prosecutor specifically stated that she was not going to call any experts. This testimony supplemented the court\u2019s observations of M\u2019s difficulties on the stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">The defendant cites <em>State </em>v. <em>Spigarolo, </em>supra, 210 Conn. 378, for the proposition that expert testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>is valuable under the circumstances. The defendant\u2019s reliance on this principle, however, is misplaced. While it is true that an expert\u2019s testimony on the issue of a victim\u2019s ability to testify in a defendant\u2019s presence might be helpful, expert testimony is not always needed. As we have noted, our Supreme Court has specifically stated that expert testimony is not a prerequisite to the state\u2019s meeting its burden of proof. It logically follows that a court-appointed expert evaluation is not required.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">The defendant, when requesting the continuance, stated that he \u201cmay make a motion to have [M] examined by an expert witness.\u201d At that time, however, he did not state that he intended that witness to be court appointed. In fact, the defendant waited until after the state had rested in the <em>Jarzbek </em>hearing to move for a court-appointed expert evaluation of M. The defendant argued at the <em>Jarzbek </em>hearing that because one witness stated that M said she was \u201cscared\u201d and the other stated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>that M said she was \u201cuncomfortable,\u201d M\u2019s mental state was unknown and, therefore, a court-ordered evaluation was necessary to \u201cdetermine whether or not this child is able to testify or is not able to testify because she\u2019s merely uncomfortable or because she\u2019s intimidated by the defendant.\u201d Whether M was merely uncomfortable or intimidated is a question of fact, and it is the trial court\u2019s sole province to determine questions of fact in a <em>Jarzbek </em>hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">The court found: \u201cBased on the information we had, there was no indication that [M] could not proceed with\u2014apparently with the testimony in the presence of the defendant. . . . It\u2019s clear to this court that for whatever reason, she\u2019s not able to proceed, and the evidence satisfies the court that the state has proved by clear and convincing evidence that [M] was not able to testify based on the court\u2019s own observation. . . . It appears to me that [M] would be intimidated or otherwise inhibited by the presence of the defendant, and therefore her testimony would be unreliable and seriously called into question simply because I don\u2019t think she\u2019d be able to testify, just not able to, and that\u2019s the court\u2019s impression as well.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b760-7\">Further persuasive support for the court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion for a court-appointed expert evaluation of M is found in <em>State </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>451 N.W.2d 231 (Minn. App.), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 837, 111 S. Ct. 109, 112 L. Ed. 2d 79 (1990). In <em>Ross, </em>a child sexual abuse victim began testifying in the presence of the defendant, but then balked when asked if she had ever been alone with him. Id., 234. The trial court found that the victim \u201cwould be psychologically traumatized and appeared to be so somewhat yesterday if there was effort or continued effort to have the youngster testily in the actual physical presence ... of the defendant, versus the approach we\u2019re using here this morning. I think it\u2019s clear yesterday she was scared being in [the defendant\u2019s] presence.\u201d Id., 235. The trial court recessed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>and allowed the victim\u2019s testimony to continue via closed circuit television, with the victim and the defendant separated. Id., 234. Minnesota Statutes \u00a7 595.02<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> allows for child testimony outside the presence of the defendant much like \u00a7 54-86g. The Minnesota statute requires \u201ca \u2018particularized finding\u2019 that a procedure shielding the child from face-to-face confrontation is necessary to prevent traumatization.\u201d Id., 235. The <em>Ross </em>court stated: \u201cExpert testimony was not required because the cause of [the victim\u2019s] trauma was clear.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">As in <em>Ross, </em>the cause of M\u2019s trauma was clear\u2014 the presence of the defendant during her testimony. M broke down on the stand and told two witnesses that she was unable to continue with the defendant in the room. It is not likely that expert testimony would have changed the court\u2019s decision. On the basis of our review of the record, we conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion and properly denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a court-ordered expert evaluation of M\u2019s ability to testify in the defendant\u2019s presence.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-7\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b761-8\">The defendant next claims that the trial court improperly denied his motion for a mistrial. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-9\">\u201cThe decision as to whether to grant a motion for a mistrial ... is one that requires the trial court to exercise its judicial discretion. . . . Our review of the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>court\u2019s exercise of its discretion is limited to questions of whether the court correctly applied the law and could reasonably have concluded as it did. . . . Every reasonable presumption will be given in favor of the trial court\u2019s ruling. ... It is only when an abuse of discretion is manifest or where an injustice appears to have been done that a reversal will result from the trial court\u2019s exercise of discretion.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Lasky, </em>43 Conn. App. 619, 635, 685 A.2d 336 (1996), cert. denied, 239 Conn. 959, 688 A.2d 328 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">The defendant first claims that \u00a7 54-86g provides only for a pretrial hearing. The defendant\u2019s argument is without merit. The language of \u00a7 54-86g does not state that the <em>Jarzbek </em>hearing must be completed before trial or even before testimony begins.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The statute provides only that before a witness\u2019 testimony can be videotaped outside the defendant\u2019s presence, the court must make the findings of fact required by \u00a7 54-86g.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-8\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b762-9\">The defendant next claims that the switch from live to videotaped testimony impinged on his right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. \u201cThe principle that there is a presumption of innocence in favor of the accused is the undoubted law, axiomatic and elementary, and its enforcement lies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>at the foundation of the administration of our criminal law.\u201d <em>Coffin </em>v. <em>United States, </em>156 U.S. 432, 453, 15 S. Ct. 394, 39 L. Ed. 481 (1895). The defendant claims that the removal of M from the stand, the videotaping of her testimony and the playing of the videotape for the jury effectively branded him with an unmistakable mark of guilt. It is well settled in both the federal system and in Connecticut that certain nonevidentiary factors can erode the presumption of innocence. See <em>Estelle </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>425 U.S. 501, 504, 96 S. Ct. 1691, 48 L. Ed. 2d 126 (1976) (requiring defendant to wear identifiable prison clothing at trial possible impairment on presumption of innocence); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Webb, </em>238 Conn. 389, 454, 680 A.2d 147 (1996) (while right to appear unfettered is important, it is not absolute).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">The present case, however, is not one in which the defendant was \u201cbranded\u201d with guilt. The videotaping of M\u2019s testimony took place out of the jury\u2019s presence. The videotape focused on M during her testimony and did not reveal that the defendant was not in the same room. Before the videotape was played to the jury, in fact, the court and the parties ensured that the voice identifications on the videotape were not played to the jury. The jury had no way of knowing who, aside from M and the two attorneys, was in the room. The defendant argues that the only inference the jury could draw was that the defendant was absent. The prosecution argues that the jury just as reasonably could have inferred that the defendant was present.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The court, prior to the jury\u2019s viewing of the videotape, made no reference to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>the defendant\u2019s presence in or absence from the room while M was videotaped. The court told the jury only that \u201cshe broke down and we could not continue with her testimony before you. We have arranged to have her testimony videotaped, the balance of her testimony.\u201d Aside from the inference that the defendant asserts, he is unable to provide us with reasons why the jury would have presumed that he was guilty prior to its deliberations. We will not speculate as to what inferences the jury did or did not draw. Absent evidence to the contrary, the jury is presumed to have acted properly. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Sauris, </em>227 Conn. 389, 403, 631 A.2d 238 (1993). We conclude that the midtestimony videotaping of M\u2019s testimony did not deprive the defendant of the presumption of innocence in violation of his constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">3</p>\n<p id=\"b764-7\">The defendant next claims that the videotaped portions of M\u2019s testimony prejudicially bolstered the previous testimony she gave in court. This claim lacks merit. After comparing M\u2019s testimony in the presence of the defendant with her videotaped testimony, we conclude that any portions that were repetitious did not unfairly bolster her testimony. We conclude that the court, in the circumstances of this case, did not abuse its discretion in denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b764-9\">The defendant next claims that the trial court (1) improperly precluded six defense character witnesses who were not disclosed prior to trial from testifying because their testimony was irrelevant, (2) abused its discretion under former Practice Book \u00a7 743 (4), now \u00a7 40-13 (d),<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and (3) violated the defendant\u2019s right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>compulsory process in violation of the federal<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and state<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> constitutions. We decline to review the defendant\u2019s claims because he failed to provide us with an adequate record to review.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">The defendant claims that his witnesses would have testified as to his tendency for being nonviolent and truthful. The court appears to have precluded the proposed witnesses\u2019 testimony on the ground that it was not relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-8\">The following portion of the transcript is relevant to this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-9\">\u201c[Prosecution]: Your Honor, I have an objection to this additional witness list that I just received this morning. It indicates six new additional witnesses. The state, many, many months ago, asked for the defense to provide a witness list.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-10\">\u201cThe Court: I didn\u2019t see that. There\u2019s a list of new\u2014 a list of new witnesses?</p>\n<p id=\"b765-11\">\u201c[Prosecution]: And now, well into this trial process, the state\u2019s being provided with six additional new witnesses, none of whom I can imagine has any relevant information whatsoever about this case. I would ask that the witnesses be stricken and not allowed to testify in this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-12\">\u201cThe Court: [Defense Counsel], what\u2019s the rationale for the witnesses?</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Your Honor, that motion was made in good faith\u2014this was made in good faith. What transpired over the weekend was that I consulted with other attorneys who have experience in trying this type of case. They indicated to me that they found it advantageous to present evidence concerning character traits of the defendant. . . . [T]hese do not involve witnesses who speak directly concerning the event. They\u2019re merely witnesses that may be called as to the character trait of my client, and I would ask the court to permit me to present those witnesses ....</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">\u201c[Prosecution]: I think it\u2019s unfair that just because defense counsel is now seeking advice from other attorneys when we\u2019re in the middle of trial that he now decides it\u2019s important that he list character witnesses. It\u2019s something he could have done inside his forty-five day window [under \u00a7 743] to respond to me with possible witnesses in the case. It\u2019s not as if all of a sudden something new has developed and there is a material witness to the crime that he\u2019s just learned about. These are people that are character witnesses. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b766-7\">\u201cThe Court: That\u2019s the problem. You\u2019ve got six witnesses here and you want to bring them in without giving the state, I think, ample opportunity or an appropriate opportunity to investigate who they are and then-backgrounds and to counteract that. This is something that should have been\u2014this is not in the way of rebuttal witnesses who can testify as to something that might have happened during trial. This is a new strategy that you just determined that you wanted to employ. I think these witnesses probably should have been disclosed prior to trial. I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-8\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Well, could I put on the record that I did make a motion for accelerated rehabilitation prior to this trial, and I presented to Judge Rittenband <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>a number of letters. Many of the letters [were from others besides] these six people. So, the state was aware that these people would vouch for the defendant. . . . They\u2019ve had some disclosure of people in the community who had attested to his good character.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">\u201cThe Court: There\u2019s certainly a big difference between a hearing for accelerated rehabilitation [and a trial]. You don\u2019t have examination of witnesses. At least, I assume these witnesses were not cross-examined and they were simply presented to the court for its consideration\u2014I mean, the letters were presented, so there is a difference, certainly a big difference.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: That\u2019s correct. I can tell you that this is the first trial that I\u2019ve had under the new Practice Book, and previously we\u2019ve not had to disclose witnesses to the state. But I did disclose all the witnesses that I had concerning the events in question. I\u2019m now today presenting\u2014suggesting that I may wish to present other witnesses concerning the character trait of my client. The state is still presenting its case. I don\u2019t know how long it\u2019s going to take to present its case, but it certainly has a few days to investigate, if not a week to investigate these people. These are people in the community who\u2019ve known my client for many years.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-8\">\u201cThe Court: What character trait are they going to testify to?</p>\n<p id=\"b767-9\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: The truthfulness and also the trait of violence or nonviolence.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-10\">\u201c[Prosecution]: That trait is not a relevant character trait in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-11\">\u201cThe Court: That\u2019s not an issue in this case. Under those circumstances, I\u2019m not persuaded that that additional witness list should be granted or that permission to call these witnesses should be granted at this late date. I\u2019m going to deny that request, too.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>It is axiomatic that for evidence to be admissible it must be relevant. \u201cRelevant evidence is evidence that has a logical tendency to aid the trier in the determination of an issue.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>First Federal Bank, FSB </em>v. <em>Gallup, </em>51 Conn. App. 39, 41, 719 A.2d 923 (1998). \u201cTo be admissible, the character evidence that a defendant seeks to introduce must be limited to specific traits and relevant to the offense charged. . . . The determination of relevance must be made according to reason and judicial experience. . . . That determination requires the exercise of the court\u2019s discretion.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Shehadeh, 52 </em>Conn. App. 46, 51, 725 A.2d 394 (1999). In cases involving claims of improper evidentiary rulings, our standard of review is limited to a determination of whether the court abused its discretion. <em>State v. Coleman, </em>241 Conn. 784, 789, 699 A.2d 91 (1997). It is, however, the appellant\u2019s duty to provide us with an adequate record to review. Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 60-5 and 61-10; <em>Chase Manhattan Bank/City Trust </em>v. <em>AECO Elevator Co., </em>48 Conn. App. 605, 607, 710 A.2d 190 (1998). The defendant failed to provide us with an adequate record.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">The transcript reveals only that the court stated: \u201cThat\u2019s not an issue in this case. Under those circumstances, I\u2019m not persuaded that that additional witness list should be granted or that permission to call these witnesses should be granted at this late date. I\u2019m going to deny that request, too.\u201d There is no additional discussion by the court as to its reasons for denying the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>defendant\u2019s request to present additional character witnesses. The defendant did not file a motion for articulation pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 66-5, although the file reveals that he did file three motions for extensions of time to file a motion for articulation or rectification.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">The defendant claims that there is an adequate record to review because of the lengthy colloquy between the parties and the court. The defendant points to the court\u2019s concern over the fact that the defendant did not disclose the witnesses prior to trial. Our review of the transcript, however, does not unambiguously reveal that the court based its determination on the defendant\u2019s nondisclosure. The defendant further argues that the court determined that the proffered character traits were not relevant. While that is a reasonable inference, we do not believe that the record is clear enough for us to make that determination. \u201cOur role is not to guess at possibilities, but to review claims based on a complete factual record developed by a trial court. . . . Without the necessary factual and legal conclusions furnished by the trial court . . . any decision made by us respecting [the defendant\u2019s claims] would be entirely speculative.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Combs, </em>51 Conn. App. 700, 701-702, 725 A.2d 349 (1999).

Because the defendant did not provide us with an adequate record to review, we decline to review this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-9\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b769-10\">The defendant next claims that the trial court\u2019s preclusion of his character witnesses violated his state and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>federal constitutional rights to compulsory process. The defendant claims that he is entitled to review of this unpreserved claim pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 567 A.2d 823 (1989).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">Under <em>Golding, </em>\u201ca defendant can prevail on a claim of constitutional error not preserved at trial only if <em>all </em>of the following conditions are met: (1) the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; (2) the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; (3) the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial; and (4) if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt. In the absence of any one of these conditions, the defendant\u2019s claim will fail. The appellate tribunal is free, therefore, to respond to the defendant\u2019s claim by focusing on whichever condition is most relevant in the particular circumstances.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Id., 239-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">As we stated in part II A, the defendant has failed to provide us with an adequate record. The defendant, therefore, has failed to meet the first prong of <em>Golding. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>Accordingly, we decline to discuss his constitutional claims.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">The defendant next claims that the trial court improperly denied his motion to redact a portion of the 1994 videotaped session between M and Edell. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-8\">Because this is a claim of evidentiary error, our standard of review is limited to whether the court abused its discretion. <em>State </em>v. <em>Hoth, 50 </em>Conn. App. 77, 87, 718 A.2d 28, cert. denied, 247 Conn. 922, 722 A.2d 811 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b771-9\">At trial, the defendant claimed that the videotaped session had to be redacted to conform to the constancy of accusation doctrine of <em>State </em>v. <em>Troupe, </em>237 Conn. 284, 677 A.2d 917 (1996). The defendant now, for the first time on appeal, essentially argues that portions of the videotape allege uncharged misconduct on his part. The crux of the defendant\u2019s claim is that M states on the videotape that the alleged sexual abuse occurred \u201ctwo times,\u201d \u201cthree times\u201d and \u201cmore and more and more.\u201d At trial, however, M\u2019s testimony indicated a single touching on one day. The defendant did not raise the uncharged misconduct issue at trial as an objection to the videotape\u2019s admission. Instead, he relied solely on <em>Troupe.</em><footnotemark><em>19</em></footnotemark><em> </em>On appeal, \u201cwe will not review an evidentiary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>claim not raised below.

Because the defendant failed to raise the uncharged misconduct issue at trial and the court did not have the opportunity to consider that ground for redacting the videotape, we will not address this claim on appeal. Instead, we limit our discussion to the constancy of accusation doctrine of <em>Troupe.</em><footnotemark><em>20</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>Our Supreme Court limited the constancy of accusation doctrine in <em>State </em>v. <em>Troupe, </em>supra, 237 Conn. 304, holding that \u201ca person to whom a sexual assault victim has reported the assault may testify only with respect to the fact and timing of the victim\u2019s complaint; any testimony by the witness regarding the details surrounding the assault must be strictly limited to those necessary to associate the victim\u2019s complaint with the pending charge, including, for example, the time and place of the attack or the identity of the alleged perpetrator. . . . Thus, such evidence is admissible only to corroborate the victim\u2019s testimony and not for substantive purposes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">The 1994 videotape was presented after M testified in court that she had been abused by the defendant. The transcript of the videotaped session that the jury viewed reveals that M disclosed to Edell that she had been assaulted by the defendant. Nothing in the videotape indicates that the evidence admitted exceeds what is permissible under the constancy of accusation doctrine set forth in <em>Troupe. </em>We note, moreover, that the defendant originally had stipulated to the admission of the videotape in its entirety. It was only after inconsistencies between M\u2019s testimony and the videotape arose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>that the defendant objected. It is axiomatic that inconsistencies in victims\u2019 statements affect the credibility, not the admissibility, of the evidence. The credibility of witnesses is solely within the province of the jury to determine. <em>State </em>v. <em>Knight, </em>50 Conn. App. 109, 112, 717 A.2d 274 (1998).

The trial court is perfectly capable of determining whether the child can reliably testify in the defendant\u2019s presence based on lay witness testimony, especially in this case, where the court witnessed for itself M\u2019s emotional collapse while testifying in the defendant\u2019s presence.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-8\">The dissent points to the inconsistency between the conclusion reached by M\u2019s therapist before trial that M would be able to testify and the <em>Jarzbek </em>hearing testimony of Heslin and M\u2019s father that M could not continue testifying in the defendant\u2019s presence. We believe that the dissent focuses on the wrong point. At the <em>Jarzbek </em>hearing, the trial court heard testimony from two witnesses both of whom testified that, M could not continue in the defendant's presence. There were no inconsistencies between those witnesses\u2019 Testimonies. The fact that testimony at the <em>Jarzbek </em>hearing conflicted with M\u2019s therapist\u2019s previous conclusion reflects only a change in the conditions between the initial evaluation of M by the therapist and the observations of her by Heslin and her father after she was removed from the stand.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b761-10\"> Minn.

In constancy of accusation cases, the underlying statement to be admitted is always a statement from the victim. In most cases, the victim tells somebody about the crime, and the confidant then testifies as to what the victim told her. In the present case, M told Edell about being assaulted. The state, instead of offering Edell\u2019s testimony describing M\u2019s statements, avoided the problems inherent in hearsay testimony by offering the videotape of the session where M told Edell that she had been assaulted.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-8\">The spirit of <em>Troupe </em>was followed by the trial court.

App. 68, 83, 618 A.2d 1372 (1993), aff'd, 228 Conn. 234, 636 A.2d 760 (1994). In determining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>whether the court\u2019s denial of the request for a continuance was improper, the majority properly observes that the following factors guide our review: \u201cthe timeliness of the request for continuance; the likely length of the delay; the age and complexity of the case; the granting of other continuances in the past; the impact of delay on the litigants, witnesses, opposing counsel and the court; the perceived legitimacy of the reasons proffered in support of the request; the defendant\u2019s personal responsibility for the timing of the request; [and] the likelihood that the denial would substantially impair the defendant\u2019s ability to defend himself . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Hamilton, </em>228 Conn. 234, 240, 636 A.2d 760 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">Application of those factors to the record discloses that the court improperly denied the defendant\u2019s request for a continuance. First, the request was timely. The defendant received a copy of the state\u2019s <em>Jarzbek </em>motion at approximately 1:57 p.m. on Friday, September 13, 1996, and requested a continuance when the court reconvened shortly after 2 p.m. Second, the length of the continuance was minimal and constituted the least amount of time feasible to enable defense counsel to prepare adequately for the evidentiary hearing. Defense counsel requested a continuance until the following Tuesday, which was the next regularly scheduled court session.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Third, the defendant did not seek nor was he afforded any previous continuances in connection with the <em>Jarzbek </em>proceeding. Fourth, a continuance from late Friday afternoon until the following Tuesday morning would not have adversely impacted the court, the state, M or any witnesses. Nor did the state articulate what advantage, if any, would be gained by conducting the hearing on Friday afternoon as opposed to the following Tuesday morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>Fifth, the defendant proffered several legitimate reasons in support of his request. After consulting M\u2019s therapist, the state had informed defense counsel well in advance of the trial that it would not file a <em>Jarzbek </em>motion, and defense counsel was entitled reasonably to rely on that representation. On September 13, 1996, however, without any prior notice, the state filed a request to videotape M\u2019s testimony after M had already given extensive testimony on direct examination. In light of the serious consequences that that motion, if granted, imposed on the defendant, including the potential impact on his constitutional right to face-to-face confrontation, defense counsel properly requested a brief continuance so that he could prepare adequately for the evidentiary hearing. Defense counsel claimed that a brief continuance was necessary so that he could, inter alia, conduct legal research and determine whether to utilize expert testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">Sixth, neither defense counsel nor the defendant were responsible for the timing of the request. The state filed this motion because, just prior to the luncheon recess, M experienced difficulties during the prosecutor\u2019s direct examination. Defense counsel did not precipitate the state\u2019s motion by, inter alia, aggressively cross-examining or intimidating M. The record neither discloses, nor does the state claim, that M was unable to testify in the defendant\u2019s presence because the defendant had previously threatened or intimidated M or her family. The timing of the defendant\u2019s request was directly influenced by and was a direct consequence of the timing of the state\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-7\">Last, the court\u2019s denial of the request substantially impaired the defendant\u2019s ability to defend himself. The <em>Jarzbek </em>hearing implicated the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to face-to-face confrontation. See <em>Coy </em>v. <em>Iowa, </em>487 U.S. 1012, 1016, 108 S. Ct. 2798, 101 L. Ed. 2d 857 (1988) (\u201cthe Confrontation Clause guarantees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>the defendant a face-to-face meeting with witnesses appearing before the trier of fact\u201d); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Bonello, </em>210 Conn. 51, 56, 554 A.2d 277, cert. denied, 490 U.S. 1082, 109 S. Ct. 2103, 104 L. Ed. 2d 664 (1989) <em>(Jarzbek </em>hearing requires court to \u201c \u2018balance the individual defendant\u2019s right of confrontation against the interest of the state in obtaining reliable testimony from the particular minor victim in question\u2019 \u201d). Therefore, \u201c[i]f the defendant is entitled to a hearing on the state\u2019s motion for videotaped testimony, he is entitled to have the trial court ensure that such a hearing is <em>meaningful </em>because, as we recognized in <em>Jarzbek, </em>the hearing on the motion serves to protect the right of an accused to confront witnesses against him as guaranteed by the confrontation clause of both the federal and state constitutions.\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Marquis, </em>241 Conn. 823, 837, 699 A.2d 893 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">The <em>Jarzbek </em>hearing implicated the defendant\u2019s constitutional light of confrontation, and he could not adequately protect this right unless he received effective assistance of counsel at the hearing. In light of the court\u2019s denial of the request for a brief continuance, I respectfully disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that a defense attorney, who was neither provided with advance notice of the state\u2019s <em>Jarzbek </em>motion nor afforded a meaningful opportunity to conduct legal research, develop legal strategy and determine whether to utilize expert testimony, could have adequately protected his client\u2019s right of confrontation during a <em>Jarz-bek </em>hearing. Thus, the court\u2019s denial of the request for a continuance deprived the defendant of his right to the effective assistance of counsel and also may have infringed on his constitutional right of confrontation.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-7\">I also respectfully disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the defendant was not prejudiced by the court\u2019s denial of the request for a continuance solely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>because defense counsel failed to inform the court specifically that the denial of this request could infringe on the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights to the effective assistance of counsel and confrontation. Defense counsel\u2019s failure to articulate this concern to the court did not negate any actual prejudice suffered by the defendant. In reviewing the propriety of a court\u2019s denial of a request for a continuance, \u201can appellate court should limit its assessment of the reasonableness of the trial court\u2019s exercise of its discretion to a consideration of those factors, on the record, that were presented to the trial court, <em>or of which that court was aware, </em>at the time of its ruling on the motion for a continuance.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Hamilton, </em>supra, 228 Conn. 242. It is reasonable to assume that the court was aware that the <em>Jarzbek </em>hearing implicated the defendant\u2019s right of confrontation and that a denial of the request for a continuance implicated the defendant\u2019s right to the effective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">I also respectfully disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the trial court\u2019s denial of the request for a continuance did not prejudice the defendant. This conclusion is predicated on the improper assumption that no amount of preparation would have enabled defense counsel to persuade the court to deny the state\u2019s <em>Jarz-bek </em>motion, as well as on the court\u2019s statement, made prior to the presentation of any evidence, that the outcome of the <em>Jarzbek </em>hearing was a foregone conclusion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b779-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b779-4\">A careful examination of the record also discloses that the trial court improperly denied the defendant\u2019s request for a court-ordered examination of M to determine whether she was capable of completing her testimony in his presence.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">\u201c[I]n criminal prosecutions involving the alleged sexual abuse of children of tender years, the practice of videotaping the testimony of a minor victim outside the physical presence of the defendant is, in appropriate circumstances, constitutionally permissible. [The] holding that appropriate circumstances may warrant a departure from strict compliance with confrontation requirements does not, however, signal a relaxation of the underlying evidentiary requirement that appropriate circumstances be proven to exist. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">\u201c[A] trial court must determine, at an evidentiary hearing, whether the state has demonstrated a compelling need for excluding the defendant from the witness room during the videotaping of a minor victim\u2019s testimony. In order to satisfy its burden of proving compelling need, the state must show that the minor victim would be so intimidated, or otherwise inhibited, by the physical presence of the defendant that the trustworthiness of the victim\u2019s testimony would be seiiously called into question. Furthermore, the state bears the burden of proving such compelling need by clear and convincing evidence. . . . [I]n light of the constitutional right of confrontation at stake here, the primary focus of the trial court\u2019s inquiry must be on the reliability of the minor victim\u2019s testimony, not on the injury that the victim may suffer by testifying in the presence of the accused.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Jarzbek, </em>supra, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>204 Conn. 704-705; see <em>State </em>v. Marquis, supra, 241 Conn. 834.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">By requesting permission to videotape M\u2019s testimony outside the presence of the defendant, the state called into question M\u2019s ability to testify reliably in a formal courtroom setting and in the presence of the defendant. Because the state petitioned the court to utilize this procedure, it was reasonable for the defendant to request a court-ordered examination to determine whether M was capable of completing her testimony in his presence. Although a court is not required to order such an examination whenever it conducts a <em>Jarzbek </em>hearing, in light of the specific factual circumstances presented by this case, I respectfully submit that the court\u2019s denial of the request was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-7\">M\u2019s father and Linda Heslin, the victim\u2019s advocate, testified that M was apprehensive about continuing her testimony in the presence of the defendant, and they believed that M would be better able to testify out of his presence. Prior to the state\u2019s request for a <em>Jarzbek </em>hearing, however, M\u2019s therapist concluded that M was capable of testifying reliably in the defendant\u2019s presence. Moreover, the record discloses that M offered extensive testimony on direct examination in the defendant\u2019s presence before she experienced difficulty. In light of this conflicting evidence, a court-ordered examination by an expert would have provided an objective assessment of M\u2019s ability to testify reliably, information that was highly relevant to the court\u2019s determination as to whether the state had satisfied its burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence \u201cthat the minor victim would be so intimidated, or otherwise inhibited, by the physical presence of the defendant that the trustworthiness of the victim\u2019s testimony would be seriously called into question.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Marquis, </em>supra, 241 Conn. 834.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">An examination of the record also discloses that the trial court improperly denied the defendant\u2019s motion to redact portions of a 1994 videotaped interview of M. The court improperly concluded that the challenged portions of that videotape were admissible pursuant to the constancy of accusation doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-7\">On September 13,1996, M testified on direct examination as to a single incident of improper touching by the defendant. When the prosecutor asked M, \u201cDo you remember if [the defendant] touched your private one time or more than one time?\u201d M responded, \u201cI can\u2019t remember.\u201d On or about November 22, 1994, Diane Edell had videotaped her interview of M. Edell was the program coordinator and interviewer at the child abuse diagnostic center at Saint Francis Hospital and Medical Center. The state sought to present that videotaped interview to the juiy. On September 18, 1996, defense counsel moved to redact those portions of the videotape in which M stated that the defendant had sexually assaulted her on several other occasions. Defense counsel claimed that the challenged portions of the videotape constituted hearsay and were not admissible pursuant to the constancy of accusation doctrine. The court denied the motion. The state did not proffer any alternative basis for admitting the challenged portions of the videotape.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-8\">\u201c[A] person to whom a sexual assault victim has reported the assault may testify only with respect to the fact and timing of the victim\u2019s complaint; any testimony by the witness regarding the details surrounding the assault must be strictly limited to those necessaiy to associate the victim\u2019s complaint with the pending charge, including, for example, the time and place of the attack or the identity of the alleged perpetrator. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>. . . Thus, such evidence is admissible only to corroborate the victim\u2019s testimony and not for substantive purposes. Before the evidence may be admitted, therefore, the victim must first have testified concerning the facts of the sexual assault and the identity of the person or persons to whom the incident was reported. In determining whether to permit such testimony, the trial court must balance the probative value of the evidence against any prejudice to the defendant.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Troupe, </em>237 Conn. 284, 304-305, 677 A.2d 917 (1996) (en banc). \u201c [Constancy of accusation evidence is not admissible unless the victim has testified, and is subject to cross-examination, concerning the crime and the identity of the person or persons to whom the victim has reported the crime . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id., 293.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">Several factors establish that the court improperly admitted the challenged portions of the videotape under the constancy of accusation doctrine. First, <em>Troupe </em>authorizes the <em>\u201cperson to whom a sexual assault victim has reported the assault [to] testify </em>only with respect to the fact and timing of the victim\u2019s complaint . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 304. <em>Troupe </em>did not explicitly authorize the trial court to admit a videotaped interview of the victim in which the victim herself testifies as to the sexual assault, as opposed to merely allowing the counselor who received the victim\u2019s complaint to testify as to the fact and timing of the complaint. The majority today expands the constancy of accusation doctrine to permit the admission of testimony by a victim herself, as opposed to merely admitting the corroborative testimony of the person to whom a victim issued her complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-7\">Second, the constancy of accusation doctrine provides that \u201csuch evidence is admissible only to <em>corroborate </em>the victim\u2019s testimony and not for substantive purposes.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id. In the present case, however, M never testified on direct examination as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>multiple incidents of sexual assault. Because M testified only as to one incident of sexual assault, <em>Trowpe </em>does not permit the court to admit evidence that M informed Edell that the defendant had sexually assaulted her on several other occasions. Moreover, the challenged portions of the videotape were neither relevant to the fact and timing of M\u2019s complaint as to the single incident of sexual assault, nor were they necessary to associate M\u2019s complaint with the pending charge. Last, there is no indication in the record that the court \u201cbalanc[ed] the probative value of the evidence against any prejudice to the defendant.\u201d Id., 305.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">I respectfully disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that defense counsel\u2019s failure to challenge the admission of portions of the 1994 videotape until after M had completed her testimony, but before this videotape was shown to the jury, undermines the strength of defense counsel\u2019s objection or, in the alternative, serves as an independent justification for admitting the videotape in its entirety. The victim must first testify as to certain matters before the court can determine whether to admit constancy of accusation evidence. Constancy of accusation \u201cevidence is admissible only to corroborate the victim\u2019s testimony and not for substantive purposes. Before the evidence may be admitted, therefore, the victim must first have testified concerning the facts of the sexual assault and the identity of the person or persons to whom the incident was reported.\u201d Id., 304-305. If the court cannot determine whether proposed constancy of accusation evidence is admissible until after the victim has completed her testimony, it follows that defense counsel cannot properly determine whether to object to the admission of such evidence until the victim has testified. Defense counsel could not, therefore, determine whether it was necessary to object to the admission of any portion of the videotape until after M had completed her testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>The court\u2019s admission of the challenged portions of the 1994 videotape substantially prejudiced the defense. M\u2019s testimony in court was limited to one incident of improper touching, and in connection with this incident the state charged the defendant with one count of sexual assault in the fourth degree and one count of risk of injury to a child. In defense to this single allegation, the defendant claimed that on the day in question, while he was sleeping, M had grabbed his fingers and he awoke to find M stimulating herself with his fingers. The defense theory was consistent with the testimony given by a state\u2019s witness, Elaine Yordan, a physician, that M masturbated.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The admission of the challenged portions of the videotape, wherein M claimed that the defendant had sexually assaulted her on several other occasions,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> substantially undermined the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>claim that the single incident of improper touching was inadvertent.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-4\">For all of the foregoing reasons, I would reverse the judgment and remand the case for a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b775-7\"> In a colloquy with the court, defense counsel stated: \u201cThe issue is to be prepared for this evidentiary hearing, and I'm asking for\u2014it\u2019s now Friday afternoon.
