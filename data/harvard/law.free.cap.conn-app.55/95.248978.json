We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">The following facts and procedural history are necessary for our review. On March 9,1997, paramedics were called to 90 Nelton Court in Hartford, where they found two year old Andre Shirley, Jr., the defendant\u2019s son, in an extremely flaccid condition with shallow respira-tions and a very low heart rate. The defendant reported .that her son had suffered a seizure while eating. Shirley was transported to Saint Francis Hospital and Medical Center and then to Connecticut Children\u2019s Medical Center. The child\u2019s treating physicians found that he had sustained three distinct blows to his head, one of which was powerful enough to tear his sagittal sinus vein. Shirley died at the Connecticut Children\u2019s Medical Center on March 18, 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">The defendant was the child\u2019s sole caregiver at the time of his injuries. She was arrested on April 3, 1997, and charged with capital felony in violation of General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>Statutes \u00a7 53a-54b (9) and risk of injury to a child in violation of \u00a7 53-21.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">A probable cause hearing was held, but not completed, on various days in July, 1997. The defendant reported to an investigating police officer that Shirley was injured when he fell backward while trying to get onto a city bus. The defendant\u2019s explanations were not consistent with the severity of the child\u2019s injuries. Betty Spivack, a physician specializing in pediatric critical care and child abuse, had treated Shirley and testified that his head injuries were consistent with those incurred in a fall from a ten to fifteen story building.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">On September 15, 1997, the defendant waived her right to a probable cause hearing<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and pleaded guilty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>to manslaughter in the first degree and risk of injury to a child as alleged in a substitute information the state filed that day.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In November, 1997, two days prior to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>her sentencing, the defendant moved for a continuance to afford her an opportunity to reevaluate her plea, her attorneys\u2019 advice and the fairness of her plea agreement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>in view of contemporaneous events in Massachusetts.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On December 4, 1997, the defendant filed a motion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>withdraw her guilty plea, claiming that she was denied effective assistance of counsel and that her plea was not knowing and voluntary.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The trial court heard argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>ment on the motion on December 12, 1997, at which time the defendant\u2019s public defenders requested that the court appoint a special public defender to represent her with respect to her motion to withdraw her guilty plea,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> particularly with respect to a hearing on the effective assistance of counsel issue.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The trial court refused <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>to appoint substitute counsel and denied the defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw her guilty plea. The court then sentenced the defendant to consecutive terms of twenty years incarceration on the manslaughter charge and ten years on the risk of injury charge. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">The defendant\u2019s claim before us is that the trial court\u2019s failure to hold an evidentiary hearing on her motion to withdraw her guilty plea and its failure to appoint new counsel violated her rights to due process and effective assistance of counsel under the fifth, sixth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution, article first, \u00a7 8, of the constitution of Connecticut, and our rules of practice. See Practice Book \u00a7 39-19 et seq. <footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>\u201cA guilty plea, once accepted, may be withdrawn only with the permission of the court. <em>State </em>v. <em>Risk, </em>17 Conn. App. 447, 451, 553 A.2d 1145, cert. denied, 211 Conn. 802, 559 A.2d 1137, cert. denied, 493 U.S. 818, 110 S. Ct. 72, 107 L. Ed. 2d 38 (1989). The court is required to permit the withdrawal of a guilty plea upon proof of any ground set forth in Practice Book \u00a7 [39-27], <em>State </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>207 Conn. 590, 597, 542 A.2d 1131 (1988); <em>State </em>v. <em>Lasher, </em>190 Conn. 259, 265, 460 A.2d 970 (1983). Whether such proof is made is a question for the court in its sound discretion, and a denial of permission to withdraw is reversible only if that discretion has been abused. <em>State </em>v. <em>Crenshaw, </em>[210 Conn. 304, 308-309, 554 A.2d 1074 (1989)]; <em>Szarwak </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>167 Conn. 10, 23, 355 A.2d 49 (1974).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Morant, </em>20 Conn. App. 630, 633, 569 A.2d 1140, cert. denied, 215 Conn. 818, 576 A.2d 547 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">\u201cIt is axiomatic that unless a plea of guilty is made knowingly and voluntarily, it has been obtained in violation of due process and is therefore voidable. <em>State </em>v. <em>Childree, </em>189 Conn. 114, 119, 454 A.2d 1274 (1983). By entering a guilty plea, the defendant waives his constitutional rights to a jury trial and to confront his accusers as well as his privilege against self-incrimination. <em>Boykin </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>395 U.S. 288, 89 S. Ct. 1709, 23 L. Ed. 2d 274 (1969); <em>State </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>207 Conn. 276, 542 A.2d 299 (1988). It is well settled that the record must affirmatively disclose that the defendant\u2019s choice was made intelligently and voluntarily. <em>State </em>v. <em>Childree, </em>supra, 120.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ramos, </em>23 Conn. App. 1, 3-4, 579 A.2d 560 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">\u201cAfter a guilty plea is accepted but before the imposition of sentence the court is obligated to permit withdrawal upon proof of one of the grounds in [Practice Book \u00a7 39-27]. An evidentiary hearing is not required if the record of the plea proceeding and other information in the court file conclusively establishes that the motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>is without merit. See <em>Fontaine </em>v. <em>United States, </em>411 U.S. 213, 215, 93 S. Ct. 1461, 36 L. Ed. 2d 169 (1973).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>182 Conn. 176, 185, 438 A.2d 46 (1980). Before the trial court, the defendant relied on two subsections of \u00a7 39-27 to withdraw her plea. Only the second reason is applicable in this appeal, namely that \u201c[t]he plea resulted from the denial of effective assistance of counsel.\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 39-27 (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">\u201cIn considering whether to hold an evidentiary hearing on a motion to withdraw a guilty plea the court may disregard any allegations of fact, whether contained in the motion or made in an offer of proof, which are either conclusory, vague or oblique. For the purpose of determining whether to hold an evidentiary hearing, the court should ordinarily assume any specific allegations of fact to be true.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>supra, 182 Conn. 185. The defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw contains no facts upon which she bases her claim that her plea was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Crenshaw, </em>supra, 210 Conn. 311-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">The defendant had the benefit of two public defenders representing her throughout the unconcluded probable cause hearing and the subsequent hearing in which she waived the probable cause hearing and pleaded guilty, and in the filing of motions for continuance and to withdraw her guilty plea. The defendant cited no facts in her motion or at oral argument before the trial court as to how or why counsels\u2019 representation was ineffective. The defendant now claims that the trial court abused its discretion in failing to grant her a continuance to develop facts to support her claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Her counsel asked for a reasonable period of time in which to develop those facts, and our reading of the record discloses that the court gave the defendant a reasonable period of time to do so. The defendant\u2019s sentencing was originally scheduled to take place on November 26, 1997. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>court continued the sentencing until December 12,1997, but the defendant failed to take advantage of that time to develop a factual basis to support her motion to withdraw her plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">The defendant also claims that the trial court improperly abused its discretion by failing to appoint substitute counsel to press her ineffective assistance of counsel claim. At argument before the trial court, the defendant\u2019s counsel requested that substitute counsel be appointed because an inherent conflict had developed between the defendant and her counsel. Our reading of the transcript demonstrates that while the defendant was waiting to be sentenced, she learned of a case in Massachusetts concerning yet another tragic death of a very young child. Apparently, the defendant hoped that she could resolve her case in a similar manner. The trial court made a specific point of telling the defendant that the Massachusetts matter was of no consequence in Connecticut. It is readily apparent from the transcript that the defendant\u2019s counsel informed her of that as well. Defense counsel ascribed the conflict between them and the defendant to the defendant\u2019s lack of education and her unfamiliarity with the legal system. The trial court properly noted that defense counsel acceded to the defendant\u2019s wish for another lawyer without considering the foreseeable consequence, i.e., that the defendant would repeatedly look for a lawyer who could resolve her case in a manner similar to what occurred in the Massachusetts case. \u201cWhether the circumstances warrant the appointment of new counsel is within the discretion of the trial court. . . . [A]bsent a factual record revealing an abuse of [the court\u2019s] discretion, the court\u2019s failure to allow new counsel is not reversible error.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 314. For this reason, the trial court properly exercised its discretion in denying the defendant\u2019s request for substitute counsel and</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>a hearing on her motion to withdraw her guilty plea due to ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b118-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-55 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of manslaughter in the first degree when ...

This court started a probable cause hearing, or that is, testimony. Has counsel explained to you what the purpose of a probable cause hearing is?</p>\n<p id=\"b119-10\">\u201cThe Defendant: Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-11\">\u201cThe Court: All right. Basically, the court, will hear evidence and the court would have to make a decision on whether the state could proceed on the charges that were alleged in the information. Under our law, you have a right to a probable cause hearing. It is guaranteed by our state, and counsel is indicating to me that you wish to waive your hearing in probable cause. Is that true?</p>\n<p id=\"b119-12\">\u201cThe Defendant: Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-13\">\u201cThe Court: Now, have you had sufficient time to discuss this with your attorney before you asked for this waiver?</p>\n<p id=\"b119-14\">\u201cThe Defendant: Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-15\">\u201cThe Court: And you understand that once you waive the hearing in probable cause you cannot ask for it, once again?</p>\n<p id=\"b119-16\">\u201cThe Defendant: Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-17\">\u201cThe Court: Now, do you feel in any way forced to malm this decision?</p>\n<p id=\"b119-18\">\u201cThe Defendant: No.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-19\">\u201cThe Court: And I know you\u2019re in the lockup, but have you had any drugs, alcohol or medicine today?</p>\n<p id=\"b119-20\">\u201cThe Defendant: No.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-21\">\u201cThe Court: Have you had sufficient time to discuss this waiver over with counsel?</p>\n<p id=\"b119-22\">\u201cThe Defendant: Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>\u201cThe Court: You feel satisfied with their advice?</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">\u201cThe Defendant: Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-8\">\u201cThe Court: And you\u2019re asking this court to waive the probable cause hearing?</p>\n<p id=\"b120-9\">\u201cThe Defendant: Yes. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b120-10\">\u201cThe Court: All right. The court will make a finding that the waiver of the hearing in probable cause by [the defendant] has been voluntary. She has had sufficient time to discuss this with both of her attorneys, and the court will make the finding of adequate waiver. All right.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b120-11\"><em> </em>The trial court canvassed the defendant as to her guilty plea as follows.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-12\">\u201cThe Court: All right. Miss Cooper, I\u2019m going to ask you a series of questions concerning both of these pleas here this afternoon. If you do not understand anything or have any questions, you can certainly ask the court or ask your attorneys who are standing with you about this particular canvass. The purpose of the canvass is basically to make sure that you understand each of the charges and the consequences of the charges, and some of the constitutional rights you\u2019re giving up by pleading here this afternoon. All right. And some of the questions will be similar to the ones I\u2019ve just asked you. Miss Cooper, do you feel in any way forced to malee both of these pleas here to both the manslaughter in the first degree [charge] and to the risk of injury charge?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-13\">\u201cThe Defendant: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-14\">\u201cThe Court: All right. And again, I understand you\u2019re incarcerated. Have you had any medicine, drugs or alcohol today?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-15\">\u201cThe Defendant: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-16\">\u201cThe Court: All right. Do you understand you have the right to maintain your innocence, plead not guilty, to make an election [for trial] to a judge or a jury [and that] witnesses could have been subject to cross-examination? You could have taken the stand to defend yourself, if you so chose, but basically because you\u2019re pleading here this afternoon, you\u2019re waiving all of those constitutional rights. You understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-17\">\u201cThe Defendant: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-18\">\u201cThe Court: That applies to both charges. Now, the charges that you\u2019ve pleaded to today are manslaughter in the first degree, which is a class B felony that carries one to twenty years [in prison and a fine of] ten thousand dollars or both. The [offense] which you plead guilty to today is [that] a person is guilty of manslaughter in the first degree when, under circumstances evincing an extreme indifference to human life, she recklessly engages in conduct [that] creates a grave risk of death to another person, and thereby causes the death of another person. That\u2019s the definition of manslaughter in the first degree. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-19\">\u201cThe Defendant: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-20\">\u201cThe Court: Now on the [charge of] injury or risk of injury to, or impairing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>the morals of a child, it\u2019s \u00a7 53-21 and states that any person who wilfully or unlawfully causes or permits any child under the age of sixteen years to be placed in such a situation that its life or limb is endangered, or its health is likely to be injured, or its morals are likely to be impaired, or does any act likely to impair the health or morals of any such child, shall be fined not more than five hundred dollars or imprisoned not more than ten years or both. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-5\">\u201cThe Defendant: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-6\">\u201cThe Court: In this particular case, to run these [sentences] consecutively . . . which is the oiler of the state, would mean a maximum sentence of thirty years to serve. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-7\">\u201cThe Defendant: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-8\">\u201cThe Court: Is that the sentence you agreed to when you talked to both of your attorneys?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-9\">\u201cThe Defendant: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-10\">\u201cThe Court: All right.

And have you had sufficient time to discuss this plea with both of your attorneys?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-13\">\u201cThe Defendant: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-14\">\u201cThe Court: You feel comfortable with this court\u2019s taking these pleas this afternoon?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-15\">\u201cThe Defendant: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-16\">\u201cThe Court: Now, the [state has] indicated its factual basis on the record. Now, after talking to both of your attorneys did you come to the conclusion that you had to take these two pleas in order to ensure the sentence [that has] been offered by the state, that is, the thirty years to serve versus the consequences of going to trial [which means you could have served the maximum of life without parole]? Is that your understanding?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-17\">\u201cThe Defendant: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-18\">\u201cThe Court: Now, do you have any questions through either your attorneys or of this court of this particular canvass today?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-19\">\u201cThe Defendant: No. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-20\">\u201cThe Court: All right. Do you have any questions of your attorneys, Miss Cooper?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-21\">\u201cThe Defendant: No. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-22\">\u201cThe Court: All right. Based upon those facts added by the state, Miss Cooper, does that change your pleas before this court this afternoon?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-23\">\u201cThe Defendant: No. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-24\">\u201cThe Court: Miss Cooper, you\u2019re satisfied by the counsel given to you both by Mr. [Patrick] Culligan and Mr. [Kenneth] Simon?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-25\">\u201cThe Defendant: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>\u201cThe Court: Once again, Miss Cooper, do you have any questions of this particular court before I accept your pleas here today?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-7\">\u201cThe Defendant: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-8\">\u201cThe Court: You understand that the court will set this matter down for a presentence investigation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-9\">\u201cThe Defendant: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-10\">\u201cThe Court: That in approximately six weeks the court will bring you back for a sentencing, that the court will basically have the probation department prepare a presentence investigation for this court\u2019s perusal and information.

And at that time she indicated to us . . .at the conclusion of our rather lengthy conversation she requested of us that we file this motion for the reasons which are enumerated in the motion, Your Honor. Because she feels that [she has] not had, at this point, appropriate time to determine if she in fact proceeded with her entry of a plea, about two months ago, I guess it was now, in a legally appropriate and constitutionally appropriate manner, Your Honor. We advised her that certainly a review of the transcript of those proceedings might answer some of her questions for her. And, of course, acquiring that transcript may take some period of time, Your Honor . . . which would allow her to review the plea canvass that she went through with the court, Your Honor. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b122-16\">\u201cThe Court: All right. What does paragraph two mean?</p>\n<p id=\"b122-17\">\u201c[Defendant\u2019s Counsel]: I think paragraph two and paragraph three probably are connected, Your Honor. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b122-18\">\u201c[Defendant\u2019s Counsel]: [The defendant] is someone who is not particularly familiar with the criminal justice system. [She has] had one minor encounter previously, which did not involve any sort of protracted or lengthy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>negotiations or any great understanding of our criminal code or the distinctions to be made between various forms of homicide, Your Honor. She has had, since the entry of her plea, a period of time to begin to ask those questions of herself. And now she has recently asked them of us, and she wishes to have an opportunity to assess the answers that we\u2019ve given her, to reassess the facts and the evidence of her case in order to make a judgment for herself whether or not she received appropriate and competent advice from us as her attorneys. And the way that I think that is related to paragraph three is that the recent events in . . . Massachusetts on a similar-case have made her . . . reevaluate whether, in fact, the advice that her attorneys gave her and the position of the state here in Connecticut is fair and constitutes justice and was appropriate advice from counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">\u201cThe Court: Now, the issue of the situation in Massachusetts, Mr. [Patrick] Culligan, I presume, with all your experience\u2014and that also includes Mr. [Kenneth] Simon\u2014that you have explained to [the defendant] that whatever happens in Massachusetts has no indirect, remote or any bearing in relation to how this particular court or the judges in Connecticut act. We\u2019re talking about apples and oranges. We're talking about a different structure, legally. We\u2019re talking about different precedent. We\u2019re talking about different factual base's ... in that case there was a trial. This is a plea. Basically, this court is indicating, very strongly, to [the defendant] that there is no correlation whatsoever in this particular courtroom concerning Massachusetts. What the judge did up there is based upon his reading of the [law]. Whether he\u2019s upheld, whether that is aproper decision is totally irrelevant to this particular court. I presume, Mr. Culligan, you have, in your vast experience, communicated the [differences] between the two courts to your client.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">\u201c[Defendant\u2019s Counsel]: That\u2019s an accurate presumption, Your Honor. I would just note for the record that in the court\u2019s comments the court did cover several items and reasons why there are distinctions to be made between the state of Massachusetts and the state of Connecticut and the results that occurred in that part icular child homicide case and this particular child homicide case. But the fact that there are numerous reasons, I think, Your Honor, speaks to the reason [for] her request for a continuance . . . simply to consider that reasoning, which is much more common to the court and to the attorneys to perceive and to understand than I think it is for a layperson of limited education who has not. achieved a high school education, Your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-9\">\u201cThe Court: And I think that\u2019s a fair assumption, Mr. Culligan . . . which is exactly what the court has stated on the record to [the defendant] very directly, that that particular issue will have no effect whatsoever on this particular court's decision concerning sentencing after plea.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b123-10\"> In anticipation of the defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw her plea, the trial court requested a transcript of its plea canvass.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b124-6\"> The defendant\u2019s counsel had secured potential substitute counsel who was in the courtroom prepared to take over the defendant\u2019s case if the trial court had appointed him.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b124-7\"> The following colloquy took place between the trial court and defense counsel during argument on the defendant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">\u201cThe Court: All right. Mr. [Patrick] Culligan [is] it your suggestion, although it\u2019s not in the motion, [that the way] to handle this particular problem is to appoint her other counsel to specifically inquire [into] (a) whether she felt that she had effective assistance of counsel and (b) . . . that counsel should be appointed and the court should conduct an independent hearing in deciding paragraph two? Is that your position?</p>\n<p id=\"b124-9\">\u201c[Defendant\u2019s Counsel]: Yes, it is, Your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-10\">\u201cThe Court: All right. Anything further, Mr. Culligan, before the court rules on the motion?</p>\n<p id=\"b124-11\">\u201c[Defendant\u2019s Counsel]: Yes, Your Honor. In support of . . . defendant\u2019s counsels\u2019 position, Your Honor . . . that at this juncture the court should appoint [the defendant] separate counsel and conduct a hearing as to claim number two. I would point out to the court that one of . . . the conundrums with defense counsel is that certain claims which [the defendant] is making with respect to the effective assistance of counsel may involve allegations made by her which her defense counsel may not agree with or may not be able to support factually, Your Honor, and there may be a factual dispute which the court will be called upon to abdicate with respect to the second claim, Your Honor. And that\u2019s why it puts defense counsel presently in an awkward position attempting to represent her effectively as to her second claim that we denied her effective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-12\">\u201cI will point out to the court, it\u2019s my opinion that our client has come to learn of . . . certain facts and concepts since the taking of the guilty plea which she believes she did not receive adequate and sufficient advice about from Mr. [Kenneth] Simon or [me], Your Honor, and that\u2019s why we feel that we have a conflict of interest in attempting to put forth that claim in a manner which an advocate for her should strenuously pursue, Your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-13\">\u201cThe Court: Let me follow this, Mr. Culligan. The person pleads guilty, [is] adequately canvassed by the court, [is] questioned not once, twice, but three times by the court as far as effective assistance of counsel, then comes back prior to sentencing, changes her mind for whatever reason, [and] you feel it\u2019s imperative [that] the court, once that issue is brought before the court . . . appoint another counsel and have a separate hearing concerning what breadth, Mr. Culligan? The breadth of the canvass, the breadth of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>probable cause hearing in this . . . particular case? How far do we go with it?</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">\u201c[Defendant\u2019s Counsel]: It would seem to me, Your Honor, that it would go to those issues and those matters on which she was advised or not by her counsel with respect to the issues surrounding the significance of her guilty plea and its legal consequences and ramifications to her, Your Honor. I would point out to the court, that just as the issue of whether a defendant\u2019s plea is knowingly and voluntarily made is both an opinion question as well as a question of legal conclusion, Your [Honor, the] question as to whether or not a defendant has received effective assistance of counsel is both a question of a person\u2019s opinion, which is, I think, what happened in this canvass and what often happens.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-14\">\u201cThe Court: Well, let me follow that further. Suppose I go down that alley [and] I appoint another lawyer, Mr. Culligan, [who] works [his] way through the process. I mean, where does that particular process end? I mean, do we get another lawyer to examine the other lawyer, rather the first lawyer, if things aren\u2019t working out the way the [defendant thinks] they should have w'orked out based upon subsequent circumstances? . . . Well, the court basically will deny the defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw. . . . The court has read the canvass. The court finds that [it was] knowingly and voluntarily made. The court denies the motion in total. The court feels that a hearing is unnecessary. The court is prepared to sentence at this particular period of time.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b125-17\"> Because the defendant briefed only her federal constitutional claim and her claims brought under the rules of practice, we will consider her state constitutional claim abandoned.
