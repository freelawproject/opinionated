J.</author>\n<p id=\"Akj\">The plaintiff, Michael Connair, an orthopedic surgeon, appeals from the decision of the workers\u2019 compensation review board (board) reversing the commissioner\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss. The plaintiff claims that the board improperly ordered the commissioner to grant the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss because the retroactive procedure adopted by the workers\u2019 compensation chairman (chairman) was in excess of the statutory authority delegated to him. We affirm the board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-10\">The chairman of the workers\u2019 compensation commission has authority under General Statutes \u00a7 31-280 (b) (23)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to develop guidelines for expediting disputed cases and has authority under \u00a7 31-280 (b) (26) (A),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>consultation with insurers and medical practitioners, to establish guidelines, including procedures for resolution of billing disputes. Pursuant to that statute, the chairman, by resolution and order on March 4, 1994, adopted \u00a7 31-280-3 (e) (2) of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which established three-member dispute resolution panels comprised of a commissioner, a payor representative and a medical practitioner representative. The panels were intended to resolve, expeditiously and efficiently, a backlog of disputes regarding medical claims that already had been submitted. Previously, all disputed medical bills were submitted to a single commissioner for determination. Under the new procedure, the old bills were to be resubmitted to one of the new three-member panels.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">The plaintiff had treated several employees of the defendant, the city of New Haven (city), who had filed workers\u2019 compensation claims for injuries covered by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (act). General Statutes \u00a7 31-275 et seq. The plaintiff submitted a claim for his services to the commissioner in accordance with the former procedure instead of to the three-member panel, and he asserted that he was never paid for these services. A consolidated formal hearing on all of these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>claims was held before the commissioner on August 28, 1996. The city filed a motion to dismiss with the commissioner because the plaintiff did not comply with the new regulation. The commissioner denied the motion to dismiss, and the city appealed to the board, which reversed the commissioner\u2019s decision and remanded the case with direction to dismiss the plaintiffs claim. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">The plaintiff argues that the procedure established by the chairman is an excessive delegation of power and, therefore, cannot retroactively be applied to his claims. The city maintains that the chairman acted pursuant to a lawful delegation of power and, consequently, the plaintiffs bills should have been submitted to the three-member panel in accordance with the new regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">It is not disputed that the chairman is given broad authority to promulgate rules and regulations to administer the act. The legislature provided the chairman with the power to develop guidelines for expediting disputed cases, \u201capproving all fees for services rendered under this chapter by attorneys, physicians, surgeons, podiatrists, optometrists, dentists and other persons . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 31-280 (b) (11) (A). The administrative authority granted to the chairman by \u00a7 31-280 (b) (23), when read with the rest of the act, indicates an extensive and broad power to manage the workers\u2019 compensation system; the authority to process cases in a timely and efficient manner is ,plenary. Nevertheless, the plaintiff argues that the chairman exceeded the scope of his authority when he established guidelines to resolve past disputed medical claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">We generally look to the statutory language and the pertinent legislative history to ascertain whether the legislature intended that an amendment be given retro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>active effect. <em>Reliance Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>American Casualty Co. of Reading, Pennsylvania, </em>238 Conn. 285, 290, 679 A.2d 925 (1996) (en banc). As a general rule of law, \u201cstatutes affecting substantive rights . . . apply prospectively only.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Rice </em>v. <em>Vermilyn Brown, Inc., </em>232 Conn. 780, 786, 657 A.2d 616 (1995). \u201c[Procedural statutes generally are applied retroactively absent a clear expression of legislative intent to the contrary.\u201d Id., 786 n.12. To determine if the resolution and order should be applied retroactively, we must first determine whether the statute is substantive or procedural.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">Our review of the record and the statutory construction of \u00a7 31-280 shows a broad grant of power given to the chairman to adopt regulations to carry out his responsibilities under the act, including the authority to \u201c[a]ppoint such supplementary advisory panels as the chairman deems necessary . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 31-280 (b) (9). Pursuant to this statutory power, the chairman procedurally changed the requirements of filing disputed claims. Instead of submitting a claim to one commissioner, the plaintiff was required to submit it to a three-member panel. This regulatory scheme affects only the remedy by which the payment of compensation is evaluated. <em>Everett </em>v. <em>Ingraham, </em>150 Conn. 153, 157, 186 A.2d 798 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">Because the criteria relied on in making such substantive determinations has not been altered, the only change in the regulatory scheme is procedural in nature. In addition, the resolution arid order applied only for a limited period of time and was enacted for the specific purpose of reducing a backlog of medical claims. Accordingly, because we conclude that the regulation is procedural, its retroactive application is not inconsistent with the grant of authority by the legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>The decision of the workers\u2019 compensation review board is affirmed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b152-11\"> General Statutes \u00a7 31-280 (b) provides in relevant part: \u201cThe chairman of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission shall . . .

Such Dispute Resolution Panels shall resolve issues that cannot be resolved through the internal mechanisms established by Payors.
