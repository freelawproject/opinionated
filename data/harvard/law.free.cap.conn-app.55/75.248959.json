Liano, appeals from the decision of the compensation review board (board) dated June 3, 1998, affirming a decision of a workers\u2019 compensation commissioner (commissioner) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>dated March 7, 1997. The defendant, the city of Bridgeport (city), cross appeals from the same decision. The plaintiff claims that the board improperly (1) determined that he was not entitled to have his benefits from 1983 to 1990 adjusted to include overtime and (2) deprived him of property without due process in violation of the federal and state constitutions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant claims that the board improperly (1) determined that the plaintiff was entitled to overtime earnings after 1990 and (2) calculated the plaintiffs weekly compensation based on a date of injury of May 16,1983. We affirm in part and reverse in part the decision of the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">The following procedural history and facts are necessary to a resolution of the appeal and cross appeal. The plaintiff was employed as a police officer for the city. He filed a claim on September 18,1979, based on injuries related to heart disease or hypertension suffered in the course of his duties. The commissioner determined that he suffered an injury that was compensable under the heart and hypertension statutes, General Statutes (Rev. to 1979) \u00a7 7-433a et seq.,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and awarded him benefits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1979) \u00a7 7-433c on September 30, 1983, with an effective date of injury of September 18, 1979. The commissioner held a subsequent hearing and, in a supplemental finding and award dated November 7, 1986, determined that the plaintiffs compensation rate was to be $204 per week. The commissioner further found that the plaintiff was temporarily totally disabled and ordered the city to make temporary total disability payments until further order of the commissioner. The plaintiff returned before the commissioner and, in a finding and award dated September 13,1988, was awarded insurance benefits pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1979) \u00a7 31-51h. Neither party appealed from any of those decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">In August, 1993, the plaintiff filed a complaint with the freedom of information commission requesting documentation regarding police officers\u2019 overtime rates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>and pay rates from the city for the years he worked on the police force. The freedom of information commission ordered that the city make those records available to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">On April 26, 1994, the commissioner issued yet another finding and award, determining that the plaintiffs weekly compensation rate was to be readjusted on the basis of a May 16, 1983 date of injury and that it was to include both \u201cinside\u201d and \u201coutside\u201d overtime compensation pursuant to <em>Szudora </em>v. <em>Fairfield, </em>214 Conn. 552, 559, 573 A.2d 1 (1990), for 1990 and subsequent years.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The commissioner also awarded the plaintiff interest and attorney\u2019s fees, but determined that no facts had been presented from which the amount of attorney\u2019s fees could be determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">The defendant appealed to the board and the plaintiff cross appealed. In an opinion dated July 25, 1995, the board upheld the commissioner\u2019s findings regarding the date for determining the plaintiffs weekly compensation and dismissed the defendant\u2019s appeal. Specifically, the board held that after 1990, overtime earnings should be includable in the 100 percent cap as defined in General Statutes \u00a7 7-433b (b), but that the plaintiff was not entitled to a readjustment to include overtime for the years 1983 to 1990 because he had not provided the commissioner with any facts showing that police officers earned overtime wages prior to 1990. The board also remanded the case to the commissioner for a determination of attorney\u2019s fees due the plaintiff. The plaintiff appealed and the defendant cross appealed to this court from the board\u2019s July 25, 1995 opinion. We dismissed the appeal and cross appeal for lack of a final judgment because there had not been a finding as to the plaintiffs attorney\u2019s fees, and our Supreme Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>denied the plaintiffs petition for certification. <em>Liano </em>v. <em>Bridgeport, </em>238 Conn. 906, 679 A.2d 1 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">The plaintiff again returned to the commissioner, this time seeking an award of attorney\u2019s fees. The commissioner awarded the plaintiff $6590 in attorney\u2019s fees in a finding and award dated March 7,1997. The defendant appealed to the board,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which remanded the issue of attorney\u2019s fees to the commissioner on June 3, 1998, for a finding of reasonableness. The board also refused to revisit the redetermination of the plaintiffs date of injury and the recalculation of his weekly compensation rate, stating that its July 25, 1995 opinion was the law of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">On June 23, 1998, the plaintiff filed this appeal from the board\u2019s June 3, 1998 decision. The defendant then filed its cross appeal. The defendant filed a motion to dismiss the plaintiffs appeal on July 1,1998. We granted the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss, limited to the issue of attorney\u2019s fees, for lack of a final judgment in light of <em>Benvenuto </em>v. <em>Mahajan, </em>245 Conn. 495, 715 A.2d 743 (1998). As a result of that dismissal, the defendant\u2019s cross appeal on the same issue also was dismissed. We also, sua sponte, struck that portion of the plaintiffs brief addressing the issue of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">In this appeal, the plaintiff claims that the board improperly affirmed the commissioner\u2019s finding that he was not entitled to an adjustment of his weekly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>compensation to include overtime wages from the years 1983 to 1990. We are not persuaded. The defendant claims in its cross appeal that the commissioner improperly determined that the plaintiff was entitled to overtime compensation for the year\u2019s 1990 and following, and that the plaintiffs date of injury was improperly changed from September 18, 1979, to May 16, 1983. We agree. The dispositive issue of both the appeal and cross appeal is whether the commissioner\u2019s finding and award of November 7, 1986, was final at the time our Supreme Court decided <em>Szudora.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">Our standard of review in workers\u2019 compensation cases is well settled. \u201c[T]he power and duty of determining the facts rests on the commissioner, the trier of facts. . . . The conclusions drawn by him from the facts found must stand unless they result from an incorrect application of the law to the subordinate facts or from an inference illegally or unreasonably drawn from them.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Fair </em>v. <em>People's Savings Bank, </em>207 Conn. 535, 539, 542 A.2d 1118 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">We first address the question of whether the plaintiffs case was pending at the time our Supreme Court decided <em>Szudora </em>v. <em>Fairfield, </em>supra, 214 Conn. 552, or whether it was a final judgment that was modifiable only in the situations indicated in General Statutes \u00a7 31-315.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In <em>Szudora, </em>the court held that the 100 percent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>cap in \u00a7 7-433b (b) \u201crequired consideration not only of base pay but also of overtime payments to similarly situated working members of the defendant\u2019s police department.\u201d <em>Szudora </em>v. <em>Fairfield, </em>supra, 554. The plaintiff relies on <em>Szudora </em>to support his position that the commissioner correctly adjusted his post-1990 compensation to include overtime and incorrectly failed to include overtime for the years 1983 to 1990. Our Supreme Court recently decided <em>Marone </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>244 Conn. 1, 707 A.2d 725 (1998) (en banc), which presents facts similar to those in the present case. \u201cThe plaintiff, Vincent Marone, a Waterbury police officer, was diagnosed on September 9,1980, as suffering from hypertension .... He reached maximum medical improvement on April 15, 1982, and retired on that date .... On July 14, 1983, the plaintiff was awarded disability benefits pursuant to \u00a7 7-433c .... On June 21,1994, the plaintiff requested a recalculation, in accordance with <em>Szudora, </em>of his weekly compensation . . . .\u201d Id., 4. Marone\u2019s request was denied by the commissioner, which decision was affirmed by the board because (1) <em>Szudora </em>did not apply retroactively, (2) the action was no longer pending and (3) such a result would be unduly burdensome to municipalities. Id., 5. The board, however, held that <em>Szudora </em>could be applied prospectively. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">\u201cWhether a judgment is final depends upon the governing statute. \u2018[T]he line that separates lower court judgments that are pending on appeal (or may still be appealed), from lower court judgments that are final, is determined by statute .... Having achieved finality ... a judicial decision becomes the last word of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>judicial department with regard to a particular case or controversy. . . <em>.\u2019Plaut v. Spendthrift Farm, Inc., </em>514 U.S. 211, 227, 115 S. Ct. 1447, 131 L. Ed. 2d 328 (1995).\u201d <em>Marone </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>supra, 244 Conn. 12. As in <em>Mar-one, </em>the plaintiff in the present case began receiving benefits pursuant to the 1986 supplemental finding and award. The present case is controlled by our Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Marone. </em>Because neither party in the present case appealed from the original 1983 finding and award, the 1986 supplemental finding and award or even the 1988 finding and award, those decisions became final after the appeal periods expired, well before <em>Szudora </em>was decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">We next decide whether the initial award was subject to modification pursuant to \u00a7 31-315. We conclude that it was not. Again, <em>Marone </em>governs this case. \u201cThe power of the commission to hear modification requests is determined by the provisions of \u00a7 31-315. \u2018It is clear that an administrative body must act strictly within its statutory authority, within its constitutional limitations and in a lawful manner.\u2019 <em>Waterbury </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>160 Conn. 226, 230, 278 A.2d 771 (1971). The parties to a claim cannot, by agreement, endow the commission with the authority to decide that claim. <em>Jester </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>99 Conn. 236, 238, 121 A. 470 (1923). Additionally, a decision of an administrative agency cannot be \u2018set aside upon the sole ground that it is erroneous in matter of law, except by a court exercising appellate or revisory jurisdiction, unless authorized by statute, or unless the error is one going to the jurisdiction.\u2019 . . . <em>Kalinick </em>v. <em>Collins Co., </em>[116 Conn. 1, 8, 163 A. 460 (1932)]. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">\u201cSection 31-315 allows the commission to modify an award in three situations. First, modification is permitted where \u2018the incapacity of an injured employee has increased, decreased or ceased, or . . . the measure of dependence on account of which the compensation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>is paid has changed . . . .\u2019 Second, the award may be modified when \u2018changed conditions of fact have arisen which necessitate a change of [the award].\u2019 . . .Third, \u2018[t]he commissioner shall also have the same power to open and modify an award as any court of the state has to open and modify a judgment of such court.\u2019 This provision extends the commission\u2019s power to open and modify judgments to cases of accident; <em>Hayden </em>v. <em>Wallace &amp; Sons Mfg. Co., </em>100 Conn. 180, 188, 123 A. 9 (1923); to mistakes of fact; <em>Fair </em>v. <em>Hartford Rubber Works Co., 95 </em>Conn. 350, 355, 111 A. 193 (1920); and to fraud; <em>Grabowski </em>v. <em>Miskell, </em>97 Conn. 76, 84, 115 A. 691 (1921); but not to mistakes of law. <em>Kalinick </em>v. <em>Collins Co., </em>supra, 116 Conn. 4-5. The final clause of \u00a7 31-315 allows the commission to retain jurisdiction over claims during the entire compensable period. This provision, however, does not independently confer authority to modify awards for reasons not otherwise enumerated in \u00a7 31-315. Id., 7-8.\u201d <em>Marone </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>supra, 244 Conn. 16-17. The plaintiff in the present case did not allege that he met any of the criteria set forth in \u00a7 31-315 to warrant modifying his award. He relies solely on <em>Szudora.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">The court in <em>Marone </em>held that <em>Szudora </em>was a new interpretation of the law and, therefore, could be applied only to pending cases. Id., 18. Because the plaintiffs case was not pending at the time of the <em>Szudora </em>decision, \u00a7 31-315 does not permit the commission to modify the plaintiffs award on the basis of the definition of weekly compensation set forth in <em>Szudora. </em>Furthermore, because the plaintiffs award was a final judgment, he was not entitled to have the commission adjust his weekly compensation on the basis of a date of injury of May 16, 1983, because he did not show that he met the requirements of \u00a7 31-315.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">On the plaintiffs appeal, the decision of the compensation review board is affirmed with respect to that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>portion determining that the plaintiff is not entitled to a recalculation of the cap pursuant to \u00a7 7-433b (b) to include overtime payments for the years 1983 to 1990. On the defendant\u2019s cross appeal, the decision of the compensation review board is reversed with respect to those portions that modify the original date of injury and determine that the plaintiff was entitled to include overtime wages in the computation of the cap pursuant to \u00a7 7-433b (b) for the years 1990 and following. The case is remanded to the board with direction to remand the matter to the commissioner for the recalculation of the plaintiffs weekly compensation based on a September 18, 1979 date of injury and in a manner not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b99-7\"> While the plaintiffs statement of the issues presented raises his due process claim, his brief does not address that question. Claims that axe not adequately briefed are considered abandoned. <em>State </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>44 Conn. App. 818, 823, 692 A.2d 846, cert. denied, 242 Conn. 902, 697 A.2d 363 (1997). We therefore do not address the plaintiffs due process claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b99-8\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1979) \u00a7 7-433b (b) provides: \u201cNotwithstanding the provisions of any general statute, charter or special act to the contrary affecting the noncontributory or contributory retirement systems of any municipality of the state, or any special act, providing for a police or firemen benefit fund or other ret irement system, 1 he cumulative payment s, not including payments for medical care, for compensation and retirement or survivors benefits under section 7-433c shall be adjusted so that the total of such cumulative payments received by such member or his dependents or survivors shall not exceed one hundred per cent of the weekly compensation being paid, during their compensable period, t o members of such department in the same position which was held by such member at the time of his death or retirement.
