Pitchell, appeals from the judgment rendered following the trial court\u2019s granting of the motion for summary judgment filed by the defendants, attorney John R. Williams and his present and former law firms,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> on Pitchell\u2019s legal malpractice action. The court ruled that the malpractice action could succeed only if Pitchell could have successfully prosecuted a claim, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 7-465,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that an off duty Hartford police officer and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>city of Hartford were liable to Pitchell as a result of an incident in which another off duty Hartford police officer shot Pitchell. Williams, who had commenced an action in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut (District Court) on behalf of Pitchell, had failed to assert such a claim. The trial court, however, concluded that the claim would necessarily have failed because the issue had been determined in the District Court action the defendants brought under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> as well as in the appeal from the District Court\u2019s decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. See <em>Pitchell </em>v. <em>Callan, </em>13 F.3d 545 (2d Cir. 1994). In rendering judgment, the District Court concluded, as a matter of law, that the off duty officer had not acted under \u201ccolor of law\u201d in failing to intercede to prevent another off duty officer from shooting Pitchell. <em>Pitchell </em>v. <em>Callan, </em>United States District Court, Civil No. H-89-73 (AVC) (D. Conn. January 6, 1993). On the basis of the federal court decisions, the trial court, reasoned that Pitchell was collaterally estopped from claiming in this malpractice action that the off duty officer had acted within the scope of his employment and in the performance of his duties pursuant to \u00a7 7-465.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">Pitchell asserts that the determination that the officer-had not acted under \u201ccolor of law\u201d for purposes of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 is not the same as a determination regarding scope of employment and performance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>duty pursuant to \u00a7 7-465, and, therefore, the court improperly granted the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment on the ground of collateral estoppel. We reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">The following relevant facts and procedural history are necessary to our resolution of Pitchell\u2019s claims. This appeal stems from a malpractice action against the defendants that arose out of their representation of Pitchell in the District Court. On June 19,1987, Officers James F. Callan and Gregory Sargis ended their work shift at midnight and went to a bar, where they met Pitchell and another man named Fernando Rodriguez. The men drank at the bar and, after it closed, retired to Callan\u2019s residence, where they continued drinking. Although his shift had ended, Sargis was still wearing part of his police uniform and was carrying his badge and service revolver.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> At approximately 3 a.m., Callan retrieved his .357 magnum revolver from another room in the house. He checked to see if the gun was loaded, then showed it to Sargis and Rodriguez and asked them to verify that it was loaded. Thereafter, while in the immediate presence of Sargis and Rodriguez, Callan pointed the loaded revolver at Pitchell and uttered threatening statements to him. Pitchell turned to Sargis and asked him for assistance, Sargis took no action to protect Pitchell or to stop Callan. Callan then shot Pitchell in the face, causing severe injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">Thereafter, Pitchell retained Williams, who filed an action in the District Court on Pitchell\u2019s behalf against the city of Hartford (city), Callan and Sargis. The complaint, as summarized by the Second Circuit alleged: \u201c(1) a section 1983 violation by Callan and Sargis on the ground that both men, acting under color of law, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>deprived Pitchell of rights secured to him by the Fourth, Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, the claim against Callan being based on the shooting, the claim against Sargis being based on his failure to attempt to prevent the shooting; (2) state-law negligence and willful misconduct on the part of both Callan and Sargis predicated on the same behavior; (3) a section 1983 violation by the City of Hartford on the ground that the municipality was consciously indifferent to the safety of its citizens in its screening, training and supervision of the officers; and (4) a state-law claim against the City on the ground it was liable for the torts of its two officers.\u201d <em>Pitchell </em>v. <em>Callan, </em>supra, 13 F.3d 546-47.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\">The District Court granted the city\u2019s motion for summary judgment, ruling that the acts of Callan and Sargis were not committed under color of law and, therefore, the city had no vicarious liability under \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">Callan and Sargis thereafter filed motions for summary judgment, which also were granted by the District Court. In its decision on the motions by Callan and Sargis the District Court reiterated its conclusion that Callan and Sargis were not acting in their official police capacity at the time of the shooting, but in their personal, private pursuits, which fall outside \u00a7 1983 liability. The Second Circuit affirmed the District Court\u2019s judgments. Id., 546.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">Pitchell eventually retained new counsel who brought an action in the Superior Court against Callan, Sargis and the city. That action alleged that the city was liable to Pitchell pursuant to \u00a7 7-465. The city\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the \u00a7 7-465 claim was granted on the grounds of res judicata and the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">Pitchell then commenced the present action against the defendants for legal malpractice alleged to have arisen out of Williams\u2019 failure to assert the \u00a7 7-465 claim for Pitchell in the federal case. Pitchell set forth causes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>of action sounding in negligence,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> breach of warranty<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and breach of contract.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The defendants filed a motion for summary judgment on the ground, inter alia, of collateral estoppel. The court granted the motion, ruling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>that \u201cthe issue whether the conduct of Callan and/or Sargis was within the scope of \u00a7 7-465 was effectively decided adversely to [Pitchell] in the federal case, and [Pitchell] is thereby collaterally estopped from relitigat-ing that issue in this case.\u201d This appeal followed.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b599-4\">Our standard of review of a trial court\u2019s decision to grant a motion for summary judgment is well established. \u201cPractice Book \u00a7 384 [now \u00a7 17-49] provides that summary judgment shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, affidavits and any other proof submitted show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. . . . <em>Miller </em>v. <em>United Technologies Corp., </em>233 Conn. 732, 744-45, 660 A.2d 810 (1995). In deciding a motion for summary judgment, the trial court must view the evidence irr the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. . . . Id., 745. The party seeking summary judgment has the burden of showing the absence of any genuine issue [of] material facts which, under applicable principles of substantive law, entitle him to a judgment as a matter of law; <em>D.H.R. Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Donnelly, </em>180 Conn. 430, 434, 429 A.2d 908 (1980); and the party opposing such a motion must provide an evidentiary foundation to demonstrate the existence of a genuine issue of material fact. Practice Book \u00a7 381 [now \u00a7 17-46]. . . . <em>Suarez </em>v. <em>Dickmont Plastics Carp., </em>229 Conn. 99, 105, 639 A.2d 507 (1994).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Dowling </em>v. <em>Finley Associates, Inc., </em>248 Conn. 364, 369-70, 727 A.2d 1245 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">\u201cCollateral estoppel, or issue preclusion, prohibits the relitigation of an issue when that issue was actually litigated and necessarily determined in a prior action. . . . For an issue to be subject to collateral estoppel, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>it must have been fully and fairly litigated in the first action. It also must have been actually decided and the decision must have been necessary to the judgment. . . . Furthermore, [t]o invoke collateral estoppel the issues sought to be litigated in the new proceeding must be identical to those considered in the prior proceeding.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Milford </em>v. <em>Andresakis, </em>52 Conn. App. 454, 460-61, 726 A.2d 1170, cert. denied, 248 Conn. 922, 733 A.2d 845 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">\u201cAn issue is actually litigated if it is properly raised in the pleadings or otherwise, submitted for determination, and in fact determined. ... 1 Restatement (Second), Judgments \u00a7 27, comment (d) (1982). An issue is necessarily determined if, in the absence of a determination of the issue, the judgment could not have been validly rendered. F. James &amp; G. Hazard, Civil Procedure (3d Ed. 1985) \u00a7 11.19. If an issue has been determined, but the judgment is not dependent upon the determination of the issue, the parties may relitigate the issue in a subsequent action. Findings on nonessential issues usually have the characteristics of dicta. 1 Restatement (Second), [supra, comment (h)]. . . . <em>Jackson v. R. G. Whipple, Inc., </em>[225 Conn. 705, 714-15, 627 A.2d 374 (1993)].\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Dowling </em>v. <em>Finley Associates, Inc., </em>supra, 248 Conn. 374.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">Here, the trial court concluded that the Second Circuit\u2019s determination that neither Sargis nor Callan was acting under color of law is \u201cincompatible with holdings that either of them was \u2018acting in the performance of his duties and within the scope of his employment\u2019 when [Pitchell] was shot.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-8\">The issue of whether the state trial court properly applied the doctrine of collateral estoppel to the \u00a7 7-465 claim turns on whether any decision regarding Sargis\u2019 duty status was necessary to the District Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>decision. Pitchell asserts that the District Court addressed only <em>Callan\u2019s </em>duty status and not Sargis\u2019 when it granted summary judgment in favor of the city. This claim is supported by the District Court\u2019s statement of the issues in its decision as: \u201c(1) Whether <em>Callan\u2019s </em>acts were made under color of state law for purposes of \u00a7 1983 liability; (2) whether the City showed \u2018deliberate indifference\u2019 to the menace posed to the public by its police officers sufficient to justify \u00a7 1983 liability; and (3) whether the court should exercise pendent jurisdiction over the remaining state law negligence claim.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Pitchell </em>v. <em>Callan, </em>supra, United States District Court, Civil No. H-89-73. Sargis\u2019 status is not mentioned as an issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">The District Court, in granting summary judgment for the defendants in that case, held that \u201cthe acts of police officers in their personal, private pursuits fall outside of \u00a7 1983 liability.\u201d In support of this conclusion, the court cited <em>Bonsignore </em>v. <em>New York, </em>683 F.2d 635 (2d Cir. 1982), in which an off duty officer shot his wife and then committed suicide. The Second Circuit determined in that case that the officer\u2019s actions \u201cwere not committed in the performance of any actual or pretended duty.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 639.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">In affirming the District Court\u2019s decision in the case before us, the Second Circuit stated that \u201cfi]f Callan did not violate Pitchell\u2019s constitutional rights, neither did Sargis.\u201d <em>Pitchell </em>v. <em>Callan, </em>supra, 13 F.3d 549. The court applied the rationale of <em>DeShaney </em>v. <em>Winnebago County Dept. of Social Services, </em>489 U.S. 189, 109 S. Ct. 998, 103 L. Ed. 2d 249 (1989), to Pitchell\u2019s claim that Sargis was \u201cautomatically\u201d on duty and should have acted when Callan threatened Pitchell with a gun in Sargis\u2019 presence <em>Pitchell </em>v. <em>Callan, </em>supra, 549. Citing <em>DeShaney, </em>the Second Circuit held that the District Court had correctly found that Callan was guilty of only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>private violence and that a state\u2019s \u201cfailure to protect an individual against private violence simply does not constitute a violation of the Due Process Clause.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">In <em>Martinez </em>v. <em>Colon, </em>54 F.3d 980, 987-88 (1st Cir. 1995), the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit concluded that on-looking police officers had no constitutional duty to protect a fellow officer from harm at the hands of another officer under the circumstances of that case. Summarizing <em>DeShaney, </em>the First Circuit stated that the \u201cDue Process Clause ordinarily does not require the state to protect an individual\u2019s life, limb, or property against the marauding of third parties not acting on the state\u2019s behoof.\u201d Id., 984. \u201cPrivate violence\u2014even private violence engaged in by one who happens to work for the state\u2014has different legal ramifications than violence attributable to state action.\u201d Id., 985. Thus, \u201cwhen an on-duty police officer witnesses violence, the existence ... of a constitutional duty to intervene will most often hinge on whether he is witnessing private violence or violence attributable to state action.\u201d Id., 986.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">For \u00a7 1983 purposes, the determinative \u201ccolor of law\u201d factor with respect to a claim that a police officer should have intervened to protect a person from violence is not the officer\u2019s duty status, but rather, whether the violent act was private or public. Having determined that Callan\u2019s violent act was a private one, unrelated to his duty as an officer, the District Court had no need to consider whether Sargis was on duty or off duty, or whether he acted within the scope of his employment or performance of his duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-8\">In the federal action, the District Court was concerned with whether Callan was acting under color of law, which is the crux of a \u00a7 1983 action, and not with whether Sargis was on or off duty. When the District Court concluded, as a matter of law, that Callan was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>not acting under color of law, its analysis stopped because, if Callan was not acting under color of law for purposes of a \u00a7 1983 constitutional rights violation, it follows, pursuant to <em>DeShaney, </em>that Sargis could not have been acting under color of law as a mere onlooker. It was, therefore, not necessary for the federal court to address the issue of whether Sargis was on or off duty. Consequently, collateral estoppel cannot apply to bar Pitchell from asserting this malpractice action based on Williams\u2019 failure to bring a \u00a7 7-465 claim in the federal action.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">Whether Sargis was on or off duty is a material issue of fact the determination of which bears on whether Pitchell would have succeeded on a \u00a7 7-465 claim, had it been properly brought.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See <em>Palmieri </em>v. <em>Winnick, </em>40 Conn. Sup. 144, 482 A.2d 1229 (1984), aff'd, 10 Conn. App. 18, 521 A.2d 210 (1987). The granting of the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment was, therefore, improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to deny the motion for summary judgment to the extent that it is based on collateral estop-pel<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and for further proceedings according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b594-12\"> The defendants are John R.
