We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">The following facts and procedural history are relevant to these appeals. James L. was bom on July 11, 1996, to the respondent parents and lived with them in Torrington. On August 21, 1996, at approximately 7:20 p.m., the respondent mother placed a 911 call to the Torrington police department to report that someone had walked into her apartment and kidnapped her son.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The following day, the police found the minor child in a car owned by Carol Brooks.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On August 30, 1996, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>trial court granted a request by the commissioner for an order of temporary custody, and the commissioner thereafter filed a coterminous petition alleging that James L. was an abandoned child and seeking termination of parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">The trial court found, by clear and convincing evidence, that the respondents had abandoned the minor child in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 46b-120 (i), as amended by Public Acts 1995, No. 95-225, \u00a7 9, and General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 17a-112 (b) (1), and engaged in specific acts of parental omission and commission in violation of \u00a7 17a-112 (b) (3).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court found that \u201cplacing the child in commerce and delivering the child to Carol Brooks constituted the act of abandoning the child, an act of commission.\u201d It concluded that \u201c[t]he callousness and the circumstances surrounding his sale [in exchange] for rent ensure that [James L.] will face [additional] painful awareness of the meaning of being an \u2018unwanted\u2019 and \u2018abandoned\u2019 child.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The court found that these grounds for termination did not exist for more than one year preceding the filing of the petition but nevertheless waived the one year statutory requirement to promote the best interests of the child. The court, finding that it was in the best interests of the minor child to do so, granted the petition and terminated the respondents\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>parental rights. From that judgment, the present appeal ensued. Additional facts and procedural history will be discussed where relevant to issues in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">Initially, the respondent mother claims that the trial court improperly failed to grant her motion to dismiss. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">Following the commissioner\u2019s presentation of her case-in-chief, the respondent mother asked the court to dismiss the first and second counts of the petition, which alleged abandonment and acts of omission or commission, respectively, on the ground that the commissioner had failed to make out a prima facie case. After the court denied the motion, the respondents presented their case, and, \u201c[a]y, there\u2019s the rub.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b362-9\">In her brief and at oral argument, the commissioner relied on the \u201cwaiver rule.\u201d \u201cUnder this rule, when a trial court denies a defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict at the close of the plaintiffs case, the defendant, by opting to introduce evidence in his or her own behalf, waives the right to appeal the trial court\u2019s ruling. See <em>Dindo </em>v. <em>Grand Union Co., </em>331 F.2d 138, 141 (2d Cir. 1964); <em>State </em>v. <em>Rutan, </em>194 Conn. 438, 440, 479 A.2d 1209 (1984). The rationale for this rule is that, by introducing evidence, the defendant undertakes a risk that the testimony of defense witnesses will fill an evidentiary gap in the [plaintiffs] case. <em>State </em>v. <em>Rutan, </em>supra, 440. On appeal in such cases, the question becomes whether . . . there is evidence in <em>the entire record </em>to justify submitting the matter to a trier of fact. . . . <em>Warner </em>v. <em>Kewanee Machinery &amp; Conveyor Co., </em>411 F.2d 1060, 1063 (6th Cir. 1969), cert. denied, 398 U.S. 906, 90 S. Ct. 1685, 26 L. Ed. 2d 65 (1970); see also 9 J. Wigmore, Evidence (4th Ed. 1981) \u00a7 2496, pp. 402-403. Although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>we have questioned the continuing viability of the waiver rule in the criminal context; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Rutan, </em>supra, 441; we have never questioned its applicability in the civil context. Id.\u201d (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>241 Conn. 749, 756-57, 699 A.2d 81 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">The respondents have articulated no persuasive reason why the rationale underlying the waiver rule should not operate in this case.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We conclude, therefore, that the waiver rule precludes our review of the respondents\u2019 first claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">In their second claim, the respondents assert that the trial court improperly denied the respondent mother\u2019s motion to remove documents attached to the petition. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-9\">Further review of the trial court\u2019s factual findings and the procedural posture of this case is necessary for our analysis of this claim. The respondents argued to the trial court that attached to the petition were eleven police reports, four documents claiming to be certified voluntary statements and an unidentified and unsigned typed copy of a letter allegedly written by the respondent mother to the respondent father. The respondents claim that the inclusion of those documents \u201ccould impair the trial court\u2019s impartiality,\u201d \u201ccould taint future motions and proceedings\u201d and \u201cimpeded the respondents\u2019 rights to cross-examine upon and challenge the documents when submitted at trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b363-10\">Further, the respondents argue that the inclusion of the documents violated Practice Book \u00a7 10-1, formerly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>\u00a7 108, \u00a7 32-1, formerly \u00a7 1040.1 (1) and (2), and \u00a7 32-2, formerly \u00a7 1040.1 (3) and (4). Specifically, the respondents argue that \u00a7 10-1 \u201cexcludes the attachment of supporting evidence from pleadings,\u201d and that \u00a7\u00a7 32-1 and 32-2 limit attachments to a petition to \u201cstatutory references reflecting the specific conditions which resulted in the subject of the petition, a summary of facts and a summons.\u201d This claim, however, lacks merit. While there is no quarrel that \u00a7 10-1<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> states that the recitation of evidence is not appropriate in a pleading, it clearly does not exclude the attachment of exhibits. In fact, Practice Book \u00a7 10-29 (a), formerly \u00a7 141, provides in relevant part that \u201c[a]ny plaintiff desiring to make a copy of any document a part of the complaint may, without reciting it or annexing it, refer to it as Exhibit A, B, C, etc., as fully as if it had been set out at length; but in such case the plaintiff shall . . . file the original or a copy of such exhibit ... in court . . . .\u201d If the respondents\u2019 assertion is correct, it would make a nullity of \u00a7 10-29 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">Our conclusion finds support in those rules of practice governing procedure in juvenile matters in the family division of the Superior Court. Practice Book \u00a7 32-6, formerly \u00a7 1041.1 (1), requires the commissioner to provide supporting documents when seeking orders of temporary custody. See <em>Pamela B. </em>v. <em>Ment, </em>244 Conn. 296, 302-303, 709 A.2d 1089 (1998). Moreover, General Statutes \u00a7 46b-129 (b) requires that the commissioner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>file, in addition to the petition, verified affirmations of facts when seeking an order of temporary custody. Most of the challenged documents here were notarized, and the record demonstrates that the commissioner filed these documents to support an order of temporary custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">The respondents\u2019 further argue that \u201cthe [rules of practice do] not authorize attachment of numerous police reports with hearsay statements, alleged witness statements and other miscellaneous documents to petitions for the initiation of the judicial process in juvenile matters.\u201d This contention, however, is further undermined by the fact that many of the challenged documents were admitted at trial. Moreover, virtually all the information in the documents was contained in the department\u2019s social study and addendum to the social study, both of which were admitted as exhibits at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">The respondents have advanced absolutely no evidence to justify their contention that the trial court was \u201cno longer impartial\u201d as a result of having in its possession the challenged documents. It is axiomatic that the trial court is able to hear the testimony and to rely on only competent evidence in reaching its determination. Accordingly, we are satisfied, from our review of the record, that the trial court properly denied the motion to remove the documents from the petition.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">In their third claim, as part of their amended appeal, the respondents maintain that the trial court improperly denied their motion for a new trial<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and their motion to reconsider that denial. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">Nine months after the trial court\u2019s ruling terminating the respondents\u2019 parental rights, they asserted that newly discovered evidence necessitated a new trial. Specifically, the respondents claim that because during the criminal trial Brooks recanted the testimony that she gave in the termination proceeding,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> her testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>could not be relied on and, therefore, the case against the respondents in the termination case was suspect at best. Accordingly, the respondents claim that a new trial is warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">\u201c[O]ur standard of review of the trial court\u2019s denial of a motion for a new trial is limited to a determination of whether, by such denial, the court abused its discretion. <em>State </em>v. Rothenberg, 195 Conn. 253, 264, 487 A.2d 545 (1985). <em>State </em>v. <em>Leavitt, </em>8 Conn. App. 517, 524, 513 A.2d 744, cert. denied, 201 Conn. 810, 516 A.2d 886 (1986). As a reviewing court considering the trial court\u2019s decision granting or denying a motion for a new trial, we must be mindful of the trial judge\u2019s superior opportunity to assess the proceedings over which he or she has personally presided.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Munson </em>v. <em>United Technologies Corp., </em>28 Conn. App. 184, 194-95, 609 A.2d 1066 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">Moreover, \u201c[a] party is entitled to a new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence if such evidence is, in fact, newly discovered, will be material to the issue on a new trial, could not have been discovered and produced, on the trial which was had, by the exercise of due diligence, is not merely cumulative and is likely to produce a different result. . . . New trials are not granted upon newly discovered evidence which discredits a witness unless the evidence is so vital to the issues and so strong and convincing that a new trial would probably produce a different result. . . . The basic question which the trial court has to decide is whether upon all the evidence an injustice had been done. In deciding this question, the court has the exercise of a sound legal discretion, and its action cannot be disturbed unless this discretion has been abused.\u201d (Cita<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>tions omitted.) <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Scanlon, </em>146 Conn. 149, 163, 148 A.2d 334 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">The respondents postulate that Brooks\u2019 admission at the criminal trial of the misstatements that she had made before the juvenile court in the termination hearing demonstrated new evidence that they could not have discovered as a result of due diligence. The respondents\u2019 argument, however, is somewhat disingenuous in that Brooks\u2019 admission was the result of the vigorous investigation and cross-examination of her by the respondents\u2019 own defense counsel.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> This alleged new evidence could have been discovered before the trial by the same means and by the same diligence as it was discovered after the trial. The failure to discover the evidence before trial constitutes a lack of due diligence. See <em>Malaspina </em>v. <em>Itts, </em>3 Conn. Cir. Ct. 651, 655, 223 A.2d 54 (1966); see also <em>Hartford-Connecticut Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Putnam Phalanx, </em>138 Conn. 695, 699, 88 A.2d 393 (1952); <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>41 Conn. App. 515, 528-29, 677 A.2d 1 (1996), appeal dismissed, 240 Conn. 547, 692 A.2d 1231 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">The information that Brooks, in the criminal trial, admitted perjury, standing alone does not support a conclusion that it would produce a different result in a new termination proceeding. Moreover, the respondents did not offer any evidence that Brooks\u2019 testimony before the juvenile trial court was falsified. The court found: \u201cThe respondents have failed to demonstrate anything by a preponderance of the evidence since they offered no evidence whatsoever. For that reason alone, their motions should be denied.\u201d The court further found that, \u201cCarol Brooks did not appear in [this court] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>flying under false colors. The trial court was aware that [Brooks] had pending criminal charges against her .... She had a history of drug addiction, of obtaining controlled substances by fraud, that her own child had been removed from her by the [department] and that she had given several different stories to the police . . . that were at extreme variance to her testimony in court. She was not presented to the court as a tabernacle of virtue and veracity. Indeed, she was presented as a person with a great deal of personal emotional baggage. <em>Nonetheless, this court found her testimony plausible, consistent and supported by the independent testimony of numerous other witnesses and, other documentary evidence. </em>The respondents\u2019 account of how their child was taken from them while the two of them huddled for five minutes in the bathroom for a cigarette break is so implausible as to invite disbelief.\u201d (Emphasis added.) \u201cWhen you have excluded the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">Here, the respondents offered no evidence and made little effort to obtain the alleged newly discovered evidence. While the newly discovered evidence does tend to discredit Brooks\u2019 testimony, we are persuaded that the trial court properly concluded that the alleged new evidence would not have led to a different result. We conclude, therefore, that the respondents have failed to meet their burden to show that the trial court abused its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">The respondent father next claims that the trial court improperly denied him access to records concerning Brooks that were in the department\u2019s possession. Specifically, he claims that the department introduced Brooks\u2019 \u201cpropensity for child abuse and/or child neglect\u201d into the case in the first count .of the revised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>petition, which states that \u201c[t]he parents surrendered their son to a woman who is a convicted felon and substance abuse addict without any regard for the child\u2019s safety. . . . Brooks\u2019 biological child had previously been removed from her care and custody because of her inability [safely to parent the child].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">At the time the motion for disclosure of records was considered, the respondent father claimed that \u201cthis case is all about Brooks\u2019 lack of credibility,\u201d and that there was a \u201cconcern as to credibility and reliability, particularly [Brooks\u2019] ability to comprehend, know and correctly relate the truth of the [facts] that she asserts.\u201d In his motion, the respondent father argued that by virtue of rights accorded him under the federal and state constitutions, he should be given the records to enable him to prepare properly his defense and \u201cconfront his [accuser].\u201d Finally, he stated that information that demonstrates an accuser\u2019s inability to perceive and relate information correctly is exculpatory. On appeal, he claims that inasmuch as the revised petition appears to rely on information contained in these confidential records, any privilege, whether it is asserted on behalf of Brooks or on the department\u2019s own behalf, must fall.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">It is axiomatic that a party cannot submit a case to the trial court on one theory and then seek a reversal in the reviewing court on another. A party is not entitled to raise issues on appeal that have not been raised in the trial court.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> \u201c[B]ecause our review is limited to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>matters in the record, we will not address issues not decided by the trial court. Practice Book \u00a7 4185 [now \u00a7 60-5] (\u2018court on appeal shall not be bound to consider a claim unless it was distinctly raised at the trial\u2019); <em>Crest Pontiac Cadillac, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hadley, </em>239 Conn. 437, 444 n.10, 685 A.2d 670 (1996) (claims \u2018neither addressed nor decided\u2019 by court below are not properly before appellate tribunal); <em>State </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>186 Conn. 654, 658, 443 A.2d 906 (1982) (\u2018[o]nly in the most exceptional circumstances will this court consider even a constitutional claim not properly raised and decided in the trial court\u2019).\u201d <em>Willow Springs Condominium Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Seventh BRT Development Corp., </em>245 Conn. 1, 52, 717 A.2d 77 (1998). We decline, therefore, to review this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Finally, the respondents claim that the trial court improperly considered their choice to exercise their constitutional right to abort previous pregnancies as a collateral basis for finding abandonment. This claim, however, is proffered for the first time on appeal. Nowhere in the transcript of any proceeding or in any pleading do we find any indication, even remotely, that the court\u2019s alleged consideration of the respondents\u2019 prior family planning decisions implicated the respondent mother\u2019s right under <em>Roe </em>v. <em>Wade, </em>410 U.S. 113, 93 S. Ct. 705, 35 L. Ed. 2d 147 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">Appellate courts \u201cshall not be bound to consider a claim unless it was distinctly raised at the trial or arose subsequent to the trial. . . .\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 60-5; see <em>Willow Springs Condominium Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Seventh BRT Development Corp., </em>supra, 245 Conn. 52. Although the respondents have a fundamental constitutional right to retain their parent-child relationship, and this right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>can be severed only in strict compliance with statutory standards; <em>In re Baby Girl B., </em>224 Conn. 263, 279-81, 618 A.2d 1 (1992); appellate courts have regularly observed that \u00a7 60-5 \u201capplies to constitutional claims.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re Romance M., </em>229 Conn. 345, 352, 641 A.2d 378 (1994). Only in the most exceptional circumstances will an appellate court consider such a claim. <em>Berry </em>v. <em>Loiseau, </em>223 Conn. 786, 828-29, 614 A.2d 414 (1992); see <em>In re Michael </em>A., 47 Conn. App. 105, 110-11, 703 A.2d 1146 (1997). The respondents have pointed to no such exceptional circumstances in the present case. Accordingly, we decline to review the merits of this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b360-7\"> The respondent father (AC 17869) and the respondent mother (AC 18155) appealed separately from the judgment of the trial court. The appeals have been consolidated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b360-8\"> Specifically, the respondents\u2019 account of the events that transpired that evening indicates that at approximately 7 p.m. they went into the bathroom of their apartment to smoke cigarettes, since neither respondent smoked in the presence of the minor child.

Contrary to the respondents\u2019 account of the events that transpired that day, Brooks testified that the respondent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>father, with the acquiescence of the respondent mother, delivered the minor child to Brooks to watch for a short period while Petrovits effectuated a sale of the minor child.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b361-8\"> During the trial, the court dismissed a third allegation against the respondent father of no ongoing parent-child relationship.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b361-9\"> In 294, the Roman Emperor Diocletian stated that \u201cit was \u2018an evident principle of law\u2019 that parents could not sell, pawn, or give away their own offspring, nor could children be forced into servitude to pay their parents\u2019 debts.\u201d J.

Moreover, even if we were to assume impropriety, without so finding, the respondents have failed to point to any harm or prejudice. <em>State </em>v. <em>Berger, </em>249 Conn. 218, 230, 733 A.2d 156 (1999) (evidentiary rulings will be overturned on appeal only where trial court abused its discretion and substantial prejudice, or injustice is shown).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-9\">The respondent, mother acknowledges that she has the burden to point to a specific harm under <em>In re Soncheray H., </em>42 Conn. App. 664, 666, 680 A.2d 1363, cert. denied, 239 Conn. 940, 684 A.2d 712 (1996). In their brief, however, the respondents state that the \u201c[respondent mother] does not challenge a specific evidentiary ruling by the trial court.\u201d At oral argument <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>before this court, counsel stated that they \u201c[could not] point to a specific harm\u201d and that there is no way to determine the harm.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b366-9\"> The respondents filed a pleading titled \u201cRespondent-Parents\u2019 Petition for a New Trial.\u201d We note that a petition for a new trial is not the equivalent of a motion for a new trial. <em>State </em>v. <em>Goodwin, </em>3 Conn. Cir. Ct. 386, 388, 215 A.2d 913, cert. denied, 153 Conn. 725, 213 A.2d 525 (1965). A petition for a new trial, under General Statutes \u00a7 52-270, although ancillary to the original trial, is a new proceeding terminating in a judgment from which an appeal may be taken. <em>State </em>v. <em>Myers, </em>242 Conn. 125, 135, 698 A.2d 823 (1997). A motion for a new trial, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 16-35, is made within the confines of the docketed matter. See <em>Cadle Co. </em>v. <em>Ginsburg, </em>51 Conn. App. 392, 408-409 n.5, 721 A.2d 1246 (1998), cert. denied, 247 Conn. 963, 724 A.2d 1125 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-10\">Initially, we must determine whether the document at issue is a motion or a petition for a new trial. The respondents filed a petition for a new trial, dated August 28, 1998, on September 21, 1998, and an identical motion for a new trial, also dated August 28, 1998, on August 31, 1998. The trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision stated that the respondents filed the petition on August 28, 1998, and thereafter made reference to it as a \u201cmotion.\u201d The respondents, in their brief to this court, state that they \u201cpetitioned the trial court for a new trial,\u201d but proceed to cite to the motion for a new trial. Moreover, a review of the transcripts reveals that all parties considered the filing as a motion for a new trial, and the trial court heard the matter as a motion for a new trial. We will do likewise. See <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Marselle, </em>38 Conn. App. 360, 363-64, 660 A.2d 871 (1995), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 236 Conn. 845, 675 A.2d 835 (1996); <em>Crozier </em>v. <em>Zaboori, </em>14 Conn. App. 457, 463, 541 A.2d 531 (1988).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b366-11\"> On or about August 23, 1996, the state charged the respondent father with risk of injury to a child in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53-21 (1), conspiracy to commit risk of ipjury to a child in violation of General Statutes a \u00a7\u00a7 53a-48 (a) and 53-21 (1), intentionally making a false statement in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-157b (a), falsely reporting an incident in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-180 (a) and abandonment of a child under the age of six years in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53-23. The respondent mother was charged with conspiracy to commit risk of injury to a child and falsely reporting an incident. They were acquitted on those charges.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b368-8\"> The respondents also claim that they were frustrated in their efforts because they were denied access to the department\u2019s records. See part IV of this opinion. There is no indication that these records were made available to the respondents\u2019 criminal defense counsel, which leads one to conclude that their criminal defense counsel was able to uncover information that led to Brooks\u2019 impeachment without the department\u2019s records.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b369-9\"> A. Doyle, The Adventure of the Beryl Coronet, in Complete Adventures and Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes (Bramhall House 1975), p. 154.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b370-8\"> Even if we were to review this claim, we would conclude that it lacks merit. General Statutes \u00a7 17a-28 permits court-ordered disclosure only when a parent, child or legal representative of either has been denied access to personal records. While such confidentiality may not be unconditional; <em>State </em>v. Kulmac, 230 Conn. 43, 57, 644 A.2d 887 (1994); even a defendant in a criminal case is not entitled to absolute access to department files, but can request access only if the court, after an in-camera review, determines that the file contains exculpatory data. See id., 58-59; <em>State </em>v. Storlazzi, 191 Conn. 453, 459, 464 A.2d 829 (1983); see also <em>Pennsylvania </em>v. <em>Ritchie, </em>480 U.S. 39, 60, 107 S. Ct. 989, 94 L. Ed. 2d 40 (1987). We have recognized the state\u2019s compelling interest, as well as statutory basis, for maintaining both mental health and substance abuse records. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Storlazzi, </em>supra, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>458; General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 52446c, 52-146d; see also 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 290dd-2; 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.1 et seq.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
