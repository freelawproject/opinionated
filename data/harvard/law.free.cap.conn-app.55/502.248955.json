On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court improperly (1) denied his motions for a mistrial that were based on the existence of egregious prosecutorial misconduct, (2) adopted a curative instruction that was insufficient to cure the prejudice caused by the misconduct, (3) denied his motion to set aside the verdict on the basis of juror misconduct and (4) admitted evidence of uncharged misconduct. We agree with the defendant and reverse the judgment of the trial court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">The record discloses the following information that is relevant to the resolution of this appeal. On March 21, 1994, Officer William Coppola of the New Haven police department was dispatched to 305 Exchange <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>Street, where he discovered the body of the victim, Amenophis Morris. The victim had sustained fatal gunshot wounds. At the defendant\u2019s trial, Jeffrey Dolphin testified for the state concerning the circumstances surrounding the murder. Dolphin testified that on March 21, 1994, Terrance Stevenson forced him at gunpoint into a motor vehicle driven by James Baker. Jermaine Harris and the defendant were passengers in Baker\u2019s vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">Dolphin testified that when Baker was driving on Exchange Street, one of the vehicle\u2019s occupants noticed the victim standing on the front porch of 305 Exchange Street. Baker then parked the vehicle farther down the block. Dolphin testified that Stevenson and Harris exited the vehicle and walked toward the victim. Baker and the defendant then exited the vehicle and waited near the front of the car. Dolphin testified that shortly after he heard six or seven gunshots, Harris, Baker, Stevenson and the defendant returned to the vehicle, and either Harris or Stevenson stated, \u201cI got the mother ... I got the asshole.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">Dolphin did not immediately contact the police. On April 22,1994, the police arrested Dolphin on unrelated narcotics charges, and he provided information about the murder. The police subsequently arrested Harris, Stevenson, Baker and the defendant, and charged them with murder as accessories and conspiracy to commit murder. Dolphin testified at the trials of Baker and Stevenson, which preceded the defendant\u2019s trial, and Baker and Stevenson were convicted on both charges. In the present case, the jury found the defendant guilty of murder as an accessory and conspiring to commit murder. He received a total effective sentence of forty-five years imprisonment. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">The defendant claims that the trial court improperly denied his motions for a mistrial, which he based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>the existence of egregious prosecutorial misconduct that deprived him of his due process right to a fair trial in violation of the federal constitution. After careful examination of the specific circumstances in this case, we agree with the defendant.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">The following additional facts are relevant to a resolution of this issue. The defendant was charged with accessory to murder and conspiring to commit murder. At trial, the prosecutor claimed that the defendant aided and abetted Baker, Harris and Stevenson in murdering the victim, and conspired with them to commit the murder. In its appellate brief, the state concedes that the jury was informed that the trials of Baker and Stevenson had preceded the defendant\u2019s trial and that Dolphin had testified in those trials.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">In closing argument to the jury, defense counsel stated: \u201c[0]ne of the most difficult parts about [this case] has been tracking all of the inconsistencies of the state\u2019s witness, Mr. Dolphin. The witness for the state, Jeffrey Dolphin, has lied to you, ladies and gentleman. He has lied to the police, he has lied to other juries, he has lied to you as members of this jury. He has lied to an officer of the court, attorney [Leo] Ahem. But don\u2019t take my word for it, just look at his testimony . . . .\u201d The prosecutor neither objected to this statement when it was made, nor did he object at the conclusion of defense counsel\u2019s closing argument, nor did he request a curative instruction or some other remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>Instead, in rebuttal, the prosecutor stated: \u201c[T]he other thing [defense counsel] said to you\u2014I do not want you to be left with the wrong impression\u2014he said that [Dolphin] has lied to other juries. <em>Well, let me tell you, ladies and gentlemen, I wish I could tell you what other juries decided, but I am not allowed to. </em>\u201d (Emphasis added.) At the conclusion of the prosecutor\u2019s rebuttal, after the court had excused the jury, defense counsel orally moved for a mistrial.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court stated: \u201cThat is absolutely some of the most impermissible argument I have heard. ... I am so upset about this, and I am going to think about it during the lunch hour, but you might think about what I might send to the New York District Attorney.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> After the lunch recess, defense counsel filed a written motion for dismissal, mistrial, surrebuttai time or a corrective instruction. The prosecutor claimed that his statement was invited by defense counsel and that he was merely attempting to counteract defense counsel\u2019s assertion that Dolphin had lied to other juries. Defense counsel responded that his statement merely referred to the inconsistencies in Dolphin\u2019s testimony in this trial and the two previous trials. The court agreed with defense counsel. Despite stating that the prosecutor\u2019s comment was prejudicial, improper and unprofessional, the court denied the defendant\u2019s motions for dismissal and a mistrial, but granted the request for a curative instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>The following principles govern our review of the defendant\u2019s claim. It is well recognized that the state\u2019s attorney \u201cis not only an officer of the court, like every attorney, but is also a high public officer, representing the people of the State, who seek impartial justice for the guilty as much as for the innocent. In discharging his most important duties, he deserves and receives in peculiar degree the support of the court and the respect of the citizens of the county. By reason of his office, he usually exercises great influence upon jurors. His conduct and language in the trial of cases in which human life or liberty are at stake should be forceful, but fair, because he represents the public interest, which demands no victim and asks no conviction through the aid of passion, prejudice, or resentment. If the accused be guilty, he should none the less be convicted only after a fair trial, conducted strictly according to the sound and well-established rules which the laws prescribe. While the privilege of counsel in addressing the jury should not be too closely narrowed or unduly hampered, it must never be used as a license to state, or to comment upon, or to suggest an inference from, facts not in evidence, or to present matters which the jury have no right to consider.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ferrone, 96 </em>Conn. 160, 168-69, 113 A. 452 (1921).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">\u201cThe general rule in Connecticut is that a mistrial is granted only where it is apparent to the court that as a result of some occurrence during trial a party has been deprived of the opportunity for a fair trial. <em>State </em>v. <em>DeMatteo, </em>186 Conn. 696, 703, 443 A.2d 915 (1982); <em>State </em>v. <em>Gooch, </em>186 Conn. 17, 25, 438 A.2d 867 (1982); <em>State v. Turcio, </em>178 Conn. 116, 143, 422 A.2d 749 (1979), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 1013, 100 S. Ct. 661, 62 L. Ed. 2d 642 (1980) .... When a mistrial is sought on the ground that a prosecutor\u2019s improper remarks violated the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to due process of law the same standard applies. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Cosgrove, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>186 Conn. 476, 488-89, 442 A.2d 1320 (1982); <em>State </em>v. <em>Hawthorne, </em>176 Conn. 367, 372, 407 A.2d 1001 (1978). The burden on the defendant is to show that the prosecutor\u2019s remarks were prejudicial in light of the entire proceeding. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Cosgrove, </em>supra, 488-89; <em>State </em>v. <em>Hawthorne, </em>supra, 372; <em>State </em>v. <em>Kinsey, </em>173 Conn. 344, 348-49, 377 A.2d 1095 (1977). The fairness of the trial and not the culpability of the prosecutor is the standard for analyzing the constitutional due process claims of criminal defendants alleging prosecutorial misconduct. <em>State </em>v. <em>Cosgrove, </em>supra, 488-89, citing <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Phillips, </em>455 U.S. 209, 219, 102 S. Ct. 940, 71 L. Ed. 2d 78 (1982).\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ubaldi, </em>190 Conn. 559, 562, 462 A.2d 1001, cert. denied, 464 U.S. 916, 104 S. Ct. 280, 78 L. Ed. 2d 259 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">\u201c[A] state\u2019s attorney should scrupulously avoid questions of probable impropriety . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Piskorski, </em>177 Conn. 677, 719, 419 A.2d 866, cert. denied, 444 U.S. 935, 100 S. Ct. 283, 62 L. Ed. 2d 194 (1979). \u201c \u2018A demonstrated deliberate effort by a prosecutor to influence the jury against the defendant through the attempted introduction of obviously inadmissible evidence may entitle the defendant to a new trial. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Woods, </em>486 F.2d 172 (8th Cir. [1973]); <em>State </em>v. <em>Hafner, </em>168 Conn. 230, 249, 362 A.2d 925, cert. denied, 423 U.S. 851, 96 S. Ct. 95, 46 L. Ed. 2d 74 [1975].\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>182 Conn. 52, 58, 437 A.2d 843 (1980). While the absence of bad faith by a prosecutor is to be accorded considerable weight in a given case, that, however, is not to say that a showing of good faith by the prosecutor is \u2018determinative.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Hafner, </em>[supra, 249]. Indeed, it is \u2018well established that serious prosecutorial misconduct, regardless of the prosecutor\u2019s intentions, may so pollute a criminal prosecution as to require a new trial, even without regard to the prejudice to the defendant.\u2019 [Id.], 251. Crucial considerations in appellate adjudication of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>such questions are not only the need, where demonstrated, to discipline prosecutors where reprehensible conduct is present but to assure ultimate fairness to the defendant. [Id.], 252; see <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Phillips, </em>[supra, 455 U.S. 219].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Binet, </em>192 Conn. 618, 629, 473 A.2d 1200 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">\u201cProsecutorial misconduct may also occur in the course of closing argument. <em>State </em>v. <em>Pelletier, </em>[196 Conn. 32, 33-34, 490 A.2d 515 (1985)]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Couture, </em>194 Conn. 530, 482 A.2d 300 (1984), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 1192, 105 S. Ct. 967, 83 L. Ed. 2d 971 (1985). Such argument may be, in light of all of the facts and circumstances, so egregious that no curative instruction could reasonably be expected to remove [its] prejudicial impact. <em>State </em>v. <em>Fullwood, </em>194 Conn. 573, 585, 484 A.2d 435 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">\u201cThe defendant claims that the prosecutorial misconduct in this case was so egregious that it deprived him of his constitutional right to a fair trial under the due process clause of . . . [the] federal [constitution]. In analyzing the defendant\u2019s claim, we ask whether the prosecutor\u2019s conduct so infected the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process. <em>Darden </em>v. <em>Wainwright, </em>477 U.S. 168, 181, 106 S. Ct. 2464, 91 L. Ed. 2d 144 (1986), quoting <em>Donnelly </em>v. <em>DeChristoforo, </em>416 U.S. 637, 94 S. Ct. 1868, 40 L. Ed. 2d 431 (1974); <em>State </em>v. <em>Hawthorne, </em>[supra, 176 Conn. 372], We do not focus alone, however, on the conduct of the prosecutor.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>204 Conn. 523, 539, 529 A.2d 653 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">\u201cIn determining whether prosecutorial misconduct was so serious as to amount to a denial of due process, this court, in conformity wit h courts in other jurisdictions, has focused on several factors. Among them are the extent to which the misconduct was invited by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>defense conduct or argument; <em>State </em>v. <em>Fullwood, </em>supra [194 Conn. 585]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Falcone, </em>191 Conn. 12, 23, 463 A.2d 558 (1983); the severity of the misconduct; see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Modica, </em>663 F.2d 1173, 1181 (2d Cir. 1981) [cert. denied, 456 U.S. 989, 102 S. Ct. 2269, 73 L. Ed. 2d 1284 (1982)]; the frequency of the misconduct; <em>State </em>v. <em>Couture, </em>supra, [194 Conn.] 562-63; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Doehrer, </em>[200 Conn. 642, 654, 513 A.2d 58 (1986)]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>[196 Conn. 157, 163, 491 A.2d 1075 (1985)]; the centrality of the misconduct to the critical issues in the case; <em>Hawthorne </em>v. <em>United States, </em>476 A.2d 164, 172 (D.C. App. 1984); the strength of the curative measures adopted; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Modica, </em>supra [1181]; <em>Harris </em>v. <em>United States, </em>402 F.2d 656, 657 n.1 (D.C. Cir. 1968); <em>State </em>v. <em>Doehrer, </em>supra [654]; and the strength of the state\u2019s case. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Modica, </em>supra [ 1181 ]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Couture, </em>supra, 564; <em>State </em>v. <em>Glenn, </em>[194 Conn. 483, 492, 481 A.2d 741 (1984)].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 204 Conn. 540.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">We must first determine whether the prosecutor\u2019s statement was improper. The jury was aware that the state had charged Baker, Stevenson, Harris and the defendant as accessories and coconspirators in the same murder, and that the trials for Baker and Stevenson had preceded the defendant\u2019s trial. On several occasions, the court instructed the parties to refrain from mentioning the outcome of those prior proceedings. The court properly determined that when viewed in this context, the prosecutor\u2019s comment informed the jury that the state\u2019s chief witness had testified in the previous trials and that juries had convicted both Baker and Stevenson of the same crimes with which the defendant was charged. The court stated that the prosecutor\u2019s comment was deliberate, improper, prejudicial and unprofessional.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">\u201c[A] defendant is entitled to have the question of his guilt determined upon the evidence against him, not on whether a codefendant or government witness has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>convicted of the same charge.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Miranda, </em>593 F.2d 590, 594 (5th Cir. 1979). \u201cGenerally, the guilty plea or conviction of a co-defendant or co-conspirator is not admissible at trial, and such guilty pleas and convictions are never admissible as substantive evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Blandford, </em>33 F.3d 685, 709 (6th Cir. 1994), cert. denied, [514 U.S. 1095], 115 S. Ct. 1821, 131 L. Ed. 2d 743 (1995). However, guilty pleas and convictions may be introduced into evidence if the co-conspirator or co-defendant testifies at trial, so that the factfinder will have appropriate facts on hand to assess the witness\u2019s credibility. Id. . . . Convictions and guilty pleas generally are not admissible for credibility purposes if the co-conspirator or co-defendant does not testify, and convictions and guilty pleas of co-conspirators or co-defendants other than the witness are not admissible to attack or bolster the witness\u2019s credibility. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Austin, </em>786 F.2d 986, 992 (10th Cir. 1986)....\" (Citation omitted.) <em>United States </em>v. <em>Sanders, </em>95 F.3d 449, 454 (6th Cir. 1996); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Just, </em>185 Conn. 339, 343-48, 441 A.2d 98 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">In the present case, neither Baker nor Stevenson testified at the defendant\u2019s trial, and the prosecutor did not offer the challenged statement to impeach the credibility of either Baker or Stevenson. The state neither claims, nor does the record disclose, any legitimate justification for informing the jury of the outcomes of the Baker and Stevenson trials. Accordingly, the prosecutor\u2019s comment was improper. We must, therefore, next determine whether the prosecutor\u2019s misconduct, viewed in the context of the entire trial, deprived the defendant of his due process right to a fair trial. As previously stated, we focus on six factors in determining whether prosecutorial misconduct was so serious as to amount to a denial of due process. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 204 Conn. 540.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>First, the state claims that the prosecutor\u2019s reference to the outcome of the Baker and Stevenson trials was invited by defense counsel.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It claims that the prosecutor made this statement to counteract the prejudicial impact of defense counsel\u2019s assertion that Dolphin had lied to other juries. The state\u2019s argument presupposes, however, that defense counsel\u2019s comment was improper. Although the state claims that defense counsel\u2019s statement was improper, the prosecutor neither objected at the time the statement was made, nor did he object at the conclusion of defense counsel\u2019s closing argument, nor did he request a curative instruction or some other remedy. The court concluded that defense counsel\u2019s statement was permissible because it referred to the inaccuracies defense counsel had pointed out in Dolphin\u2019s testimony. At trial, defense counsel attempted to impeach Dolphin\u2019s credibility by pointing out inconsistencies in his testimony. Defense counsel claimed that his statement that Dolphin had lied to other juries merely referred to these testimonial inconsistencies, and the court agreed.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Additionally, unlike the prosecutor\u2019s statement, defense counsel\u2019s comment did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>directly or indirectly disclose the outcomes of the prior trials.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">Second, several factors establish the severe nature of the prosecutor\u2019s misconduct. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit has stated: \u201cIt is a well-accepted principle that \u2018evidence about the conviction of a co-conspirator is not admissible as substantive proof of the guilt of a defendant.\u2019 <em>United States </em>v. <em>Leach, </em>918 F.2d 464, 467 (5th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, [501 U.S. 1207], 111 S. Ct. 2802, 115 L. Ed. 2d 976 (1991). In criminal cases, it is the province of the defendant\u2019s jury to resolve questions of credibility; referring to what another jury may have done is clearly improper because the defendant\u2019s jury cannot permissibly rely on what they may assume a previous jury to have found. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Samad, </em>754 F.2d 1091, 1100 (4th Cir. 1984) (observing that a prosecutor may not argue evidence not presented to the jury). Such conduct \u2018raises the concern that a defendant might be convicted based upon the disposition of the charges against the [co-conspirator], rather than upon an individual assessment of the remaining defendant\u2019s personal culpability.\u2019. . . Indeed, improper use of a co-conspirator\u2019s conviction infringes on the principle that the \u2018central purpose of a criminal trial is to decide the factual question of the defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence.\u2019 <em>Delaware </em>v. <em>[Van Arsdall], </em>475 U.S. 673, 681, 106 S. Ct. 1431, 1436, 89 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1986).\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>1 F.3d 235, 240 (4th Cir. 1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">Furthermore, \u201c[a] demonstrated deliberate effort by a prosecutor to influence the jury against the defendant through the attempted introduction of obviously inadmissible evidence may entitle the defendant to a new trial.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Binet, </em>supra, 192 Conn. 629. The prosecutor\u2019s misconduct constituted a wilful violation of an order of the trial court and a deliberate attempt to improperly influence the jury. In its instruction to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>jury, the trial court stated that the prosecutor\u2019s comment constituted \u201ca deliberate attempt to mislead you to consider matters not for your consideration and that it was a distortion of the truth in fact. . . . The fact is that [the prosecutor] has had a copy of that charge and heard me numerous times during the trial on a specific theme to disregard these matters throughout the trial.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">Third, we consider the frequency of the prosecutor\u2019s misconduct. Other than the blatantly egregious comment the prosecutor made during rebuttal, the record discloses that he did not make any additional references to the outcome of the Baker and Stevenson trials. The prosecutor\u2019s improper reference to the outcome of those trials did not, however, constitute his only act of misconduct. The court strongly admonished the prosecutor for engaging in improper communication with a witness during the course of the trial.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>Fourth, in considering the centrality of the misconduct to the critical issues of the case, we conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s misconduct went to the very heart of this case. In closing argument, the prosecutor repeatedly emphasized that the outcome of this case turned on the credibility of witnesses.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Dolphin was the state\u2019s most important witness, and the prosecutor\u2019s misconduct improperly bolstered Dolphin\u2019s credibility by informing the jury that the state already had convicted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>Baker and Stevenson based in part on Dolphin\u2019s testimony. The \u201cgovernment\u2019s attempt to bolster the credibility of government witnesses by saying their previous testimony resulted in convictions of other defendants [is] improper\u201d; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>900 F.2d 779, 781 (4th Cir. 1990); and \u201cconvictions and guilty pleas of co-conspirators or co-defendants other than the witness are not admissible to attack or bolster the witness\u2019s credibility.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Sanders, </em>supra, 95 F.3d 454. Moreover, where, as here, a defendant is charged with conspiring with others to commit murder, the introduction of evidence of coconspirator convictions as substantive proof of the defendant\u2019s guilt is central to this ultimate determination. \u201cSuch conduct raises the concern that a defendant might be convicted based upon the disposition of the charges against the [co-conspirator], rather than upon an individual assessment of the . . . defendant\u2019s personal culpability. . . . Indeed, improper use of a co-conspirator\u2019s conviction infringes on the principle that the central purpose of a criminal trial is to decide the factual question of the defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>supra, 1 F.3d 240.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">Fifth, we consider the strength of the state\u2019s case. The state neither cites, nor can we discern from the record, any physical evidence tying the defendant to the murder. Dolphin was the only witness the state produced who directly connected the defendant to the murder, and in his closing argument, the prosecutor conceded that defense counsel had pointed out several inconsistencies in Dolphin\u2019s testimony.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Dolphin\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>credibility was pivotal to the outcome of this case and, as we have already stated, the prosecutor improperly bolstered Dolphin\u2019s credibility by informing the jury that he had testified in the two previous trials and that both Baker and Stevenson had been convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">Finally, we consider the strength of the curative measures adopted by the court. The court granted defense counsel\u2019s request for a curative instruction and instructed the jury to disregard the prosecutor\u2019s comment.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Several courts have recommended that reviewing courts should scrutinize more closely the purported remedial effect of a curative instruction in cases where a prosecutor has improperly disclosed a coconspirator\u2019s guilty plea. See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Kroh, </em>915 F.2d 326, 336-37 (8th Cir. 1990) (en banc) (Lay, C. J., dissenting); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gullo, </em>502 F.2d 759, 761 (3d Cir. 1974). The reasoning underlying this recommendation extends to cases involving the improper disclosure of a coconspirator\u2019s conviction. Although we generally accord deference to a trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>court\u2019s efforts to eliminate prejudice through a curative instruction, in certain circumstances we have concluded that no curative instruction reasonably could have been expected to remove the prejudicial impact of prosecutorial misconduct. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Binet, </em>supra, 192 Conn. 632-34; <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>41 Conn. App. 180, 190-91, 674 A.2d 1372, cert. denied, 237 Conn. 925, 677 A.2d 950 (1996). \u201c[A] curative instruction is not inevitably sufficient to overcome the prejudicial impact of inadmissible evidence. See also <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Denno, </em>378 U.S. 368, 84 S. Ct. 1774, 12 L. Ed. 2d 908 (1964). One court, observing that a cautionary instruction does not always remove the prejudice involved, has aptly stated: It must be remembered that after the saber thrust, the withdrawal of the saber still leaves the wound. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Rudolph, </em>403 F.2d 805, 807 (6th Cir. 1968).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Binet, </em>supra, 633.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In the present case, the trial court itself questioned whether a curative instruction adequately could remove the prejudice caused by the misconduct.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>After careful examination of each of those six factors in light of the specific circumstances of this case and despite the trial court\u2019s use of a curative instruction; see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Miranda, </em>supra, 593 F.2d 595-96 (doubtful that any curative instruction could have erased prejudice from minds of jurors resulting from improper disclosure of coconspirator\u2019s conviction); we conclude on the basis of the severity of the misconduct, its centrality to the critical issues in the case and the weakness of the state\u2019s case, that the prosecutor\u2019s misconduct deprived the defendant of his due process right to a fair trial. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Austin, </em>supra, 786 F.2d 991-92 (prosecutor\u2019s improper disclosure of coconspirators\u2019 convictions constituted reversible error); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Miranda, </em>supra, 595-96 (same).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> When prosecutorial misconduct has deprived a defendant of a fair trial, a new trial is warranted. <em>State </em>v. <em>Binet, </em>supra, 192 Conn. 634; <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 41 Conn. App. 191.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">In this opinion LANDAU, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b525-9\"> Because we agree with the defendant\u2019s first claim, we find it unnecessary to address his remaining claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b527-8\"> The defendant neither invokes our state\u2019s constitution nor provides an independent analysis of his claim pursuant to the state constitution.

Because we conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s misconduct deprived the defendant of his due process right to a fair trial, we need not reach his claims that reversal of the judgment is warranted pursuant to our supervisory powers and that the misconduct unconstitutionally burdened the exercise of his constitutional right of confrontation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b528-6\"> Defense counsel claimed that \u201ca corrective instruction in no way could possibly repair the irreparable harm done by [the prosecutor\u2019s] comment We feel that. . .

We respectfully request that for that reason also, the fact that any type of curative instruction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>you ini end to give would draw attention to it means that only solution is a mistrial.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b541-10\"> In reaching this conclusion, we also reject, the state\u2019s alternative ground for affirming the judgment. Pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 63-4 (a) (1), the state claimed that the court properly denied the defendant\u2019s motions for a mistrial because the prosecutor\u2019s comment disclosing the outcome of the Baker and Stevenson trials was justified pursuant to the \u201cinvited response\u201d doctrine.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b541-8\">FOTI, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ag7-dedup-0\">dissenting. I respectfully dissent. The primary issue in this appeal is whether the trial court properly denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial on the ground of prosecutorial misconduct. The defendant ar gues that the remarks made by the prosecutor were so prejudicial as to deprive him of a fair trial and violated his right to due process, in spite of the court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>emphatic curative instruction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Alternatively, he claims that even if he was not denied a fair trial, we should exercise our supervisory authority to grant him a new trial. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Pouncey, </em>241 Conn. 802, 808, 699 A.2d 901 (1997) (court has supervisory power to order new trial to deter prosecutorial misconduct that is \u201c \u2018unduly offensive to the maintenance of a sound judicial process\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">As a preliminary matter, let me state that the prosecutor\u2019s remarks were clearly improper and perhaps worthy of sanction. I also conclude, however, that defense counsel\u2019s earlier remark that \u201c[Jeffrey Dolphin] has lied to other juries,\u201d made during final argument, also was improper. As a result, I view the prosecutor\u2019s misconduct as having been invited by the defendant\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">The defendant argues that his comment was not improper because on cross-examination of Dolphin, defense counsel elicited certain inconsistencies in prior statements and prior testimony in other cases.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> My review of the record discloses that Dolphin never admitted lying in other cases or at any other time. The purpose of the cross-examination was to allow the defendant to argue to the jury that Dolphin was not credible in his current testimony because of prior inconsistencies. In remarking in final argument that Dolphin had lied to other juries, however, the defendant was inviting the jury to speculate that other juries had disbelieved his testimony and, therefore, had acquitted the codefen-dants, James Baker and Terrance Stevenson.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>In final closing argument, the prosecutor replied, \u201cI do not want you to be left with the wrong impression\u2014 [defense counsel] said that [Dolphin] has lied to other juries. Well, let me tell you, ladies and gentlemen, I wish I could tell you what other juries decided, but I am not allowed to.\u201d The obvious meaning of that remark was that \u201cdefense counsel implied that other juries had acquitted Baker and Stevenson, and I am implying otherwise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">Closing argument by both sides should be based on the evidence presented during trial. There was no evidence presented concerning the verdicts in other cases, which evidence would have been totally improper. Given the circumstances of this case combined with the very strong curative instruction given by the court; see footnote 11 of the majority opinion; I would not reverse this conviction.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> There was no due process violation and the defendant was not deprived of a fair trial. I would, therefore, affirm the judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b542-6\"> The court also offered defense counsel the opportunity for surrebuttal argument to the jury. The offer was withdrawn when defense counsel proffered that he would, if given that chance, argue that the jury should adopt a negative inference from the prosecutor\u2019s remarks, i.e., that the remarks were motivated by a bad case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b542-7\"> In using the trial transcripts, the defendant brought forward inconsistencies in the testimony given at the trials of James Baker and Terrance Stevenson. Some of the testimony, however, was consistent with Dolphin\u2019s direct testimony in this matter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b543-7\"> In fact, courts in other jurisdictions have found that the introduction of evidence of a codefendant\u2019s conviction was not per se prejudicial, especially if the introduction was in some way invited by defense counsel; see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Casto, </em>889 F.2d 562, 567 (5th Cir. 1989), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 1092, 110 S.
