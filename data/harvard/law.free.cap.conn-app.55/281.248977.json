We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">From the evidence, the jury reasonably could have found that in March, 1993, the defendant, accompanied by four masked men, approached Alex Santana and asked him where to find his cousin, George Flores. When Santana replied that he had not seen Flores, the defendant punched Santana in the face, causing him to be thrown against a store window. The owner of the store came outside and the defendant and his companions departed.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">On May 5, 1993, at approximately 11 p.m., the defendant agreed to pay Ronaldo Rivera $40 if he would steal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>a large, fast, four door automobile and deliver it to the defendant. Rivera found such a vehicle on Frank Street in New Haven and, with the help of a friend, stole a four door Buick and brought the car to the defendant and another man on Ward Street at approximately 2 a.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">Santana had been riding that night in the car of his friend, Butch Console, with three other persons, Marilyn Torres, Melissa Dawson and Dimiris Vega. When the car stopped on Button Street, the occupants got out. As they were standing by the car, a man approached and offered to paint Console\u2019s initials on the driver\u2019s door. Console agreed and then stood next to a red station wagon parked on the opposite side of the street. Meanwhile, his friends stood on the street side of Console\u2019s car watching the man paint. Console noticed a car approaching slowly on Button Street. He saw what he first thought were firecrackers coming from the rear seat of the car. When he realized it was gunfire, Console ran around the front of the station wagon to the sidewalk and knelt to avoid the bullets. The approaching car was the stolen Buick and contained the defendant and three companions. Gunfire erupted from the area of the rear seat of the Buick. One bullet hit Santana in the stomach, resulting in his hospitalization. Another bullet struck Torres in the back, causing her death. The evidence indicated that at least five shots were fired from close range.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">A few minutes later, the defendant and his companions crashed the Buick on Howard Avenue and abandoned it with the motor running, the rear door open, a bullet casing on the floor behind the driver\u2019s seat, and a sheet covering the rear seat wet with blood. The rear window had been blown out. A second shell was found on the roof of the car, and a third was found on Button Street at the shooting scene. The defendant went to the Hospital of St. Raphael (hospital) at 2:49 a.m. to seek treatment for a gunshot wound. He spoke with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>New Haven police officer at 3:05 a.m. He gave a statement to Sergeant Diane Langston declaring that he and his friend had been accosted and shot on the street in an attempted robbeiy by two masked men. The defendant stated that he and his friend then ran directly to the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">A ballistics expert testified that the bullet obtained from Torres\u2019 body matched the .45 caliber shell casing found on the floor of the Buick. The other casings found on the roof of the Buick and on Button Street came from a nine millimeter gun. A fingerprint expert identified fingerprints found on the interior of the driver\u2019s door as those of the defendant. Experts from the state forensic laboratory testified that the blood on the sheet covering the backseat was consistent with the defendant\u2019s blood type.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">The jury convicted the defendant as charged on all counts. This appeal followed. Additional facts will be set forth where necessary to a resolution of the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">The defendant first claims that the evidence presented was insufficient to support the jury\u2019s verdict. Specifically, the defendant claims that the evidence presented proves nothing more than that he was in the Buick with three companions when the shots were fired that injured Santana and killed Torres.3 *<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">\u201cIn reviewing a sufficiency claim, we apply a two part test. First, we construe the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict. Second, we determine whether upon the facts so construed and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom the jury reasonably could have concluded that the cumulative force of the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Traficonda, </em>223 Conn. 273, 278, 612 A.2d 45 (1992).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. Greenfield, 228 Conn. 62, 76, 634 A.2d 879 (1993). In the present case, we agree that the defendant\u2019s mere presence in the car with his companions would not, by itself, prove that he was a party to a conspiracy or that he was involved in the crimes that occurred. The evidence indicates, however, that the defendant\u2019s involvement went far beyond a mere presence at the scene of the crimes. More than one month before the crimes, the defendant punched Santana in the face when he failed to disclose the whereabouts of his cousin in response to the defendant\u2019s inquiry. That incident provides a basis to infer hostility toward Santana on the part of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">Additionally, on the night of the crimes, it was the defendant who paid Rivera to steal the car used in the shooting. The defendant\u2019s fingerprints were found on the interior of the car door on the driver\u2019s side. Moreover, the blood on the sheet covering the backseat of the Buick matched the defendant\u2019s blood type, indicating that he was sitting there during the shooting and either wounded himself or was injured by a companion when the shots were fired from the backseat. The defendant visited the hospital within one-half hour of the shooting to seek treatment for a gunshot wound to his arm. While he claimed that he had been injured during an attempted robbery by two masked men, that explanation never was corroborated by other evidence. Indeed, an investigation of the alleged location of the reported attempted robbery uncovered no shell casings, blood drops or other physical evidence to support the defendant\u2019s account of the attempted robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>Finally, when Rivera\u2019s testimony about being hired by the defendant to steal the car that was used in the shooting is considered along with the subsequent events that occurred that night, the requirement of an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy is satisfied. General Statutes \u00a7 53a-48.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus, after reviewing the evidence presented at trial and construing it in the light most favorable to sustaining the conviction, we conclude that there was sufficient evidence from which the jury reasonably could have convicted the defendant on all the charges beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">The defendant next claims that he was denied the right to confront his accusers. This claim, despite its constitutional implications, is based on the admission into evidence of hospital records relating to the defendant\u2019s visit to the hospital for treatment of the gunshot wound that he claimed to have received in the attempted robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">The following additional facts are necessary for our resolution of this claim. The hospital records indicated that the defendant was admitted at 2:49 a.m. on the morning of the crimes. Sergeant Langston had previously testified that she had taken a statement from the defendant at the hospital shortly after 2:05 a.m. Because the state claimed that the shooting occurred at 2:20 a.m., Langston\u2019s testimony would have provided the defendant with an alibi if it were correct. The state called Langston to testify once again after the introduction of the hospital records. It also introduced into evidence, over the defendant\u2019s objection, two previously undisclosed statements by Langston, both of which indicated that she had not been dispatched to the hospital until 2:48 a.m. She testified that her earlier testimony was a result of \u201chuman error.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>The defendant\u2019s only objection at trial to the admission of the hospital records was that, because this was a criminal case, the court should exercise its discretion and require the custodian of the records at the hospital to testify and be available for cross-examination. The trial court overruled the objection and admitted the records pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 4-104,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> which allows hospital records, \u201cif not otherwise inadmissible,\u201d to be admitted into evidence without any preliminary testimony when there is attached thereto a certification in affidavit form of the person in charge of the hospital record room or his assistant. The defendant does not claim that the requirements of \u00a7 4-104 for admission of the records were not satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">On appeal the defendant claims that the admission of the hospital records without supporting testimony violated his \u201cright to be confronted with the witnesses against him,\u201d as provided by the sixth amendment to our federal constitution.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In advancing this claim,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>relies on <em>Ohio </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>448 U.S. 56, 65, 100 S. Ct. 2531, 65 L. Ed. 2d 597 (1980), in which that provision was construed to require the prosecution, before introducing prior testimony from a court proceeding in which the defendant was a party, to \u201ceither produce, or demonstrate the unavailability of, the declarant whose statement it wishes to use against the defendant.\u201d In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Inadi, </em>475 U.S. 387, 394, 106 S. Ct. 1121, 89 L. Ed. 2d 390 (1986), however, <em>Roberts </em>was viewed as applying the unavailability requirement only to prior testimony. <em>\u201cRoberts </em>cannot fairly be read to stand for the radical proposition that no out-ol-court statement can be introduced by the government without a showing that the declarant is unavailable.\u201d Id. In this case particularly, where the only purpose for introducing the hospital records was to explain the basis for Langston\u2019s correction of her previous testimony concerning the time of the defendant\u2019s hospital visit, it would make no sense to require the state to produce the person who made the entries in the records showing the time of that visit. We conclude, therefore, that the hospital records were properly admitted into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">The defendant\u2019s final claims are that the trial court improperly instructed the jury concerning (1) proof beyond a reasonable doubt and (2) consciousness of guilt. We conclude that neither claim is meritorious.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b311-9\">The defendant claims that the trial court\u2019s instructions to the jury concerning the requirement of proof <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt incorrectly diluted that standard by including the following sentence: \u201cA reasonable doubt means this, it is a doubt for which a reasonable man or woman can give a valid reason.\u201d The defendant excepted to that portion of the charge, thus preserving his right to appellate review. Practice Book \u00a7 42-16, formerly \u00a7 852; <em>State </em>v. <em>Ali, </em>233 Conn. 403, 421, 660 A.2d 337 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">The defendant relies mainly on the dissenting opinion of then Chief Judge Jon O. Newman in <em>Chalmers </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>73 F.3d 1262, 1274-76 (2d Cir. 1996), in which a similar instruction was criticized as implying that a juror must be able to articulate a good reason to fellow jurors for entertaining a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The majority opinion, although it disapproved that instruction and acknowledged that it \u201cmight mislead the jury,\u201d held that in the context of the entire charge, it was not reasonably likely that the jurors misunderstood the proper burden of proof. Id., 1268. Moreover, the <em>Chalmers </em>court stated that while such an instruction was \u201c \u2018not approved\u2019 and \u2018perhaps unwise,\u2019 [we] have never held such [an instruction] to be reversible error.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Morant, </em>242 Conn. 666, 688, 701 A.2d 1 (1997), our Supreme Court approved a \u201cvalid reason\u201d instruction identical to that challenged by the defendant in this case. The court cited the following cases that upheld the same or similar instructions: <em>State </em>v. <em>Kelley, </em>229 Conn. 557, 567, 643 A.2d 854 (1994); <em>State </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>225 Conn. 270, 290-91, 623 A.2d 42 (1993); <em>State </em>v. <em>Derrico, </em>181 Conn. 151, 170-71, 434 A.2d 356, cert. denied, 449 U.S. 1064, 101 S. Ct. 789, 66 L. Ed. 2d 607 (1980). <em>State </em>v. <em>Morant, </em>supra, 688. This court is obliged to follow precedent established by our Supreme Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>in the absence of controlling federal authority. Accordingly, we conclude that there is no merit in the defendant\u2019s challenge to the trial court\u2019s instruction on reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">The defendant claims that the trial court\u2019s charge on consciousness of guilt was \u201cunwarranted by the evidence and highly misleading.\u201d Such a claim is inconsistent with the failure of the defendant to take any exception to that part of the charge at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">The following additional facts are necessary for the resolution of this claim. The trial court instructed the jury that it was proper to consider evidence of the defendant\u2019s conduct and any declarations he made after the crimes occurred that may have been fairly influenced by the alleged criminal offenses. The court instructed the jury: \u201cIf a defendant should make false statements with respect to himself or as to his whereabouts at the time of some particular event, these may be shown because such conduct or such statements often tend to show a guilty connection by the accused with the crime charged.\u201d The trial court then referred to the statements made by the defendant to Langston at the hospital: \u201cNow, if you find that the accused . . . lied to Sergeant Langston as to his activities, his whereabouts and how he received the gunshot wound to his arm during the early morning hours of May 6, 1993, then you may properly infer that these statements were borne of a guilty mind and that they tend to show a guilty connection by the defendant with the crimes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b313-9\">Evidence that an accused has made false statements tending to exculpate him from involvement in the crimes charged has commonly been deemed to support a jury charge on consciousness of guilt. \u201c[A] party\u2019s falsehood or other fraud in the preparation and presentation of his cause . . . his fabrication or suppression <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>of evidence . . . and all similar conduct is receivable against him as an indication of his consciousness that his case is a weak or unfounded one; and from that consciousness may be inferred the fact itself of the cause\u2019s lack of truth and merit.\u201d 2 J. Wigmore, Evidence (Chadbourn Rev. 1979) \u00a7 278, p. 133. Indeed, our Supreme Court has stated that such a charge \u201c \u2018may be given when a party has made material misstatements because such fabrication or falsification implies that that party believes his or her case to be weak or unfounded.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. Banks, 194 Conn. 617, 621, 484 A.2d 444 (1984).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Middlebrook, </em>51 Conn. App. 711, 730, 725 A.2d 351, cert. denied, 248 Conn. 910, 731 A.2d 310 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">The defendant, having failed to except to the charge on consciousness of guilt, seeks appellate review pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989), maintaining that the court\u2019s instruction involved the violation of a fundamental right to a properly instructed jury and, therefore, is of constitutional magnitude. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>219 Conn. 160, 166, 592 A.2d 382 (1991), however, a similar claim involving an instruction on consciousness of guilt was held to be \u201cevidentiary rather than constitutional in significance\u201d and, therefore, did not qualify for review pursuant to <em>Golding. </em>\u201cWhile we have recognized that a claim challenging an instruction that mandates a particular inference adverse to a defendant may sufficiently implicate constitutional rights to satisfy the second condition of <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra [239-40] ... we cannot agree that the instruction challenged here suffers from such a defect. The instruction merely identified a permissive inference that the jury might draw from the defendant\u2019s false statement, an item of circumstantial evidence.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra, 165.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">In the case before us, the challenged instruction stated that if the jury found the accused had lied to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>Langston about how he received his gunshot wound, \u201cyou may properly infer that these statements were borne of a guilty mind and that they tend to show a guilty connection by the defendant with the crime.\u201d As in <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra, 219 Conn. 165, the instruction given here \u201cmerely identified a permissive inference that the jury might draw from the defendant\u2019s false statement, an item of circumstantial evidence.\u201d We conclude, therefore, that the defendant is not entitled to further review of the challenged instruction because the deficiency claimed did not violate any constitutional right; id., 166; and he failed to preserve his right to appellate review by excepting to that portion of the charge as required by Practice Book \u00a7 42-16. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ali, </em>supra, 233 Conn. 421.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b304-13\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-48 (a) provides: \u201cA person is guilty of conspiracy when, with intent that conduct constituting a crime be performed, he agrees with one or more persons to engage in or cause the performance of such conduct, and any one of them commits an overt act in pursuance of such conspiracy.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b304-14\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of murder when, with intent to cause the death of another person, he causes the death of such person or of a third person . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b305-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-59 (a) provides: \u201cA person is guilty of assault in the first degree when: (1) With intent to cause serious physical injury to another person, he causes such injury to such person or to a third person by means of a deadly weapon or a dangerous instrument; or (2) with intent to disfigure another person seriously and permanently, or to destroy, amputate or disable permanently a member or organ of his body, he causes such injury to such person or to a third person; or (3) under circumstances evincing an extreme indifference to human life he recklessly engages in conduct which creates a risk of death to another person, and thereby causes serious physical injury to another person; or (4) with intent to cause serious physical injury to another person and while aided by two or more other persons actually present, he causes such injury to such person or to a third person . . .</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b305-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-180 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of falsely reporting an incident when, knowing the information reported, conveyed or circulated to be false or baseless, he . . .

Under <em>Golding, </em>\u201ca defendant can prevail on a claim of constitutional error not preserved at trial only if all of the following conditions are met: (1) the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; (2) the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; (3) the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial; and (4) if subject to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt.
