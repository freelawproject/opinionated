The plaintiff claims that the court lacked jurisdiction to open the judgment because General Statutes \u00a7 49-15 prohibits the opening of a foreclosure judgment after title has passed. The defendants, Robert J. Pin-cince and Joan C. Pincince, claim that the foreclosure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>judgment was improperly rendered because they were improperly defaulted for failure to appear at a time when Robert Pincince had filed a pro se appearance. The plaintiff disputes the defendants\u2019 contention that Robert Pincince\u2019s appearance was on file when the default was entered. We affirm the decision of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">The plaintiff has filed with this court, purportedly pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 64-1, a transcript of the trial court\u2019s oral decision signed by the court. The transcript, however, fails to disclose the reasons for the court\u2019s decision to open the judgment, and the plaintiff failed to file a motion for articulation pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 66-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-7\">Because the plaintiff failed to provide us with an adequate record, we decline to review his claim. \u201cThe duty to provide this court with a record adequate for review rests with the appellant. Practice Book \u00a7 60-5; <em>Chase Manhattan Bank/City Trust </em>v. <em>AECO Elevator Co., </em>48 Conn. App. 605, 607, 710 A.2d 190 (1998).\u201d <em>State v. Combs, </em>51 Conn. App. 700, 701, 725 A.2d 349 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b790-8\">The trial court\u2019s granting of the defendants\u2019 motion to open is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b789-12\"> Ordinarily, the granting of a motion to open a prior judgment does not constitute a final judgment and, therefore, is not immediately appealable. <em>State </em>v. <em>Phillips, </em>166 Conn. 642, 646, 353 A.2d 706 (1974). Where, however, the appellant challenges the power of the trial court to open the judgment, an immediate appeal lies. <em>Cassella </em>v. <em>Kleffke, </em>38 Conn.
