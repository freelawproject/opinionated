The trustee was appointed in 1935 for the benefit of holders of first mortgage certificates on the Half Moon Hotel in Coney Island, and he operated the property until 1947, when said hotel was sold for $855,000. When the trustee made the present application, appellants-respondents, certificate holders, opposed the granting of any fee to his attorneys on the basis that, by having purchased certificates, said attorneys forfeited) the right to be compensated for their services. The question of their right to compensation, however, is not before us on these cross appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">Special Term, Kings County, referred the matter to an official referee to hear and report. It thereafter approved the referee\u2019s report and ordered that the trustee\u2019s attorneys:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-6\"><em>\u201c </em>(a) Deliver and surrender to Walter McMeekan, Trustee for Certificate Holders in the issue specified in the caption, all mortgage certificates held by them in said issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>\u201c (b) Deliver to Walter McMeekan, Trustee aforesaid, a statement duly acknowledged, giving the face amount and the time of purchase of all certificates purchased by them and the actual amount paid for said certificates, and at the same time pay to the Trustee the amount they received on said certificates by the three distributions heretofore made by the Trustee, less the cost to them of the acquisition of such certificates as may be shown on their statement, together with interest at the rate of six (6%) percent per annum on each amount that was due on the date of each of the said three distributions to the date of payment to the Trustee \u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">The order further directed that all remaining questions relevant to the settlement of the trustee\u2019s account, his commissions and attorneys\u2019 allowance be held in abeyance until the order had been complied with, and that upon compliance the referee should continue the hearing and make further report. The Appellate Division (one Justice dissenting), modified the Special Term order by striking out subparagraphs \u201c a \u201d and \u201c b \u201d above referred to, ordered that those former certificate holders from whom the trustee\u2019s attorneys purchased certificates be brought in as parties, and that they be given notice of the possibility of their ownership of claims against said attorneys with reasonable opportunity to assert such claims, if any. That court also remitted the matter to Special Term for further proceedings in accordance with its opinion, obviously because it was not satisfied upon the record before it whether the attorneys had observed the rule of full disclosure to the beneficiaries with whom they were dealing.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">The objecting certificate holders have obtained leave from the Appellate Division to appeal on the certified question: \u201c Was the order of the Special Term properly made? \u201d, and the trustee and his attorneys similar leave on the question: \u201cWas the order of the Appellate Division properly made? \u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">The Half Moon Hotel was constructed in 1928 and 1929 at an alleged cost of over $2,500,000. The Title Guarantee and Trust Company issued first mortgage participation certificates in a mortgage in the sum of $690,000 covering the premises. The Bond and Mortgage Guarantee Company guaranteed the payment of the bond secured by the aforesaid mortgage to the owners and holders of said bond and mortgage and/or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>participating certificates therein. The business and property of Bond and Mortgage Guarantee Company were taken over by the Superintendent of Insurance in 1933, pursuant to the provisions of article XI (now art. XVI) of the Insurance Law, and the Mortgage Commission of the State of New York took over the mortgage investments. The Superintendent of Insurance thereupon sought and obtained judicial approval of a plan for readjustment, modification and reorganization of the rights of the holders of the guaranteed mortgage participation certificates. In pursuance of this plan, the Mortgage Commission foreclosed the mortgage, and title to the Half Moon Hotel was transferred to the trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">The order of the Supreme Court, Kings County, dated October 7, 1935, provided, among other things, that \u201c Walter McMeekan shall be appointed Trustee by the Court <em>of all of the property of every description securing or intending to secure the certificates issued by Title Guarantee and Trust Company against the mortgage which is the subject-matter of this proceeding </em>and guaranteed by Bond and Mortgage Guarantee Company. * * * Upon the execution of the said Declaration of Trust, the Trustee shall become vested with title to the said trust estate and shall hold the same in trust <em>for the benefit of certificate holders solely to liquidate the same in an orderly businesslike manner \u201d. </em>(Emphasis supplied.) This was done pursuant to chapter 745 of the Laws of 1933, as amended (McKinney\u2019s Unconsol. Laws, \u00a7 4871 <em>et seq.). </em>The purpose of this legislation was to prevent demoralization of the general real estate market under the economic pressure of the depression, with consequent ruin to real estate owners and damage to investors; it sought to provide a method of disposing of these mortgages in an orderly manner over a reasonable period of time <em>(Matter of People [Tit. &amp; Mtge. Guar. Co.], </em>264 N. Y. 69, 85). Chapter 19 of the Laws of 1935 created the Mortgage Commission of the State of New York. In section 1 thereof a public emergency affecting the health, safety and comfort of the people was declared, the enactment providing: \u201c Many holders of mortgage investments are receiving no income or little income therefrom and they and their families are in want. The present market for such mortgage investments has depreciated to such an extent that few of such mortgage investments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>can be sold except at great sacrifice and at distress prices.\u201d By section 3 of chapter 944 of the Laws of 1939 (McKinney\u2019s Unconsol. Laws, \u00a7 4846), the Mortgage Commission was terminated and its powers transferred to the Superintendent of Insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">The hotel had been operated by a receiver for two and a half years before the trustee took possession in December, 1935. The attorneys for the trustee have acted as such since that time. Between September 25, 1941, and June 21, 1944, the attorneys made a total of five purchases of certificates of the face amount of $47,489.42 at a cost of $3,995.42, or on the average less than 8% cents on the dollar. On July 1, 1946, they purchased additional certificates in the face amount of $9,000 for which they paid $5,040. Thus their total average cost was less than 16 cents on the dollar. Distributions thus far made have amounted to nearly 56 cents on the dollar, and the attorneys\u2019 profit has amounted to well over $22,000. In addition, the attorneys have received thus far over $10,000 for their legal services, and on the present accounting request approximately an additional $25,000. The objecting'certificate holders purchased their certificates of the face value of some $103,000 at various times in 1939, 1941, 1942, 1944, 1946 and 1947 at an average price of more than 43 cents on the dollar.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">There is no claim of actual fraud, bad faith, or manipulation of the trust deahngs by the attorneys. The attorneys assert they did not buy any of the certificates from certificate holders; they bought from dealers and brokers only. They bought in their own name without attempt at concealment. The attorneys stated they never solicited certificates for sale either from certificate holders or brokers. They also state that they did not rely on any \u201c inside or secret information \u201d in buying the certificates. Of course, by reason of their situation, they could not help but have the fullest information concerning the trust. The attorneys also claimed that in response to many inquiries from certificate holders, they always advised them to hold on rather than to sell at the then depressed market values. It does not appear, however, that the attorneys informed such holders that they were buying certificates, nor how many' inquired.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>The trustee knew about the attorneys\u2019 purchases because, after a sale was completed, the certificate was sent to him for transfer. He stated that \u201c they had a perfect right to do it \u201d, although neither he nor any of his family directly or indirectly participated in any purchases. However, it is stated in the referee\u2019s report \u2014 and undisputed here \u2014 that the attorneys \u201c admit their dealings in certificates were never disclosed in any way to the judges who made the allowances to them for services or to the justices in charge of reorganization and rehabilitation matters with whom they were frequently in contact as set forth in their detailed claim for fees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">We are of the view that the attorneys did breach their fiduciary obligation. The duty of the trustee, as defined by court order, was to hold the hotel in trust <em>\u201c </em>for the benefit of certificate holders solely to liquidate the same in an orderly businesslike manner \u201d. One of the most fundamental duties of a trustee in any case is complete unselfishness and inflexible loyalty to the interests of the beneficiaries of the trust. This duty stems from human frailty when confronted with conflicting interests,' evidenced by the centuries-old scriptural passage: <em>:i </em>No man can serve two masters</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">The attorneys, concededly in the same position as the trustee, owed an equally high degree of fidelity, and so both courts below held, the Appellate Division stating that, \u201c by reason of their status as attorneys for the trustee, [they] were no less fiduciaries than was the trustee himself.\u201d (277 App. Div. 1132.) Thus the attorneys, like the trustee, owed to these certificate holders <em>\u201c </em>the duty of the finest loyalty \u201d, <em>\u201c </em>something stricter than the morals of the market place \u201d <em>(Meinhard </em>v. <em>Salmon, </em>249 N. Y. 458, 463-464). The attorneys put themselves in a position <em>\u201c </em>in which <em>thought of self was to he renounced, </em>however hard the abnegation their loyalty to the certificate holders was to be <em>\u201cundivided and </em>unselfishindeed, for them this <em>\u201crule of undivided loyalty \u201d </em>was <em>\u201c relentless and supreme \u201d (Meinhard </em>v. <em>Salmon, supra, </em>pp. 467, 468, emphasis supplied; see, also, <em>Case </em>v. <em>Carroll, </em>35 N. Y. 385, 388; <em>Merrick </em>v. <em>Waters, </em>51 App. Div. 83, affd. 171 N. Y. 655, and, more recently <em>to </em>the same effect, <em>City Bank Farmers Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Cannon, </em>291 N. Y. 125, 131; <em>Matter of Durston, </em>297 N. Y. 64).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>Moreover, the question of bad faith or damage is irrelevant to our inquiry. As was said in <em>Wendt </em>v. <em>Fischer </em>(243 N. Y. 439, 443-444): <em>\u201c </em>we are told that the brokers acted in good faith, that the terms procured were the best obtainable at the moment, and that the wrong, if any, was unaccompanied by damage. This is no sufficient answer by a trustee forgetful of his duty. The law \u2018 does not stop to inquire whether the contract or transaction was fair or unfair. It stops the inquiry when the relation is disclosed, and sets aside the transaction or refuses to enforce it, at the instance of the party whom the fiduciary undertook to represent, without undertaking to deal with the question of abstract justice in the particular case \u2019 <em>(Munson </em>v. <em>Syracuse, etc., R. R. Co., supra </em>[103 N. Y. 58], at p. 74; cf. <em>Dutton </em>v. <em>Willner, </em>52 N. Y. 312, 319). Only by this uncompromising rigidity has the rule of undivided loyalty been maintained against disintegrating erosion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">Measured by these standards, we think it clear that these attorneys placed themselves in a situation wherein their own personal purposes <em>might </em>well conflict with the purposes of the trust beneficiaries, the certificate holders. Countless illustrations of such conflict suggest themselves on slight reflection. In every detail of legal advice and legal action with respect to the trust estate, the attorneys would consciously or unconsciously have in mind their own investment in the trust property. If all went well, the difficulty might not be great, but if the trust estate were in great danger, and the market price of certificates again began to decline, the temptation to protect themselves with respect to their own investment would have a tendency to affect their best judgment, advice and action. They would find it difficult to obliterate a divided loyalty, and the endangering process of \u201c disintegrating erosion \u201d would quickly present itself. Hence .the uncompromising rigidity of the rule, and it applies irrespective of good or bad faith. There is no shadowy borderline or twilight zone. Where doubt exists, full and complete disclosure, and authorization from the court upon due notice, are the fair and simple remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">That the attorneys could have influenced the course of the liquidation is too plain for controversy; indeed, they could not help but influence it in one way or another, as evidenced by the affidavit of one of the attorneys in connection with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>negotiations surrounding the Navy lease. The same affidavit discloses that the attorneys, when several prospects indicated an interest in buying the hotel, were \u201c continuously consulted [by the trustee] * * * as to the manner of procedure, the type of contracts to be entered into, the terms of any sale and other related matters.\u201d How could the attorneys give an absolutely unbiased opinion on such matters when their own profits and losses were involved? That their advice and action in this case may have been correct, despite their personal Interest in the trust estate, is beside the point. In another ease it may be otherwise. The law cannot always discover and measure the influence of a trustee or his attorneys. The basic vice is the existence of a personal interest, entangling their private claims with those of their beneficiaries, thus creating the danger of biased judgments and opening the way to fraud and wrong. That is sufficient to brand this conduct as a breach of fiduciary obligation under the circumstances here presented (see 3 Bogert on Trusts and Trustees, part 1 [1946], \u00a7 485, p. 108; \u00a7 543, pp. 375, 379, 380; \u00a7 544, p. 399; <em>2 </em>Scott on Trusts, [1939], \u00a7 170.21, subd. [2], pp. 899-901; Restatement, Trusts, \u00a7 170, particularly comment j; Restatement, Restitution, \u00a7 196).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">In <em>Matter of Dwight </em>(61 App. Div. 357, appeal dismissed 173 N. Y. 583) it was held that where the attorney for the assignee for the benefit of creditors, acting in the interest of the assigned estate, induces creditors thereof to execute assignments of their claims to him, paying personally therefor an amount less than their face value, he is only entitled to be allowed out of the assigned estate the amount paid by him for the claims, with interest. At page 362 the court said: \u201c To allow a trustee and his attorney to take advantage of their trust relation and their special knowledge by reason of such relation to make an individual profit out of the trust fund is contrary to public policy.\u201d It quoted at length with approval from <em>Manhattan Cloak &amp; Suit Co. </em>v. <em>Dodge </em>(120 Ind. 1, Note, 6 L. R. A. 369), where a situation similar to the <em>Dwight </em>case <em>(supra) </em>was presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">The attorneys rely largely on <em>Donnelly </em>v. <em>Consolidated Inv. Trust </em>(99 F. 2d 185) and <em>Victor </em>v. <em>Hillebrecht </em>(405 Ill. 264, certiorari denied 339 U. S. 980), the only two cases cited by the Appellate Division herein. The <em>Donnelly </em>case <em>(supra) </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>involved trustees\u2019 purchases of shares of a Massachusetts trust at a time apparently when the trust was a going concern and not under judicial supervision. The court pointed out that a Massachusetts trust resembled a corporation, \u201c the trustees being analogous to directors and the shareholders to corporate stockholders \u201d (p. 186). (See, on the question of directors and officers of a corporation purchasing its stock, <em>Fischer </em>v. <em>Guaranty Trust Co., </em>259 App. Div. 176, affd. 285 N. Y. 679.) Such a situation is not comparable to the one now before us. Moreover, it appeared in the <em>Donnelly </em>case that one of the trustees caused letters to be sent to <em>all </em>shareholders advising them not to sell; no such all-inclusive admonition was given in the instant case. Certainly the disclosure made by the attorneys here, \u2018 \u2018 so indefinite and equivocal \u201d as it was, did not meet the test that, where dual interests are to be served, <em>\u201c </em>the disclosure to be effective must lay bare the truth, without ambiguity or reservation, in all its stark significance \u201d <em>(Wendt </em>v. <em>Fischer, </em>243 N. Y. 439, 443, <em>supra; </em>see 3 Bogert on Trusts and Trustees, part 1 [1946], [commenting that the <em>Donnelly </em>decision \u201c seems of dubious soundness \u201d], \u00a7 485, p. 109, n. 91).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\">In <em>Victor </em>v. <em>Hillebrecht (supra), </em>also relied upon by the attorneys and the Appellate Division, purchases were made by trust managers under a liquidation trust agreement which appointed both trust managers and a liquidation trustee. There, however, the trust agreement provided: \u201c Trust Managers, may, but need not, be holders of participation certificates. The rights of any holder of participation certificates to deal freely with Liquidation Trustee and Trust Managers shall not be affected by his being a Trust Manager.\u201d (See 3 Bogert on Trusts and Trustees, part 1 [1950 Cumulative Pocket], \u00a7 544, n. 24.)</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">In any event, to the extent that the <em>Donnelly </em>and <em>Victor </em>cases <em>(supra) </em>may be construed as imposing a less rigid duty upon trustees, we are not disposed to follow them. In our State \u201c Uncompromising rigidity has been the attitude of courts of equity when petitioned to undermine the rule of undivided loyalty by the \u2018 disintegrating erosion \u2019 of particular exceptions \u201d <em>(Meinhard </em>v. <em>Salmon, supra, </em>p. 464). We have taken this unyielding position because of a belief that only thus can the \u201c level of conduct for fiduciaries \u201d be kept \u201c higher <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>than that trodden by the crowd \u201d, and we have stated that this higher level \u201c will not consciously be lowered by any judgment of this court\u201d; we should not lower it now, and thus make the first breach in a \u201c tradition that is unbending and inveterate \u201d <em>(Meinhard </em>v. <em>Salmon, supra, </em>p. 464; see, also, <em>Munson </em>v. <em>Syracuse, G. &amp; C. R. R. Co., </em>103 N. Y. 58, 74, <em>supra). </em>And certainly not in a judicial proceeding, authorized by the Legislature to relieve distressed holders of mortgage investments, who can no longer act independently. By virtue thereof, the Supreme Court was given complete supervisory powers to assist in preserving the trust estate for their benefit, and the Superintendent of Insurance and the State Mortgage Commission were empowered to make financial advances. This emergency legislation was not enacted to assist trustees or their attorneys to make private profits from the trust estate by purchasing for themselves mortgage certificates with the right to vote and act that accompanied them.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">The distinction sought to be made between the trust property and the certificated interests in the mortgage is without substance. By foreclosure of the mortgage, the certificate holders became the beneficial owners of the property in place of the foreclosed mortgage, and the trustee holds the fee title for them pursuant to court order. The certificate holders are to all intents and purposes the owners of the property and the clients of the trustee\u2019s attorneys. The latter look to them for compensation out of their interest in the property. The attorneys bought such interests <em>in the trust estate, </em>in the administration of which they were under a duty to assist. The trust corpus was owned by the certificate holders, there was but one trust to be administered, and dual interests could not be served. (Cf. U. S. Code, tit. 11, \u00a7 649; Real Property Law, \u00a7 127, subd. 1.)</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">We agree with the Appellate Division\u2019s order insofar as it directs that the former certificate holders from whom the attorneys purchased certificates be brought in and given notice of the possibility of their ownership of claims, and insofar as it remits the matter to Special Term for further proceedings. However, we do not agree with the Appellate Division insofar as it struck out Special Term\u2019s direction that the attorneys\u2019 certificates be delivered and surrendered to the trustee, and that their profits be ac.oQpnted for. As we see it, the attorneys <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>in no event may keep the certificates and the profits, but must account therefor to the trust estate as upon a constructive trust, subject to the rights of the former certificate holders.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">The order of the Appellate Division should be modified by striking out the direction in the first decretal paragraph thereof, and by reinstating in lieu thereof subdivisions \u201c a \u201d and \u201c b \u201d of the third decretal paragraph of the Special Term order, excepting as to the time of compliance, and the matter remitted for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion, and, as so modified, affirmed, without costs. The certified questions should be answered in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">Loughran, Ch.
