Upon the evidence the board was justified in concluding that on at least two different occasions petitioner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>either knew or through the exercise of reasonable diligence could have known that homosexuals were committing disorderly acts upon the licensed premises. The question of credibility of witnesses was for the board alone and its determination is supported by substantial evidence. <em>(Schindler </em>v. <em>Royal Ins. Co., </em>258 N. Y. 310; <em>Matter of Cohen </em>v. <em>Board of Regents, </em>274 App. Div. 952, 299 N.

The court below, in holding that petitioner was excused and justified, as a matter of law, in refusing to take steps to prevent its premises from becoming disorderly, has usurped the exclusive province of the board to judge the facts, and, since the facts in mitigation were not raised or proved by petitioner, but rather affirmatively denied by it, the court has created a rule of law which would nullify completely any effective sanctions against licensees who suffered or permitted their premises to become disorderly. The court further erred in creating a new criteria of proof relating to the statutory phrase \u201c suffer or permit \u201d. <em>(Matter of Clement [Ruehl </em>Certificate], 144 App. Div. 156; <em>Grannan </em>v. <em>Westchester Racing Assn., </em>153 N.

(See, e.g., <em>Matter of Humphrey </em>v. <em>State Ins. Fund, </em>298 N. Y. 327, 331-332; <em>Matter of Miller </em>v. <em>Kling, </em>291 N. Y. 65, 69.) In the case before us, ample proof was adduced before the State Liquor Authority \u2014 and it was not rendered less effective or less probative because the criminal charge based upon some of it had been dismissed in a magistrate\u2019s court (see <em>Matter of Cohen </em>v. <em>Board of Regents, </em>299 N. Y. 582, affg. 274 App. Div. 952; <em>Schindler </em>v. <em>Royal Ins. Co., </em>258 N. Y. 310, 312-313; <em>Matter of Garvey </em>v. <em>O\u2019Connell, </em>271 App. Div. 766) \u2014to warrant the Authority (1) in finding that the licensee actually knew or should have known, had reasonable diligence been exercised, that homosexual activities were being carried on in its premises, and (2) in concluding that such licensee had suffered or permitted the premises to become \u201c disorderly \u201d in violation of subdivision 6 of section 106 of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Law. (See <em>Matter of Avon Bar &amp; Grill </em>v. <em>O\u2019Connell, </em>301 N.
