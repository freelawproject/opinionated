Since the issue presented here is solely a question of representation, and since the National Mediation Board has determined, after mediation, election and certification in 1935, that the Switch-men\u2019s Union of North America is the proper union to represent the men on the \u201c 3:00 P. M. City Line Job \u201d, any action to review the mediation, election and certification is not justiciable. <em>(Switchmen\u2019s Union </em>v. <em>Board, </em>320 U.

If, despite the decision of the United States Supreme Court in the <em>Slocum </em>case, this court should hold that there is jurisdiction, then the rights of both unions are clearly barred by the Statute of Limitations. <em>(Washington Terminal Co. </em>v. <em>Boswell, </em>124 F. 2d 235, 319 U. S. 732.) IV. Since the Appellate Division\u2019s reversal of the judgment was predicated solely upon its lack of jurisdiction under the decision in the <em>Slocum </em>ease, plaintiffs\u2019 conjectures and speculations as to other possibilities with respect to the trial court\u2019s holding of abrogation of the 1926 contract are academic. The answers did not preclude a finding of abrogation of the contract. <em>(Sternstein </em>v. <em>Heit, </em>186 App. Div. 45; <em>Auerbach </em>v. <em>Taub, </em>194 Misc. 86, 275 App. Div. 802; <em>Milbank </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>127 N.

City Line Job \u201d and the \u201c seventh day extra job \u201d, in the Buffalo district of defendant railroad company. The Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen (hereafter referred to as plaintiff union) seeks an injunction and a declar\u00e1<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>tory judgment \u2014 an injunction to enjoin the railroad from assigning the city line job to the yardmen or switchmen belonging to the Switchmen\u2019s Union (hereafter called defendant union) and a.declaration as to the respective rights of the two unions to employment on the various \u2018 \u2018 runs \u2019 \u2019 described in the contract. It is defendant railroad\u2019s position that the courts lack jurisdiction of the controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">The Official Referee decided, on the strength of this court\u2019s decision in <em>Delaware, L. &amp; W. R. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Slocum </em>(299 N. Y. 496), that it had jurisdiction of the dispute and found in favor of defendant union as to the city line job and in favor of plaintiff union on the seventh day extra job. The Appellate Division, Fourth Department, unanimously reversed and dismissed the complaint, holding \u2014 on the authority of the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Slocum </em>v. <em>Delaware, L. &amp; W. R. Co. </em>(339 U. S. 239), which reversed our determination, <em>supra </em>\u2014 that the state courts lack jurisdiction of the controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">The dispute or, more precisely, its origin can be traced to 1920, when a wildcat strike of switchmen initiated a number of employment changes in the Buffalo district of defendant railroad. Defendant union, unable to control the strike in that area, surrendered its existing contract to the railroad which assigned that contract to plaintiff union, with the consequence that plaintiff thereafter represented both roadmen and yardmen in the Buffalo district. Plaintiff\u2019s claim to the city line job is based on its 1926 contract with defendant railroad. That contract contained an \u201c appendix \u201d, wherein certain <em>\u201c </em>runs \u201d \u2014 which before 1920 had been operated by switchmen belonging to the Switchmen\u2019s Union \u2014 were included in \u201c Road Service \u201d and manned by roadmen of plaintiff union. Neither side claims that the city line job was originally included in the 1926 appendix \u2014 although, defendant railroad acknowledges, plaintiff union could, at any time between 1920 and 1935, have required it to be included therein and manned by its roadmen. But plaintiff union maintains that in December, 1937, the \u201c type, character and nature of work \u201d on the city line job changed from yard and switching work to road service and that job should now be governed by the 1926 appendix denominating similar types of former yard work as \u201c Road Service \u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>Defendant union\u2019s claim to the city line job and the seventh day extra job is founded upon the results of an election held in 1935 under the auspices of the National Mediation Board. At that election, held to determine whether defendant union should again represent yardmen in the Buffalo district, only yardmen, including the \u201c crew \u201d on the city line job, were allowed to vote. The election won, defendant union entered into its \u201c 1935 Memorandum \u201d agreement with the railroad. That Memorandum provided that that union would thereafter represent yardmen in the Buffalo district and that \u2018\u2018 all work in that [yard] will be performed \u201d by them, and a letter from the railroad company to the chairmen of the two unions gave notice of \u201c the discontinuance of the existing contract between this company and [plaintiff union], insofar as it relates to yard men at Hoboken and Buffalo \u201d. Denying that the character of its operations has changed, defendant union presses the claim to the city line job by reason of the election, the 1935 Memorandum and the letter to which reference has just been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">After the reinstatement of defendant union in 1935, both unions attempted to clarify the status of the city line job. In 1938, defendant union invoked the jurisdiction of the National Mediation Board in an effort to be designated representative of those employees included in the appendix of plaintiff union\u2019s 1926 contract with the railroad. The Mediation Board dismissed the case, declaring that the Switchmen\u2019s Union was not entitled to represent those employees because they had been excluded from the election which resulted in the certification of defendant union. No specific reference was made to the city line job.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">In 1944, however, plaintiff filed a claim with the Bailroad Adjustment Board which, the parties concede, involves the same issues as are presented in the case before us. Based upon grievances of two of its trainmen members who sought yardworkers\u2019 pay rates in connection with the city line job, the claim was \u201c dismissed \u201d by the Board. In essence, the Board\u2019s decision directed the two unions to adjust the dispute between themselves. After noting that <em>\u201c </em>This Division of the Adjustment Board has jurisdiction over the dispute involved herein \u201d, the Board went on to declare that \u201c The question * * * <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>involved should be adjusted by and between the interested organizations, i.e., Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen, Order of Railway Conductors [now represented by plaintiff union] and Switchmen\u2019s Union of North America, as it involves classification of service on run under what seem to this Division to be conflicting agreements and facts concerning the dispute.\u201d The <em>\u201c </em>Award \u201d was that the \u201c Case [be] dismissed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">Attempts on the part of the unions to adjust the <em>\u201c </em>question \u201d having proved futile, plaintiff union filed its present complaint in the Supreme Court. It is our view, as it was the Appellate Division\u2019s, that the courts of this state lack jurisdiction to entertain the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">The Railway Labor Act accords the Adjustment Board jurisdiction over \u201c disputes between an employee or group of employees and a carrier or carriers growing out of <em>grievances </em>or out of the <em>interpretation or application of agreements </em>concerning rates of pay, rules, or working conditions \u201d (Railway Labor Act, \u00a7 3, subd. [i]; U. S. Code, tit. 45, \u00a7 153, subd. [i]). And the Supreme Court of the United States has held that, where an interpretation of their respective agreements is needed to determine which of two unions is entitled to furnish employees for a particular job or jobs, the dispute is one envisaged by the Act and falls within the Board\u2019s jurisdiction. (See, e.g., <em>Slocum </em>v. <em>Delaware, L. &amp; W. R. Co., supra, </em>339 U. S. 239; <em>Order of Conductors </em>v. <em>Pitney, </em>326 U. S. 561.) In the <em>Slocum </em>case, for instance, it was a clerks\u2019 union and a telegraphers\u2019 union which claimed jobs covered by their respective agreements; in the <em>Pitney </em>case, trainmen and conductors relied upon agreements which covered identical jobs. And such is the case before us. The two unions dispute the status of the city line job, each claiming that its own members are entitled to work it. Both of their agreements with defendant railroad are concededly legal and valid. The ultimate question for determination is whether the jobs which each contract encompasses cover the work on that particular \u201c run \u201d. Assuredly, that involves the \u201c scope of [the] respective agreements \u201d <em>(Slocum </em>v. <em>Delaware, L. &amp; W. R. Co., supra, 339 </em>U. S. 239, 240) and requires their \u201c interpretation \u201d and <em>\u201c </em>application \u201d to the situation in question (Railway Labor Act, \u00a7 3, subd. [i]). And, beyond that, we fail to see how, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>any event, it may be said that the dispute is not one <em>\u201c </em>growing out of grievances * * * concerning rates of pay, rules, or working conditions \u201d <em>(id).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">Whatever authority the courts retain to determine the existence, validity or legality of contracts between railroads and their employees or the unions representing them (see, e.g., <em>Hettenbaugh </em>v. <em>Airline Pilots Assn. International, </em>189 F. 2d 319, 320), the determination here sought is of an entirely different sort \u2014 going beyond such matters and involving much more. This is not, as plaintiff union suggests, a dispute concerning <em>\u201c </em>clear breaches of solemn clear contracts \u201d which require no \u201c interpretation \u201d, nor one involving mere indecision as to which of two agreements \u2014 insofar as the city line job is concerned\u2014 is in force and effect. And, significantly, the National Mediation Board, in connection with defendant union\u2019s claim in 1938 in this very case, after declaring that it was without authority <em>\u201c </em>to change the specific classification of these [union] agreements \u201d, went on to say that, \u201c If any reclassification is to be made it will have to be done by changing the existing agreements in accordance with the provisions for their amendment or interpretation. \u201d \u201c Interpretation \u201d, of course, requires presentation to the Adjustment Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">That the Adjustment Board has jurisdiction of the controversy may not, then, be doubted. The primary question here posed, however, is whether the parties \u2014 having once invoked the jurisdiction of the Board and having failed to \u201c adjust \u201d the controversy as suggested by that body \u2014 were privileged to initiate an action in the courts to have their respective rights defined and declared. It is entirely clear, of course, that the parties must in the first instance proceed before the Board. (See, e.g., <em>Slocum </em>v. <em>Delaware, L. &amp; W. R. Co., supra, </em>339 U. S. 239; <em>Order of Conductors </em>v. <em>Pitney, supra, </em>326 U. S. 561.) Thus, in the <em>Pitney </em>case, the court wrote (p. 566): \u201c Not only has Congress thus designated an agency peculiarly competent to handle the basic question here involved, but as we have indicated in several recent cases in which we had occasion to discuss the history and purpose of the Railway Labor Act, it also intended to leave a minimum responsibility to the courts.\u201d And the <em>Slocum </em>case is to the same effect. It involved a dispute in which a clerks\u2019 union and a telegraphers\u2019 union each main<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>tained that certain jobs were covered exclusively by its own particular contract with the defendant railroad. The parties pursued their claims in the manner initially provided by the Bailway Labor Act \u2014 that is, by conferences among the respective representatives. When they failed to agree, the railroad, instead of proceeding before the Adjustment Board, commenced an action for declaratory judgment in the state court. Assuming jurisdiction of the controversy, the court decided it on the merits; its determination was affirmed both by the Appellate Division and by this court, but as indicated, the Supreme Court reversed, holding that the jurisdiction of the Adjustment Board was \u201cexclusive\u201d (339 U. S., at p. 244). Pointing to the <em>Pitney </em>case \u2014 'Where it was held that the federal court should have refused to entertain a jurisdictional dispute involving a railroad and two unions \u2014 the Supreme Court declared in <em>Slocum </em>that the reasoning in <em>Pitney </em>\u201c equally supports a denial of power in any court \u2014 state as well as federal \u2014 to invade the jurisdiction conferred on the Adjustment Board by the Railway Labor Act \u201d (339 U. S., at p. 244). It was the court\u2019s rationale that Congress had provided an administrative method of settling disputes before they reached \u201c acute stages \u201d; that the administrative officials comprising the Adjustment Board were better equipped than the courts to handle railroad employment problems; and that their decisions would provide a \u201c desirable degree of uniformity in the interpretation of agreements throughout the nation\u2019s railway systems \u201d (pp. 242-243). Accordingly, concluded the court, \u201cWe hold that the jurisdiction of the Board to adjust grievances and disputes of the type here involved is exclusive \u201d (p. 244).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">Since the type of controversy in the <em>Slocum </em>case is remarkably similar to that here involved, it follows that the Board\u2019s jurisdiction of the present dispute is likewise \u201c exclusive.\u201d We need not decide \u2014 as the Supreme Court declined to do in <em>Slocum </em>\u2014 where the parties would stand, insofar as rights of review are concerned, if the Board had made a determination on the merits or had refused to take action at all. The court\u2019s remark that it was not \u201c called upon to decide any question concerning judicial proceedings to review board action or inaction \u201d (339 U. S., at p. 244, fn. 7), may leave open the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>question whether there is any such power of review and, if there is, its scope and its extent. But the court\u2019s reservation of that question is not relevant here, since plaintiff is seeking, not a review of an administrative decision, but a trial of the facts <em>de novo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">There is, of course, a difference between the <em>Slocum </em>case and the present one. Unlike the plaintiff in <em>Slocum, </em>the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen did first proceed before the Board, seeking redress in the courts only after the suggested adjustment efforts had failed. That did not justify the parties in foregoing further pursuit of their claims before the Board, in removing the controversy from the agency and litigating the controversy in the courts. In other words, the action taken by the Board did not render its jurisdiction one whit less exclusive. (Cf. <em>New Orleans Public Belt Railroad Comn. </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>182 F. 2d 654, 656; <em>Hayes </em>v. <em>Union Pac. R. Co., </em>184 F. 2d 337, 338; <em>Hettenbaugh </em>v. <em>Airline Pilots Assn. International, supra, </em>189 F. 2d 319, 321.) In ruling that the courts had no jurisdiction, even after the Board\u2019s jurisdiction had been invoked and it had taken some action, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit wrote in the <em>Ward </em>case <em>(supra, </em>182 F. 2d 654, 656): <em>\u201c </em>It is true that in that case [the <em>Slocum </em>case] the suit was brought in the state court and before the Board had acted, instead of, as here, in the federal court and after it had acted, but the language and scope of the decision is conclusive authority for the view that we take, that the complaint does not present a justiciable declaratory judgment controversy.\u201d And in the <em>Hettenbaugh </em>case, it was said: \u2018 \u2018 The Congress did not, by the Railway Labor Act, grant jurisdiction to the federal courts to afford relief for breaches of performance of collective bargaining agreements. Appropriate quasi-judicial tribunals have been established for that purpose. Slocum v. Delaware, L. &amp; W. R. Co., 339 U. S. 239 * * *. It. is only when collective bargaining agreements are unlawfully entered into, or when the agreements themselves are unlawful in terms or effect, that federal courts may act \u201d (189 F. 2d, at p. 321).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">Turning again to the case before us, all the Adjustment Board did was to dismiss plaintiff union\u2019s case with a direction that the question should be <em>\u201c </em>adjusted \u201d between the interested unions, because it involved \u201c classification of service \u201d under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number><em>\u201c </em>conflicting agreements and facts \u201d. This was in no sense any adjudication, final or otherwise, of the merits of the controversy. What the parties wanted to know, and what they wanted decided, was which of the unions, under the agreements in question, was entitled to the 3:00 P.M. City Line Job. Instead of giving them an answer, the Board sent them back either to negotiate further in conferences between representatives or to seek arbitration. It recognized, of course, that it had jurisdiction of the controversy, and there is nothing to indicate that it did not contemplate ultimate settlement of the issue in accordance with the administrative procedures provided within the Railway Labor Act. If further conferences proved of no avail, and arbitration was not desired or pressed \u2014 for it could not be compelled (Railroad Labor Act, \u00a7 7; U. S. Code, tit. 45, \u00a7 157) \u2014 the dispute should have been resubmitted to the Adjustment Board, for it remained the ultimate and sole arbiter of the dispute. (Cf. <em>Order of Railway Conductors and The Central Railroad Company of New Jersey, </em>Award No. 14673, pp. 15-16.)</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">It may be urged that, upon such resubmission, the Board may still decline to decide the controversy, and that the Railway Labor Act provides neither for a review of the Board\u2019s \u201c dismissal \u201d of the claim nor for a method to compel the Board to decide the \u201c merits \u201d of the controversy presented. Even if that be so, we suggest that that follows from the provisions of the federal statute, its scheme and its desigp. In enacting the statute, Congress determined that, if decisions are to be made upon basic questions of railroad-employee relations, they must be made, if at all, by the designated agency \u201c peculiarly competent \u201d to decide them; that, if disputes arise as to the meaning, application or scope of agreements between railroads and unions involving labor relations, they must be read and construed, in the light of usage, practice and custom, by the designated body most familiar with them. (See <em>Slocum </em>v. <em>Delaware, L. &amp; W. R. Co., supra, </em>339 U. S. 239, 244.) To attain the essential certainty and uniformity of decision and policy in the field, and to avoid a myriad of divergent and conflicting determinations by numberless courts and judges throughout the country, Congress found it necessary to vest exclusive jurisdiction in the Railroad Adjustment Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>The judgment of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, with costs to the defendant Delaware, Lackawanna &amp; Western Railroad Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">Loughran, Ch.
