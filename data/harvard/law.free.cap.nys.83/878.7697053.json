See Vernon v. O\u2019Bannon Co., 71 App. Div. 618, 75 N. Y. Supp. 737. It is only necessary now to recall that the complaint contains two separate and distinct causes of action, while the answer sets up a counterclaim to both causes of action, arising out of the alleged breach of the contract which is the basis of the plaintiffs\u2019 second cause of action. On the first trial three orders were entered, and on appeal all three were unanimously affirmed, viz., an order setting aside the verdict of the jury in favor of the plaintiffs upon the first cause of action as inadequate, an order denying the defendant\u2019s motion to set aside the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"879\">*879</page-number>verdict of the jury in favor of the plaintiffs upon the second cause of action, and an order dismissing the counterclaim. In the order of this court on affirmance, no provision was made for a new trial; and as the order setting aside the verdict on the first cause of action granted a new trial, in terms, as to that cause of action, the learned trial justice ruled upon the second trial that only the first cause of action was then before the court, and tried the case upon the theory that neither the second cause of action nor the counterclaim could be again litigated. I was inclined on the argument to the belief that, even if this ruling were error, it would be unavailing to the defendant, since it might have moved for a resettlement of the order of this court, and thereby have procured the insertion of a precise provision with respect to the scope of the new trial, or such a disposition of the appeal from the respective orders as would result in itself in a trial of the whole case de nova; but I am satisfied on reflection that a litigant cannot be deprived of a substantial right by mere acquiescence in the form of the order by which he is defeated, especially in a case where there may possibly be doubt as to the right of further appeal. The utmost that can be said of the order is that it did not settle the scope of the new trial, but left it to be determined in accordance with the law, and therefore acquiescence would not necessarily involve a waiver of the right to present the question now under consideration. .</p>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">It seems to be well settled that there cannot be two final judgments in this case, and that the reversal of the verdict of the jury as to the first cause of action, and the granting of a new trial thereon, necessarily involved a, retrial of the whole controversy, including the second cause of action and the counterclaim. As to the latter, doubt was expressed on the former hearing (71 App. Div. 619, 75 N. Y. Supp. 737) whether an appeal would lie from the order of dismissal, and the question was regarded as presented by an exception taken to a ruling on the trial. But that the whole case should have been sent for retrial would seem to be decided by the cases of Goodsell v. Western Union Telegraph Co., 109 N. Y. 147, 16 N. E. 324; Board of Underwriters v. Nat. Bank, 146 N. Y. 64, 40 N. E. 500; Altman v. Hofeller, 152 N. Y. 498, 504, 46 N. E. 961; and Freel v. County of Queens, 154 N. Y. 661, 49 N. E. 124.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-6\">It follows that the judgment and order must be reversed, and a new trial granted of the entire case.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-7\">Judgment and order reversed, and new trial of entire case granted; costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
