The relator is the commissioner of highways, the amount involved is about $18, and the purpose of the proceeding seems to be the vindication of the dignity of the relator as an official of the township, rather than the accomplishing of any important public purpose. It is fundamental in our jurisprudence that the moving party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1084\">*1084</page-number>in any litigation shall have an interest in the subject-matter, or that he-shall be specially authorized by statute to act; and, aside from the relator\u2019s allegation in his moving papers that he is a taxpayer, we find-no possible interest of his involved in this proceeding. The invasion of his rights of office on the part of the supervisor, if they were such,, could not be reached or adjusted in this proceeding. John Robb and others had performed labor repairing the roads within the jurisdiction of the relator, and the object of this proceeding is to have this court adjudge that there is no authority in law for the payment of these claims, which the town board of auditors had audited and allowed. The relator had no interest in the claims. He was not a party to-them in any manner, and, if any of his rights as a taxpayer were involved, the law affords a complete and direct remedy by way of a taxpayer\u2019s action, under the provisions of chapter 301, p. 620, of the . Laws of 1892, which permits a recovery of any moneys paid upon, illegal or fraudulent claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-5\">The return to the writ shows that the claims had been audited and allowed, and that the certificate of audited accounts had been delivered to the town supervisor, and by him delivered to the clerk of the board of supervisors, as the law provides, before this writ was issued,, so-that the matter had passed from the jurisdiction of the board of town auditors, and the rights of the claimants, who are not parties to this-proceeding, had been judicially established. The writ is directed to-the members of the board of auditors, and, as that body has acted upon the claims, and has delivered the records of such action into the-hands of the board of supervisors, the matter has passed beyond the jurisdiction of any body now before this court; and it is well established that under such circumstances the writ of certiorari can accomplish nothing. People ex rel. L. S. &amp; M. S. R. Co. v. Common Council, 38 Hun, 7, 10, and authorities cited. It is probably true, as suggested in People ex rel. Vil. of Brockport v. Sutphin, 166 N. Y. 163, 171, 59 N. E. 770, that, if this bill had not been audited or acted upon by the board of auditors before their adjournment, the writ of certiorari would lie'to compel the board at a subsequent meeting to-act; but where the claim has been audited and allowed, and the record has passed on in its regular order to another body, which body is not before this court, we are of opinion that the relator, assuming him. to have an interest in the subject-matter, has mistaken his remedy. Any order that the court might make in respect to these claims could not affect the action of the board of supervisors or the claimants, because none of them is before the court. When to this is added the fact that the relator has no legal rights involved in this proceeding, and: that he has a complete remedy for any wrong he may suffer as a tax- \u25a0 payer, under the act cited above, we are persuaded that the writ should be dismissed. See People v. Board of Commissioners, 97 N. Y. 37, 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-7\">The writ of certiorari should be dismissed, with costs. All concur.. except GOODRICH, P. J., who reads dissenting opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1112-8\">GOODRICH, P. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AFgR\">I dissent from the conclusion of my associates,, and for these reasons: The relator is the commissioner of highways <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1085\">*1085</page-number>-of the town of Lagrange, having exclusive charge of the highways. He brings this proceeding to review the action of the town board of auditors in allowing certain bills for work done on the highways without his consent or authority. In 1902, Mr. Townsend, the supervisor of the town, in the presence of the defendant Cross, one of the auditors, and without, the authority of the relator, employed persons to do work on the highways. Bills for such services were presented to and audited by the board, against the protest of the relator, who contends that the audit was illegal, and an unlawful charge upon the taxpayers, of whom he is one, and that it was an interference with and usurpation -of his powers and duties as highway commissioner. The defendants justify their action on the ground that the relator, as commissioner, left the highway in such a dangerous condition as to render it unsafe for travel, and that the supervisor deemed it his duty, for the protection of the public, to employ persons to make it safe. They deny the relator\u2019s right to this remedy, on the ground that he is not a person aggrieved under section 2127 of the Code of Civil Procedure. But he is not only a taxpayer, but the official upon whom is imposed the duty \u25a0of caring for the highway. He is therefore doubly aggrieved.</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-5\">The second objection is that the writ should have been obtained before the board of auditors had delivered its accounts to the supervisors and adjourned. This ignores section 2125 of the Code of Civil -Procedure, which reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1113-6\">\u201cSubject to the provisions of the next section, a writ of certiorari to review \u25a0a determination must be granted and served, within four calendar months .after the determination to be reviewed becomes final and binding, upon the -relator, or the person whom he represents, either in law or in fact.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1113-7\">In support of this contention the defendants cite several cases, and among them Osterhoudt v. Rigney, 98 N. Y. 222, which reviewed some of the cases cited by them. But in the recent case of People ex rel. Vil. of Brockport v. Sutphin, 166 N. Y. 163, 59 N. E. 770, the -court said that the Osterhoudt Case gave some support to the contention which is made by the present defendants, but that it was a mere expression of opinion, and that the effect of section 2125 was not considered in that case and in the cases upon which the respondent relies; among them, People ex rel. Jonas v. Board of Town Auditors, 49 App. Div. 4, 63 N. Y. Supp. 114, decided by this court. The Court of Appeals referred to People ex rel. Andrus v. Board of Town Auditors, 33 App. Div. 277, 53 N. Y. Supp. 739, and said that the question was -considered in that case, which held (pages 171, 172, 166 N. Y., page 772, 59 N. E.) that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1113-8\">\u201cThe section is not solely a statute of limitations, as by implication it \u25a0grants the relator four months within which to procure a writ in a case, where, although the determining body has finally adjourned after making a \u25a0 disposition of the matter in question, it or its successor, at its next authorized meeting, can obey any order made by the court. We think this is the correct rule, and that the Legislature intended to extend, rather than restrict, the \u2022scope of the writ. It prevents the defeat of an important remedy when the town board disallows a claim, makes and files the certificate, and adjourns -on the same day, whether from proper motives or with the intent to prevent an examination of their official action. The board is a continuous body. Any change in the persons composing it is unimportant, and there is nothing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1086\">*1086</page-number>to prevent it from acting upon the claim in some subsequent year when its previous determination disallowing the claim has been reversed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1114-4\">See, also, People ex rel. Smith v. Schiellein, 95 N. Y. 124.</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-5\">The main question involved in this proceeding is whether the board of audit could audit and approve a claim for -work done on a highway where it was not authorized by the commissioner of highways. In People ex rel. Everett v. Board of Supervisors, 93 N. Y. 397, the court held that to impose liabilities upon towns for the repairs of their roads in any other manner than that provided by the statute would defeat the policy of the law as it had stood in this state for upwards of half a century, and would require explicit statutory provision to authorize it, and that towns are exempt from the burden of any general duty in respect to the care and maintenance of roads. The same doctrine was announced in People ex rel. Van Keuren v. Town Auditors, 74 N. Y. 310, which held that no corporate duty is imposed upon towns in respect of the care or superintendence of highways within their limits, but that this duty was devolved upon the commissioners of highways, who \u201care independent public officers exercising public powers and charged with public duties specially prescribed by law.\u201d These cases were decided before the passage of the highway law (chapter 568, p. 1177, Laws 1890); but I do not find in that law anything which confers power upon the supervisor of the town to repair a highway. On the contrary, section 4 devolves the care and superintendence of the highways upon the highway commissioners of the several towns in the state, and requires them to \u201ccause such highways * * * to be kept in repair, and give the necessary directions therefor.\u201d It is true that section 16 declares that the town shall be liable for damages sustained by reason of any defect in its highways existing because of the neglect of the highway commissioners, but the next section declares the liability of the highway commissioners to the town for the amount of any judgment recovered against the town therefor. So far from changing the law as enunciated in the Everett and Van Keuren Cases, supra, it seems to me that sections 16 and 17 were passed in view of the law as it had been announced by the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-7\">It is no answer that the relator was neglecting his duty in caring for the highway, even if the record made such fact clear \u2014 which it is very far from doing. The only fact alleged by the defendants is that the labor was done in clearing off stones and large bowlders which had been thrown on the highway by a road machine under the supervision of the relator, and in filling up a dangerous hole caused by a washout. How long the stones had been left or the hole had existed does not appear, and it would make no- difference if it had appeared. The duty of caring for and repairing the road rests upon the relator as commissioner of highways, and lor a breach of duty in that respect he would be liable, provided necessary funds for that purpose had been furnished to him. The supervisor and board of audit are not substituted for the court as arbiters of that matter, and they may not usurp the powers or duties of the commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-8\">In my opinion, according to the authorities cited, the supervisor had no power to contract for labor on the highway without consent of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1087\">*1087</page-number>relator as highway commissioner, and the board of audit had no power to audit bills for such work. Therefore their audit of the bills in question should be declared illegal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
