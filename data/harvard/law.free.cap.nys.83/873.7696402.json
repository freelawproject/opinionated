His engagement, as conceded by his counsel upon, the oral argument, was to furnish a horse and wagon to the city and to drive the same for the sum of $3.75 per day. It was within the province of those in charge of the department to terminate such a contract at any time in accordance with its terms. The relator\u2019s application for reinstatement is based upon section 21 of the civil service law (chapter 370, p. 809, Laws 1899), under the claim that he is an honorably discharged exempt fireman; but it is evident from the nature of his engagement that his relations with the municipality are- purely contractual, involving the use of the horse and wagon as well as Iris own services at a lump sum per diem, and that he is, therefore, not, within the meaning of the section cited, a \u201cperson holding a position appointment or employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b902-5\">The order should be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. .All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
