There was evidence that the car was running at the time as rapidly as 15 miles an hour. The only exceptions taken by the defendant were to the refusal of the learned trial justice to nonsuit the plaintiff, and to the evidence referred to as to the speed of the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-12\">Neither exception is availing. As to the first, it is urged that there was no negligence established, inasmuch as the motorman, according to his evidence, discovered the peril as soon as possible, and did everything in his power to avert the collision. This argument overlooks the fact that his credibility was a proper consideration for the jury. Moreover, the negligence asserted consisted in the speed of the car under foggy conditions, but for which the peril, even if not sooner discovered, might have been successfully averted. The question was submitted in a charge which was favorable to the defendant, and which included every request made by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-13\">The witness who testified to the speed of the car was a passenger on the occasion in question, a civil engineer of 11 years\u2019 experience, at one time connected with the railroad business, and accustomed to time the speed of cars by the watch. That such a person was competent to testify to the speed of a car has been frequently held, among other cases in Salter v. Utica &amp; Black River Railroad Co., 59 N. Y. 631; Northrup v. New York, O. &amp; W. R. Co., 37 Hun, 295, 299; Scully v. New York, L. E. &amp; W. R. R. Co., 80 Hun, 197, 30 N. Y. Supp. 61; Strauss v. Newburgh Electric R. Co., 6 App. Div. 264, 39 N. Y.
