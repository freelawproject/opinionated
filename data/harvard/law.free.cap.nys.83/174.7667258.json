The original answer contained several defenses, and in the second defense to the first cause of action the defendant set forth in full certain facts upon which it relied. In the third defense to the first cause of action, and in the second and third defenses to the second cause of action, these facts were set forth by an allegation as follows: \u201cThe defendant repeats and realleges each and every paragraph of the second defense to the first cause of action, with like effect as if here fully set forth.\u201d The plaintiff was successful in having stricken out on motion, as irrelevant and immaterial, certain allegations of the second defense to the first cause of action. As these were thus stricken out, the defendant could no longer refer to them, and therefore, in the other defenses, they were set forth in full. The plaintiff, however, refused to accept the amended answer in this form, claiming that the defendant had no right to insert, in the other defenses mentioned, the allegations which in the second defense to the first cause of action had been stricken out. The court at special term, having agreed in this view, denied the motion made by the defendant to compel the plaintiff to accept the amended answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">We think this was error, and for the reason that allegations which may be irrelevant and immaterial, as they appear in one defense, may, as they appear in another defense, be relevant and material; and, as the plaintiff\u2019s motion was directed merely to striking out the allegations in one defense, the granting of such motion did not necessarily import a decision that they were improper as part of the subsequent defenses. We think, therefore, that, the defendant having in the amended answer omitted the objectionable features of the second defense to the first cause of action, which was the relief which the plaintiff sought on his motion, the latter was not warranted in insisting that such allegations be stricken from the subsequent defenses, but should have accepted the amended answer. It may be that upon a motion these allegations would be deemed irrelevant and immaterial with respect to the subsequent defenses, but upon that question the defendant is entitled to its day in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">The order, therefore, should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion granted, without costs, and with leave to the plaintiff, if he deems himself aggrieved, to move to strike out any objectionable matter contained in the subsequent defenses. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
