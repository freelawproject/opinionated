Theall, in trust for Horace Theall.\u201d The Farmers\u2019 Loan &amp; Trust Company, by order of interpleader, as executor of the will of Horace Theall, deceased, was substituted in place of the bank as defendant. The issues were referred, and from the judgment \u25a0entered upon the decision of the referee the plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-10\">We think the judgment must be reversed for an error committed in excluding the testimony of Mrs. Sarah J. Farrar, the daughter of Mrs. Theall, relating to a conversation between Mrs. Theall and the cashier of the bank at the time the account was opened. Such testimony was excluded upon the ground that it was within the prohibition of section 829 of the Code of Civil Procedure. Whether Mrs. Farrar, the witness whose testimony was objected to, was or was not interested in the event of the controversy, was not made to appear. It was stipulated in the case that she was a beneficiary under the will of Mrs. Theall; but to what extent she was a beneficiary, whether as a legatee or otherwise, was not shown, nor was that fact stipulated. The rule has been frequently stated that one asserting that a witness is incompetent to testify on account of a statutory prohibition has the burden of establishing the disqualification. Griffiths v. Metropolitan St. Ry. Co., 171 N. Y. 106, 63 N. E. 808; Green v. Metropolitan St. Ry. Co., 171 N. Y. 201, 63 N. E. 958, 89 Am. St. Rep. 807; Whitman v. Foley, 125 N. Y. 651, 26 N. E. 725; City of Cohoes v. D. &amp; H. C. Co., 134 N. Y. 397, 31 N. E. 887. Here the witness was a beneficiary of both the plaintiff\u2019s testatrix and defendant\u2019s testator, but, as stated, the nature of her interest in her mother\u2019s estate does not appear. If -entitled only to a specific legacy, the estate may be entirely sufficient to satisfy this claim, in which event she would have no interest in this action] brought by the executor to recover personal property of the deceased. Carpenter v. Soule, 88 N. Y. 251, 42 Am. Rep. 248. Apart, however, from this feature of the case, we do not think that the 'testimony sought to be elicited from Mrs. Farrar related to any per\u2022sonal transaction or communication between herself and the testatrix, .as that phrase \u201cpersonal transaction or communication\u201d has been construed by the decisions. It is unnecessary to refer to the numerous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>cases bearing upon this subject, as they have been very ably and fully-collated and discussed in the recent opinion in Hutton v. Smith, filed in the Court of Appeals on the gth of June, 1903 (not yet officially, reported) 67 N. E. 633, which, as the latest expression of that court, it is our duty to follow. In O\u2019Brien v. Weiler, 140 N. Y. 281, 35 N. E. 587, it was held that a witness was not precluded from testifying to a. conversation between the testator and another in his presence, in which he took no part, although interested in the event. In commenting; upon this decision and the cases cited in its support, Chief Judge-Parker says in Hutton v. Smith, supra, that the rule was too broadly stated, and continues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-5\">\u201cIt has now been limited to this extent, at least: that all conversations' or transactions between persons since deceased and a third party in the presence or hearing of the witness may not be testified to by such witness if\" he by word or sign participated in the transaction or conversation, or is referred to in the course of it, or was in any way a party to it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">We assume, therefore, that, as thus limited, the rule in O\u2019Brien v~ Weiler is still the law in this state; and, as here Mrs. Farrar was-asked only to state the conversation between the cashier of the bank and the deceased, and it does not appear that she had in such conversation, \u201cby word or sign, participated,\u201d or that she was referred to-therein, or that she was a party thereto, she was riot, either under the O\u2019Brien v. Weiler Case, supra, or under the decision in Hutton v-Smith, supra, disqualified.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">For the error, therefore, in excluding her testimony, the judgment must be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
