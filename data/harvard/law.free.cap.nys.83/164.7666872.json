J.</author>\n<p id=\"A56\">This action was brought to recover from the defendant the sum of $400; being, as alleged in the complaint, the proceeds arising from the sale of a horse which had been placed by plaintiff\u2019s assignor in the hands of the defendant to be sold. The defendant answered, the complaint, and, after denying all the allegations of the complaint, set up as a separate defense the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-10\">\u201cDefendant alleges that on or about the 5th day of July, 1902, one Lillian. S. Holmes delivered to defendant a bay gelding for the purpose of having defendant sell said horse on her account for the sum of \u00a7400, less a commission, of 10 per cent, for the services of defendant as the sales agent of said horse;, that thereafter, and on or about July 7, 1902, said defendant sold said horse-for the sum of \u00a7400, and thereafter tendered the plaintiff the sum of \u00a7360 in. full for the amount received by defendant from the sale of the said horse, less his commission of \u00a740, or 10 per cent, of the purchase price of said horse, which purchase price was the sum of \u00a7400; that said tender was refused; that said defendant is ready and willing to pay said plaintiff the sum of \u00a7360, the proceeds of the sale of said horse.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b193-11\">From the contents of certain letters that passed between the parties, and which letters were read in a motion for judgment herein, it seems that said tender consisted of defendant sending plaintiff a postdated check, which was refused and returned to defendant. After the answer was served, the plaintiff, claiming that, under section 511 of the Code of Civil Procedure, he was entitled to a judgment, made a motion at a Special Term of the City Court for judgment, and an order was made allowing plaintiff judgment for the sum of $360 and costs; said order reciting that the plaintiff \u201celected that the action be not continued for the remainder of his claim.\u201d A judgment was entered thereon, and, after issue and return of an execution against the property, a body execution was issued, and from the order denying defendant\u2019s motion to set aside the last-named execution this appeal comes up.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-12\">Plaintiff\u2019s complaint charged conversion, but the defendant urges that the plaintiff, having entered judgment upon the pleadings, must be deemed to have waived the allegations of the complaint, and relied upon those of the answer, and that those allegations constitute a cause of action for money had and received, and nothing more. We think in this the defendant is in error. The answer admits that plaintiff\u2019s assignor placed with the defendant a horse to be sold by him on \u201cher account,\u201d that he sold said horse for $400, and that he tendered the plaintiff $360 in full \u201cof the amount received by the defendant\u201d from the sale of the horse. This sum was, however, never paid. In fact, said sum was never tendered, merely a postdated check being offered plaintiff. Under the more recent de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>cisions, it has been held that \u201cthe relation between a commission agent for the sale of goods and his principal is fiduciary.\u201d Baker v. New York Nat. Exch. Bank, 100 N. Y. 31, 2 N. E. 452, 53 Am. Rep. 150. \u201cProperty thus received is received in a fiduciary capacity, and, when the property is turned into money, that is also received in a fiduciary capacity. It does not belong to the agent, who can lawfully exercise -no power or authority over it, except for the benefit of his principal, and only as authorized by him. If he uses it for his own purposes, * * * it is a conversion of that which does not belong -to him.\u201d Moffatt v. Fulton, 132 N. Y. 507, 515, 30 N. E. 992; Britton v. Ferrin, 171 N. Y. 235, 242, 63 N. E. 954.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">The admissions of the defendant\u2019s answer clearly place him within the purview of the foregoing decisions, and rendered him liable upon the facts as alleged by him in his answer to a judgment, under which, in default of property, his person was liable upon execution. -Order affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">Order affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
