Earl on April 3, 1902, for $300 at three months. The note is a renewal of one made on January 3, 1902, and the defendant asserts, among other defenses, that he indorsed the original note solely for Earl\u2019s accommodation, and that it was delivered to the plaintiff without consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-18\">The evidence tends to show the existence of a debt in favor of the plaintiff and against Earl on January 3, 1902, and that the note was given to secure it; and the main question upon the appeal is whether there must be a new trial because of the undoubted error of the learned court in refusing to charge \u201cthat value is any consideration sufficient to support a simple contract, and an antecedent or pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>existing debt is such value,\u201d and in charging that, \u201cif this note was-given to pay a pre-existing and past-due debt, I charge that it is nofc. a live and valid consideration between the parties.\u201d There was, however, no evidence tending to prove that the note was given to pay the-debt, that the debt was canceled or relinquished in any way, or that time for its payment was extended; and the propositions of law referred to may be regarded, for the purposes of this case, as mere-abstractions. The plaintiff testified positively that the. note of Janu\u2014 ary 3, 1902, \u201cwas not given to me by Mr. Earl for money he had previously borrowed, and for goods he had purchased from me and owed: me for. I gave Mr. Earl money for that note.\u201d Mr. Earl testified.' that he received a check from the plaintiff for the amount of the note-preceding the note in suit, less discount, adding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-5\">\u201cI swear on oath before this jury that I received from Mr. RosemaE.\u00bb $295.50 for that note dated January 3, 1902. I think I received that amount-I can\u2019t say whether any of it went for goods or not. I may not have receive\u00ae!! $295.50 from Mr. Roseman. I will not sweai I did.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">There was other evidence, given by both the plaintiff and Earl\u201e, so contradictory and confused that the jury may very well have believed, especially in view of the fact that no check was produced, that the note was taken as security for a pre-existing debt; but, as I have-said, no one testified or suggested that the debt was given up, or that: the plaintiff relinquished his right to sue upon it for a moment.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-7\">By section 51 of the negotiable instruments law (chapter 612, p-_ 727, Laws 1897) it is provided that \u201can antecedent or pre-existingdebt constitutes value.\u201d Br.: the holder of the note must give up the-debt, either wholly or qualifiedly, in order to constitute consideration-He must part with something; if not with the debt, at least with the: right to sue upon it for some determinate period. The taking of the-debtor\u2019s note raises no presumption that it is in payment of the debt, and there was here no' circumstance or suggestion that the plaintiff extended the time for payment, or did any other act which would have prevented him from surrendering the note and resorting to the original indebtedness. He tried the case on the issue solely of a money consideration given at the time of the taking of the note, without s pretense on the part of any one that it was taken in payment of a debt, and he cannot be permitted to disturb a just result by predicating error upon a refusal to charge upon an issue not embraced within the evidence.

All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
