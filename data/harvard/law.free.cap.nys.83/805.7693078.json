In Stedwell v. Hartmann, 74 App. Div. 126, 77 N. Y. Supp. 498, the agreement expressly provided that everything that was done thereunder by plaintiff\u2019s testator was \u201cto be done at his own expense.\u201d This is the only apparent differ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>ence between the two cases, and is not, we think, sufficient to distinguish the case at bar from the Stedwell Case. Inasmuch as the latter has been affirmed by the Court of Appeals on the opinion below (173 N. Y. 624, 66 N. E. 1117), the opinion of Mr. Justice Patterson must be taken as settling the law, and is a controlling authority in this case for the affirmance of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
