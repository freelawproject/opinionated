From an order granting a temporary crossing, defendants appeal separately.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"AQF\">Affirmed.</disposition>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b336-12\">This is a special proceeding under section 12 of the railroad law (Laws 1890, p. 1082, c. 565, as amended by Laws 1892, p. 1382, c. 676), in which the petitioner prays for the appointment of commissioners to ascertain and determine the amount of compensation to be made by the. petitioner to the defendants for the right to intersect the track of the defendants at grade upon \u25a0Chestnut street in the village of Cooperstown, and to fix the line or lines, grade or grades, point or manner of such intersections and connections. The petitioner is a street-surface railroad corporation operating its road by electricity from the village of Oneonta to the village of Richfield Springs through the village of Cooperstown. The defendant the Cooperstown &amp; Susquehanna Valley Railroad Company is the owner of a single-track railway operated from Cooperstown to Cooperstown Junction, a distance of about 16 miles, and its railway is leased to the defendant the Cooperstown &amp; Charlotte Valley Railroad Company, who operates it as a steam railroad. The line of the petitioner\u2019s electric road crosses the line of the defendant\u2019s steam road at Chestnut street in the village of Cooperstown, as above stated, and all that is necessary to make the track of petitioner\u2019s road a continuous one between the village of Oneonta and the village of Richfield Springs is the construction of about 50 feet of track across the single track of the defendants\u2019 railroad where their lines cross at Chestnut street aforesaid. Without the construction of such 50 feet, petitioner would be compelled to transfer all its passengers going in either direction from a car on its track on one side of the defendants\u2019 track to a car on its track on the other side of defendants\u2019 track, at great expense to it and great inconvenience to the traveling public.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b336-13\">In June, 1902, the petitioner applied to the State Board of Railroad Commissioners under section 68 of the railroad law to determine whether the petitioner\u2019s track should cross the defendants\u2019 track above, below, or at grade \u25a0of the steam railroad track. The defendant lessee appeared in opposition to such application. After several hearings the board rendered a decision October 3, 1902, authorizing a crossing over appellant\u2019s track and roadbed at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>grade, upon compliance with certain conditions mentioned in such decision. The decision of the Board of Railroad Commissioners was not appealed from. The petitioner alleges here that it has been unable to agree with the defendants or either of them upon the amount of compensation to be made for crossing their road, or upon the lines, grades, points, or manner of such intersection, and alleges that the defendants refuse to negotiate concerning the said intersection or otherwise, and refuse to allow the petitioner to carry out or comply with the decision of the said State Board of Railroad Commissioners. In the answer of the defendants each of them admits that it has refused and refuses to allow the petitioner to carry out or comply with the decision of the said State Board of Railroad Commissioners of October 3, 1902. Upon suclr refusal of the defendants the petitioner commenced this proceeding, and applied to the Special Term upon its petition and affidavit, and on an order to show cause, granted and served February 26, 1903, returnable March 2, 1903, for the order prayed for as above stated under section 12 of the railroad law. On the return of said order to show cause the defendants appeared, and filed numerous preliminary objections to the jurisdiction, of the court and to the sufficiency of the papers as a foundation for the application. These preliminary objections were overruled. Defendants thereupon served answers raising numerous issues, and the court made an order of reference to a referee to hear and determine all the issues raised by these answers. The court also upon the same day upon these papers and a further affidavit granted an order to show cause why a temporary crossing should not be granted to the petitioner pursuant to chapter 239, p. 463, of the Laws of 1893, which order to show cause was made returnable on the 4th day of March, 1903. On that day the matter was adjourned to the 10th of March, 1903, when the court, after overruling preliminary objections again made to the jurisdiction of the court, granted the order pursuant to chapter 239, p. 463, Laws 1893, providing for a temporary crossing upon the petitioner\u2019s filing the bond provided for by the law. From that order this appeal is taken, and the appellants state in their notice of appeal that they intend to bring up for review all the intermediate orders.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b337-3\">Argued before PARKER, P.

The answer to this, it seems to me, is that the proceeding is not one commenced or required by law to be conducted under the condemnation law. It is true that section 12 of the railroad law requires that the commissioners should \u201cbe appointed by the court as ris provided in the condemnation law,\u201d but nowhere is it provided that the proceeding should be commenced and conducted under such law, and it has been expressly held that the condemnation law does not govern the proceeding. Matter of Lockport &amp; Buffalo R. R. Co., 77 N. Y. 557. This proceeding, therefore, could have been commenced by the service upon the defendants of the petition and the usual eight days\u2019 notice of the motion or application which it was proposed to make to the court, and instead of such notice of motion the court or justice had the power, under section 780 of the Code of Civil Procedure, upon an affidavit showing grounds therefor, to make an order to show cause, returnable in less than eight days. The orders to show cause in this case were each based upon sufficient affidavits showing the grounds and the necessity for a less time for the hearing than would be required by giving the usual notice of motion, and were each, I think, properly granted. The case last cited is also an authority that the petition need not state the matters required by the condemnation law in a proceeding to acquire title to lands. Judge Earl, in writing the unanimous opinion of the Court of Appeals in that case, says (at page 561):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-6\">\u201cWhat, then, must the petition state? Obviously that the petitioner is a corporation, that the route of its road as laid down by it crosses the other road, and that it desires to cross or intersect such road, specifying the place, \u25a0and that the two corporations \u2018cannot agree upon the amount of compensation to be made therefor, or the points and manner of such crossings and connections.\u2019 \u201d 1</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">In Matter of Saratoga Electric Ry. Co., 58 Hun, 287,12 N. Y. Supp. 318, it was held that because of an amendment to the law (Laws 1884, p. 309, c. 252) it was also essential to allege in the petition that the requisite consents of property owners and municipal authorities to the construction of the road had been procured. In the case at bar it is alleged in the petition not only that the petitioner had received such consents, but that its road was actually in operation on both sides and up to the point of intersection with defendants\u2019 road. In addition to this, all the facts mentioned in the above quotation from Judge Earl\u2019s opinion are alleged. The petition is clearly sufficient to confer jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">The decision of the Board of Railroad Commissioners under section 68 of the railroad law does not, in my opinion, serve as a bar to the application for the order for the temporary crossing. That de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>cisi\u00f3n related to a permanent crossing, and as to whether such crossing should be above, below, or at grade, and to the expense thereof. It determined that such permanent crossing should be at grade, and that the relator should bear the entire expense of the construction and maintenance of it. Section 68 gives to such board authority to determine those questions, and those only. For these reasons the decision is not a bar to the granting of the order for <em>tbf </em>provisional or temporary crossing. So far as the provisions of chapter 239, p. 463, of the Laws of 1893, and of section 12 of the railroad law are not inconsistent with section 68 of the railroad law, they remain in full force, for the reason that the repealing clause contained in Laws 1897, p. 794, c. 754, which added section 68 to the railroad law, was only of \u201call acts and parts of acts inconsistent with this act.\u201d Id. \u00a7 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-3\">The Appellate Division in the Fourth Department has recently decided that section 1, c. 239, p. 463, of the Laws 1893, was not inconsistent with chapter 754, p. 794, of the Laws of 1897, as amended by chapter 739, p. 1590, of the Laws of 1900 (section 68, Railroad Law), and therefore was not repealed by it, and we agree with that conclusion. Olean Street Railroad Co. v. Penn. R. R. Co., 75 App. Div. 412, 78 N. Y. Supp. 113. Neither is section 12 of the railroad law, so far as the petitioner has sought relief under it \u2014 that is, so far as it authorizes the appointment of commissioners by the court to determine the amount of compensation to be made by one road for intersecting another, and the manner of such intersection \u2014 at all inconsistent with section 68 of that law and therefore can stand with it. The petitioner, therefore, had the right to invoke the aid of both these laws in this proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">I think, for the reasons already given, that the court had the jurisdiction and power to make the order appealed from. More than this, I think such order was right under the circumstances appearing here. The petitioner had the right under the law to have its road cross and intersect that of the defendants. Railroad Law, \u00a7 4, subd. 5. After the Board of Railroad Commissioners had determined that such crossing-should be at grade, and the petitioner had attempted to agree with the defendants upon the grades, points, and manner of the intersection and the amount of compensation to be made therefor, and the defendants had refused to allow the petitioner to proceed under the decision of such board, the petitioner had, of necessity, if it was not to be defeated entirely in its efforts to secure such crossing, to apply to the Special Term, as it did, under section 12 of the railroad law, for the appointment of commissioners to determine said matters, concerning which it was unable to agree with the defendants. When, on such application coming on, the defendants served answers denying the right of the petitioner to any crossing, and raising issues concerning most of the matters alleged in the petition, the petitioner, in order to avoid the delay incident to the trial of the issues thus raised, was justified in resorting to the court for permission to make a temporary crossing under section 1, p. 463, c. 239, Laws 1893. Olean St. R. Co. v. Penn. R. R. Co., 75 App. Div. 412, 78 N. Y. Supp. 113. That section provides for relief in just such a case as this, and the purpose of the statute in permitting an application for a temporary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>crossing was evidently to enable a street railroad company to avoid the delay in laying its tracks which otherwise would result from awaiting the trial of issues so raised. Geneva &amp; W. R. Co. v. N. Y. C. &amp; H. R. R. Co., 90 Hun, 9, 35 N. Y. Supp. 339.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">The criticism made by the appellants upon the order granting the temporary crossing, that by it such crossing is permitted without compliance with sorqe of the conditions imposed by the determination of the State Board of Railroad Commissioners for the permanent crossing at grade, has no force in view of the fact that the Special Term required the bond given by the petitioners before granting the temporary crossing to be conditioned upon full and faithful performance by\" the petitioner of all conditions which may be imposed upon it by such board pursuant to section 68 of the railroad law.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">It appears that after the answers had been served, and after the granting, but before the return, of the order to show cause why a temporary crossing should not be permitted, the defendants, through their attorneys,, consented in writing that the engineer of the Board of Railroad Commissioners, or any engineer it may designate, \u201cshall determine the point of crossing by said plaintiff at Chestnut street, -such consent to be without prejudice to any of the other questions raised or presented upon either of the applications herein.\u201d The purpose of this carefully guarded consent, coming so late and at the time it did, was undoubtedly to influence the court favorably towards the defendants\u2019 position; but it is not apparent how it could facilitate in any way the early consummation of the petitioner\u2019s right to a crossing, in view of the fact that all the issues raised by the answers, including that raised by the defendants\u2019 denial of petitioner\u2019s right to cross their track at all, remained to be tried. The court was right in not permitting this consent to stand in the way of granting the order for the temporary crossing.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">The appeal here not being from a final order in a special proceeding, the specification in the notice of appeal of an intention to bring up the intermediate orders for review is not effective for that purpose. Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7\u00a7 1301, 1358.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">What has been said concerning the orders to show cause was made necessary by the alleged want of jurisdiction in the court to make the order appealed from.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-9\">The order should be affirmed, with $10 costs and printing disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
