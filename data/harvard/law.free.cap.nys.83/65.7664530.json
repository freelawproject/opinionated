In that store were certain shelves and counters used for the storage of goods. Some of these were entirely loose, to be placed anywhere in the store, and it is stipulated that \u201cthe counters and shelving and office fixtures were not framed or built with or into the building insured, and were capable of being easily removed without injury to them or to the building.\u201d The policy was written upon a standard blank policy which contained this printed clause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-12\">\u201cThis company shall not be liable for * * * nor unless liability is specifically assumed hereon for loss to awnings * * * store or office furniture or fixtures.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b93-13\">The property described in the policy, and written in, was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-14\">\u201cOn his brick, metal and asphalt roof building, including gas, steam and water pipes, and all other permanent fixtures contained therein, occupied for stores, offices and other hazardous and extrahazardo\u00fas purposes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b93-15\">The determination of this controversy depends upon the construction which should properly be given to the expression \u201call other permanent fixtures contained therein.\u201d If this expression should properly be deemed to include the shelving and counters which were thus attached to the store building, the plaintiff is right in his contention; otherwise the defendants must prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-16\">The defendants admit at the outset that, if there be an ambiguity in this contract, it must be construed against the insurers. They insist, however, that there is no substantial ambiguity which authorizes the application of this rule of interpretation. The provision in the contract exempting the defendants from liability \u201cfor store and office furniture or fixtures unless .liability is specifically assumed thereon\u201d protects the defendants from liability for the loss of this shelving and these counters unless the plaintiff can point to some other clause which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>creates a specific assumption of liability^ for loss thereon. In the description of the property named as insured is included gas, steam, and water pipes, \u201cand all other permanent fixtures contained therein.\u201d It is a familiar rule of interpretation of contracts that words must be construed in the light of other words in connection with which they are used. The words \u201call other permanent fixtures\u201d are used in connection with such fixtures as gas, steam, and water pipes. It would seem to me to do violence to this rule of interpretation to hold that these store fixtures, which it has been stipulated could be easily removed without injury to them or to the building, were of the same class of permanent fixtures as gas, water, and steam pipes. If they are not, the plaintiff has failed to point out where liability therefor has been specifically assumed in the contract of insurance, and the defendants are relieved from liability under the general clause of their contract which exempts from liability for \u201coffice or store furniture or fixtures.\u201d I am of opinion, therefore, that judgment must be directed for the defendants, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
