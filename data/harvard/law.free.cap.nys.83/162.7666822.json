The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff for $125.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">I am of the opinion that this charge was erroneous. Plaintiff was, in effect, simply a tenant of the stateroom that he had hired from the defendant for a night. He was kept out of what might be called the premises that had been demised to him by the defendant, and was entitled to recover no more than what he had paid for the use of the room or the value of the room for the term that he had hired it. The action was one simply for a breach of the contract of hiring. It was said in Jacobs v. Sire, 4 Misc. Rep. 398, 23 N. Y. Supp. 1063, that in actions for breach of contract, with a single exception, the amount recovered is limited to the actual damage caused by the breach, and that the measure of damage is the same, whether the defendant fails to comply with his contract through inability, or willfully disregards it. The amount of the verdict shows that the defendant was injured by the above-mentioned charge of the court. The cases referred to by the counsel for the respondent, like Day v. Wordworth, 13 How. 363, 14 L. Ed. 181, and Voltz v. Blackmar, 64 N. Y. 440, are actions in tort, in which class of actions it is -well settled that under certain circumstances the jury may give punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">I do not consider it necessary to pass upon the point raised by the defendant that the reservation printed upon the back of the ticket given by the defendant to the plaintiff was a reasonable regulation, because I am of the opinion that the plaintiff was entitled to have the use of the room, or to have the money that he had paid for the use of the room refunded to him. Judgment is reversed, with costs to the appellant, and a new trial ordered, unless plaintiff stipulates to reduce the judgment to $3 and costs, in which event the judgment so modified is affirmed, without costs to either party in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">\u25a0 Judgment reversed, with costs to appellant, and new trial ordered, unless plaintiff stipulates to reduce judgment to $3 and costs, in which .event judgment so. modified is affirmed, without costs.
