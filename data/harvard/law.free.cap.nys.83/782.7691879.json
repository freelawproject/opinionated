Upon this question is cited the case of the People v. Dumar, 106 N. Y. 502, 13 N. E. 325; and the doctrine is reiterated in People v. Klipfel, 160 N. Y. 371, 54 N. E. 788; People v. Peckens, 153 N. Y. 576, 47 N. E. 883; People v. Helmer, 154 N. Y. 596, 600, 49 N. E. 249; People v. Willis, 158 N. Y. 392, 396, 53 N. E. 29. The indictment in its first paragraph clearly charges the crime, for it makes the charge in the words of the statute,, and this has many times been held sufficient. Phelps v. People, 72 N. Y. 334; People v. West, 106 N. Y. 293, 12 N. E. 610, 60 Am. Rep-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>452; People v. Herlihy, 66 App. Div. 534, 73 N. Y. Supp. 236, affirmed on opinion below, 170 N. Y. 584, 63 N. E. 1120.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">The question, then, comes to the acts constituting the crime, and reference to the second paragraph of the indictment shows that it is alleged that the defendants on a given day \u201cdid feloniously outside the race course authorized by law, engage * * * in pool selling and selling pools upon the result of a trial and contest of speed and power of endurance of horses\u201d on the day named. This, we think, is a sufficient statement of the acts constituting the crime. In the Herlihy Case, supra, a demurrer was interposed to the indictment, which charged the plaintiff with failure to suppress houses of ill fame, on the ground that the statement of facts constituting crime was not sufficient. The Appellate Division, First Department, said the meaning of the words \u201chouses of ill fame\u201d is well understood, and these words of themselves, irrespective of other description, are sufficient in an indictment charging an officer with omission of duty in respect thereto ; where a statute defines a crime, it is sufficient in respect thereto. The opinion further states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-6\">\u201cWhile I am of the opinion that the words \u2018houses of ill fame\u2019 would, have been sufficient without any further description, it certainly does not take from the sufficiency of the statement of the acts constituting the crime to add thereto a statement of acts which constitute the houses of the character described.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b812-8\">The indictment was upheld, and the judgment affirmed in the Court of Appeals upon the opinion of Mr. Justice McLaughlin. The Century Dictionary defines the term \u201cengage\u201d as \u201cto take part, as to engage in conversation.\u201d The term \u201cpool selling and selling pools\u201d can have no equivocal meaning, and has such a place in the language as to define the act with as great 'clearness as is true of houses of ill fame. The word is not only used in the statute, but is employed in the ninth section of article 1 of the Constitution, where it is provided \u201cthat no pool selling, bookmaking or other kind of gambling shall be authorized or allowed.\u201d It is clear, therefore, that sufficient facts are stated to constitute the crime. A statement of more than this indictment contains would lead to the pleading of evidence; that this is unnecessary has long been established both in criminal and civil procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-9\">The respondents contend, as well, that the indictment is not sufficient to enable them properly to prepare for trial, and suggest that, if this indictment was not challenged by way of a demurrer, many sets of facts might be put in evidence by the prosecution; such as that the defendants contributed the capital for the enterprise; that defendants formed a corporation for the purpose; that they employed agents through whom they committed the act; that defendants or one of them kept watch to prevent those actually engaged from being apprehended; that the defendants gave money to another to carry on the enterprise; and that they acted as solicitors for the principals. It must be considered as now settled that, if these defendants believe that they are insufficiently advised as to the particular facts that will be proven to make out against them a case under the statute, their remedy is by a bill of particulars. Judge Cullen, speaking for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>Court of Appeals in the recent case of People v. Stedeker, 175 N. Y. 61, 67 N. E. 132, says that it is unnecessary that an indictment specify the particular house or building in New York City in which the defendants were charged -with keeping and occupying a room for the purposes forbidden by section 351 of the Penal Code, and uses this language :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-5\">\u201cIf there were any question as to the particular place where it is charged that the offense had been committed by which the appellants could be in any way misled or prejudiced in then</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">Wharton\u2019s Criminal Pleadings and Procedure, \u00a7 702, announces a similar doctrine:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-7\">\u201cWherever the indictment is so general as to give the defendant inadequate notice of the charge he is expected to meet, the court, on his application, will require the prosecution to furnish him with a bill of particulars of the specific charge to be pressed or the evidence intended to be relied on.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b813-8\">The claim that the indictment is invalid for duplicity cannot be sustained. Where an offense may be committed by doing one or more of several things, the indictment may in a single count allege them together, and conviction may be had on proof of commission of any one of the things, without proof of the commission of the others. Bork v. The People, 91 N. Y. 5; People v. Harris, 123 N. Y. 70, 25 N. E. 317. Here the indictment charges that the defendants did \u201cengage, aid, assist and abet in pool selling and selling pools.\u201d In the Herlihy Case, supra, it was charged that defendant, between the 22d day of September and the 18th day of November, 1900, allowed 109 houses of prostitution to flourish, and yet it was held that the indictment charged one offense. This court has recently had occasion to pass upon a similar question in People v. Kane, 43 App. Div. 472, 61 N. Y. Supp. 195, 632. The court said, by Mr. Justice Jenks in the court below:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-9\">\u201cThe fact that the statute is expressed in disjunctives, while the indictment employs conjunctives \u2014 violating \u2018and\u2019 evading \u2018and\u2019 committing a fraud \u2014 is not fatal. Aside from the grave question whether a statutory misdemeanor can be charged in the disjunctive, it is clear that a charge in the form followed is well made. The pleader may allege all breaches in a single count, employing \u2018and\u2019 where the statute reads \u2018or,\u2019 and there is no duplicity, and the crime will be established upon proof of any one of the infractions. 1 Bish. New Cr. Proc. \u00a7\u00a7 434, 586; Whart. Cr. Pl. &amp; Pr. \u00a7 228; Bork v. People, 91 N. Y. 5; People v. Davis, 56 N. Y. 95; People v. Wicks, 11 App. Div. 539 [42 N. Y. Supp. 630]; People v. Smith (Gen. Sess.) 5 N. Y. Supp. 22.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b813-10\">It follows, therefore, that the indictment is good, and that the judgment appealed from should be reversed. All concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"\u00b6\" orphan=\"true\">\n<p id=\"b810-19\"> 1. See Indictment and Information, vol. 27, Cent. Dig. \u00a7 292.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
