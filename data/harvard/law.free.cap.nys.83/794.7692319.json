The clause reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b823-9\">\u201cIf any of my grandchildren should ever renounce the Hebrew Faith, such \u25a0grand child shall be disinherited and deprived of all provision under this Will.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b823-10\">It is not contended that any one of the grandchildren has apostatized or threatens to do so. The question has not arisen, nor is there any evidence that there is any probability of its being aught but academic. The purpose of the action is entirely foreign to the clause or to anything bearing upon it, and I see no reason why the court should grasp out to construe it. Horton v. Cantwell, 108 N. Y. 255, 266, 15 N E. 546. If the question were necessarily before the court for corn \u25a0struction, I am not prepared to say that the clause is illegal. I think that it has never been directly adjudicated in this state. But in England, Hodgson v. Halford, L. R. 11 Ch. Div. 959, and Ex Part Mary Dickson, 1 Sim. N. S. 37, are authorities which go far to sustain its validity. The latter authority is mentioned in Hogan v. Curtin, 88 N. Y. 162,170, 42 Am. Rep. 244, in the learned discussion upon conditions and their validity, by Andrews, C. J. The fact that there is no devise over is to be read in connection with the latter part of the same-learned opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-11\">The judgment should be modified by striking therefrom the adjudication as to the validity of the seventeenth clause, and, as thus modi.-fied, affirmed, without costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
