The action was settled before trial. The defendant claims that the understanding was that, upon the settlement being made, he should have $500 net, and that the whole of the plaintiffs\u2019 compensation for their services should be paid by the railroad company, if paid at all. The plaintiffs claimed that there was no such agreement, but that the defendant was to pay them a reasonable amount for then-services, in addition to such amount as they could get from the railroad company as their costs and disbursements. The case was submitted to the jury in such manner that, if they had believed the testimony in behalf of the defendant that he was to have $500 net, their verdict would have been for the defendant. The case has been twice tried, and there can be no question that ordinary diligence would have developed what is now claimed to be newly discovered evidence in favor of the defendant. Mr. Goddefroy was the presi\u25a0\u25a0dent and general superintendent of the railroad company, and the claim, as paid, was audited by Mr. Cox, an employ\u00e9 of the company. There was no .apparent reason why they should not have been deemed as important witnesses for the defendant as Mr. Lillie, the treasurer of the company, or Mr. Parshall, its attorney, and, like them, produced as witnesses upon the trial to testify as to their knowledge of the whole transaction. Whether the $300 paid by the railroad company to the plaintiffs as attorneys included claims other than their claim for costs and disbursements in the Wilcox action does not seem to me to be important. The defendant himself entered into negotiations with the railroad company for the settlement of his claim, and agreed \u2022to accept $500. If, as the jury have found, he was still to pay his attorneys twenty per cent, upon the amount he received, it does not avail him that the railroad company paid to the attorneys $300 additional. If the plaintiffs had made the settlement, and had concealed from the defendant that $800 was to be paid by the railroad company, then the question of the items or charges which involved the payment of $300 more than was paid to the defendant would be of importance. I think the verdict of the jury as to the weight -of evidence was conclusive, and that the motion for a new trial should be \u25a0denied, with costs.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b361-9\">Argued before GOODRICH, P.
