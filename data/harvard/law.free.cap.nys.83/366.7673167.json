This conceded relation between the plaintiff and the defendant entitled the plaintiff to compel the defendant to account, and for that reason the plaintiff should not be required to specify the items of the moneys collected by the defendant for the plaintiff and for which the defendant has failed to account.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-17\">The order appealed from should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion denied, with $10 costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
