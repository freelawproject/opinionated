The subdivision stricken out was one alleging as a defense the discharge of the defendant in bankruptcy by an order of the United States District Court made on the nth day of June, 1901, which discharge included the \u25a0claim sued upon.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b348-12\">Argued before PARKER, P.

Y. Supp. 40), they served a supplemental answer containing a provision alleging such discharge. From an order striking out such provision this appeal is taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-17\">The claim sued upon was an unliquidated claim. After the plaintiff had procured judgment upon it, his judgment was reversed by the Court of Appeals and a new trial granted. Thereafter the defendants filed a petition in bankruptcy.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-18\">The bankruptcy act of 1898 provides, in section 63b, Act July 1, 1898, 30 Stat. 562, 563, c. 541 [U. S. Comp. St. 1901, p. 3447], that \u201cunliquidated claims against the bankrupt may, pursuant to application to the court, be liquidated in such manner as it shall direct, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>and may thereafter be proved and allowed against his estate.\u201d Upon an application to the bankruptcy court under that section by the plaintiff, an order was made permitting him to proceed in the state court to liquidate his claim against the estate of the bankrupts, and directing that Clark, the trustee in bankruptcy of the estate of the defendants, be brought in as a party defendant in the action. The plaintiff\u2019s action is therefore continued for the purpose only of \u201cliquidating\u201d or ascertaining the amount of his claim against the defendants. This being the situation, all that there is to try in the action is what amount, if anything, did the defendants owe to the plaintiff before their discharge, in bankruptcy upon the claim sued upon, and the only purpose of determining this is that it may be ascertained how much the trustee in bankruptcy may lawfully allow to the plaintiff in the distribution of the assets of the bankrupts. The fact of bankruptcy is entirely immaterial in determining these questions, and the order striking out of the supplemental answer the allegation of defendants\u2019 discharge in bankruptcy was proper, and should be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
