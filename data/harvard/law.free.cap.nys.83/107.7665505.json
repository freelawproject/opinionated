The defendant was a witness in his own behalf, and the testimony shows that he was a young man who used vile language, associated with other young men of the same class, and lounged with them about drinking places, and that he was accustomed to drink intoxicating liquors, and had on the day in question drank repeatedly. The remarks of the district attorney to the jury at the close of the evidence were taken by the stenographer at the request of the defendant\u2019s counsel. After the charge by the court, requests to charge were made by the defendant\u2019s counsel, and the record thereof, so far as material, is as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b136-5\">\u201cDefendant\u2019s counsel objects, and asks the court to correct the following portions of the district attorney\u2019s summing up: The district attorney\u2019s reference to the defendant\u2019s connection with the \u2018growler gang,\u2019 as being without the evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b136-6\">\u201cThe Court: Yes; there is no evidence of that.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b136-7\">\u201cMr. Woollard: Also to any reference or allusion as to the character of the defendant, on the ground it is not in issue in this case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b136-8\">\u201cThe Court: Character is always in issue when a man is upon trial for a criminal offense; but I do not recall any evidence in this case to show that this man is a man of bad character. We know nothing about his character, whether it is good or bad; and, in the absence of any such evidence, his character is supposed to be reasonably good. That is, there has been nothing brought against him, so far as I can recall, in the evidence, excepting, I think, in response to one inquiry, he said he could not tell whether he had been convicted of intoxication or not. That is the only evidence relating to bad character that there is in the case, that I recall.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b136-9\">\u201cDefendant excepts to the statement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b136-10\">\u201cMr. Woollard: I ask the court to charge they must presume the character of the defendant to be good.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b136-11\">\u201cThe Court: Yes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b136-12\">\u201cMr. Addington: I except to your honor\u2019s charge that the jury must presume the defendant\u2019s character is good, and ask your honor to charge the jury must determine, from all the evidence, whether his character is good or bad.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b136-13\">\u201cThe Court: If there was any evidence upon that subject, that would be so; but, in the absence of any evidence, I think it is fair to a man upon trial that the jury should assume that up to that time \u2014 up to the time of the commission of the offense \u2014 he was a reputable citizen.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b136-14\">\u201cMr. Woollard: We except to that.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b136-15\">\u201cThe Court: That is favorable to you.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b136-16\">\u201cMr. Woollard: Not as favorable as the law contemplates.\u201d</summary>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b136-17\">Argued before PARKER, P.

Webster\u2019s International Dictionary; Simonton v. Winter, 30 U. S. 141, 8 L. Ed. 75. It is the privilege of the accused to put his character in issue, or not. If he does, and offers evidence of good character, then the prosecution may give evidence to rebut or counteract it; but it is not competent for the government to give in proof the bad character of the defendant, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>unless he first opens that line of inquiry by evidence of good character. Colby\u2019s Criminal Law, vol. 2, p. 205. A prisoner on trial may show what his reputation is, and then the question is open to the prosecution, and for the jury to determine, like other controverted facts. But, if the prisoner chooses to give no evidence on the subject, the jury are not at liberty to indulge in conjecture that his character is bad, in order to infer that he is guilty of the particular crime charged. Good character is a shield, which the prisoner may use, if he has it; but, if he is content to leave his character entirely out of the. case, the jury are not thence to infer that it is bad. Under such circumstances, the general character of the accused is hardly a subject to be considered by the jury, and they should determine the guilt or innocence of the accused upon the evidence before them, and wholly irrespective of the question of general character. People v. Bodine, 1 Denio, 281-314. To admit evidence of bad character against the accused, it is necessary that he shall have already put his character clearly and expressly in issue. Underhill on Criminal Evidence, \u00a7 78.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">It is a fundamental principle of the criminal law that the character of the defendant cannot be impeached or attacked by the state, unless he puts his character in evidence, either by becoming a witness in his own behalf, or by offering evidence in support of his character. Hughes\u2019 Criminal Law and Procedure, \u00a7 3155. Where an accused becomes a witness in his own behalf, he may be cross-examined, the same as any other witness, and his character for truth and veracity may be considered in determining the weight to be given to his testimony, and within the discretion of the trial court he may be asked as to specific facts which tend to discredit him, or to impeach his moral character as bearing upon credibility. Abbott\u2019s Trial Brief (Criminal Causes) \u00a7 396 et seq. The admission of evidence bearing upon the credibility of the accused as a witness in his own behalf does not make the defendant\u2019s character an issue upon the trial, or justify the jury in taking the character of the accused into consideration in determining whether he is guilty of the particular crime charged. General character only can be considered in determining the guilt or innocence of an accused. It is general character alone which can afford any test of general conduct, or raise a presumption that the person who had maintained a fair reputation down to a certain period would not then begin to act an unworthy part; and therefore proof of particular transactions in which the prisoner may have been concerned is not admissible. Colby\u2019s Criminal Law, vol. 2, p. 204. The refusal of the court to charge, as requested by the defendant\u2019s counsel, that the character of the defendant was not in issue in this case, and the charge that \u201ccharacter is always in issue when a man is upon trial for a criminal offense,\u201d was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">It is claimed by the respondent that the subsequent remarks of the court to the jury corrected the error, if <em>any, </em>in said general statement. The subsequent remarks of the court in substance were that the jury must presume the defendant\u2019s character to be good; but, if they found that there was any evidence relating to the defendant\u2019s character, then they could determine whether his character was good or bad. All of the statements of the court are confirmatory of the first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>general statement on the subject of character. The jury were not told that general character alone could be considered in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant, nor that, as evidence of general character had not been given, his character was not in issue; nor were they told that the evidence received relating to the defendant should only be considered in determining the weight to be given to his testimony. The jury clearly were left with the understanding that they could determine whether there was any evidence, either general or relating to specific acts, affecting the defendant\u2019s character, and that such evidence,'if any, could be considered by them in determining whether he was guilty as charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">For the reason stated, the judgment of conviction should be reversed, and a new trial granted. All concur, except CHESTER, J., who dissents.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
