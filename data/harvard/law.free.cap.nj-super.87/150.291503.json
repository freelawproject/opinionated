A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"AWa\">This is an appeal by the City of Camden from a final decision of the New Jersey Civil Service Commission, reinstating Urquhart Ward in his position as senior plumbing inspector of the city, with full back pay, and holding \"'illegal\u201d section 12.9 of the Camden Administrative Code, which requires each appointive officer and employee of the city to retire \"upon attaining seventy years of age.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">Ward was appointed senior plumbing inspector in May 1948 and continued in that position until his services were terminated by written notice effective July 25, 1963, given pursuant to section 12.9 of the Administrative Code. Ward\u2019s dismissal was based solely on the fact of his age and the code provision. The city makes no claim that Ward has any physical or mental disability that would interfere with the performance of his duties. So far as the record shows, the services rendered by Ward as senior plumbing inspector have always been satisfactory.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">Camden is subject to the provisions of the Civil Service Act, <em>N. J. S. A. </em>11:1-1 <em>et seq., </em>and Ward had tenure rights thereunder. His appointment was not for a fixed term. The city contends it is operating under the Eaulkner Act, <em>N. J. S. A. </em>40:69A-1 <em>et seq., </em>and by virtue of <em>N. J. S. A. </em>40:69A-29 has the authority to require retirement of its employees at age 70, regardless of any tenure rights enjoyed by them under the Civil Service Act. Stated otherwise, the city argues that the Civil Service Act does not pre-empt the field of removal of employees by municipalities, and that the jurisdiction of the Civil Service Commission is restricted to cases of removal \u201cfor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>cause.\u201d The city concedes that age is not <em>per se </em>a valid cause for removal of a civil service employee under the Civil Service Act. The city maintains further that mandatory retirement of a public employee at age 70 is not unreasonable, arbitrary or capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">Ward was not subject to any contributory pension fund law under wdiieh his retirement might have been effected. However, at the discretion of the city, he could have been retired and granted a noncontributory pension under <em>N. J. S. A. </em>43 :8B\u20141 <em>et seq. </em>Ward was eligible under that statute because he was \u201cat least 65 years of age,\u201d <em>N. J. S. A. </em>43 :8B-4, and had \u201cat least 15 years of employment continuously\u201d with the city, <em>N. J. S. A. </em>43 :8B-5. The city chose not to retire Ward under this act and had no intention of giving him any pension thereunder. This was confirmed by the city at oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\"> We are not here concerned with the wisdom of mandatory retirement at age 70. Much can be said in favor of and in opposition to such a policy. See 279 <em>Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science </em>72 (1952). The single issue which requires our attention is whether our Legislature has delegated to the city the power to impose a mandatory age retirement upon its senior plumbing inspector who has enjoyed tenure protection under the Civil Service Act. The city admits that no such authority exists under that law. Superannuation is not <em>per se </em>a valid cause for the removal of an employee under the Civil Service Act. The city also concedes that Ward\u2019s retirement was not effected under any retirement pension plan statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">The sole claim of statutory authority asserted by the city for establishing the policy of mandatory retirement at age 70 is <em>N. J. S. A. </em>40 :69A-29(a). This section of the Faulkner Act gives to municipalities operating under its provisions full power to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-8\">\u201corganize and regulate its internal affairs, and to establish alter, and abolish offices, positions and employments and to define the functions, powers and duties thereof and fix their term, tenure and compensation;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b172-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>True, this section does give a municipality full power to fix the \u201ctenure\u201d of its employees, but the same statute expressly makes that power \u201csubject to the provisions of this act or other general laws.\u201d As defined in <em>N. J. S. A. </em>40 :69A-28, a \u201cgeneral law\u201d is any law or provision of law \u201cwhich is by its terms applicable or available to all municipalities.\u201d The Civil Service Act is such a general law. Therefore, the power of a municipality, operating under the Faulkner Act, to fix the \u201ctenure\u201d of its employees is subject to the tenure rights of employees under the Civil Service Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">The city argues that \u201cif there exists a direct and expressed conflict between the Civil Service Act and the Faulkner Act, the latter will control.\u201d In support of that proposition, it cites <em>City of Newark v. Department of Civil </em>Service, 68 <em>N. J. Super. </em>416 <em>(App. Div. </em>1961), and <em>Raphalides v. Civil Service, </em>80 <em>N. J. Super. </em>401 <em>(App. Div. </em>1963). In these eases we considered whether <em>N. J. S. A. </em>40:69A-166, a section of the Faulkner Act, was in conflict with the Civil Service Act. That section provided that any person convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude would be ineligible toi hold a municipal office or position in a municipality governed by the Faulkner Act, and that conviction of such an offense while in office would cause a forfeiture of such office. We held that this definite provision in the Faulkner Act, covering particular subject matter, would prevail over a general tenure provision in the Civil Service Act. <em>N. J. S. A. </em>40:69A-166 was not so much in conflict with <em>Title </em>11, <em>\u201cCivil Service,\u201d </em>as it was supplementary thereof, in that it added conviction of a crime involving moral turpitude as another \u201ccause\u201d for removal from office. These cases do not aid the city\u2019s position herein because they involved a clearly expressed legislative enactment about which there could be no doubt as to the legislative intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">The city contends that <em>Kennedy v. City of Newark, </em>29 <em>N. J. </em>178 (1959), supports its position. In <em>Kennedy, </em>the Supreme Court upheld an ordinance of the City of Fewark which required its employees to reside within the city. However, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>the court pointed out therein, that ordinance did not relate to \u201cwork requirements\u201d or \u201cmerit and fitness.\u201d (at <em>p. </em>190) It concerned only regulations relating to the common good. It was not in conflict with the Civil Service Act because <em>Civil Service Rule </em>59, listing the causes for loss of tenure, includes the violation of official and reasonable local regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">Furthermore, in <em>Messano v. Bd. of Education of Jersey City, </em>32 <em>N. J. </em>561 (1960), the Supreme Court referred to the <em>Kennedy </em>case and noted that there was a distinction between a reasonable residence requirement, which employees \u201cmay satisfy while continuing in their public employment,\u201d and a mandatory retirement for age provision \u201cwhich automatically terminated the plaintiff\u2019s public employment without hearing or showing of cause.\u201d For the latter, the Supreme Court held that express statutory authority is required. Since such authority was found lacking in <em>Messano, </em>the board\u2019s dismissal of Messano, its secretary, on the sole group d that he was 65 years old, a mandatory retirement age fixed by rule of the board, was declared invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">In <em>Messano, </em>as here, the dismissal was without <em>recourse </em>to any pension. Compare <em>Board of Education of Jersey City v. Cuff, </em>38 <em>N. J. </em>430 (1962), wherein the board dismissed certain school employees on the ground that they had reached the board\u2019s retirement age of 65. In doing so, the board effectually retired thorn under <em>N. J. S. A. </em>43 :8B\u20141 <em>el seq., </em>the Noncontributory Public Employees Pension Act. As the Supreme Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-7\">\u201cThe Board\u2019s action was in reality a mandatory retirement for age under a uniform policy and insofar as the 5 employees in question were concerned it was a lawful retirement on pension within the terms of the pertinent pension act.\u201d (at <em>p. </em>433)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">For that reason, the dismissals in the <em>Cuf </em>case were upheld. In the instant case, the city followed the impermissible procedure pursued in <em>Messano, </em>rather than the sanctioned method adopted in <em>Cuff.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b174-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>Despite the distinction between <em>Messcmo </em>and <em>Cuff, </em>the Supreme Court expressed in <em>Messano </em>the basic rule in these words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-4\">\u201c* * * in the absence of clear and explicit statutory delegation, a municipal body has no power to impose a mandatory age retirement policy on a public employee who is discharging his duties efficiently and is protected by a general tenure enactment.\u201d (32 <em>N. J., </em>at <em>p. </em>563)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">In doing so, it noted that the judicial decisions in other states are generally in accord with this legal position. See cases cited, 32 <em>N. J., </em>at <em>p. </em>563.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">The retirement of public employees because of age is of great importance both to the governmental agency and the employees. Mindful of this, the Legislature has always taken the pains to fix the retirement age, both mandatory and optional, in clear and precise language. See the various statutes fixing the retirement age, both mandatory and optional, for judges, public school teachers, policemen, firemen, members of contributory pension plans, and other public employees subject to the Noncontributory Pension Fund Act, <em>N. J. S. A. </em>43:8B-1 <em>et seq. </em>The Legislature has never left the matter of retirement for age to the unbridled discretion of a public board or body. Tenure under civil service or other law is too precious a right to be subject to annihilation for age without express legislative sanction. Absent a more clearly expressed authority to do so, we are satisfied that the Legislature never intended to convey such power by <em>N. J. S. A. </em>40:69A-29.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">As indicated above, Camden could have legally retired Ward because of his age pursuant to <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>43:8B-1 <em>et seq., </em>as was done in <em>Board of Education of Jersey City v. Cuff, supra. </em>It chose not to do so. We are left to speculate that it did not want to give Ward the pension allowable under that statute. Yet, that pension could have been a very modest sum. The statute fixes the maximum, not the minimum, amount of the pension. Thus, instead of availing itself of the authority vested in it by <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>43:8B-1 <em>et seq., </em>the city dismissed Ward without any pension and without legal sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>Accordingly, the decision of the Civil Service Commission, restoring Ward to his position as senior plumbing inspector, with full back pay, is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
