Rush as administrator of the estate of Richard Pietrueha, deceased, for counsel fees and other expenses incurred in defending an action brought by the Mongusos.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-12\">Selected issued an automobile liability policy to defendant William Pietrueha, the father of Richard. The policy was obtained by William from defendant David Berman through the \u201cAssigned Risk Plan.\u201d Berman was not an agent of Selected, but a broker. The parties have stipulated that the policy provisions were as hereafter set forth.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-13\">The policy provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-14\">\u201cThe following are insured * \u00ae *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-15\">(a) With respect to the owned automobile</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-16\">(1) The named insured and any resident of the same household,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>(2) any other person using such automobile, provided the actual use thereof is with the permission of the named insured:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-4\">The insurance afforded * * * applies separately to each insured against whom claim is made or suit is brought * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-5\">\u2018Named insured\u2019 means the individual named in Item I of the declaration and also includes his spouse if a resident of the same household;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-6\">\u2018Insured\u2019 means a person or organization described under \u2018Persons Insured\u2019.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">William alone was the \u201cnamed insured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">On June <em>22, </em>1961 Richard, a minor and a member of his father\u2019s household, was involved in an automobile accident while driving the insured vehicle and was instantly killed. Three passengers were in the car with the decedent; two were also killed and one seriously injured. At the time of the accident the policy was in force, and there is no dispute that Richard was covered under the above-stated policy provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-9\">The pertinent notice provisions of the policy were as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-10\">\u201c3. Notice</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-11\">In the event of an accident, occurrence or loss, written notice containing particulars sufficient to identify the insured and also reasonably obtainable' information with respect to time, place and circumstances thereof and the names and addresses of the injured and of available witnesses, shall be given by or for the insured to the company or any of its authorized agents as soon as practicable * * * If claim is made or suit is brought against the insured, he shall immediately forward to the company every demand, notice, summons or other process received by him or his representative * * * <em>% % </em>He <em>% </em>s|s</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-13\">No action shall lie against the company unless, as a condition precedent thereto, the insured shall have fully complied with all the terms of the policy * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b512-14\">Within 24 hours after the accident William notified David Berman of it. However, Berman did not notify Selected. Although not informed by either William or Berman, Selected received notice through one of the persons injured, on July 25, 1961, 33 dajrs after the accident. Selected investigated the matter, obtained statements and, on December 27, 1961, filed answers in this action on behalf of William individually and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>as \u201cGuardian ad Litem and Natural Guardian of the person and property\u201d of Kichard. Selected says it did so reserving its right to disclaim. For the purposes of this opinion, we shall assume that is so. Thereafter Selected disclaimed liability and withdrew from the defense of the litigation on the sole ground that the notice received by it was too late.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">On February 27, 1963 John B. Eush was appointed administrator <em>ad litem </em>of the estate of Bichard; prior to this time there had been no formal appointment of a legal representative of the decedent or his estate. Immediately upon his appointment Eush gave Selected formal notice of the accident and requested it to defend the estate under the terms of the insurance policy. Selected declined. Thereafter he filed third-party complaints against Selected upon the insurance contract and against Berman for failing to inform the company of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">Eush and Selected made cross-motions for summary judgment. The trial court granted Bush\u2019s motion for summary judgment and denied Selected\u2019s, holding that the notice by Eush, even though it was given one year and nine months after the date of the accident, was given \u201cas soon as practicable\u201d under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">Selected appeals not only from the judgment in favor of Eush but also from the denial of its own motion for summary judgment. It claims that notice 33 days after the accident was too late as a matter of law, and the fact that Richard was killed in the accident is immaterial, citing <em>Sawyer v. Travelers Ins. Co., </em>10 <em>F. Supp. </em>848 <em>(D. C. E. D. Va. </em>1935). But see <em>Krauss v. Brooklyn Fire Insurance Co., </em>130 <em>N. J. L. </em>300 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1943); <em>Baylor v. State Mutual Life Assurance Company, </em>113 <em>N. J. L. </em>389, 394-395 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1934); <em>Revell v. Columbian Protection Ass\u2019n, </em>9 <em>N. J. Misc. </em>1311, 157 <em>A. </em>553 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1931); <em>Metropolitan Casualty Ins. Co. of New York v. Johnston, </em>247 <em>F. </em>65, 7 <em>A. L. R. </em>175 (3 <em>Cir. </em>1917); <em>Globe Accident Ins. Co. v. Gerisch, </em>163 <em>Ill. </em>625, 45 <em>N. E. </em>563 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1896); <em>cf. Matthews v. American Central Ins. Co., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>154 <em>N. Y. </em>449, 48 <em>N. E. 751, </em>39 <em>L. R. A. </em>433 <em>(Ct. App. </em>1897).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">Selected argues that William could and should have given timely notice; that indeed William undertook to give that notice, but gave it to Berman who failed to communicate it to Selected. On the other hand, Eush contends that since Eichard was killed, there was no obligation upon anyone to give notice until an \u201cofficial representative\u201d of Eichard\u2019s estate was appointed, no matter how long after the accident that appointment might have been delayed. Eush says in his brief, \u201cCertainly upon his death no one could act in his place except by an official act. The decedent\u2019s rights under this policy should not be cut off by reason of the action or inaction of a volunteer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">We disagree with Selected\u2019s position that the death of an insured is immaterial in determining whether notice was given \u201cas soon as practicable.\u201d On the other hand, the facts of this case do not require us to accept Eush\u2019s position that notice on behalf of a deceased insured need not be given until an \u201cofficial representative\u201d of the deceased or his estate has been appointed, ev\u00e9n though that might not be until years after the accident. We hold that under the facts of this case the notice which Selected did receive from one of the injured parties 33 days after the accident was timely, and redounded to the benefit of Eichard\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">The policy itself draws a distinction between the \u201cnamed insured\u201d and others insured. Under it there may be more than one insured with reference to a given accident, in which case it applies separately to each insured against whom claim is made or suit is brought. In addition, those injured as a result of an accident have an interest in the insurance. The policy provides that notice may \u201cbe given by <em>or for </em>the insured.\u201d Laying aside all questions of timeliness and completeness, if the insurance company receives any notice, it makes no difference who gives it and it is regarded as if given by or for all parties in interest. <em>Costanzo v. Pennsylvania Threshermen &amp; Farmers\u2019 Mutual Casualty Ins. Co., </em>30 <em>N. J. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>262, 272 (1959); <em>Mariani v.

Co., </em>27 <em>F. 2d </em>859, 861 (9 <em>Cir. </em>1928); <em>McClellan v. Mandonti, </em>313 <em>Pa. </em>515, 169 <em>A. </em>760 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1934); <em>Bethlehem Steel Company v.

Idaho </em>1960), it was given by another insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">However, that still leaves the question of the timeliness of a notice. If the insured claiming the benefit of a notice given by another was himself able to give earlier notice, a notice given by such other 33 days after an accident may not be timely. Eor example, if it were William who was suing for counsel fees incurred by him, it might be that, as to him, the 33 days notice was out of time. But here, since Richard was killed and no one had been appointed to represent his estate, the notice given on the 33rd day was timely as to his estate and redounded to its benefit and the benefit of those claiming through it.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
