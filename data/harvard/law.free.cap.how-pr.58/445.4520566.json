He must furnish some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>one who will respond for him in this state. If he cannot, the state does not furnish him means of pursuing a remedy here.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">It seems to me inconsistent with this policy that an irresponsible non-resident should be allowed to sue without even a liability for costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">I am of opinion that the order allowing the plaintiff to sue m <em>forma pauperis </em>should be vacated; but as the action was begun under the order relieving her from costs, &amp;c., she should have an election to discontinue without costs. On this motion she cannot be required to give security.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
