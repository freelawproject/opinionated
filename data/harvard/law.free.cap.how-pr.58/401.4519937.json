Yan Epps to set aside the summons and dismiss the action as to him, on the ground of irregularity, to wit: that the plaintiffs attorney in this action .is and was the attorney of the judgment creditor, in the action and proceedings supplementary to execution therein, by which the plaintiff was appointed receiver of the property, &amp;c., of John G. Yan Epps.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b408-5\">The complaint herein alleges the plaintiff\u2019s appointment .June 26, 1879, and qualification as receiver, &amp;c., on proceedings supplementary to execution, upon a judgment for .$9,715.15, recorded March 10, 1879, by Abram W. Yan Epps against John O. Yan Yan Epps; and alleges \u201cthat the said John C. Yan Epps and his wife (codefendants), Sarah H. Yan Epps, <em>\u2018 </em>conspired together to prevent plaintiff from obtaining rents \u2019 -of certain premises in Rochester, alleged to have been owned by said judgment debtor; and that by reason of such conspiracy and interference with plaintiff\u2019s rights as such receiver, the said Sarah H. Yan Epps received certain rents, and that she, in the same way, had rented certain premises of said judgment debtor and owed therefor, and \u2018 demands judgment for $355 and interest, or for accounting, &amp;c.\u2019 \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b408-6\">The defendant Sarah H. Yan Epps duly answered. The other defendant, John C., without appearing in the action, makes this motion on the irregularity stated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b408-7\">The motion is made upon the summons and complaint and affidavits, which allege in substance, upon information and belief, that no order of court was obtained instructing said plaintiff, receiver, to sue ; that the attorney of record for the plaintiff here was the attorney for the judgment creditor in all the proceedings of said judgment, and is still acting as such attorney; that said attorney also has an assignment of .said judgment, or part thereof, to himself, and has brought .this action at his own prompting instead of that of plaintiff, 'receiver, and for the interest of himself; that the judgment .on which supplementary proceedings were instituted has been .appealed to general term, and the present action is brought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>to harass defendants therein and force a settlement. There was also an affidavit of merits by said John 0. Van Epps.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b409-5\">On the argument plaintiff\u2019s attorney produced an order of court granting plaintiff, as such receiver, the right to bring this action.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b409-6\"><em>Farming &amp; Williams, </em>for motion.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b409-7\">(1.) The motion papers are in pursuance of <em>Branch </em>agt. <em>Harrington </em>(49 <em>How. Pr., </em>196). That case is decisive of this motion; see, also, cases therein cited.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b409-8\">(2.) The principle that an attorney for receiver (as the receiver acts for both debtor and creditor) should be untrammeled rests in public policy.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b409-9\">(3.) The attorney for receiver having, moreover, an assignment of the judgment is the real party in interest, and, hence, comes under the stringent rule.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b409-10\">(4.) The judgment debtor is the only one who can take advantage of the irregularity. It alone affects him. A third party cannot take advantage of it. Hence, his codefendant cannot join in the motion <em>(See Branch </em>agt. <em>Harrington, supra; and Comming </em>agt. Egerton, 9 <em>Bosworth, </em>685).</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b409-11\"><em>Angus McDonald </em>( <em>Wm. E. Edwards, </em>attorney), opposed.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b409-12\">(1.) <em>Branch </em>agt. <em>Harrington </em>(49 <em>How., </em>196) is- a special term decision, and anomalous.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b409-13\">(2.) Both defendants should join in the motion. The action cannot be discontinued as to one because improperly brought, and continued as to the other because properly brought.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b409-14\">(3.) There is a distinction between receivers in equity and those in supplementary proceedings. The receiver is simply the agent of judgment creditors. The rule as applicable to present case is exploded <em>(Bostwick </em>agt. <em>Menk, </em>40 <em>N. Y., </em>383; <em>Becker </em>agt. Torrance, 31 <em>N. Y., </em>641). A receiver in supplementary proceedings is nothing but an execution in equity <em>(Rule </em>85.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b409-15\">Macomber, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AT2\">The motion to set aside the summons and complaint is denied, for the reason that all of the defendants did not join in the application. Ho costs allowed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
