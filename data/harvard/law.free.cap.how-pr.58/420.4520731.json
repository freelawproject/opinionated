O\u2019Connor. John Townshend was her attorney in this action. O\u2019Connor alone interposed an answer to the complaint. Charles L. Halberstadt was the attorney for O\u2019Connor. On the 22d day of June, 1877, O\u2019Connor consented to the entry of judgment against him in open court. The case was never, therefore, actually tried. Judgment was entered against O\u2019Connor, in favor of the respondent, for $224.74 costs, and her attorney issued an execution on this judgment against O\u2019Connor. Garrett J. Byrne claimed to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>the landlord of the defendant, O\u2019Connor, as the affidavit of Hr. Boe states. On this execution against O\u2019Connor, issued on plaintiff\u2019s own judgment, the sheriff was directed by plaintiff\u2019s own attorney to sell the interest of Garrett J. Byrne in the plaintiff\u2019s property. That interest, so far as the papers show, was a claim that he was the landlord. This Josiah Lockwood purchased Garrett J. Byrne\u2019s interest in plaintiff\u2019s property. Plaintiff\u2019s own property was, therefore, sold out on her own judgment by her own attorney, and purchased by this mysterious Lockwood, who now seeks to question her title. On the 14th of January, 1878, plaintiff sold and conveyed the premises in question to Hary L. Sacia, who now owns it. It will, therefore, be seen that the plaintiff has no interest in the action. Beal W. O\u2019Connor and Garrett J. Byrne, the landlord of O\u2019Connor, has no interest in it, and that neither of them make any affidavit in the motion, and no authority is shown authorizing Hr. Boe to appear for either of them. On the 24th of May, 1879, as soon after the entry of the judgment in plaintiff\u2019s favor, for $224.74 costs, as it was possible to perfect title, the silent but diligent and unseen Lockwood, who makes no affidavit in this proceeding, served notice of motion, founded on the affidavit of Mr. Boe alone, and served it on John Townshend. On the 24th of Hay, 1879, Hr. Townshend wrote plaintiff a letter, in which he instructs her to procure another attorney. He says : \u201c I wish you to distinctly understand that I am no longer your attorney. I shall not oppose the motion.\u201d Hr. Boe signs the notice of motion as <em>\u201c </em>defendant\u2019s attorney and attorney for Josiah Lockwood.\u201d In that notice of motion he asks that Lockwood be made a defendant and that a new trial be had on payment by the defendant to the plaintiff, \u201c or her attorney of record,\u201d of costs.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b427-5\"><em>A. J. Roe (AT. G. Moak </em>of counsel), for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b427-6\">I. It was claimed below at general term that the motion should have been made by the defendant\u2019s attorney of record. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>It is clear, however, that after judgment a party may change his attorney without any consent or order <em>(Weeks\u2019 Law of </em>Attorney, 427, 436; <em>Thorp </em>agt. Fowler, 5 <em>Cow., </em>446 ; <em>Trust </em>agt. <em>Repoor, </em>15 <em>How. Pr., </em>570).</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b428-5\">II. Where the prescribed facts are shown to exist, the provisions of law leave no discretion in the court either to deny the motion, or to impose terms other than those prescribed by the statute <em>(Rogers </em>agt. <em>Wing, </em>5 <em>How. Pr., </em>50; <em>Shaw </em>agt. <em>McMarin, </em>2 <em>Hill, </em>417).</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b428-6\">III. In this case, all the prescribed facts were shown. It was shown: (1.) The action was ejectment. (2.) The motion was by the defendant. (3.) The motion was within three years after judgment on a verdict.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b428-7\"><em>Ira P. Warren, </em>for respondent.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b428-8\">I. All the interest Garrett J. Byrne, had in this property, at the time of the commencement of this action, in 1876, as appears by Boe\u2019s affidavit, was this: At the time of the commencement of the action it was claimed that the defendant was in possession as tenant of Garrett J. Byrne. It does not appear that Byrne ever claimed to own the property, or had the slightest interest in it. Whether O\u2019Connor made this claim or a street gamin does not appear. The affidavit says \u201c it was claimed,\u201d but it don\u2019t state by whom, or that there was any foundation for the claim. Bow, if Lockwood had any interest in it, of any right to come into this case, it was through the purchase of this vague \u201c claim to be landlord \u201d under a sale on an execution against O\u2019Connor, on a judgment owned by plaintiff, on an execution issued by her own attorney. Did this purchase make Lockwood the \u201c heir and assign\u201d of the defendant, Beal W. O\u2019Connor? Could a \u201c claim to be landlord \u201d be sold on an execution unless some fact appears to show that the \u201c claim \u201d had some foundation ? If he \u201cclaimed to be landlord\u201d in Hay, 1876, did such claim continue until June, 1877, when the judgment was rendered ? <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>Is not the position of Lockwood a glittering generality? Again: O\u2019Connor\u2019s attorney in this case is Mr. Halberstadt. Mr. Roe has never been substituted. O\u2019Connor makes no affidavit and, for any thing that appears, knows nothing about this application. . The statute provides that the court may, upon application of <em>\u201c </em>the party against whom the same was rendered, his heirs or assigns,\u201d vacate the judgment, &amp;c. Before the court will put a plaintiff to the expense of \u00e1 new trial, must it not appear that the application was made by \u201cthe party,\u201d O\u2019Connor, either by its appearing that it is made by his attorney of record in the case, or some reason given why it was not, or on an affidavit of O\u2019Connor. Can a strange attorney come in and make such an application when he pleases, on his own affidavit, without even swearing that he acts for \u201cthe party,\u201d without any affidavit of the party or any thing showing authority to act for \u201c the party ? \u201d We think not and the court are right in saying, as they do, that the matter is in a \u201c vague and obscure state.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b429-5\">II. The fact is undisputed here that when the case was ready for trial the defendant Real W. O\u2019Connor \u201c consented \u201d to judgment in open court. Section 36 provides that \u201c every judgment in the action of ejectment rendered upon the verdict of a jury, or upon the-decision of a single judge, upon the facts, the court shall vacate,\u201d etc. W e submit that a judgment rendered, not on the verdict of a jury on the facts, but by consent of the party, in open court, does not come within the statute entitling a party absolutely to a new trial <em>(Chautauqua County Bank </em>agt. <em>White, </em>23 <em>N. Y., </em>348; <em>Large </em>agt. <em>Rophe, </em>1 Duer, 101). The party is bound by his consent, and estopped from taking advantage of a statute to indirectly get rid of his consent. There was no \u201c verdict of a jury upon the facts,\u201d it was a consent which O\u2019Connor is bound by until he shows some reason to set it aside, which perhaps he might do under section 38.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b429-6\">III. The most that could be said on the part of the defendant is, that a verdict or judgment taken by consent was a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>default <em>(Bennet </em>agt. <em>Couchman, </em>48 <em>Barb., </em>74). If it was a default, section 38 provides for opening the default, if the' \u201c court is satisfied that the ends of justice will be promoted.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b430-5\">IY. Leave to renew this motion being given, it is not appealable <em>(Robbins </em>agt. <em>Ferris, </em>5 <em>Hun, </em>286). When leave to renew is given, it is not a final order within the meaning of section 190 of the Code <em>(King </em>agt. <em>Platt, </em>2 <em>Abb. Ct. App. Cas., </em>527). Had Mr. Townshend and Mr. Boe availed themselves of this leave to renew, they could have made it clear. 1st. By what authority Mr. Boe undertakes to represent O\u2019Connor, whose attorney he is not. 2d. What the \u201c claim \u201d of Byrne to be landlord is founded on. 3d. What Josiah Lockwood got by his purchase of Byrne\u2019s claim to be landlord, under the plaintiff\u2019s execution against O\u2019Connor. 4th.- Who undertook to sell the plaintiff out on a judgment which she owed without her knowledge. 5th. How it happened that Lockwood could purchase her own property, on her own execution, issued by her own attorney, on her own judgment, and pay nothing for it. 6th. Why it is that neither O\u2019Connor nor Byrne, nor Lockwood, the three pretended claimants, make affidavit on this motion? 7th. Whether or not, although the hand is the hand of Jacob, the voice is not the voice of Esau. 8th. How the ends of justice would be promoted by allowing Lockwood <em>&amp; </em>Co. to repudiate the defendant\u2019s consent, and thus enable them to gravitate towards this little piece of land, and finally capture it, on Lockwood\u2019s shadowy title, or, at all events, subject the owner to an expensive litigation.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b430-6\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"AZs\">We think that the papers upon which the application for a new trial in this action is founded, do not establish facts which authorize the granting of the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">The application is made on the behalf of the defendant and of one Josiah Lockwood.' The interest of Lockwood is stated to have been derived from one Byrnes, who, it is alleged, was the landlord of the premises under whom the defendant. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>was in possession. The right of Lockwood is expressly controverted by the opposing affidavit, and it is alleged that Lockwood has no lawful title or claim, and that he is neither heir or assignee of the defendant nor of Byrne.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">It is also shown by the affidavit that when the action was ready for trial the defendant withdrew his answer, and judgment was entered by his consent in open court. It is true the judgment record shows that by the direction of the court a verdict was found for the plaintiff. But without contradicting the record, it may be assumed from the affidavit, which is not controverted, that this was done by consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">It also appears that the application is not made by the attorney of record, but by an attorney who has never been substituted in the place of the original attorney. The motion, then, is on behalf of a party whose interest in the premises is at least doubtful, in a case where consent has been given to the judgment, and by an attorney who is not shown to have had any authority. To say the least it is very uncertain upon the papers what are the actual facts, and whether a case is made out for a new trial, within the statute, (2 <em>R. S., </em>309, <em>as amended by cheap. </em>485, <em>of the Laws of </em>1862).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">The defendant, or the party actually interested, had an opportunity to supply these defects by a renewal of the motion, as was authorized by the special term. This he has failed to do, and we think the order should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">All concur, except Folgeb and Rapallo, JJ., absent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
