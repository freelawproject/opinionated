Crisafulli.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">Ordered that the order is affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">The Supreme Court providently exercised its discretion in permitting the defendants to depose nonparty witness Christine M. Crisafulli regarding the plaintiff\u2019s alleged failure to follow her recommendations for treatment, and her conversations with the plaintiff concerning treatment. In light of Dr. Crisafulli\u2019s medical report and the plaintiff\u2019s denial of the allegation that he did not comply with his physician\u2019s treatment regimen, the defendants made an adequate showing of \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d pursuant to CPLR 3101 (a) (4) to entitle them to an examination before trial of Dr. Crisafulli <em>(see, Cirale v 80 Pine St. Corp., </em>35 NY2d 113, 116-117; <em>Bostrom v William Penn Life Ins. Co., </em>285 AD2d 482; <em>Goldblatt v Avis Rent A Car Sys., </em>223 AD2d 670; <em>Heitzman v Abrahamson, </em>97 AD2d 811). Ritter, Acting P.J., Feuerstein, O\u2019Brien, H.
