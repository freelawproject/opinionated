Appellant\u2019s employee, whose testimony was submitted in support of the motion, admitted that he could not say with certainty whether appellant had any utility holes similar to the one described by plaintiff as the cause of his accident, and his testimony did not address whether there were no such holes at the location. The affidavit of another employee submitted with appellant\u2019s reply papers was properly rejected by the motion court since it sought to remedy these basic deficiencies in appellant\u2019s prima facie showing rather than respond to arguments in plaintiffs opposition papers <em>(see, Lumbermens Mut. Cas. Co. v Morse Shoe Co., </em>218 AD2d 624, 625-626). Concur\u2014 Tom, J.P., Andidas, Rubin, Buckley and Friedman, JJ.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
