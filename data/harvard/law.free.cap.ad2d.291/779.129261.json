The police officer who stopped defendant\u2019s, vehicle had probable cause to believe that defendant committed several traffic violations, and the officer\u2019s admitted intention to stop the vehicle irrespective of those violations does not render the stop illegal (see, <em>People v Robinson, </em>97 NY2d 341).</p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">The court also erred in granting that part of defendant\u2019s motion seeking to dismiss the indictment by dismissing count one, charging criminal possession of a weapon in the first degree (Penal Law \u00a7 265.04), and counts eight and nine, each charging criminal possession of a weapon in the fourth degree (Penal Law \u00a7 265.01 [2]), on the ground that the evidence of intent presented to the Grand Jury is insufficient to support those counts. Evidence of defendant\u2019s possession of an explosive substance, a machete and a shank or homemade knife, coupled with the statutory presumption of intent <em>(see, </em>Penal Law \u00a7 265.15 [4]), is legally sufficient to establish a prima facie case with respect to counts one, eight and nine <em>(see, People v Monero, </em>184 Misc 2d 764, 766-767). That evidence, \u201cviewed in the light most favorable to the People, if unexplained and uncontradicted, would warrant conviction by a petit jury\u201d on those counts <em>(People v Jennings, </em>69 NY2d 103, 114).</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">We therefore reverse the order, deny defendant\u2019s motion in its entirety, reinstate counts one, eight and nine of the indictment and remit the matter to Ontario County Court for further proceedings on the indictment. Present \u2014 Pigott, Jr., P.J., Green, Hayes, Kehoe and Bums, JJ.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
