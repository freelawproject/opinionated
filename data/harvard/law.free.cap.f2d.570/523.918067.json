It raises issues of the applicability both of the securities acts of 1933 and 1934, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 77a et seq. and 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 78a et seq., and of the Commodities Exchange Act, 7 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1 et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-20\">In March 1973, plaintiff Joe G. Moody opened a commodities account with defendant Bache &amp; Co. on the urging of Bache\u2019s representative, Robert Peters. Peters told Moody that he would invest for Moody according to the recommendations of Bache\u2019s research department. In fact, however, Peters did not do this, or did not do so uniformly, but rather invested according to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>method of his own. He had considerable success during March and April, but in May this success soured dramatically. On May 2, Peters made on Moody\u2019s behalf the trades that ultimately led to this lawsuit: he \u201cshorted\u201d twenty contracts for September wheat. His trade on the \u201cshort\u201d side reflected his hope that the price of wheat would decline; but instead, no doubt due to the market\u2019s reaction to the Soviet wheat deal, the price of wheat rose. Peters continued to keep Moody\u2019s account in the short position and did so for a time even after Bache\u2019s research analysts began to advise that short positions be \u201ccovered.\u201d When Moody\u2019s wheat position was liquidated on June 1, the account had suffered a net loss of over $86,000 due to the wheat trades. Coincidentally, Moody also suffered a net loss of over $5,000 in a Bache securities account due to trading in certain bonds. To recoup his losses, plaintiff brought this action under the securities acts and the Commodities Exchange Act, concentrating his arguments on section 10(b) of the 1934 Securities Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 promulgated under that Act. According to this well-known rule (17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.10b-5), it is unlawful for any person to make untrue statements or omissions of material fact in connection with the purchase or sale of any security.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">After trial, the jury answered several specific questions as to Peters\u2019 commodity trading in Moody\u2019s behalf; as will appear below, these findings are the basis of the present appeal. The jury also made several findings exonerating Bache and Peters with respect both to the bond transactions and to charges of malice. The district court held that the jury findings resolved all issues of liability in favor of defendants and awarded judgment accordingly. Plaintiff Moody now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-12\">Before reaching the substance of Moody\u2019s contentions on appeal, we must note some preliminary points. Courts have widely agreed that a particular commodities futures contract is not in itself a security under the securities acts. <em>SEC v. Continental Commodities Corp., </em>497 F.2d 516, 520 n. 9 (5th Cir. 1974), and cases cited therein; <em>cf. Booth v. Peavey Company Commodity Services, </em>430 F.2d 132 (8th Cir. 1970), <em>but see Marshall v. Lamson Brothers &amp; Co., </em>368 F.Supp. 486 (S.D.Iowa 1974). According to the definitions of these acts, the term \u201csecurity\u201d'embraces investment contracts; and according to the Supreme Court in <em>SEC v. W. J. Howey Co., </em>328 U.S. 293, 298-99, 66 S.Ct. 1100, 1103, 90 L.Ed. 1244 (1946), \u201can investment contract for purposes of the Securities Act means a contract, transaction or scheme whereby a person invests his money in a common enterprise and is led to expect profits solely from the efforts of the promoter or a third party.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In <em>SEC v. Koscot Interplanetary, Inc., </em>497 F.2d 473, 477 (5th Cir. 1974), this court noted that the <em>Howey </em>test \u201csubsumes within it three elements: first the existence of an investment of money; second, that the scheme functions as a common enterprise; and third, that the profits of the enterprise are derived solely from the efforts of others.\u201d <em>Continental Commodities, supra </em>at 521, <em>cit</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number><em>ing Koscot </em>at 477.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It has often been held that futures contracts fail to meet this test because, as Judge Rubin said in <em>McCurnin v. Kohlmeyer &amp; Co., </em>340 F.Supp. 1338, 1341 (E.D.La.1972), <em>aff\u2019d per curiam, 477 </em>F.2d 113 (5 Cir. 1973):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-4\">A commodity future contract is no more or less than an option; the purchaser agrees to take delivery, or the seller agrees to make delivery, of a specified quantity of a specified commodity at a specified future time at a specified price. Unless the investor reverses his position timely by selling what he has bought or buying what he has sold, he must accept delivery of the commodity and pay the full purchase price as set by the contract (or deliver the commodity against the full payment, if he has sold). He is in no way investing his money in a common enterprise, nor is he led to expect profits solely from the efforts of any third party. The \u201centerprise\u201d is an individual one. The expectation of profit arises solely from the speculative hope that the market price of the underlying commodity will vary in his favor, permitting purchase or sale at a profit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b594-5\"><em>See Sinva Inc. v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc., </em>253 F.Supp. 359, 366-67 (S.D.N.Y.1966); <em>accord Continental Commodities Corp., supra </em>at 520 n. 9, and cases cited therein. Hence the courts have generally rejected the \u201cnovel contention that the regulatory features of the securities acts be extended into the vast domain of the commodities markets.\u201d <em>Sinva, supra </em>at 365.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-10\">On the other hand, some courts, including this one, have recognized that discretionary accounts in commodities futures contracts \u2014 as opposed to the futures contracts themselves \u2014 may be \u201cinvestment contracts\u201d and thus \u201csecurities\u201d for purposes of the securities acts. This is because such discretionary accounts may contain the <em>Howey </em>elements of investment, common enterprise, and dependence solely on the efforts of others. <em>Continental Commodities, supra.</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Plaintiff in the present case argues as if the commodities futures contracts themselves were securities. We reject this line of argument; if any \u201csecurity\u201d subject to the securities acts was involved in this case, it must be the Bache commodity account itself, on the theory that this was a discretionary account such as to be considered an \u201cinvestment contract\u201d and thus a security subject to the acts.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In answers to specific questions the jury found that plaintiff Moody gave Peters discretion to make the transactions in Moody\u2019s account and that the ill-starred May transactions were so made; but it also found that plaintiff authorized or consented to these transactions. Supposing that these findings are sufficient to render the commodities account a \u201cdiscretionary account,\u201d we must still bear in mind that only the account itself \u2014 not the individual commodities futures traded- \u2014 can be a \u201csecurity\u201d subject to the securities acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>This analysis disposes of several portions of plaintiff\u2019s argument, namely those that seek to impose liability on Bache as a broker or dealer. Bache was of course a broker or dealer in commodities futures, but since these are not securities, Bache\u2019s brokerage activities in commodities futures do not in themselves entail liability under the securities acts. And with respect to the account itself \u2014 the only arguable \u201csecurity\u201d at issue \u2014 Bache was not a broker or dealer but was rather at most in the position of an issuer or seller.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">With the issues thus narrowed, we reach the main focus of plaintiff\u2019s argument. In the jury\u2019s answers to specific interrogatories about the commodities account, it found that Peters did represent that he would act in accordance with the Bache recommendations, that this representation was false and misleading, that Peters knew it to be so, that Moody relied on this representation in making his investment, and that the representation was \u201cmaterial\u201d in the sense that a reasonable person would have regarded it as important and relied on it. However, the jury also found that the representation was not the cause of Moody\u2019s loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">Plaintiff contends that the last of these findings is inconsistent with the previous findings, and he urges that causation follows as a matter of law where reliance and materiality are found. This contention relates to the requirements for a private cause of action under Rule 10b-5. That such a private cause of action exists is now \u201cwell established, \u2019 <em>Ernst &amp; Ernst v. Hochfelder, </em>425 U.S. 185, 196, 96 S.Ct. 1375, 47 L.Ed.2d 668 (1976), and this court recognized such a cause of action in <em>Hooper v. Mountain States Securities Corp., </em>282 F.2d 195 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>365 U.S. 814, 81 S.Ct. 695, 5 L.Ed.2d 693 (1960). But such an action is essentially a tort claim. <em>See Kardon v. National Gypsum Co., </em>69 F.Supp. 512 (E.D.Pa.1946). Thus, the private complainant must show not only a violation of the rule, i. e., an untrue statement or material omission in connection with the sale of a security, but must also show that the omission or untrue statement resulted in or caused the complainant\u2019s damage. <em>See Sargent v. Genesco, Inc., </em>492 F.2d 750, 759 (5th Cir. 1974). In some contexts, however, it has been held that where reliance and materiality \u2014 or even materiality alone \u2014 are shown, this is a sufficient showing of cause of harm, and no further proof of causation need be adduced. <em>E. g., Affiliated Ute Citizens of Utah v. United States, </em>406 U.S. 128, 154, 92 S.Ct. 1456, 31 L.Ed.2d 741 (1972); <em>Chasins v. Smith Barney &amp; Co., Inc., </em>438 F.2d 1167 (2d Cir. 1970). In view of these cases, plaintiff argues that the jury\u2019s finding of \u201cno causation\u201d must have been based on an erroneous understanding of the showing of causation required by law, and hence that this finding should be disregarded.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b595-9\">We disagree. We may observe at the outset that plaintiff made no objection to the separate jury question on causation. We observe further that the cases on which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>plaintiff places greatest emphasis, <em>Affiliated Ute </em>and <em>Chasins, supra, </em>are both cases dealing primarily with nondisclosure of material fact rather than with misstatements. In the case of nondisclosure, it is particularly difficult to show a causal relationship to damage, but this is not necessarily true of actual misleading statements.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Finally, even in the nondisclosure cases, where a causal link between violation and harm is always most difficult to prove, a specific finding of nonreliance may suffice to overcome the materiality of the omission. <em>Simon v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc., </em>482 F.2d 880 (5th Cir. 1973). By the same token, a specific finding of no causation may suffice to overcome findings of reliance and materiality. While reliance and materiality, or even materiality alone, may sometimes establish causation without any further showing, we cannot say that findings of materiality and reliance by law must negate a specific finding of no causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">We are particularly persuaded of this view by a factor that the plaintiff\u2019s argument entirely overlooks: that is, the further jury finding that the plaintiff authorized or consented to the commodities transactions that ultimately proved so ill advised. The jury had before it evidence of frequent communication between plaintiff and Bache\u2019s representative Peters, including daily phone calls; it also had before it evidence that Peters explained his investment methods to plaintiff after the account had been opened. The jury may well have concluded that while Peters\u2019 misrepresentations as to following the Bache recommendations swayed the plaintiff to open the commodities account in the first place, by the time of the wheat futures purchase and subsequent loss, these misrepresentations were no longer matters of any consequence to either party. In somewhat similar circumstances, some courts in brokerage cases have held that when a complainant\u2019s close contact with a broker indicates knowledge or approval of the broker\u2019s transactions, the complainant is estopped from maintaining that the transactions were unsuited to his needs. <em>Hecht v. Harris, Upham &amp; Co., </em>430 F.2d 1202, 1212 (9th Cir. 1970); <em>accord Ferguson v. Francis I. duPont, </em>369 F.Supp. 1099 (N.D.Tex.1974); <em>see also Canizaro v. Kohlmeyer &amp; Co., </em>370 F.Supp. 282 (E.D.La.1974), <em>aff\u2019d per curiam, </em>512 F.2d 484 (5th Cir. 1975). For reasons stated earlier, the present case cannot be classified as a brokerage case, but we nevertheless regard the jury\u2019s finding of authorization or consent to be an important support in sustaining its finding of \u201cno causation\u201d over against the other findings of reliance and materiality.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Certainly the jury had evidence from which it could conclude that whatever reliance plaintiff placed on Peters\u2019 misrepresentations, by the time of the disputed transactions these misrepresentations were no longer material, and the effect of any reliance was rendered inconsequential by the plaintiff\u2019s own close involvement in the transactions to which he now so strenuously objects.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">Plaintiff argues, finally, that section 4b of the Commodities Exchange Act, 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 6b, entitles him to relief comparable to that available in a private action for a securities violation under Rule 10b \u2014 5. This section of the Commodities Exchange Act states in part that it is unlawful for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>member of the contract market to cheat, defraud or willfully deceive any person in connection with any commodities sales contract.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> However, the section and the Act generally make no explicit provision for a private right of action. This court has not ruled on the issue of whether the Act impliedly authorizes such private actions, although we note that several courts have ruled \u2014 with varying depths of consideration \u2014 that it does. Case <em>&amp; Co. v. Board of Trade of City of Chicago, </em>523 F.2d 355 (7th Cir. 1975); <em>Deaktor v. LD Schreiber &amp; Co., </em>479 F.2d 529 (7th Cir.), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>414 U.S. 113, 94 S.Ct. 466, 38 L.Ed.2d 344 (1973); <em>Booth v. Peavey, supra; Arnold v. Bache &amp; Co., Inc., </em>377 F.Supp. 61 (M.D.Pa.1973); <em>McCurnin, supra; Goodman v. Hentz &amp; Co., </em>265 F.Supp. 440 (N.D.Ill.1967); <em>see also Gould v. Barnes Brokerage Co., </em>345 F.Supp. 294 (N.D.Tex.1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">If such an action exists it is based on the principle that a federal statutory prohibition may create a private right of action where the complainant is a member of the class for whose especial benefit the statute was enacted, where such private actions are consistent with the legislative intent and underlying purpose, and where regulation of the activity is not so fundamentally a matter of state law that it would be inappropriate to recognize an implied right of action based entirely upon federal law. <em>See Piper v. Chris-Craft Industries, Inc., </em>430 U.S. 1, 97 S.Ct. 926, 51 L.Ed.2d 124 (1977); <em>Wilson v. First Houston Investment Corp., </em>566 F.2d 1235 (5th Cir. 1978). But any such private right of action under the Commodities Exchange Act would be in the nature of a tort action, <em>see Goodman v. Hentz, supra; </em>like other tort actions it would require some showing of a causal link between the violation and the damage to the complainant. Here, as in the 10b-5 action, the jury\u2019s finding of no causation would preclude plaintiff\u2019s recovery, even on the supposition that section 4b does create a private right of action.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b597-11\">Since plaintiff can recover neither under the securities acts nor under the Commodities Exchange Act \u2014 even assuming that the latter creates a private right of action \u2014 we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b593-6\">. The rule provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-7\">\u00a7 240.1 Ob-5 Employment of manipulative and deceptive devices.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-8\">It shall be unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly, by the use of any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce, or of the mails or of any facility of any national securities exchange,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-9\">(a) To employ any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-10\">(b) To make any untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AnV\">(c) To engage in any act, practice, or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon any person, in connection with the purchase or sale of any security.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b593-15\">. <em>Howey </em>refers to the 1933 Act and not the 1934 Act, but the definitional sections of these two Acts are substantially identical; in <em>Tcherepnin v. Knight, </em>389 U.S. 332, 88 S.Ct. 548, 19 L.Ed.2d 564 (1967), the Supreme Court quoted <em>Howey </em>to define investment contracts under the 1934 Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b594-6\">. <em>United Housing Foundation v. Forman, </em>421 U.S. 837, 852, 95 S.Ct. 2051, 2060, 44 L.Ed.2d 621 (1975), adds with respect to the <em>Howey </em>test that \u201c[t]he touchstone is the presence of an investment in a common venture premised on a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the <em>entrepreneurial </em>or <em>managerial </em>efforts of others.\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b594-7\">. Some courts have rejected the idea that even discretionary accounts in commodities futures can meet the <em>Howey </em>test for investment contracts. <em>See, e. g., Milnarik v. M-S Commodities, </em>457 F.2d 274 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>409 U.S. 887, 93 S.Ct. 113, 34 L.Ed.2d 144 (1972).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b594-8\">. In several cases of \u201cchurning\u201d (i. e., excessive trading for the purpose of raising brokers\u2019 fees) where both securities and commodities were involved, some courts have held that a plaintiff may recover under the securities acts if the transactions are a part of a single fraudulent scheme. <em>See Hecht v. Harris, Upham &amp; Co., </em>430 F.2d 1202 (9th Cir. 1970); <em>Goodman v. Hentz &amp; Co., </em>265 F.Supp. 440 (N.D.Ill.1967). Supposing that we were to accept this theory, it would be inapplicable to the case at bar. Although the original complaint included charges relating to losses on the trading of certain bonds, there is no indication that there was a \u201csingle fraudulent scheme\u201d linking the transactions in the securities account to those in the commodities account. The chief losses and transactions complained of concern the commodities trading; plaintiffs argument on appeal focuses entirely on the commodities account transactions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b595-7\">. Plaintiffs arguments with respect to Bache\u2019s brokerage duties rely chiefly on \u00a7 15(c)(1) of the 1934 Securities Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78o(c)(1), as applied under \u00a7 29(b) of the same act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78cc(b). Plaintiff cites especially <em>Eastside Church of Christ v. National Plan, Inc., </em>391 F.2d 357 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>393 U.S. 913, 89 S.Ct. 234, 21 L.Ed.2d 198 (1968), to argue that a contract made in violation of the brokerage requirements may be rescinded with no showing of a causal relationship between the violation and the harm to the complainant. In view of our position that Bache was not a broker with respect to the commodities account, we need not discuss this argument here, although we note that in this case, where plaintiff essentially asks for a remedy comparable to money damages, the argument is highly questionable in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s discussion of \u00a7 29(b) in <em>Mills v. Electric Auto-Lite Co., </em>396 U.S. 375, 90 S.Ct. 616, 24 L.Ed.2d 593 (1970).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b595-11\">. Plaintiff makes a somewhat protracted argument relating to a distinction between \u201closs causation\u201d and \u201ctransaction causation,\u201d saying that only the latter must be shown \u2014 that is, a complainant may recover if he shows that the misrepresentation caused him to enter the transaction in question and need not show any further cause of loss. We need not enter into this discussion, since our disposition of the case does not entail causation beyond what plaintiff refers to as \u201ctransaction causation.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b596-5\">. See <em>Mills v. Electric Auto-Lite Co., </em>396 U.S. 375, 90 S.Ct. 616, 24 L.Ed.2d 593 (1970). Similar proof problems appeared in <em>Mills </em>itself. This case concerned misleading materials in a proxy solicitation, and it involved especially difficult proof problems in showing a causal link between the defective proxy materials and the shareholders\u2019 approval of a merger. Under these circumstances the Supreme Court held that the plaintiffs showed a sufficient causal relationship if they showed that the proxy solicitation itself, rather than the defect in the solicitation materials, was an essential link in the accomplishment of the transaction (i. e., the merger).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b596-9\">. We find no conflict with <em>Colvin v. Dempsey-Tegeler &amp; Co., Inc., </em>477 F.2d 1283 (5th Cir. 1973), in which the jury inconsistently found materiality, reliance and causation but no damage. Damage in that case was the necessary consequence of materiality, reliance and causation. For reasons stated above, we do not regard cause in this case to be the ineluctable consequence of reliance and materiality.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b597-6\">. The relevant portions of the statute are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-7\">It shall be unlawful (1) for any member of a contract market, or for any correspondent, agent, or employee of any member, in or in connection with any order to make, or the making of, any contract of sale of any commodity in interstate commerce, made, or to be made, on or subject to the rules of any contract market, for or on behalf of any other person .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-8\">(A) to cheat or defraud or attempt to cheat or defraud such other person;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-9\">(B) willfully to make or cause to be made to such other person any false report or statement thereof, or willfully to enter or cause to be entered for such person any false record thereof;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ave-dedup-0\">(C) willfully to deceive or attempt to deceive such other person by any means whatsoever in regard to any such order or contract or the disposition or execution of any such order or contract, or in regard to any act of agency performed with respect to such order or contract for such person . . ..</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"AP_\">.
