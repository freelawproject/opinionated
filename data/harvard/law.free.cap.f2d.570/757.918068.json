Regan, Senior Judge, United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b826-22\">WEBSTER, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b826-23\">In this appeal we review the determination by the District Court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> on remand<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that, because it lacked subject matter jurisdiction to hear a federal claim, it also lacked jurisdiction to hear a pendent state claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-24\">Appellant Kuhn was employed as a janitorial employee by the United States Post Office Department. In August 1970, he received a letter from the Dep\u00e1rtment notifying him that it intended to take disciplinary action against him. Kuhn sought and received some assistance from his local union, but on October 7, 1970, he was notified that he would be terminated as of the close of business on October 23, 1970. Although this notification explained available appeal procedures, no action was taken by Kuhn or by the union to preserve his right to appeal. Kuhn\u2019s attempts to have the matter reopened were unsuccessful.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>In April 1972, Kuhn brought an action against both the national and local unions of which he was a member claiming that they had undertaken to represent him in the disciplinary proceedings leading to his dismissal, and had breached their duty of fair and adequate representation. His complaint was read to allege both a federal statutory claim for violation of a duty to represent fairly, and a state contractual claim arising out of Kuhn\u2019s union membership and the union\u2019s agreement to assist him in the grievance proceedings for failure to represent fairly. The Post Office Department was later added as a party defendant and the complaint was amended to allege wrongful conduct on its part.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-4\">Motions to dismiss were filed by all defendants. The District Court granted the motions and dismissed the action as to all defendants without prejudice to appellant\u2019s right to file appropriate charges with the National Labor Relations Board. The District Court held that any federal statutory duty of fair representation could only be heard by the NLRB, and refused to exercise pendent jurisdiction over the contractual state claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">On appeal, this Court affirmed the dismissal of the claims against the Post Office Department for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. We also affirmed the dismissal of the federal claims against the national union and the local on the ground that neither was the employees\u2019 exclusive bargaining agent in the bargaining unit in which Kuhn was employed, a necessary prerequisite to a statutory duty to represent fairly.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The District Court\u2019s dismissal of the state law claim was reversed, however, and the cause was remanded with instructions \u201cto determine, in the light of appropriate standards, whether it will hear and decide Kuhn\u2019s claim against Branch 5,\u201d and to take \u201caction consistent with this opinion.\u201d 528 F.2d at 771 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b827-8\">On remand, the District Court again refused to hear the state law claim against the union and its local, and dismissed the action. Kuhn\u2019s federal claim, that the union had failed to represent him fairly, was found to arise under Executive Orders Nos. 10988 and 11491,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> establishing a federal labor relations system for the Post Office Department prior to the passage of 39 \u00da.S.C. \u00a7 1209(a). The District Court held that because Kuhn\u2019s claim did not arise under a \u201claw of the United States,\u201d it had no subject matter jurisdiction under \u00a7 1331, and hence, was without power to consider the pendent state claim. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b827-10\">In <em>United Mine Workers v. Gibbs, </em>383 U.S. 715, 725-27, 86 S.Ct. 1130, 16 L.Ed.2d 218 (1966), the Supreme Court made it clear that the question of pendent jurisdiction involves two considerations: (1) whether there is power to assume pendent jurisdiction and (2) whether the court should properly exercise its discretion by assuming jurisdiction when it has the power. <em>See </em>13 C. Wright, A. Miller &amp; E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 3567 at 443 (1975). The power to exercise pendent jurisdiction is grounded upon the existence of federal subject matter jurisdiction over some claim in the cause of action. Jurisdiction has been held to be established by the existence of' a substantial federal question, <em>see e. g., Hagans v. Lavine, </em>415 U.S. 528, 536-39, 94 S.Ct. 1372, 39 L.Ed.2d 577 (1974), and exists even if the decision on the merits goes against the federal claimant. The district court, however, must ini<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>tially have subject matter jurisdiction over a federal claim before it can exercise jurisdiction over a pendent state claim.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b828-4\">Pendent jurisdiction, in the sense of judicial <em>power, </em>exists <em>whenever there is </em>a <em>claim \u201carising under [the] Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and Treaties made, or which shall be made, under their Authority . . </em>.,\u201d U.S.Const., Art. III, \u00a7 2, and the relationship between that claim and the state claim permits the conclusion that the entire action before the court comprises but one constitutional \u201ccase.\u201d The federal claim must have substance sufficient to confer subject matter jurisdiction on the court, (brackets in original) (second emphasis added) (footnotes omitted)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b828-6\"><em>United Mine Workers v. Gibbs, supra, </em>383 U.S. at 725, 86 S.Ct. at 1138.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-7\">Similarly this Court has said that in order to rule on a non-federal claim the court \u201cmust first be satisfied that there exists a justiciable federal claim to support pendent jurisdiction,\u201d <em>Springfield Television, Inc. v. City of Springfield, Missouri, </em>462 F.2d 21, 23 (8th Cir. 1972), and \u201cif the district court [has] no jurisdiction with respect to the federal claim asserted by plaintiff it [has] no jurisdiction of the pendent claim,\u201d <em>Briscoe v. Bock, </em>540 F.2d 392, 394 (8th Cir. 1976). <em>See IIT v. Vencap, Ltd., </em>519 F.2d 1001, 1015 (2d Cir. 1975) (\u201cPendent jurisdiction can be relied upon only when there is a claim conferring federal jurisdiction that will survive a motion to dismiss.\u201d); <em>Williams v. United States, </em>405 F.2d 951, 954-55 (9th Cir. 1969); 13 C. Wright, A. Miller &amp; E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 3567 at 443-45 (1975).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b828-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b828-11\">Kuhn attempts to establish federal jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331, which grants federal district courts \u201coriginal jurisdiction of all civil actions wherein the matter in controversy . . . arises under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States. . . . \u201d Prior to the passage of the Postal Reorganization Act of 1970, 39 U.S.C. \u00a7 201 <em>et </em>seq.,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> collective bargaining between the Post Office Department and labor unions representing postal employees was governed by Executive Order No. 10988, and its successor No. 11491. Therefore, any federal duty to represent fairly owed by the unions to Kuhn must arise from these orders. As correctly determined by the District Court, however, these Executive Orders are not \u201claws of the United States\u201d for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 and, therefore, do not confer subject matter jurisdiction on a federal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-14\">Although this precise question has not arisen in this Court, other Circuits have considered the issue and have held that jurisdiction could not be established on the basis of these orders. In <em>Local 1498, American Federation of Government Employees v. American Federation of Government Employees, </em>522 F.2d 486 (3d Cir. 1975), the Court found that Executive Order No. 11491 \u201cwas not issued under statutory authority providing for presidential implementation or effectuation of statutory provisions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 491. Therefore, it did not have the congressional authority necessary to constitute it a \u201claw of the United States\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>for purposes of \u00a7 1331. Similarly, in <em>Stevens v. Carey, </em>483 F.2d 188 (7th Cir. 1973), the Court held that the district court was without jurisdiction over a case brought under Executive Order No. 10988 because, even though the order was not beyond the authority of the President, it was not issued pursuant to a federal statute and therefore was not a \u201claw of the United States\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 1331. <em>See Bendure v. United States, </em>554 F.2d 427 (Ct.Cl.1977); <em>Manhattan-Bronx Postal Union v. Gronouski, </em>121 U.S.App.D.C. 321, 350 F.2d 451 (1965), <em>cert. denied, </em>382 U.S. 978, 86 S.Ct. 548, 15 L.Ed.2d 469 (1966). <em>See also Dreyfus v. Von Finck, </em>534 F.2d 24, 29 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 835, 97 S.Ct. 102, 50 L.Ed.2d 101 (1976); <em>Crabb </em>v. <em>Weldon Bros., </em>164 F.2d 797, 803 (8th Cir. 1947). <em>Cf. Farkas v. Texas Instrument, Inc., </em>375 F.2d 629, 632 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>389 U.S. 977, 88 S.Ct. 480, 19 L.Ed.2d 471 (1967); <em>Farmer </em>v. <em>Philadelphia Electric Co., </em>329 F.2d 3, 7 (3d Cir. 1964) (holding Executive Orders, different from those at issue here, and issued pursuant to statutory authority, to be \u201claws of the United States\u201d for jurisdictional purposes but not intended to create private rights of action). <em>But cf. Braden v. University of Pittsburgh, </em>343 F.Supp. 836, 840 (W.D.Pa.1972) (statutory source not explicitly identified), <em>vacated and remanded, </em>477 F.2d 1 (3d Cir. 1973), <em>on remand, </em>392 F.Supp. 118 (W.D.Pa.1975), <em>affirmed, </em>552 F.2d 948 (3d Cir. 1977) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">The <em>Local 1498 </em>and <em>Stevens </em>cases are consistent with this Court\u2019s statement in <em>Independent Meat Packers Association v. Butz, </em>526 F.2d 228, 234 (8th Cir. 1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>424 U.S. 966, 96 S.Ct. 1461, 47 L.Ed.2d 733 (1976), that \u201c[presidential proclamations and orders have the force and effect of law when issued pursuant to a statutory mandate or delegation of authority from Congress.\u201d In that case we did not discuss the jurisdictional question, but found that no specific statute authorized the Executive Order in question and a general constitutional authority cannot give an order the force and effect of law.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b829-9\">Since we agree that the District Court did not have the power to consider the pendent state claim because it did not have jurisdiction over the federal claim, we affirm the judgment of the District Court.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b826-14\">. The Honorable Robert V. Denney, United States District Court for the District of Nebraska.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b826-25\">. <em>See Kuhn v. National Association of Letter Carriers, </em>528 F.2d 767 (8th Cir. 1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b827-6\">. We view the previous panel opinion as holding that appellant had failed to establish the union as the employees\u2019 exclusive bargaining unit, an essential element in a fair representation case. The holding was thus on the merits and was not jurisdictional in nature. While the presence of federal subject matter jurisdiction was assumed in the earlier opinion, <em>cf. </em>528 F.2d at 771 n.6 (discussing the discretionary aspects of pendent jurisdiction), the jurisdictional issues presented in this case were not argued to or considered by the Court. The District Court was therefore not precluded from reexamining its own jurisdiction, and we are not precluded from considering its holding on this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b827-12\">. <em>See </em>27 Fed.Reg. 551 (1962); 34 Fed.Reg. 17,605 (1969).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b828-8\">. A dismissal for jurisdictional reasons must be distinguished from a dismissal for failure to state a claim after jurisdiction is established. The latter is a disposition on the merits.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b828-9\">[I]t is well settled that the failure to state a proper cause of action calls for a judgment on the merits and not for a dismissal for want of jurisdiction. Whether the complaint states a cause of action on which relief could be granted is a question of law and just as issues of fact it must be decided after and not before the court has assumed jurisdiction over the controversy. If the court does later exercise its jurisdiction to determine that the allegations in the complaint do not state a ground for relief, then dismissal of the case would be on the merits, not for want of jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b828-16\"><em>Bell v. Hood, </em>327 U.S. 678, 682, 66 S.Ct. 773, 776, 90 L.Ed. 939 (1946).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b828-17\">. Because that Act was not effective prior to July 1, 1971, and all of the operative facts giving rise to this cause of action arose prior to that date, Kuhn\u2019s claim cannot be said to arise under that statute. The Postal Reorganization Act of 1970 provides that labor relations of the Postal Service shall be subject to the provisions of the National Labor Relations Act. 39 U.S.C. \u00a7 1209(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b829-6\">. In holding that Executive Orders such as Nos. 11491 and 10988 are not \u201claws of the United States\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 1331, we have no trouble distinguishing cases such as <em>Old Dominion Branch No. 496, National Association of Letter Carriers v. Austin, </em>418 U.S. 264, 94 S.Ct. 2770, 41 L.Ed.2d 745 (1974), which hold that Executive Orders <em>(Old Dominion </em>involved Executive Order No. 11491) preempt state law if that is their intent. These cases do not consider or discuss the jurisdictional issue presented here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b829-7\">. It is, of course, within a district court\u2019s discretionary power to dismiss a pendent state claim when the federal claim is disposed of before trial for reasons that are not jurisdictional in nature. See <em>CES Publishing Corp. v. St. Regis Publications, Inc., </em>531 F.2d 11, 15 (2d Cir. 1975); <em>Toensing v. Brown, </em>528 F.2d 69, 72 (9th Cir. 1975); <em>Gibson v. First Federal Savings &amp; Loan Association of Detroit, </em>504 F.2d 826, 830-31 (6th Cir. 1974). In some circumstances it may be an abuse of discretion not to dismiss if the federal issue is resolved at that time. See <em>Nolan v. Meyer, </em>520 F.2d 1276, 1280 (2d Cir.), cert. <em>denied, </em>423 U.S. 1034, 96 S.Ct. 567, 46 L.Ed.2d 408 (1975). Because we uphold the District Court\u2019s conclusion that it was without jurisdiction to entertain the pendent state claim, we do not reach the abuse of discretion issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
