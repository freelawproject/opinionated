Citizens Casualty Co. of New York et al., </em>5 Cir., 1970, 431 F.2d 409.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b608-24\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b608-25\">James L. Coody pleaded guilty to interstate transportation of a stolen motor vehicle, a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2312. He has filed a motion to vacate sentence, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, alleging that his plea was invalid. He contends that the district judge, in questioning him on the voluntariness of his plea, failed to comply with Rule 11, Fed.R.Crim. Proc. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-26\">Rule 11 requires the Court to \u201caddress the defendant personally in open <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>court and inform him of, and determine that he understands . . . the nature of the charge to which the plea is offered . \u201d The transcript of the plea hearing shows that the district judge asked the appellant, \u201c. . .do you understand the charges that have been made against you?\u201d To which the appellant replied, \u201cI do.\u201d \u201cRoutine questions on the subject of understanding the nature of the charges are insufficient; and a single response by the defendant that he \u2018understands\u2019 the charge gives no assurance or basis for believing he does.\u201d <em>Sierra v. Government of the Canal Zone, </em>5 Cir. 1977, 546 F.2d 77, 79. Hence, such an inquiry does not satisfy the requirements of Rule 11. See also, <em>United States v. Hart, </em>5 Cir. 1978, 566 F.2d 977; United <em>States v. Adams, </em>5 Cir. 1978, 566 F.2d 962; <em>United States v. Crook, </em>5 Cir. 1976, 526 F.2d 708.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">The district court also failed to advise appellant of the maximum sentence he could receive. Permitting the Assistant United States Attorney to give this information falls short of the literal compliance required of the district judge by Rule 11. <em>United States v. Aldridge, </em>5 Cir. 1977, 553 F.2d 922. See also <em>United States v. Hart, </em>supra; <em>United States v. Adams, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-8\">Rule 11, as amended, effective December 1, 1975, states: \u201cThe Court shall also inquire as to whether the defendant\u2019s willingness to plead guilty or <em>nolo contendere </em>results from prior discussions between the attorney for the government and the defendant or his attorney.\u201d That requirement is mandatory and the inquiry it directs was not made. In a recent opinion this Court discussed the provisions of Rule 11, as amended, <em>United States v. Adams, </em>supra, and reiterated the requirement of this circuit that \u201ccompliance with Rule 11 must be literal,\u201d citing the preamendment rule, as set forth in <em>United States v. Aldridge, </em>5 Cir. 1977, 553 F.2d 922. See also <em>Government of the Canal Zone v. Tobar, </em>5 Cir. 1978, 565 F.2d 1321.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-9\">Although we base the reversal of the district court\u2019s judgment on the errors noted above, we observed that the appellant was not sworn during the plea hearing. Prior to the effective date of the 1975 amendments to Rule 11, this Court held: \u201cThe defendant shall be placed under oath,\u201d when the court inquires as to plea agreements. <em>Bryan v. United States, </em>5 Cir. 1974, 492 F.2d 775, 781 (en banc); cert. denied 419 U.S. 1079, 95 S.Ct. 668, 42 L.Ed.2d 674 (1974). Whether or not <em>Bryan </em>continues to be mandatory in the light of the subsequent amendments to Rule 11 we do not here consider. Since the defendant\u2019s plea of guilty must be vacated, we note merely that prudence would indicate compliance with <em>Bryan </em>until the Court again addresses the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-10\">The judgment dismissing appellant\u2019s motion to vacate his sentence is reversed, and the cause is remanded to the district court where Coody must be allowed to plead anew.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-11\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
