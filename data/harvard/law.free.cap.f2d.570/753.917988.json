Tatum appeals from a second dismissal of his <em>pro se </em>civil rights complaint. He seeks declaratory, injunctive and monetary relief against officials of the United Methodist Church for his dismissal, without procedural safeguards, from his parish and from the United Methodist Church. He also alleged that the church discriminates against black ministers in assignments to parishes, transfers and dismissals.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-24\">In October of 1976, in an unpublished opinion, this court affirmed the dismissal of Tatum\u2019s claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 because he failed to allege state action. However, we reversed the dismissal of his claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981, because an allegation of state action is not a prerequisite to a claim of racial discrimination under that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-25\">On remand, the district court denied Tatum\u2019s motions for disqualification of the district court judge and for summary judgment. It granted the defendants\u2019 motions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>to dismiss on the grounds that the claim was barred by the applicable state statute of limitations and that venue was improper. We find that the applicable statute of limitations bars Tatum\u2019s claim, and affirm the dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">Because \u201cthere is no specifically stated or otherwise relevant federal statute of limitations for a cause of action under \u00a7 1981, the controlling period would ordinarily be the most appropriate one provided by state law.\u201d <em>Johnson v. Railroad Express Agency, </em>421 U.S. 454, 463, 95 S.Ct. 1716, 1721, 44 L.Ed.2d 295 (1975). We agree with the district court that the most appropriate Iowa statute of limitations is Iowa Code Ann. \u00a7 614.1(4), which applies to actions founded on unwritten contracts and to \u201call other actions not otherwise provided for in this respect.\u201d It has been construed by the Iowa courts to include actions on liabilities created by statute. <em>See Preston v. Howell, </em>219 Iowa 230, 250, 257 N.W. 415, 425 (1934). Tatum filed his complaint on June 11, 1976, and exhibit A to his complaint reveals that he was dismissed in 1968. Therefore, the five-year period of limitations provided for in \u00a7 614.1(4) bars his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">Tatum\u2019s allegation that the defendants \u201clulled\u201d him into not filing suit was not presented to the district court, is contradicted by the record, and does not constitute equitable estoppel under Iowa law. <em>Cf. DeWall v. Prentice, </em>224 N.W.2d 428, 432 (Iowa 1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
