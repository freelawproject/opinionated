In this motion the Defenders Office argues that this court\u2019s order of October 19, 1977, affirming the District Court\u2019s judgment of conviction and sentence of 18 months, with all except three months suspended, is in conflict with the opinions of three other Circuits. Treating appellant\u2019s motion as both a motion for rehearing and a motion for stay of mandate, we deny rehearing and grant the stay.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-19\">The issues presented in this appeal were thoroughly considered and accurately answered, we believe, in District Judge Robert DeMascio\u2019s Opinion dated November 24, 1976, and this court\u2019s Order dated October 19, 1977. For the reasons stated therein, we feel appellant\u2019s rights to be informed of the charges against him and to be protected against double jeopardy were amply protected.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-20\">Appellant\u2019s present motion, however, emphasized another constitutional right, namely, the right to Grand Jury indictment contained in the Fifth Amendment. As to this issue, we agree with the District Judge\u2019s Memorandum and Order that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-21\">Where an indictment charges that the defendant transported a falsely made or forged security in interstate commerce knowing it to be falsely made or forged, the grand jury could not reasonably find other than probable cause to believe the defendant acted with the requisite intent. An \u2018unlawful or fraudulent\u2019 intent is implicit in such an allegation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b653-22\">We also agree with the District Judge\u2019s opinion in holding that <em>Russell v. United States, </em>369 U.S. 749, 82 S.Ct. 1038, 8 L.Ed.2d 240 (1962), cited by appellant, is inapposite. <em>Russell </em>held the indictment invalid because of its failure to include \u201ca specific identification of fact\u201d which <em>Russell </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>was required to meet, <em>Russell v. United States, supra </em>at 764, 82 S.Ct. at 1047. While in our instant case, we are asked to reverse an otherwise fair trial because the indictment, although citing it, failed to simply repeat the language of the criminal statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">In this respect we note, but do not follow, <em>United States v. Beard, </em>414 F.2d 1014 (3d Cir. 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">Further, if, under the facts of this case, we were to assume that the Grand Jury indictment had failed to include an element of the crime, either expressly or by implication, we note that no pretrial motion was made to strike the indictment, as required by Fed.R.Crim.P. 12(a), and that no objection on this ground was offered until completion of the government\u2019s case in chief.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">We believe that modern rules of pleading have been drafted to avoid just such highly technical arguments as these. <em>See </em>Fed.R. Crim.P. 7(a), (b), (c)(1) and (3), and 52(a). In the context of this case, we cannot hold that appellant\u2019s constitutional rights have been prejudiced.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">The motion for rehearing is denied. The motion for stay of mandate pending application for writ of certiorari is granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
