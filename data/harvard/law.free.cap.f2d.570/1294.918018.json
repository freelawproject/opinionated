The towboat M/V HERMAN POTT, pushing a tow of 25 barges, was headed downriver in Scudder Bend, about mile 12 above the confluence of the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers. The M/V ROBERT P. GIPSON, with a tow of one barge, was headed upriver. The GIPSON was lying to the Illinois shore at the left descending bank. The POTT tow collided with the GIPSON, causing damage. GIP-SON\u2019s owner sued POTT, claiming that the POTT\u2019s pilot was negligent and caused the collision. The district court held that the reach of the Mississippi River in which the collision occurred was a \u201cnarrow channel\u201d within the meaning of the Narrow Channel Rule.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court also found the POTT free from fault. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1363-22\">Appellant argues that the Mississippi River at the collision site is 1,200 feet wide and that it provided adequate room for passage of the POTT and the GIPSON. The appellant contends that the district court improperly applied the Narrow Channel Rule; furthermore, appellant urges that the district court was in error in finding the POTT without fault.</p>\n<p id=\"b1363-23\">The argument that the river was wide enough for the tows to pass is insufficient. The application of the Narrow Channel Rule is not based on the physical dimensions of the body of water alone but also on the character of the navigating use to which the water is put. <em>SKIBS A/S SILJESTAD v. S/S MATHEW LUCKENBACH, </em>215 F.Supp. 667, 681 (S.D.N.Y.), <em>aff\u2019d </em>324 F.2d 563 (2d Cir. 1963); <em>THE HOKENDAUQUA, </em>270 F. 270 (D.N.Y.1919) (applying the statutory Narrow Channel Rule, art. 25 of the Inland Rules, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 210).</p>\n<p id=\"b1363-24\">The collision occurred in Scudder Bend, a horseshoe-shaped part of the Mississippi River that extends from approximately mile 10 U.M.R.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to approximately mile 20 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1296\">*1296</page-number>U.M.R. The district court found that the river was at high stage, that there were sandbars on the right descending bank of the reach of the river immediately upriver from Antelope Light, and that there was a strong left-hand set \u2014 a current toward the left descending bank. Furthermore, our observation of a Corps of Engineers Chart of Scudder Bend (defendant\u2019s exhibit number 1) reveals that a vessel must change course over 180 degrees in order to navigate the bend. The overall size of POTT and its tow, 1,143 feet long by 175 feet wide, in addition to the physical conditions of the river, were all properly considered by the district court in determining whether to apply the Narrow Channel Rule. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1364-4\">Since the Narrow Channel Rule is applicable, the GIPSON was at fault for entering the channel before POTT passed downstream. The purpose of the rule is to prevent the development of situations which may lead to collisions \u2014 by keeping an ascending vessel out of a narrow channel. <em>In Re M/V FAY BLACKMAN, </em>437 F.2d 542, 547 (5th Cir. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b1364-5\">The evidence shows that POTT and GIPSON first became aware of each other\u2019s position in a radio communication when the former was at approximately mile 20 U.M.R. and the latter was at Elk Island Light, approximately mile 7.5 U.M.R. The GIPSON\u2019s pilot testified that the POTT\u2019s pilot told him to proceed upriver to Antelope Light. The POTT\u2019s pilot denied that such conversation took place. The district court, as trier of fact, chose to believe the POTT\u2019s pilot, a choice we will not disturb. <em>Hodgson </em>v. <em>Morgan Daniel Seafoods, Inc., </em>433 F.2d 918 (5th Cir. 1970); Wright &amp; Miller, Federal Practice &amp; Procedure: Civil \u00a7 2586. The appellant\u2019s argument as to POTT\u2019s negligence is a credibility choice; the finding that the POTT was free from negligence is, therefore, not to be overturned.</p>\n<p id=\"b1364-6\">GIPSON was aware of POTT prior to GIPSON\u2019s entrance into Scudder Bend. GIPSON should have lain to and permitted the downstream tow to pass. By entering the bend and lying to at Antelope Light\u2014 where there was a strong left-hand set to the left descending bank and sandbars on the right \u2014 GIPSON violated the Narrow Channel Rule. We find no error in the opinion of the district court, and its judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1363-18\">. 33 C.F.R. \u00a7 95.11: \u201cWhen two steam vessels are about to enter a narrow channel at the same time, the ascending steam vessel shall be stopped below such channel until the descending steam vessel shall have passed through it ....</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1363-25\">. \u201cU.M.R.\u201d stands for \u201cUpper Mississippi River.\u201d The United States Corps of Engineers designates the Upper Mississippi as that part of the river above its confluence with the Ohio River.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
