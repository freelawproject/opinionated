Zimmerman and Billie Zimmerman from a November 7, 1977, Order entered in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas. We dismiss the \u201cappeal-petition.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b580-20\">This \u201cappeal-petition\u201d involves the third of five petitions for a writ of habeas corpus, noted by this Court in <em>Zimmerman v. Spears, </em>565 F.2d 310, 315-16 (5th Cir. 1977):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AeTT\">A third petition for a writ of habeas corpus was made to Chief Judge Brown, initially. Chief Judge Brown forwarded this petition to the Clerk of the United States District Court, Southern District of Texas \u2018for appropriate action.\u2019 The papers contained the petition and affidavit of Leona Weber, purporting to act on behalf of the Zimmermans, and the powers of attorney signed by the Zimmer-mans. It was entitled \u2018Second Application to Circuit Judge John R. Brown, individually and as a Judge who is a Circuit judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>writ of habeas corpus, pursuant to Article 1, Section 9, United States Constitution, and Title 28 U.S.C. Sections 2241-2254.\u2019 On November 7, 1977, Judge Spears.ordered that since Leona Weber had not been admitted to practice law her affidavit could not be filed. Chief Judge Spears did order the Clerk to file the powers of attorney. A similar order was entered on October 17, 1977, regarding the affidavit of C. W. Steinbrecher. The pertinent principles of law concerning lay representation and their application to the facts here are clear and require no further discussion on our part. There was no notice of appeal filed from that order.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">Leona Weber attempted to file a Notice of Appeal from the November 7, 1977, Order by letter dated January 5, 1978. The deputy clerk of the district court refused to file the Notice of Appeal citing this Court\u2019s opinion, quoted above, and the November 7, 1977, Order itself, which states, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ajb\">[T]he Clerk is directed to refuse to file the affidavit of Leona Weber, since her name does not appear on the rolls of those admitted to practice in this Court, and it does not appear that such individual is an attorney authorized to practice law in this state. However, while the Clerk is authorized to file the powers of attorney signed by John R. Zimmerman and Billie Zimmerman on the 4th day of October, it should be clearly understood that this Court does not at this time recognize or accept Leona Weber as the true and lawful attorney to act for either of them in compiling, signing and filing court documents of any kind or character whatsoever.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-8\">Thus, this \u201cappeal-petition\u201d raises the issue whether the district court was correct to refuse to allow Leona Weber to file a petition for habeas corpus relief on behalf of the Zimmermans.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b581-9\">Title 28, United States Code, Section 2242 provides, in part, that \u201c[an] application for a writ of habeas corpus shall be in writing signed and verified by the person for whose relief it is intended <em>or by someone acting in his behalf.\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied) The words \u201cor by someone acting in his behalf\u201d were added to the statute to be consistent with the actual practice of the courts. <em>See Collins v. Traeger, </em>27 F.2d 842 (9th Cir. 1928); <em>United States ex rel. Funaro v. Watchorn, </em>164 F. 152 (C.C.S.D.N.Y.1908). The actual practice of entertaining such so-called \u201cnext friend\u201d applications, while not common, may occasionally be useful or even necessary. <em>See, e. g., United States ex rel. Toth </em>v. <em>Quarles, </em>350 U.S. 11, 76 S.Ct. 1, 100 L.Ed. 8 (1955). However, a \u201cnext friend\u201d may not file a petition in every case in which the person actually detained might file a petition. Over the years, a small body of case law has developed around the question of when a \u201cnext friend\u201d application is appropriate. Three principles, which control the resolution of the issue raised here, can be distilled from the precedents.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> First, the authority of one person to apply for a writ of habeas corpus for the release of another will be recognized only when the application for the writ establishes some reason or explanation, satisfactory to the court, showing: (1) why the detained person did not sign and verify the petition and (2) the relationship and inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>est of the would be \u201cnext-friend.\u201d Second, individuals not licensed to practice law by the state may not use the \u201cnext friend\u201d device as an artifice for the unauthorized practice of law. The \u201cnext friend\u201d expedient, which on occasion may be essential to the efficacy of the \u201cGreat Writ,\u201d may not be so abused as to unleash on the courts a quasi-professional group of lay writ writers who would seek to right all wrongs, both real and imagined. Third, when the application for habeas corpus filed by a would be \u201cnext friend\u201d does not set forth an adequate reason or explanation of the necessity for resort to the \u201cnext friend\u201d device, the court is without jurisdiction to consider the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">Our review of the \u201cSECOND APPLICATION TO CIRCUIT JUDGE JOHN R. BROWN, INDIVIDUALLY AS A JUDGE, WHO IS A CIRCUIT JUDGE OF THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT, FOR THE WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS, PURSUANT TO ARTICLE 1 SECTION 9, U. S. CONSTITUTION, AND TITLE 28 U.S.C., SECTIONS 2241-2554 [2254],\u201d the Order appealed from, the \u201cappeal-petition\u201d of Leona Weber, and the appendix leads us to conclude that the district court was correct to refuse to file Leona Weber\u2019s application. The application did not establish any reason or explanation of the necessity for resort to the \u201cnext friend\u201d device, and none appears on the record. Here the requisite showing of a need for a \u201cnext friend\u201d is lacking; the powers of attorney, executed by the Zim-mermans, cannot alone transform Leona Weber into a \u201cnext friend.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"ane-dedup-0\">. . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-8\">But the complaint must set forth some reason or explanation satisfactory to the court showing why the detained person does not sign and verify the complaint and who \u2018the next friend\u2019 is. It was not intended that the writ of habeas corpus should be availed of, as matter of course, by intruders or uninvited meddlers, styling themselves next friends, (citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-10\">Since she has not qualified as a \u201cnext friend,\u201d Leona Weber may not participate in the unauthorized practice of law by preparing legal papers, filing petitions and briefs, and generally acting as an attorney in violation of state and federal provisions governing the unauthorized practice of law. The powers of attorney executed by the Zimmermans do not invest her with such authority. The Zimmermans are not entitled to have an unlicensed lay person represent them either in the district court or here.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Since we have concluded that Leona Weber has not qualified as a \u201cnext friend\u201d and since she is not authorized to practice law, this \u201cappeal-petition\u201d is</p>\n<p id=\"b582-11\">DISMISSED.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b580-12\">. The \u201cMOTION FOR FOLLOWING CIRCUIT JUDGES TO RECUSE THEMSELVES FROM THIS ACTION\u201d is denied. The motion urges the recusal of eight judges of this Court, including all on the present panel, in conjunction with Appellant-petitioner's Certificate under Local Rule 13(a), 5th Cir. Rules \u201cbecause of their previous association in other civil cases involving the same parties and issues of this case.\u201d For purposes of recusal, it is insufficient to allege, without more, that a judge is familiar with the factual and procedural background of a case by reason of having served as a judge in previous related cases. 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 455. <em>See Smith v. United States, </em>360 F.2d 590 (5th Cir. 1966).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b581-6\">. We do not decide whether Leona Weber\u2019s persistence in the unauthorized practice of law, in the face of repeated clear warnings, can be deemed contempt. That determination, in the first instance, is properly for the district court judge who is more fully familiar with the \u201cprocedural plethora\u201d which surrounds the Zim-mermans and Leona Weber.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b581-7\">. <em>Wilson v.
