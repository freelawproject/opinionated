Caviness drove, apparently at Carrico\u2019s instance, or at least with his express consent and agreement. Caviness was neither Renter, employer, employee, partner, executive officer, or member of Carrico\u2019s immediate family as mentioned in the contract between Avis and Carrico.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-18\">A wreck took place while Caviness was driving in which two hitchhiker passengers, the Muellers, were injured. The Muellers\u2019 claim against Caviness and Carrico brought about this suit for a declaratory judgment on the question of the coverage afforded by Liberty Mutual to the estate of Caviness.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-19\">The district court held that, Caviness not being among those permitted by the contract between Carrico and Avis to operate the vehicle, his estate was not afforded coverage under the policy.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In so doing, it correctly applied Virginia Code \u00a7 38.1-381 (the omnibus clause) and other applicable Virginia law. Harsh as the result may seem to be, as was also recognized by the district court, because of the contract between Avis and Carrico, we are of opinion there is no error in the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-20\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b577-13\">. We do not have before us any question as to the coverage afforded Carrico by the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"Av_\">The opinion of the district court is reported in 432 F.Supp. 325 (W.D.Va.1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
