He was represented by privately retained counsel at the guilty plea proceeding and at sentencing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b886-14\">Olles petitioned for vacation of his sentence, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, challenging the validity of his guilty plea. The trial court held an evidentiary hearing at which Olles was represented by appointed counsel, and the court subsequently denied Olles\u2019 petition. The court found that Olles\u2019 plea was freely, voluntarily and intelligently made, and that he was adequately represented by counsel throughout the proceedings against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-15\">On appeal Olles contends that the district court erred in finding that his plea was voluntary. He argues that his counsel failed to discuss with him, or correctly advise him as to, the admissibility of certain evidence, including an allegedly coerced confession, identification testimony based on a lineup, and money taken in the robbery. We find that the trial court fully complied with the requirements of Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure in accepting Olles\u2019 plea, and Olles does not argue otherwise. Accordingly, although his attack upon the voluntary and intelligent nature of the plea is not foreclosed, Olles bears a \u201cheavy burden.\u201d See <em>Tucker v. United States, </em>470 F.2d 220, 221 (8th Cir. 1972), <em>cert. denied, </em>412 U.S. 929, 93 S.Ct. 2758, 37 L.Ed.2d 157 (1973). To successfully <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>challenge the voluntariness of his plea, Olles must show that the advice he received from counsel was not \u201cwithin the range of competence demanded of attorneys in criminal cases.\u201d <em>McMann v. Richardson, </em>397 U.S. 759, 771, 90 S.Ct. 1441, 1449, 25 L.Ed.2d 763 (1970). See also <em>Tollett </em>v. <em>Henderson, </em>411 U.S. 258, 267, 93 S.Ct. 1602, 36 L.Ed.2d 235 (1973); <em>Huffman v. Missouri, </em>527 F.2d 899, 900 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>426 U.S. 924, 96 S.Ct. 2634, 49 L.Ed.2d 379 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">We find substantial evidence to support the trial court\u2019s determination that Olles\u2019 counsel was reasonably competent. At the post-conviction hearing, Olles\u2019 attorney, whom the trial court apparently found to be credible, testified that he had at least three conversations with Olles. He stated that he informed Olles of the government\u2019s evidence and that he discussed its admissibility with him; that he informed Olles of the government\u2019s agreement not to use as evidence the money taken in the robbery which Olles gave to his attorney and which his attorney turned over to the government; <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and that, although he concurred in Olles\u2019 decision to plead guilty, he did not suggest the plea. Given the nature of the evidence against Olles, which included eyewitnesses and money taken in the robbery and given by Olles to his bondsman, it is difficult to conclude that his attorney\u2019s representation and advice was not reasonably competent. Having received competent representation by counsel, Olles may not collaterally impeach his guilty plea by asserting that his attorney misjudged the admissibility of his confession or other evidence. <em>McMann v. Richardson, supra, </em>397 U.S. 759, 90 S.Ct. 1441; <em>Tucker v. United States, supra, </em>470 F.2d at 222.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-6\">Olles\u2019 other allegations of misconduct by his attorney and the government cannot stand in the way of his conviction if factual guilt is established. <em>See Menna v. New York, </em>423 U.S. 61, 62 n. 2, 96 S.Ct. 241, 46 L.Ed.2d 195 (1975). Since there is substantial evidence to support the finding that Olles\u2019 admission of guilt was voluntary and intelligent, the conviction must stand. Accordingly, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b886-16\">. Bobby Joe Olles received a six-year sentence after pleading guilty to bank robbery in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b887-7\">. Olles alleges that his attorney violated the confidentiality of the attorney-client relationship by turning over to the government money taken in the robbery and given by Olles to his attorney. Even if that allegation is true, the government\u2019s agreement not to use that money as evidence against Olles would have negated any coercive effect of Olles\u2019 attorney\u2019s conduct on Olles\u2019 decision to plead guilty.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
