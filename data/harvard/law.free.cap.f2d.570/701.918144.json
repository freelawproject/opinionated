On that date the Administrator, Packers and Stockyards Administration, filed a complaint against Mid-States Livestock, Inc., Gordon Reisinger, president of Mid-States, and Dale E. Van Wyk, secretary-treasurer of Mid-States, who were designated as respondents. The complaint alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>that Mid-States was a corporation under the direction, control, and management of the above-named corporate officers; that Mid-States, Reisinger, and Van Wyk engaged in the business of buying and selling livestock in commerce; and that the corporation and the individual respondents had registered with the Secretary of Agriculture as dealers to buy and sell livestock in commerce and as market agencies to buy livestock in commerce on commission. The complaint further alleged that all three respondents willfully violated (1) the provisions of the Packers and Stockyards Act of 1921, as amended and supplemented, 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 181 <em>et seq., </em>by engaging in unfair or deceptive practices or devices, and (2) the regulations promulgated under the Act by the Secretary of Agriculture, 9 C.F.R. \u00a7 201.1 <em>et seq., </em>by failing to make sufficient funds available for the payment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>of drafts and checks issued for the purchase of livestock.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-4\">Mid-States did not contest the complaint, waived oral hearing, and consented to an order based on the allegations of the complaint. Van Wyk filed an answer denying, in effect, that he had violated the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">In due time, hearings were conducted by The Honorable John H. Campbell, Chief Administrative Law Judge, from October 22,1974 through October 25,1974, and from November 19, 1974 through November 21, 1974. Numerous witnesses were heard and many exhibits received into evidence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After weighty consideration and analysis of all of the evidence, the ALJ filed his initial decision and order on November 1, 1976. The exhaustive and detailed findings and conclusions of the ALJ are reported in the Decisions of the Secretary of Agriculture. 35 A.D. 1879 (1976). The ALJ ordered Van Wyk, to the extent that he is a registrant under the Act, and Van\u2019s Livestock, Inc., a corporate device and a corporate successor to Mid-States, suspended as registrants for a period of thirty days. <em>Id. </em>at 1897.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">Van Wyk appealed to the judicial officer to whom final administrative authority to decide Department cases subject to the Administrative Procedure Act has been delegated.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">On February 11,1977, the judicial officer filed his decision and order. 36 A.D. 172 (1977). After taking notice of the contentions of the petitioners in this proceeding, the judicial officer adopted the decision and order of the ALJ \u201cwith trivial changes except for the addition of footnotes 8 and 9.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 173. Additionally, the judicial officer increased the period of suspension of the registrations of Van Wyk and Van\u2019s Livestock, Inc. from thirty to sixty days.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-10\">Dale Van Wyk and Van\u2019s Livestock, Inc. filed a timely petition in this court to review the order of the Secretary.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-11\">The ALJ and judicial officer have, with painstaking care, fully and accurately explicated all relevant evidence and considered the contentions of the petitioners. We need only observe that we have canvassed the voluminous record and have concluded that no rational basis exists on which to interfere with the order of suspension. For the purpose of this opinion, a brief resume of the pertinent evidence will suffice.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-12\">Mid-States was primarily engaged in the buying and selling of cattle, both on commission and for its own account. This business proved profitable, but the respondents were not content to devote their full energies and resources to their livestock activities, which were large and expansive. They embarked upon speculating in commodities, and this enterprise led to the collapse and downfall of Mid-States and Reisinger. Van Wyk, who was more affluent financially, also suffered losses. The commodities speculations were profitable until, on Van Wyk\u2019s urging, Mid-States changed its commodities position from \u201cshort\u201d to \u201clong.\u201d As a result, during September of 1973, Mid-States became subject to increased margin calls which Van Wyk and Reisinger agreed to cover with Mid-States\u2019 operating monies. Mid-States soon began suffering cash-flow difficulties, but continued to purchase cattle. Efforts to salvage Mid-States\u2019 financial position failed, and many of those who had sold livestock to Mid-States during the period were paid either late or not at all. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>Mid-States ceased buying and selling livestock on October 3, 1973.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\">Shortly after Mid-States\u2019 collapse, Van Wyk resumed buying and selling livestock individually and through a corporation, Van\u2019s Livestock, Inc., formed by Van Wyk in November of 1973. Van\u2019s Livestock, Inc. is owned by Van Wyk and his wife. It is quite similar in operation to Mid-States, employs former Mid-States personnel, utilizes some former Mid-States facilities, and services many of Mid-States\u2019 former customers. Both Van Wyk and Van\u2019s Livestock, Inc. received substantial operating loans from the bank which Mid-States formerly used. These loans were secured in part by a pledge of Van Wyk\u2019s Mid-States\u2019 shares.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">The ALJ found that the failure of Mid-States to pay for livestock in a timely manner was (1) a willful \u201cunfair ... or deceptive practice or device\u201d contrary to \u00a7 312(a) of the Packers and Stockyards Act, 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 213(a),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and (2) a violation of \u00a7 201.43(b) of the regulations of the Secretary of Agriculture, 9 C.F.R. \u00a7 201.43(b).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He also concluded that Van\u2019s Livestock, Inc. was the corporate successor to Mid-States.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">We turn now to the contentions presented for our determination, and in our disposition thereof will elaborate as necessary on the basic and essential facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b772-8\">Petitioners maintain that the transactions on which this case is predicated involve only debtor/creditor concerns, and do not fall within the regulatory scheme of the Packers and Stockyards Act. We disagree. The numerous cases relied upon by petitioners are readily distinguishable and do not support petitioners\u2019 claim that this proceeding has no jurisdictional basis in the Packers and Stockyards Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-15\">One purpose of the Act \u201cis to assure fair trade practices in the livestock marketing . . . industry in order to safeguard farmers and ranchers against receiving less than the true market value of their livestock.\u201d <em>Bruhn\u2019s Freezer Meats v. United States Department of Agriculture, </em>438 F.2d 1332, 1337 (8th Cir. 1971). Timely payment in a livestock purchase prevents the seller from being forced, in effect, to finance the transaction. By insuring that the seller will receive the fair market value of his livestock, undiminished by the cost of financing the sale, the requirement that a purchaser make timely payment fulfills the purpose of the Act. Mid-States contravened that requirement, and thus became subject to the sanctions which the Act provides. <em>See Mahon v. Stowers, </em>416 U.S. 100, 111, 94 S.Ct. 1626, 40 L.Ed.2d 79 (1973) (dictum); <em>Bowman v. United States Department of Agriculture, </em>363 F.2d 81, 85 (5th Cir. 1966). That Mid-States\u2019 inability to meet its obligations may be characterized as a debtor/creditor problem is irrelevant to our disposition of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-18\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b772-19\">Petitioners next argue that the failure of Mid-States to pay for livestock when due involved a series of isolated acts and was therefore not an \u201cunfair ... or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>deceptive practice or device\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 312(a) of the Act. They rely primarily on <em>Guenther v. Morehead, </em>272 F.Supp. 721 (S.D. Iowa 1967), which held that \u00a7 312(a) did not apply to the wrongful negotiation of a check.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">We find <em>Guenther </em>inapposite! The present case embraces thirty-one cattle purchases resulting in losses of over $500,000 to livestock owners. Mid-States\u2019 failure to pay for the cattle it had purchased involved a deliberate course of conduct, not an isolated event. That conduct was proscribed by \u00a7 312(a). <em>See Bowman v. United States Department of Agriculture, supra </em>at 85; <em>Swift &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>317 F.2d 53 (7th Cir. 1963) (\u201cunfair ... or deceptive practice or device\u201d under \u00a7 202(a) of the Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">Mid-States\u2019 failure to pay was also clearly proscribed by \u00a7 201.43(b) of the regulations of the Secretary of Agriculture. 9 C.F.R. \u00a7 201.43(b). That section represents the Secretary\u2019s construction of the Act. And, of course, great deference is accorded the construction of a statute by the agency charged with its enforcement. <em>Griggs v. Duke Power Co., </em>401 U.S. 424, 433-34, 91 S.Ct. 849, 28 L.Ed.2d 158 (1971); <em>Udall v. Tallman, </em>380 U.S. 1, 16, 85 S.Ct. 792, 13 L.Ed.2d 616 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b773-7\">In sum, we conclude that the Secretary had jurisdiction to adjudicate petitioners\u2019 case.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b773-9\">Finally, petitioner Van\u2019s Livestock, Inc. complains that it was never formally notified of the charges against it. Van\u2019s Livestock, Inc. contends that its suspension is therefore invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-10\">The ALJ found that Van\u2019s Livestock, Inc. is the corporate successor to Mid-States. Substantial evidence supports that finding. As we stated in <em>Bruhn\u2019s Freezer Meats v. United States Department of Agriculture, supra </em>at 1343:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-11\">[T]he corporate entity may be disregarded when the failure to do so would enable the corporate device to be used to circumvent a statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b773-12\">The record convincingly demonstrates that the Secretary\u2019s case and respondents\u2019 defense treated the proceedings as encompassing Van\u2019s Livestock, Inc. Thus, failure to name Van\u2019s Livestock, Inc. as a respondent in the original complaint was not prejudicial to either of the petitioners. To permit Van\u2019s Livestock, Inc. to escape suspension would obviate the sanctions imposed on Van Wyk and Mid-States. Moreover, formal notice would have been superfluous because Van\u2019s Livestock, Inc. is Mid-States\u2019 corporate successor and Van Wyk\u2019s alter ego. <em>See Sebastopol Meat Co. v. Secretary of Agriculture, </em>440 F.2d 983, 984-86 (9th Cir. 1971); <em>Bruhn\u2019s Freezer Meats v. United States Department of Agriculture, supra </em>at 1342-43.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-13\">We conclude that the facts reflected by this record reveal a flagrant and aggravated violation of the pertinent provisions of the Act, and the sanction imposed was fully justified. The order of the Secretary is affirmed and the petition for review is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b771-8\">. Respondent Gordon Reisinger was represented by counsel in the hearings before the administrative law judge. When called as a witness, he invoked the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution and refused to testify. The activities of Mid-States, under the control of the two individual respondents, resulted in substantial losses to sellers of livestock, and litigation ensued. In connection with that litigation, Gordon Reisinger\u2019s deposition was taken on two occasions subsequent to the hearings in this case before the administrative law judge. The first deposition was taken on the 24th of January, 1975, in Eldora, Hardin County, Iowa. The second deposition was taken in September, 1975, apparently in Leavenworth, Kansas. According to Gordon Reisinger\u2019s testimony appearing in the transcript of the September, 1975 deposition, he was then confined to Leavenworth, Kansas, and had received a two-year sentence \u201cfor conspiracy, embezzlement, and mortgaging mortgaged property.\u201d Deposition of Gordon Reisinger, September, 1975, Vol. II, at 142. By agreement, the depositions of Reis-inger were made a part of the record in this proceeding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b772-9\">.

Any such agreement shall be disclosed in the records of any market agency or dealer selling the livestock, and in the purchaser\u2019s records and on the accounts or other documents issued by the purchaser relating to the transaction.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
