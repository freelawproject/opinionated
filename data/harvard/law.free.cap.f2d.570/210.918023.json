All six petitioners filed a notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-16\">The petitions alleged that the three male petitioners were employed by Hamlin, Inc., a Delaware corporation, which manufactures, distributes and sells electronic components, with two plants in Wisconsin and one in Mexico. Educo, Inc., a Delaware corporation, engages in designing, implementing and administering college educational benefit plans for corporate employers, including Hamlin.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-17\">In September 1969, Educo and Hamlin entered into an agreement under which Educo agreed to administer a plan (Educo Plan) to provide funds for certain educational and related expenses of children of key Hamlin employees. The plan was suggested by petitioner Owens. Hamlin agreed to make payments to a Chicago bank as trustee, and Educo agreed to direct the trustee to pay expenses of qualified children of Hamlin employees incurred in attending college, university, or trade and vocational schools in the continental United States. In certain circumstances, a qualified child would forfeit his right to receive payments under the Educo Plan, and subject to Hamlin\u2019s directions the forfeited funds would then be applied for the benefit of other children involved in the Educo Plan or against Hamlin\u2019s scheduled future payments to the trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-18\">When the Educo Plan went into effect in 1969, twenty-seven children of twelve key employees of Hamlin were covered, and the benefits they received were without respect to compensation paid by Hamlin to their parents. Subsequently benefited children included three Armantrouts, three Peppers and a son of the Owens. For the taxable years in question, the Commissioner adjusted the petitioners\u2019 taxable income by add<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>ing the amounts their children received as Educo Plan benefits in those years.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">In the Commissioner\u2019s Answers, he asserted that the educational payments to the petitioners\u2019 children were paid as a part of the pattern of their respective fathers\u2019 employment, and that \u201c[bjecause of this direct relation to the [male] petitioner\u2019s employment the amounts are compensation includable in the petitioner\u2019s income.\u201d Three stipulations of facts were filed at the commencement of the one-day trial in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Five witnesses testified and various exhibits were received by the Tax Court judge. Eight months thereafter, after considering the briefs of the parties, he handed down a decision in the Commissioner\u2019s favor and approving the deficiencies previously determined, citing 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 61 and 83.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The judge\u2019s findings of fact and opinion are reported in 67 T.C. 996. We adopt them as our own and add the following comments:</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">This case is a branch of <em>Educo, Inc. v. Alexander, </em>557 F.2d 617 (7th Cir. 1977). There Educo, represented by same counsel as petitioners, attacked a Revenue Ruling that Educo-type plan benefits constitute deferred compensation to corporate employees, so that amounts contributed by the employer would be deductible only in the taxable year in which an amount attributable to the contribution would be included in the gross income of those employees on whose behalf the contributions had been made. Educo also argued there that the children rather than the parents should pay the income taxes on the educational benefits provided. Since Educo was unable to show that the Government could not prevail, we held that the exception to the Anti-Injunction Act (26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7421(a)) was inapplicable, so that the district court had properly denied equitable relief. In the present case we reach the merits of the question whether the parents are taxable on the educational benefits and hold that they are.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-9\">This case is controlled by the seminal principle reaffirmed in <em>United States v. Basye, </em>410 U.S. 441, 450, 93 S.Ct. 1080, 35 L.Ed.2d 412, that one who earns income may not avoid taxation through anticipatory arrangements. First, from Hamlin\u2019s perspective, as the Tax Court judge found, the Educo payments are actually part of the compensation earned by these three Hamlin employees. As he concluded, the amounts paid under the Educo Plan were compensatory in nature because the plan \u201cwas adopted by Hamlin to relieve its most important employees from concern about the high costs of providing a college education for their children. It was hoped that the plan would thereby enable the key employees to render better service to Hamlin.\u201d Second, from the employees\u2019 perspective, because the Educo program was designed to attract and satisfy key employees, because arms-length negotiation exists between the parties (compare <em>Teschner v. Commissioner, </em>38 T.C. 1003 (1962)), and because it is admitted that the employees \u201call wanted it\u201d (Tr. 34), it cannot be assumed that the petitioners were not without control of the manner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>in which they were compensated. Cf. <em>United States v. Basye, </em>410 U.S. 441, 452, 93 S.Ct. 1080, 35 L.Ed.2d 412. As the Tax Court judge found, there is no evidence to indicate that petitioners were unable to bargain with Hamlin about the terms of their employment and the available avenues of compensation. As <em>Basye </em>held, it is immaterial that the payments were never received by taxpayers, for \u201c \u2018the first principle of income taxation [is] that income must be taxed to him who earns it.\u2019 <em>Commissioner v. Culbertson, </em>337 U.S. 733, 739-740, 69 S.Ct. 1210, 93 L.Ed. 1659 (1949).\u201d 410 U.S. at 449, 93 S.Ct. at 1086. To paraphrase <em>Basye, </em>despite the novelty and ingenuity of this arrangement, the Hamlin employees\u2019 base compensation in the form of Educo-plan payments was income to them and should have been reported as such. 410 U.S. at 453, 93 S.Ct. 1080. To hold otherwise would foster easy tax evasion, especially since counsel at oral argument said he could make the same contention if the payments were made to petitioners\u2019 needy older relatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">At oral argument (repeated in a post-argument letter), taxpayers\u2019 counsel cited numerous authorities not contained in his brief without giving previous notice to Government counsel. Although this violated Circuit Rule 11, we have examined those authorities and find them inapposite to these facts. Because in reality the Commissioner is only taxing personal service income to the persons who perform the services and because petitioners are not without control over the manner in which they are compensated, there is no merit to petitioners\u2019 argument that the tax violates the Fifth and Sixteenth Amendments. See <em>Sakol v. Commissioner, </em>67 T.C. 986 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">The decisions are affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b279-13\">. Petitioners\u2019 wives were included in the lawsuits only because joint returns were filed by all.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b279-19\">. The deficiencies for Mr. and Mrs. Armantrout were for 1971, 1972 and 1973; for Mr. and Mrs. Pepper, 1973; and for Mr. and Mrs. Owens, 1971.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b280-6\">. Although the Armantrouts\u2019 petition claimed that their children received $1,481.99 in scholarships in 1971, the subsequent first stipulation of facts showed that the amount was $1,035.85; that was the amount the Commissioner added to their parents\u2019 taxable income for 1971.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b280-7\">. Section 61 defines gross income as \u201call income from whatever source derived,\u201d including first of all \u201cCompensation for services.\u201d Section 83 provides that where property is transferred to any person (here the children) other than the person for whom the services are performed (here Educo), the performer of the services (here the fathers) must pay income tax on amounts calculated under Sections 83 and 402(b) of the Internal Revenue Code. Whether the Commissioner uses Section 61 or Section 83, the alleged tax deficiencies would come out the same because they are based entirely on the Educo benefits paid. Nor is the question of liability affected by the choice of Sections given our view of petitioners\u2019 compensation (discussed infra) because the Educo Plan fits within the terms of compensation for services under Section 61 and may also qualify within the more specific language of Section 83. Therefore, like the Tax Court, we need not choose between the Section 61 and Section 83 routes, nor need we decide whether Section 83 applies only to stock plans. Cf. <em>Sakol v. Commissioner, 67 </em>T.C. 986, 989-991 (1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
