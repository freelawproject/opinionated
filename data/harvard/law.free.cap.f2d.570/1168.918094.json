With this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1171\">*1171</page-number>principle in mind, we turn to Bethel\u2019s complaint. i</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-4\">The most relevant sections of the complaint which bear on our discussion of the various statutory claims other than \u00a7 1983 read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1239-5\">11. Defendant employers, individually and in concert, acting alone and through their agents, employees and officers, engaged in and continue to engage in racially discriminatory employment practices against plaintiff and other black persons from 1966 to the present, including but not limited to the following practices:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1239-6\">(a) Refusing to employ plaintiff as a journeyman carpenter because of his race;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1239-7\">(b) Employing plaintiff for only short periods of time, because of his race, and then, for the sole purpose of undertaking the most undesirable duties of a journeyman carpenter, while giving the more desirable jobs to white persons;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1239-8\">(c) Laying off plaintiff after completion by plaintiff of the most undesirable jobs of journeyman carpenters and then employing white carpenters to continue in plaintiff\u2019s stead, despite their lack of experience, skill, seniority and residence, as compared to plaintiff;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1239-9\">(d) Laying off plaintiff, because of his race, while retaining or employing white carpenters despite their lack of skill, experience or seniority as compared to plaintiff;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1239-10\">(e) Transferring plaintiff, because of his race, from job site to job site during job inspections by governmental agents investigating defendants\u2019 compliance with the aforementioned Equal Employment Opportunities Act, in order to give the false impression that defendants employed black carpenters and/or other craftsmen or tradesmen;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1239-11\">(f) Denying plaintiff the opportunity to engage in overtime work because of his race, while granting overtime work to white carpenters, regardless of whether or not they had more or less skill, experience or seniority than plaintiff;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1239-14\">(g) Intentionally depriving plaintiff of the opportunity of having among his co-workers, as journeyman carpenters, other members of his own race;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1239-15\">(h) Refusing to consider plaintiff or other blacks for supervisory positions within the defendant corporations and in the field because of their race;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1239-16\">(i) Denying plaintiff, because of his race, the same on-the-job assistance of other carpenters and other employees as was given to white carpenters;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1239-17\">(j) Refusing to recall plaintiff to work after a layoff because of his race, but instead, employing white carpenters of lesser skill, experience and seniority;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1239-18\">(k) Conspiring with the defendant labor organizations to discriminate against plaintiff and other black persons in employment practices;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1239-19\">(l) Denying plaintiff full employment because of his race.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1239-20\">12. Since 1966, defendant labor organizations, acting alone and in concert with the corporate defendants, and through their agents, employees and officers, engaged in the following racially discriminatory practices against plaintiff and other black persons:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A12_\">.....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1239-21\">(b) Conspiring with the corporate defendants to deny full employment to plaintiff and other black persons</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Abn-\">.....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1239-22\">13. Beginning in November, 1974, and continuing to the present, intending to discriminate against plaintiff for asserting his right to be free of racially discriminatory employment practices and employment opportunities, and to punish him for asserting such rights and for filing complaints against Jendoco Construction Corporation, Navarro Corporation, Noralco Corporation, Graziano Construction Company, Inc., Carpenters\u2019 District Council of Western Pennsylvania, and United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America with the Equal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1172\">*1172</page-number>Employment Opportunity Commission and the Human Relations Commission of the City of Pittsburgh, Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the defendants conspired among themselves to deprive plaintiff of fair employment opportunities; furthermore, they have denied him employment opportunities as a journeyman carpenter; in addition, they have intentionally, wil-fully, maliciously and wickedly, acting through their supervisory personnel, deprived plaintiff full employment, harassed plaintiff on job sites, [and] made disparaging comments about plaintiff because of his assertion of such rights. .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1240-4\">14. Each defendant, conspiring with the other defendants, through its agents, officers and employees, from 1966 to the present, has gone upon the premises of persons owning real estate for the purpose of then and there carrying out construction activities and for the purpose, incidental thereto, of continuing to deprive plaintiff and other black persons, directly or indirectly, of the equal protection of the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the United States of America which grant plaintiff full and equal employment opportunities, and this, each and everyone of the defendants herein has done in violation of the terms of 42 U.S.C. 1985(3).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1240-5\">15. Defendants, and each of them, through their individual agents, employees and officers, had knowledge of the wrongs conspired to be done and done by their own agents, employees and officers and by their subdivisions and by and with the other defendants, in depriving plaintiff and other black persons of their right to be free of racially discriminatory employment practices, and having power to prevent or aid in preventing such acts, neglected and refused to prevent such wrongful acts, in violation of 42 U.S.C. 1986, and are, therefore, liable to plaintiff under the terms of said act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1240-8\">16. As a direct and proximate result of the aforementioned acts of the defendants, acting individually and/or in concert, plaintiff has suffered and will suffer mental anguish and humiliation, public scorn and derision, and damaged reputation; he has lost and will continue to lose large sums of money because of a lack of full and fair employment; and he has been denied the full and fair fruits of his membership in the labor organizations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"a1u-dedup-0\">.....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1240-9\">51. In retaliation for plaintiff having commenced this civil rights action, all defendant corporations have knowingly and intentionally refused to hire plaintiff since the action was filed, despite repeated applications made to the offices and job sites of each and every corporate defendant between September, 1975 and March, 1976, and plaintiff believes, and therefore avers, that said corporations have entered into an agreement with the defendant-union to attempt to deprive plaintiff of the means of making a livelihood in order to punish plaintiff. . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1240-10\">52. Plaintiff believes, and therefore avers, that since plaintiff filed a complaint with the E. E. 0. C., representatives of defendant corporations have met together to coordinate their handling of plaintiff and have orally agreed not to hire plaintiff despite the fact that they have not employed black carpenters, in order to impose sanctions upon plaintiff for asserting his rights to equal employment opportunities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1240-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-12\">CLAIMS UNDER \u00a7\u00a7 1985(3) AND 1986</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-13\">To come within the purview of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985(3),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Bethel\u2019s complaint was required to allege four matters:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1241-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1173\">*1173</page-number>(1) a conspiracy;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1241-5\">(2) for the purposes of depriving another (Bethel) of equal protection or equal privileges and immunities;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1241-6\">(3) any act in furtherance of the conspiracy committed or caused to be committed by a conspirator;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1241-7\">(4) whereby another (Bethel) was injured in his or her person or property or deprived of a right or privilege as a United States citizen.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1241-8\"><em>Griffin v. Breckenridge, </em>403 U.S. 88, 102-05. 91 S.Ct. 1790, 29 L.Ed.2d 338 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"AGs_\">In the preceding, excerpted paragraphs of Bethel\u2019s complaint, Bethel has clearly and unequivocally alleged a cause of action under \u00a7 1985(3). He has alleged with sufficient concreteness the four elements specified in the statute and required under <em>Griffin v. Breckenridge. </em>Moreover, Bethel alleges \u201cspecific facts\u201d of discrimination,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>see, e. g., </em>Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 11) 13, as well as of a conspiracy,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>see, e. g., id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 13, 14, 51. Finally, in alleging race-based discrimination, the complaint clearly charges that Bethel was a victim of \u201cinvidious, purposeful and <em>intentional </em>discrimination <em>between classes </em>or individuals.\u201d <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>McCorkle, </em>462 F.2d 111, 113 (3d Cir.) (emphasis added), <em>cert. denied, </em>409 U.S. 1042, 93 S.Ct. 529, 34 L.Ed.2d 492 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-11\">The district court, in dismissing Bethel\u2019s \u00a7 1985(3) claim, relied upon <em>Robinson v. McCorkle, supra. </em>That reliance was misplaced, as <em>Robinson </em>is completely distinguishable from the case at bar. In <em>Robinson, </em>this Court upheld the district court\u2019s dismissal of Robinson\u2019s claim, holding that Robinson\u2019s conspiracy allegations were \u201cunsupported by any specific facts,\u201d that his complaint \u201cfail[ed] to make a sufficient showing under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985(3) that [he] was denied equal protection of the law,\u201d and, more generally, that the complaint contained no more than \u201cmere conclusory allegations of deprivations of constitutional rights.\u201d 462 F.2d at 113. Here, by contrast, even a cursory reading reveals that Bethel\u2019s complaint is replete with specific allegations of race-based discrimination<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \u2014conduct proscribed by the Constitution and the remedy for which is provided by the very statute which Bethel invokes. Accepting as true for the purposes of this motion the allegations found in Bethel\u2019s complaint, we hold that the district court erred in dismissing Bethel\u2019s \u00a7 1985(3) claim, thereby preventing him from \u201coffering] evidence to support his claims.\u201d <em>Helstoski v. Goldstein, supra, </em>552 F.2d at 565.</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-17\">Having held that Bethel should be permitted to pursue his \u00a7 1985(3) claim, it is apparent that he must also be permitted to produce, if he can, the evidence supporting his \u00a7 1986 claim,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> which claim had been dismissed by the district court. <em>Cf. Griffin v. Breckenridge, supra; Robinson v. McCor-kle, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1241-18\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-19\">CLAIM UNDER \u00a7 1981</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-20\">Section 1981 of Title 42, United States Code, provides that \u201c[a]ll persons within the jurisdiction of the United States shall have the same right ... to make and en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1174\">*1174</page-number>force contracts . . . as is enjoyed by white citizens.\u201d Challenges to racial discrimination in private employment may be brought under \u00a7 1981. <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Railway Express Agency, Inc., </em>421 U.S. 454, 459-60, 95 S.Ct. 1716, 44 L.Ed.2d 295 (1975); <em>Young v. International Telephone &amp; Telegraph, </em>438 F.2d 757, 759 (3d Cir. 1971). Hence \u00a7 1981 would furnish redress for Bethel against the discriminatory acts alleged in his complaint, if proven, and the district court properly so held. See <em>Bethel v. Jendoco Construction Corp., </em>Civ. Action No. 76-57, at 11 (W.D.Pa. Dec. 6, 1976) (A33, A43).</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-5\">However, the district court, in rejecting a six year statute of limitations argument, also held that the applicable statute of limitations for a \u00a7 1981 claim asserting racial discrimination in employment is two years. The district court then found that Bethel failed to allege any violations by Noralco, Navarro, or Martin &amp; Nettrour within the applicable two-year time period, and thereupon dismissed Bethel\u2019s \u00a7 1981 claims against these three defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-6\">Under Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(c), the statute of limitations constitutes an affirmative defense to an action. Under the law of this and other circuits, however, the limitations defense may be raised on a motion under Rule 12(b)(6), but only if \u201cthe time alleged <em>in the statement of a claim </em>shows that the cause of action has not been brought within the statute of limitations.\u201d <em>Hanna v. United States Veterans\u2019 Administration Hospital, </em>514 F.2d 1092, 1094 (3d Cir. 1975) (emphasis added); <em>accord Herron v. Herron, </em>255 F.2d 589, 593 (5th Cir. 1958) (\u201c[tjhere is general agreement . . . that even the defenses of limitations or laches may be asserted by motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim \u2014 provided that the complaint shows affirmatively that the claim is barred\u201d); <em>Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Co. v. Parish, </em>168 F.2d 238, 240 (10th Cir. 1948); <em>Burkhardt v. Liberty, </em>394 F.Supp. 1296, 1298 (W.D.Pa.1975), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>530 F.2d 963 (3d Cir. 1976) (without published opinion); 2A J. Moore, Moore\u2019s Federal Practice \u00b6 9.07, at 1963 (2d ed. 1974); <em>see Currier v. Knapp, </em>442 F.2d 422, 423 (3d Cir. 1971) (per curiam) (statute of frauds, as an affirmative defense, must \u201cbe set forth affirmatively by a party pleading to a preceding pleading\u201d and was improperly entertained under a Rule 12(b)(6) motion).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> If the bar is not apparent on the face of the complaint, then it may not afford the basis for a dismissal of the complaint under Rule 12(b)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-10\">Here the complaint does not satisfy the exception which would permit disposition pursuant to 12(b)(6) motion, for it is apparent that the time limitations alleged on the face of the complaint do not bar Bethel\u2019s \u00a7 1981 charges. Bethel complains that the defendants\u2019 discriminatory acts continue \u201cto the present.\u201d <em>E. g., </em>Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 11, 13, 14; <em>see, e. g., id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 51, 52. <em>See also </em>n. 14 <em>infra. </em>Thus the district court could not properly dismiss these claims on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, for if Bethel\u2019s assertions are true, as we are obliged to presume they are at this stage, each of the discriminatory acts, by having been continued to the date of the filing of the complaint, would necessarily escape the bar of any statute of limitations.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1242-11\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-12\">TITLE VII CLAIM</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-13\">Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e <em>et seq., </em>was enacted to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1175\">*1175</page-number>assure equality of employment opportunities through elimination of discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. <em>Johnson v. Railway Express Agency, supra, </em>421 U.S. at 457, 95 S.Ct. 1716; <em>Alexander v. Gardner-Denver Co., </em>415 U.S. 36, 44, 94 S.Ct. 1011, 39 L.Ed.2d 147 (1974). \u201cIt creates statutory rights against invidious discrimination in employment.\u201d <em>Johnson v. Railway Express Agency, supra, </em>421 U.S. at 457-58, 95 S.Ct. at 1719.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-5\">In its December 6th and December 22nd Orders, the district court dismissed Bethel\u2019s Title VII claim against Navarro.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The court ruled that Bethel stated only that Navarro discharged him in 1973: hence his complaint did not allege a specific discriminatory act by Navarro within the 180-day time period prior to his filing of a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) on March 21, 1975.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Our preceding discussion concerning Be-thel\u2019s \u00a7 1981 claim is pertinent here. Inasmuch as Bethel has alleged violations of Title VII by Navarro which continue \u201cto the present,\u201d it was error to consider this complaint as time-barred without proofs to support such a finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-6\">In \u00b6 32 of his complaint, Bethel alleges not only that Navarro discharged him in 1973 but also that \u201c[d]espite multiple job applications by plaintiff, defendant <em>Navarro Corporation </em>refused to hire plaintiff before September, 1973, or after November 16, 1973, because of his race, and has employed few or no other black persons as a carpenter for at least the past eleven (11) years\u201d (emphasis in original). Furthermore, Bethel alleged that Navarro employs \u201ccontinuing racially discriminatory employment practices,\u201d <em>id., </em>and that the defendants\u2019 discriminatory practices have persisted \u201cto the present,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 11, 13, 14. Taking as true these allegations of the complaint, <em>Helstoski v. Goldstein, supra, </em>552 F.2d at 565, it is apparent that Bethel has alleged Title VII violations by Navarro which continued to the filing of the charge with the EEOC and which therefore must have occurred within the requisite 180-day time period provided in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(e).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>See Cox v. United States Gypsum Co., </em>409 F.2d 289, 290-91 (7th Cir. 1969). Whether or not Bethel can substantiate these assertions by proof remains to be seen. On this record, however, and at this stage of the proceeding, he may not be precluded from trying.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-11\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-12\">SECTION 1983</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-13\">Section 1983 of Title 42 provides a cause of action against any party who \u201cunder color of\u201d state law, deprives another of rights or privileges secured by the Constitution or by federal statute. The crucial question here, of course, is whether the alleged discrimination of appellees \u2014 three construction companies \u2014 occurred under color of state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-14\">Bethel\u2019s allegations pertinent to his claim are limited to an assertion that the defendants received large amounts of public funds for constructing projects for the government, Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 32, 43, 44, and that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1244-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1176\">*1176</page-number>All defendants operate under color of local, state and federal laws in that a substantial portion of each defendant employer\u2019s income is derived from construction projects financed in whole or in part by local state and/or federal governmental agencies and in that the defendant labor organizations knowingly provide carpenters and other skilled craftsmen to the defendant employers and other employers located in Western Pennsylvania who engaged in such governmentally financed construction projects. In addition, said defendant labor organizations and said employer defendants exist as legal entities solely as a result of and under the protection and promotion of governmental statutes, ordinances and regulations and under the custom and usage of the local, state and federal governments within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. 1983.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1244-4\"><em>Id. </em>\u00b6 6. In effect, Bethel posits that the defendants\u2019 connection with the state is two-fold: (1) the defendant companies receive a portion of their income from projects financed in whole or in part by state governmental agencies, while the defendant labor organizations supply skilled craftsmen to those defendants and other such companies; and (2) the defendants exist and are \u201cprotect[ed] and promot[ed]\u201d as \u201clegal entities\u201d (as corporations, presumably) by virtue of government statutes and regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-5\">In determining whether the involvement of the appellee companies rises to the level of state action,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1244-6\">\u201cthe inquiry must be whether there is a sufficiently close nexus between the State and the challenged action . so that the action of the latter may be fairly treated as that of the State itself,\u201d <em>Jackson v. Metropolitan Edison Co., </em>419 U.S. 345, 351, 95 S.Ct. 449, 453, 42 L.Ed.2d 477 (1975), <em>citing Moose Lodge No. 107 v. Irvis, </em>407 U.S. 163, 176, 92 S.Ct. 1965, 32 L.Ed.2d 627 (1972), or whether the \u201cState has so far insinuated itself into a position of interdependence with [the defendants] that it must be recognized as a joint participant in the challenged activity.\u201d <em>Burton v. Wilmington Parking Authority, </em>365 U.S. 715, 725, 81 S.Ct. 856, 862, 6 L.Ed.2d 45 (1961).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1244-9\"><em>Hollenbaugh v. Carnegie Free Library, </em>545 F.2d 382, 383 (3d Cir. 1976).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In light of the allegations of plaintiff\u2019s complaint, we conclude that he has failed to state a claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 against the defendant companies involved in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-10\">First, Bethel has nowhere alleged the existence of a connection between the government\u2019s funding and regulation of defendants, on the one hand, and the defendants\u2019 discriminatory conduct on the other. <em>See Jackson v. Metropolitan Edison Co., </em>419 U.S. 345, 351, 95 S.Ct. 449, 42 L.Ed.2d 477 (1974). Second, plaintiff\u2019s allegations that the defendant companies derive a substantial portion of their income from construction projects financed in whole or in part by state governmental agencies, without more, are insufficient under <em>Burton v. Wilmington Parking Authority, </em>365 U.S. 715, 81 S.Ct. 856, 6 L.Ed.2d 45 (1961) to state a claim upon which relief can be granted against a private company under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-11\">As we have recently held, the \u201creceipt of money from the state is not, without a good deal more, enough to make the recipient an agency or instrumentality of the Government.\u201d <em>Hollenbaugh v. Carnegie Free Library, supra, </em>545 F.2d at 385, <em>quoting Grossner </em>v. <em>Trustees of Columbia University, </em>287 F.Supp. 535, 547-48 (S.D.N.Y.1968). Moreover, \u201c[t]he mere fact that a business is subject to state regulation does not by itself convert its action into that of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1177\">*1177</page-number>State for purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Metropolitan Edison Co., supra, </em>419 U.S. at 350, 95 S.Ct. at 453. \u201cNor does the fact that the regulation is extensive and detailed ... do so.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In short, even taking as true Bethel\u2019s \u201cfunding\u201d and \u201cregulation\u201d allegations, his complaint is nevertheless insufficient to bring the defendant companies\u2019 conduct within the purview of \u00a7 1983. Thus, the district court did not err in granting the defendants\u2019 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss Be-thel\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-5\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-6\">In sum, we hold only that in the procedural posture of this case, where all allegations of the complaint are to be taken as true for purposes of testing the defendants\u2019 motion made pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), we will affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Bethel\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim, and we will reverse and remand to the district court for further proceedings pertaining to those claims brought under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981, 1985(3), 1986, and 2000e <em>et seq. </em>(Title VII). We express no view as to the merits of these latter claims.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1238-11\">. Defendants <em>sub judice </em>include Jendoco Construction Corporation, Navarro Corporation, Noralco Corporation, Graziano Construction Company, Inc., Dick Corporation, Martin &amp; Nettrour Contracting Company, Carpenters\u2019 District Council of Western Pennsylvania and United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1238-12\">. Bethel also alleged violations of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1982 and Executive Order No. 11246, and asserted claims alleging common law libel and slander.

The December 22nd Order is the subject of this appeal and, by reason of the district court\u2019s 54(b) certification, is properly reviewable by us. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1238-24\">.
