Thereafter, we directed the parties to file briefs in connection with the question of mootness. The briefs have now been received and the parties, both appellants and appellee, state that the issues are not moot because the Immigration and Naturalization Service has not yet promulgated its new regulations and it will be some time before the amended regulations will be published.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">We believe, therefore, that the matter can best be dealt with in the district court where consideration of the mootness issue may be appropriately resolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is vacated and the cause is remanded for consideration in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-9\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
