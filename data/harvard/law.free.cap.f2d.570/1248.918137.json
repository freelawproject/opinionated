As part of the credit transaction Elzea assigned to the bank the homestead and exemption provided her by Georgia law so that in the event of her bankruptcy the bank could be paid from exempted property. The bank\u2019s disclosure statement said, \u201cThis note is also secured by an assignment of [Elzea\u2019s] homestead exemption.\u201d The district court concluded that the assignment was not a security interest. We hold that the assignment was a security interest that must be disclosed pursuant to Regulation Z, 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226.8(b)(5), and that the bank\u2019s disclosure was adequate. Thus the judgment of the district court is affirmed but on a different ground. We set out in the margin a Table of Cases referred to in this opinion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In text we will shorten case titles, omit repeating book and page where not necessary and eschew the ubiquitous <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1317-22\">The Truth-in-Lending Act requires a creditor to disclose a \u201cdescription of any security interest held or to be retained or acquired by the creditor in connection with the extension of credit.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1639(a)(8). Regulation Z, promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board pursuant to authority granted in the Act, defines \u201csecurity interest\u201d and \u201csecurity\u201d to \u201cmean any interest in property which secures payment or performance of an obligation.\u201d 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226.2(gg). The definition also lists some interests in property that are security interests. The assignment in this case, although not specifically listed, is a security interest because it is an interest in property which secures payment of an obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1317-23\">Although state and federal courts have characterized in many ways the waiver or assignment of Georgia\u2019s homestead and exemption,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> these characterizations are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1250\">*1250</page-number>not determinative of whether a creditor holds a security interest under Regulation Z\u2019s definition. This question should be answered by examining the rights which the creditor has. Basically, the creditor has no rights unless the debtor goes into bankruptcy and requests that his homestead and exemption be set aside. <em>Novak; see Kronstadt.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>But once the bankrupt debtor requests that the homestead and exemption be set aside, the creditor holding a waiver or assignment may have his debt paid from the exempted property.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A <em>waiver </em>of the homestead and exemption allows the creditor to be preferred over general creditors. <em>See Lockwood. See generally </em>1A Collier on Bankruptcy \u00b6 6.10[3]. An <em>assignment </em>may allow the creditor to be preferred over both creditors holding homestead waivers, e. <em>g., Strickland Hardware Co., </em>and creditors with subsequent assignments, <em>J. Saul &amp; Co. </em>Thus, the creditor has an interest in property \u2014 he has enforceable rights in the exempted property. These rights are contingent on, first, the debtor\u2019s bankruptcy with the obligation outstanding and, second, the debtor\u2019s asking that the property be set aside; but they constitute an interest in property all the same. It does not matter that the property cannot presently be identified and may not yet exist. Regulation Z specifically recognizes the possibility that property may not be identifiable.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> What is important is that the homestead and exemption privilege is valuable to the debtor and he has given up this valuable privilege to the extent of his debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b1318-11\">Further, the assignment helps to secure payment of the obligation. Ordinarily a secured debt is one that makes certain the payment of the debt,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> yet because the debt- or may fail to claim his exemption, assignment of the exemption does not make payment absolutely certain.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The debtor may frustrate the assignment, however, only by forsaking his right to the exemption. The creditor\u2019s risk is analytically no different than the risk of willful destruction that a creditor assumes whenever the debtor holds security property.</p>\n<p id=\"b1318-12\">Georgia law permits a debtor to waive his homestead and exemption \u201cexcept as to wearing apparel and $300 worth of household and kitchen furniture and provisions.\u201d Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 51-1101. Elzea <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1251\">*1251</page-number>contends that the bank should have disclosed this statutory limitation. We hold that the bank\u2019s identification of the type of security interest without mentioning the statutory limitation was adequate disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b1319-5\">Regulation Z elaborates the statutorily required \u201cdescription of any security interest,\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1639(a)(8), as \u201cdescription <em>or identification of the type </em>of any security interest.\u201d 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226.8(b)(5) (emphasis added). Decisions in this circuit generally accept that simply the identification of the type of security interest is sufficient disclosure. In <em>Pennino, </em>at 371, the court held that the description \u201cany lien on property arising by operation of laws\u201d was insufficient to disclose the vendor\u2019s lien provided by Louisiana law, but suggested simply identifying the security interest as a vendor\u2019s lien would be sufficient. In <em>Anthony, </em>at 1367, the court held sufficient the description \u201ca security interest [wherein the Secured Party] may exercise any rights and remedies granted a Secured Party by the Uniform Commercial Code.\u201d The court said, \u201cThe Code reference fully defines the legal rights of the parties.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The descriptions approved in these two cases \u2014 vendors\u2019 lien and security interest under the Uniform Commercial Code \u2014 do no more than simply identify the type of security interest. The description in this case as the assignment of the debtor\u2019s homestead and exemption similarly identified the type of security interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1319-6\">Elzea argues that the decision of this circuit in <em>Pollock </em>requires disclosure of the statutory limitation on the waiver of the homestead and exemption. <em>Pollock </em>specifically involved the disclosure of an after-acquired property clause. The court held that the creditor must disclose that the security interest would be limited to goods obtained within ten days after the creditor gave value. <em>See </em>U.C.C. \u00a7 9-204(4)(b). <em>Pollock, </em>however, dealt with a different clause in the relevant section of Regulation Z. That clause expressly concerned after-acquired property; it was not the general clause requiring a description or identification of the type of any security interest. Accordingly, the decision in <em>Pollock </em>does not require any further disclosure than the bank gave Elzea.</p>\n<p id=\"b1319-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1317-14\">.
