Jurisdiction of the district court was invoked under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331 and 1343. This court has jurisdiction on appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-4\">As originally filed, this appeal included five appellees, Sturges, Beebe, Azordegan, Sainz and O\u2019Brien. Pursuant to a stipulation between the parties, this court has dismissed the appeal with regard to Sturges and Beebe. Pursuant to a motion by appellant this court has remanded that portion of the appeal which relates to Azordegan and Sainz to the district court for further proceedings. O\u2019Brien is the only remaining appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">This civil action was commenced under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, alleging deprivation, under color of state law, of certain of appellant\u2019s rights guaranteed under the Constitution and laws of the United States. The allegations set out in the complaint against O\u2019Brien may be summarized as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-6\">On September 2, 1954 appellant was arrested in connection with the disappearance of Jimmy Bremmers. After a prior voluntary commitment, on or about October 5, 1954 appellant was involuntarily committed to Cherokee Mental Health Institute. On or about October 6, 1954 at the Cherokee Mental Health Institute appellant confessed to the murder of Jimmy Bremmers. This confession, which was tape recorded, was obtained after appellant had been given large doses of the drugs desoxyn and seconal. These drugs were administered by a staff physician at the Institute, Azizollih Azordegan, and others with the consent of Anthony Sainz, the Assistant Superintendent of the Institute. The confession was elicited through questioning by Azordegan and others.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-13\">In February, 1955, prior to the filing of formal charges against appellant, appellee O\u2019Brien learned of the existence of the taped confession. O\u2019Brien was informed by officials at the Cherokee Mental Health Institute that appellant\u2019s confession was obtained while he was under the influence of drugs. Shortly thereafter O\u2019Brien obtained the tape recorded confession from the Cherokee Mental Health Institute by means of a court order. O\u2019Brien at this time was the Woodbury County Prosecuting Attorney, having assumed that office on or about January 1, 1955. O\u2019Brien was in charge of the Jimmy Bremmers murder case from January 1, 1955 until April 1, 1955.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On or about April 1, 1955 it was determined that the murder of Jimmy Bremmers had taken place in Plymouth County rather than Woodbury County, and responsibility for the prosecution of appellant was transferred to Sturges, the County Attorney for Plymouth County, and to Beebe, a Special Prosecuting Attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-14\">In June, 1955 appellant was tried for the murder of Jimmy Bremmers in the District Court of Iowa, in and for Plymouth County. During the trial appellant\u2019s tape recorded confession was introduced into evidence and played for the jury by Sturges and Beebe, over appellant\u2019s objection that the confession had been drug induced. With the exception of the confession, appellant has consistently denied his guilt of the crime. The confession was crucial to appellant\u2019s subsequent conviction and incarceration in the Iowa State Penitentiary, where appellant remained for approximately seventeen years.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-15\">On November 3,1971 appellant brought a federal habeas corpus action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Iowa to obtain his release from the penitentiary. On July 28, 1972 the district court ruled that appellant\u2019s murder convic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>tion was obtained in violation of the due process standards set out in <em>Jackson v. Denno, </em>378 U.S. 368, 84 S.Ct. 1774, 12 L.Ed.2d 908 (1964), and ordered that a writ of habeas corpus <em>subjiciendum </em>should issue unless an evidentiary hearing was set in the Plymouth County District Court to determine the voluntariness of appellant\u2019s confession. A hearing was held in the Plymouth County Court and on October 17, 1972 that court ruled that appellant\u2019s confession was involuntarily given. On the same day the Plymouth County Attorney moved to dismiss all charges against appellant, stating that charges would not have been brought had the information concerning the confession been known. Appellant was ordered released from incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-4\">This civil suit ensued, alleging that appel-lee O\u2019Brien obtained the taped confession from the Institute and concealed his knowledge of the facts surrounding appellant\u2019s 1954 confession during appellant\u2019s trial and for seventeen years thereafter in violation of appellant\u2019s civil rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">The United States District Court dismissed the action against O\u2019Brien on the ground that <em>Imbler v. Pachtman, </em>424 U.S. 409, 96 S.Ct. 984, 47 L.Ed.2d 128 (1976), barred prosecution of the action due to prosecutorial immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-6\">Appellant asserts two grounds for reversal on appeal. First, appellant argues that O\u2019Brien\u2019s acts prior to April 1, 1955 with regard to obtaining the confession from the Institute were investigative or administrative rather than prosecutorial, and thus were not entitled to absolute immunity. Second, appellant argues that O\u2019Brien\u2019s concealment, at the time of trial and for seventeen years thereafter, of his knowledge of the facts surrounding appellant\u2019s confession constituted a continuing tort and since O\u2019Brien was not in charge of prosecuting appellant during any of that time he should not be protected by the doctrine of prosecutorial immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-7\">We find it unnecessary to address the issue of prosecutorial immunity in affirming the judgment and order of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-12\">To establish a claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 two elements must exist. First, the plaintiff must have suffered the deprivation of federally protected rights, privileges or immunities as the result of action taken. <em>Chism v. Price, </em>457 F.2d 1037, 1039 (9th Cir. 1972); <em>Orr v. Trinter, </em>444 F.2d 128, 133 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>408 U.S. 943, 92 S.Ct. 2847, 33 L.Ed.2d 767 (1972), <em>reh. denied, </em>409 U.S. 898, 93 S.Ct. 95, 34 L.Ed.2d 157 (1972); <em>Beaumont </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>427 F.2d 667, 670-71 (1st Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>400 U.S. 882, 91 S.Ct. 120, 27 L.Ed.2d 121 (1970). Second, such deprivation must have been caused by a person acting under color of state law. <em>Monroe v. Pape, </em>365 U.S. 167, 81 S.Ct. 473, 5 L.Ed.2d 492 (1961); <em>Azar v. Conley, </em>456 F.2d 1382, 1388 (6th Cir. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-13\">Viewing the allegations set out in the pleadings, as we must, in the light most favorable to appellant, we are convinced that appellant has failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted and that O\u2019Brien was entitled to dismissal of the complaint against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-14\">It is not alleged that O\u2019Brien participated in the events leading up to appellant\u2019s confession or in the trial of appellant. While it is alleged that O\u2019Brien obtained the taped confession knowing it to have been drug induced, it is clear that the mere act of procurement of the tape constituted no actionable invasion of petitioner\u2019s right.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b890-15\">Unless and until some use is made of an illegally obtained confession in such a way as to deprive a person of constitutional rights, no claim is stated under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. <em>Ransom </em>v. <em>City of Philadelphia, </em>311 F.Supp. 973 (E.D.Pa.1970). Appellee O\u2019Brien made no such use of the confession. There is no allegation that O\u2019Brien knew that the subsequent trial of appellant would be lacking in any element of due process and the court will not presume any such knowledge. <em>See Dunn v. Gazzola, </em>216 F.2d 709 (1st Cir. 1954). Neither can it be said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>that O\u2019Brien\u2019s act of obtaining the confession was the proximate cause of denial of appellant\u2019s rights at his subsequent trial. O\u2019Brien was in no way involved in that trial and had no authority over the persons in charge of the prosecution of appellant in Plymouth County. A defendant will not be held liable under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 unless he was personally involved in causing the deprivation of a constitutional right or he either has or is charged with having actual knowledge that his subordinates are causing deprivations of constitutional rights. <em>Potts v. Wright, </em>357 F.Supp. 215, 218 (E.D.Pa.1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">We note that O\u2019Brien is not charged with having concealed or withheld information from Beebe and Sturges, the prosecutors in Plymouth County. Indeed those prosecutors were charged with having intentionally and purposefully concealed the facts concerning use of drugs to induce appellant\u2019s confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">As to the alleged concealment by O\u2019Brien, during appellant\u2019s trial and subsequent incarceration, of his knowledge that the confession was drug induced, we hold that O\u2019Brien was not acting under color of state law and thus the \u00a7 1983 cause of action must fail. The record clearly reflects that at the time of the alleged concealment of facts by O\u2019Brien, O\u2019Brien was no longer acting as the prosecuting attorney in appellant\u2019s case which had been transferred to Plymouth County on or about April 1, 1955. The mere fact that O\u2019Brien was a prosecuting attorney would not support a finding that every act done by him was done under color of state law. It is the nature of the act performed by a state official, not the status of a state official as such, that is determinative of the applicability of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Warner v. <em>Croft, </em>406 F.Supp. 717, 721 (W.D.Okla.1975); <em>Edwards v. Vasel, </em>349 F.Supp. 164, 166 (E.D.Mo.), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>469 F.2d 338 (8th Cir. 1972); <em>Phillips v. Rockefeller, </em>321 F.Supp. 516, 521 (S.D.N.Y.), <em>aff\u2019d </em>435 F.2d 976 (2d Cir. 1971). To establish that an act was performed under color of state law, there must exist some authority vested by the state in the official to act in regard to the constitutional right of which appellant contends he has been denied. <em>Potts v. Wright, supra, </em>357 F.Supp. at 219. In the present case, O\u2019Brien had no authority or duty to take official action concerning appellant\u2019s trial in a county outside of his jurisdiction. The failure of O\u2019Brien to take affirmative action in a jurisdiction where he was not empowered or required by the state to take such action simply was not a violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. <em>See Ashenhurst v. Carey, </em>351 F.Supp. 708, 713 (N.D.Ill.1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b891-8\">In <em>Edwards v. Vasel, supra, </em>it was held that a police officer who testified falsely at a habeas corpus hearing concerning the vol-untariness of a confession was not acting under color of state law. Since the \u00a7 1983 claim in <em>Edwards </em>was based on perjury committed at a habeas corpus hearing, the court ruled that there had been no misuse of power possessed by the officer by virtue of state law and made possible only because the wrongdoer was clothed with authority of state law. Judge Regan<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> pointed out that a person having authority by law must use such authority to deprive another of his constitutional rights before a \u00a7 1983 claim is stated. 349 F.Supp. at 166. In testifying, the officer was not using his official authority since he was testifying as a witness, and in this respect was no different than any other witness. It would be incongruous for this court to hold that O\u2019Brien\u2019s failure to come forward with evidence constituted an act under color of state law when clearly, under <em>Edwards, </em>even if O\u2019Brien had been called as a witness and perjured himself concerning his knowledge of appellant\u2019s confession, his act of perjury would not have been performed under color of state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-9\">The record reflects that appellee O\u2019Brien was in no way responsible for the use of appellant\u2019s confession at trial in Plymouth County, and that O\u2019Brien had no authority to prevent such use of the confession by Sturges and Beebe. Any action or inaction on the part of O\u2019Brien with regard to the trial of appellant in Plymouth County was undertaken in O\u2019Brien\u2019s capacity as a pri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>vate citizen. The fact that O\u2019Brien was a prosecuting attorney for Woodbury County does not alter the private nature of his failure to come forward with exculpatory information at appellant\u2019s trial, or thereafter. <em>See Chicago\u2019s Last Dept. Store v. Indiana Alcoholic Bev. Com'n, </em>161 F.Supp. 1, 4-5 (N.D.Ind.1958).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b892-4\">In sum, we hold that O\u2019Brien\u2019s acts prior to April 1, 1955 deprived appellant of no rights secured to him by the Constitution or laws of the United States and inflicted no injury upon him. As to O\u2019Brien\u2019s failure to come forward with exculpatory information at appellant\u2019s trial and thereafter, we hold that O\u2019Brien was not acting under color of state law. Thus, no claim cognizable under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 has been stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-5\">Accordingly, the judgment and order of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b889-7\">. The Honorable Edward J. McManus, Chief Judge, United States District Court, Northern District of Iowa.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b889-10\">. According to the complaint O\u2019Brien was in charge of the case until about April 1, 1955. From other materials in the record it appears that actually charges were filed in Plymouth County on March 3, 1955. Since the difference in dates is of no real consequence here we use the date April 1, 1955 alleged in the complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b890-8\">. We note that appellant does not include O\u2019Brien\u2019s act of obtaining the tape in any of the four causes of action set out in his complaint and we note also that the tape was obtained under protection of an order of the Iowa state district court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b891-10\">. The Honorable John K. Regan, United States District Judge, Eastern District of Missouri.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b892-18\">. There is no indication in the record that appellant subpoenaed O\u2019Brien or requested that he testify at appellant\u2019s trial concerning his knowledge of the circumstances surrounding the confession. Further, had O\u2019Brien been called as a witness in this regard it is uncertain whether his second-hand information concerning the drug induced nature of the confession would have been admissible at trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
