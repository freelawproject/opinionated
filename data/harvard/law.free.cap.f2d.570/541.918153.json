Lopez as a counselor in May 1973. Plaintiffs sought declaratory, injunctive, and monetary relief to correct certain hiring policies alleged to discriminate against Mexican Americans and Blacks. The trial court dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 Title VII claims for failure to comply with the deferral provisions of 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2000e-5(e) and later dismissed with prejudice plaintiffs\u2019 remaining claims for failure to prosecute, awarding attorney\u2019s fees to defendants under 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1988. Plaintiffs appeal both dismissals and the award of attorney\u2019s fees. We affirm the trial court\u2019s ultimate dismissal for failure to prosecute and therefore do not reach plaintiffs\u2019 contentions regarding the earlier dismissal of their Title VII claims. We vacate, however, the court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees and remand that issue for reconsideration in light of the intervening Supreme Court decision in <em>Christiansburg Garment Co. v. </em>EEOC,-U.S.-, 98 S.Ct. 694, 54 L.Ed.2d 648 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-14\">Because the focal issue before us is whether the trial court abused its discretion in dismissing plaintiffs\u2019 suit for want of prosecution, we recount in detail the events leading up to the court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-15\">In December 1974 plaintiffs Jose Lopez, Tony Bonilla, and the League of United Latin American Citizens filed this employment discrimination class action against the Aransas County Independent School District, its superintendent, and six members of the Board of Trustees. Plaintiffs based their claims on the thirteenth and fourteenth amendments, Title VI and VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 2000c-8, 2000d, 2000e, <em>et seq., </em>and 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1981, 1983, 1985, 1988. On June 9, 1976, the court dismissed all claims based on 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2000e on the ground that plaintiff Lopez had failed to comply with 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2000e-5, which requires deferral for 60 days to state or local mechanisms for eliminating discrimination before filing under Title VII. The district court also dismissed all of plaintiffs\u2019 claims against the school district based upon 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1983 and 1985. Plaintiffs were permitted to proceed on all other claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-16\">On May 5, 1977, the court clerk notified all parties that the case was set for docket call on June 13 at 9:00 a. m. On June 9, 1977, plaintiffs filed their pretrial order, which did not suggest that plaintiff Lopez would not be available for trial or that there might be need for a continuance. On June 13, 1977, both plaintiffs and defendants appeared through their attorneys and indicated they were ready for trial. The trial court ordered that the docket call be continued and recalled at 9:00 a. m. on June 20, 1977. On June 17, 1977, the clerk of the trial court confirmed by telephone call to the respective attorneys that the case would be called for trial at the continuation of the docket call on Monday, June 20, 1977, and that each attorney should be available to begin trial on Tuesday, June 21, 1977. On June 20, 1977, when the trial court called this case for trial, defendants appeared through their attorney, but neither plaintiffs nor their attorney appeared at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>designated time. Noting that plaintiffs had also failed to obtain a determination that they were qualified to represent the alleged class of Mexican Americans and Blacks, the trial court dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 suit for failure to prosecute their claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">Later that same day, in a telephone conversation with the trial judge\u2019s law clerk, plaintiffs\u2019 attorney indicated for the first time that plaintiff Lopez would be unable to come to the trial and that there might be a need for a continuance of the trial setting. Plaintiffs motion to reinstate the suit, however, made no mention of Lopez\u2019 inability to attend trial or the need for a continuance. On June 21 the trial court conditionally reinstated the cause and set it for trial on June 24 at 10:00 a. m. When the trial court again called the case for trial on June 24, defendants\u2019 attorney announced ready for trial. Plaintiffs\u2019 attorney, however, announced not ready and made an oral motion for a continuance, asserting that although plaintiff Lopez had been notified that he was expected to be present for trial, he was in school in another state and would not be able to attend trial until August. The trial court denied plaintiffs\u2019 oral motion for continuance and ordered the cause to proceed to trial. Plaintiffs\u2019 attorney refused to call any witnesses, although Lopez\u2019 deposition had been filed and 10 defense witnesses, including six of the seven named defendants, were present. Admonishing plaintiffs\u2019 attorney for \u201cplaying loose and fast with the parties, with the lawyers, with the Court and the taxpayers,\u201d the trial court dismissed the suit with prejudice for failure to prosecute and awarded defendant $2500 in attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">Under Rule 41(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure a case may be dismissed with prejudice for failure to prosecute. Although the rule is phrased in terms of dismissal on the motion of the defendant, it is clear that the power is inherent in the court and may be exercised <em>sua sponte </em>whenever necessary to \u201cachieve the orderly and expeditious disposition of cases.\u201d <em>Link v. Wabash R.R., </em>370 U.S. 626, 82 S.Ct. 1386, 8 L.Ed.2d 734 (1962). The power to dismiss for want of prosecution should be used sparingly and only when less drastic alternatives have been explored. <em>Ramsay v. Bailey, </em>531 F.2d 706 (5th Cir. 1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 1107, 97 S.Ct. 1139, 51 L.Ed.2d 559 (1977). Exercise of the power is, however, committed to the sound discretion of the trial court, and appellate review is confined solely to whether the trial court has abused that discretion. <em>Id.; Marshall v. Sielaff, </em>492 F.2d 917 (3rd Cir. 1974); <em>see Provenza v. H &amp; W Wrecking Co., </em>424 F.2d 629 (5th Cir. 1970). In order to determine whether the circumstances justified a dismissal for want of prosecution, the reviewing court must examine the procedural history of the case and weigh the power of the trial court to achieve the orderly and expeditious disposition of cases against the policy of law favoring disposition of litigation on the merits. <em>Marshall v. Sielaff, </em>492 F.2d 917 (3rd Cir. 1974); <em>Dyotherm Corp. v. Turbo Machine Co., </em>392 F.2d 146 (3rd Cir. 1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">In the instant case plaintiffs knew in early May 1977 that the case would be set for trial at the docket call scheduled for June 13, 1977. They also knew that plaintiff Lopez was in school out-of-state and had no intention of returning until August. Yet plaintiffs indicated they were ready for trial at the June 13 docket call. Indeed, not until the case had actually been called for trial on June 24 did plaintiffs move for a continuance. The trial court\u2019s denial of plaintiff\u2019s eleventh-hour oral motion for a continuance was well within its discretion, particularly since plaintiff Lopez\u2019 deposition was available for use at trial. <em>See Davis v. United Fruit Co., </em>402 F.2d 328 (2d Cir. 1968), <em>cert. denied, </em>393 U.S. 1085, 89 S.Ct. 869, 21 L.Ed.2d 777 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-8\">We hold that the trial court, faced with these circumstances and with plaintiffs\u2019 refusal to proceed, did not abuse its discretion in dismissing the cause with prejudice for want of prosecution. <em>See Michelsen v. Moore-McCormack Lines, Inc., </em>429 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>F.2d 394 (2d Cir. 1970). We therefore need not decide whether the court\u2019s earlier dismissal of plaintiffs\u2019 Title VII claims was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">After dismissing plaintiffs\u2019 claims, the court awarded defendants $2500 in attorney\u2019s fees under the Civil Rights Attorney\u2019s Fees Awards Act of 1976, 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1988. In pertinent part \u00a7 1988 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-q\">In any action or proceeding to enforce a provision of sections 1981, 1982, 1983, 1985, and 1986 of this title . . . the court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party, other than the United States, a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee as part of the costs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">The trial court apparently interpreted Congress\u2019 use in \u00a7 1988 of the term \u201cprevailing party\u201d to mean that attorney\u2019s fee awards to prevailing defendants are to be made under the same standard applied to prevailing plaintiffs. In response to plaintiffs\u2019 contention that attorney\u2019s fees are to be awarded under \u00a7 1988 to prevailing defendants only when the plaintiffs\u2019 claims are frivolous or vexatious, the court replied: \u201cI think [\u00a7 1988] provides . . . that the prevailing party, the prevailing party is entitled to attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b613-9\">Although support for the trial court\u2019s position can be found in this Circuit, <em>see United States v. Allegheny-Ludlum Industries, Inc., </em>558 F.2d 742 (5th Cir. 1977), <em>rehearing granted, </em>568 F.2d 1073 (5th Cir. 1978) (portion of opinion dealing with attorney\u2019s fees withdrawn in light of <em>Christiansburg Garment Co. v. </em>EEOC, -U.S. -, 98 S.Ct. 694, 54 L.Ed.2d 648 (1978)), the Supreme Court has recently ruled that 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2000e-5(k), which in language identical to \u00a7 1988 gives the district court discretion to award attorney\u2019s fees to the \u201cprevailing party\u201d in Title VII litigation, requires the application of different standards to plaintiffs and defendants. While a prevailing plaintiff ordinarily is to be awarded attorney\u2019s fees in all but special circumstances, a prevailing defendant can recover attorney\u2019s fees only if the plaintiff\u2019s claim \u201cwas frivolous, unreasonable, or groundless, or . . the plaintiff continued to litigate after it clearly became so.\u201d <em>Christiansburg Garment Co. v. EEOC, </em>- U.S.-, -, 98 S.Ct. 694, 701, 54 L.Ed.2d 648 (1978). The Supreme Court\u2019s reasoning and decision in <em>Christiansburg </em>apply equally to the identical provisions of \u00a7 1988. The congressional intention that such a restrictive standard apply to defendants claiming attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 1988 is reflected in the amendment\u2019s legislative history. The Senate Report states that under \u00a7 1988 an unsuccessful plaintiff \u201ccould be assessed his opponent\u2019s fee only where it is shown that his suit was clearly frivolous, vexatious, or brought for harassment purposes.\u201d S.Rep. No. 94-1011, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 5, <em>reprinted in </em>[1976] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News, pp. 5908, 5912. We therefore vacate defendants\u2019 award of attorney\u2019s fees and remand to the district court for reconsideration of that issue under the standard enunciated in <em>Christiansburg.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b613-15\">After this appeal was docketed, a suggestion of the death of one of the plaintiffs, Jose L. Lopez, was filed with this Court. Because of the remand of this case on the attorney\u2019s fee issue, we take no action on that suggestion. Upon remand, the suggestion of death and motion for substitution of party plaintiff may be brought before the district court for such disposition as to it may seem proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-16\">AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
