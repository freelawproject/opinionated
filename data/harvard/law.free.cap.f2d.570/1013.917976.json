The basis of the conviction was his distribution of a \u201cServiceman\u2019s Newsletter\u201d. Without opinion the District Court granted the Secretary\u2019s motion for summary judgment. On appeal Priest contends that the conviction was obtained in violation of his First Amendment rights because (1) the court-martial was instructed improperly on the application of the First Amendment, and (2) the material he distributed was merely abstract advocacy. Priest also alleges that inconsistent decisions by the United States Court of Military Appeals denied him due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-19\">We conclude that the instructions the military judge gave to the court-martial were consistent with the requirements of the First Amendment and that the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction. We find no merit in Priest\u2019s Fifth Amendment contention; consequently, we affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-20\">THE FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-21\">In the spring of 1969 Priest was a Navy seaman apprentice stationed at the Pentagon. On his own time and with his own <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1015\">*1015</page-number>funds, he published a newsletter which he distributed to active duty military personnel in the Pentagon. Priest\u2019s conviction was based on the May and June 1969 issues of the newsletter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-5\">The May 1969 issue of the newsletter began with the following headline:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1083-6\">A CALL TO RESIST ILLEGITIMATE AUTHORITY AN INDICTMENT AGAINST THE U.S. GOVERNMENT, THE ARMED SERVICES AND ITS INDUSTRIAL ALLIES</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1083-8\">By Roger Priest, U.S. Navy</blockquote>\n<p id=\"atn-dedup-1\">[Capitals in original]</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-9\">The accompanying article closed with the warning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1083-10\">And to those who hold illegitimate power over our lives we say to you that we will not accept the continuation of this war. We will continue to resist; and encourage others to do the same. SILENCE IS COMPLICITY.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1083-11\">[Capitals in original]</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-12\">Another headline in the same issue read \u201cBE FREE GO CANADA\u201d. The newsletter then listed the addresses of groups in Canada aiding military deserters and explained that landed immigrant status was available in Canada to deserters.</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-13\">The June 1969 issue quoted Che Guevara concerning the supposed \u201cfutility of maintaining the fight for social goals within the framework of civil debate.\u201d It encouraged enlisted men to refuse promotions, \u2014 \u201cDon\u2019t Get Promoted. Fail the System.\u201d This issue also contained a crude formula for gunpowder and quoted, with obvious approval, a verse attributed to Phil Ochs:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1083-14\">Ah, but some time later</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AIc\">When I feel a little safer</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AJK\">We\u2019ll assainate [sic] the President</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AV2\">And take over, the government</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ajt-dedup-0\">And then we\u2019re going to fry them!</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A_3\">Elsewhere the June issue contained these declarations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1083-15\">THERE ARE TWO KINDS OF VIOLENCE: VIOLENCE DIRECTED AGAINST A PERSON OR GROUP TO KEEP THEM IN A PARTICULAR PLACE AND VIOLENCE USED TO DEFEND THE PEOPLE AGAINST THIS SUPPRESSION. \u2022WE WILL USE VIOLENCE TO DEFEND THE PEOPLE.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1083-16\">The U.S. military must be turned upside down and shook so loudly that our brothers throughout the world can hear we\u2019ve joined the struggle.

WE TAKE THAT \u201cNOTHING\u201d SERIOUSLY.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1083-18\">[Capitals and Emphasis in original]</p>\n<p id=\"ah1-dedup-0\">Numerous slogans were included:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1083-19\">TODAY\u2019S PIGS ARE TOMORROW\u2019S BACON.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1083-20\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1083-21\">BOMB AMERICA. MAKE COCA-COLA SOMEPLACE ELSE.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1083-22\">OUR GOAL IS LIBERATION ... BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1083-23\">SHOOT A PIG!!</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1083-24\">[Capitals in original]</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-25\">The Navy charged Priest with three offenses: (1) a violation of Article 82 of the UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 882, soliciting desertion or sedition; (2) a violation of Article 134 of the UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 934, incorporating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2387, distributing written matter which advises, counsels, or urges insubordination, disloyalty, mutiny, or refusal of duty by a member of the military forces; and (3) a violation of Article 134 of the UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 934, which prohibits \u201cdisorders and neglects to the prejudice of good order and discipline in the armed forces . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-26\">Priest was convicted on two specifications of the third charge and acquitted of all other charges. He was sentenced to receive a reduction to the lowest pay grade and a bad conduct discharge. No confinement was imposed. The Navy Court of Military Review reversed the conviction upon the ground that the military judge failed to explain to the court-martial that disloyalty to the Navy or to a superior officer was not the same as disloyalty to the United States. <em>United States v. Priest, </em>No. 70-2332 (N.C.M.R. Feb. 9, 1971). On discretionary review the Court of Military Appeals held the instruction on disloyalty sufficient and reinstated the conviction. <em>United States v. Priest, </em>21 C.M.A. 64, 44 C.M.R. 118 (1971). On remand the Navy Court of Military Review considered Priest\u2019s other allegations of error, including two that he urges here, insufficiency of the evidence to prove that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1016\">*1016</page-number>the newsletter might undermine discipline and improper instructions on the applicability of the First Amendment to the Article 134 charge. The Court of Military Review affirmed. <em>United States v. Priest, </em>46 C.M.R. 368 (N.C.M.R.1971) as did the Court of Military Appeals, <em>United States v. Priest, </em>21 C.M.A. 564, 45 C.M.R. 338 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-5\">JURISDICTION</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-6\">Collateral relief from the consequences of a court-martial judgment is barred unless it appears that the judgment is void. <em>Schlesinger v. Councilman, </em>420 U.S. 738, 748, 95 S.Ct. 1300, 43 L.Ed.2d 591 (1975). Whether a judgment may be deemed void turns upon two factors: the nature of the alleged defect in the proceedings and the gravity of the harm from which relief is sought. These in turn must be considered in light of the deference Congress expected the military justice system to receive in the federal courts. <em>Id. </em>at 753, 95 S.Ct. 1300. Priest received a bad conduct discharge that deprives him of substantially all veterans\u2019 benefits and operates as a formidable obstacle to employment. Moreover, impairment of First Amendment rights, if it occurred, would be a grave harm. We conclude that if Priest\u2019s interpretation of the First Amendment is correct, the defect in the court-martial judgment caused by improper instructions would be sufficiently fundamental to void it. We therefore have jurisdiction to review the judgment. <em>Schlesinger v. Councilman, supra </em>at 747, 753, 95 S.Ct. 1300, <em>Avrech v. Secretary of the Navy, </em>171 U.S.App.D.C. 368, 370-71 n.5, 520 F.2d 100, 102-03 n.5 (1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>425 U.S. 970, 96 S.Ct. 2165, 48 L.Ed.2d 793 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-11\">FIRST AMENDMENT CONTENTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-12\">Priest argues that his conviction must be reversed because the court-martial \u201cwas not instructed and accordingly, did not, consider appellant\u2019s First Amendment claims . . . [A]s a consequence, [the court-martial] did not strike \u2018the proper balance between legitimate military needs and individual liberties.\u2019 \u201d (Appellant\u2019s Brief at 10, <em>quoting Avrech v. Secretary of the Navy, supra, </em>at 371, 520 F.2d at 103.) Priest relies upon our statement in the <em>Avrech </em>case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ajq-dedup-0\">the act of balancing First Amendment rights against the military necessity of the moment is inextricably bound to the fact-finding process, and, on review, it is the instructions guiding the members of the court martial panel to which we must direct our attention. If the panel has been properly instructed, its findings cannot readily be set aside by an appeals court, especially in a collateral proceeding such as this.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1084-13\">171 U.S.App.D.C. at 373, 520 F.2d at 105.</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-14\">At trial Priest requested an instruction which reflected the standard announced in <em>Brandenburg </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>395 U.S. 444, 89 S.Ct. 1827, 23 L.Ed.2d 430 (1969) (Per Curiam).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The military judge refused to give this instruction, believing it inappropriate to offenses under Article 134 of the UCMJ. The Court of Military Appeals upheld that refusal and went on to hold that the proper standard for the governance of free speech in military law is not that of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1017\">*1017</page-number>the <em>Brandenburg </em>ease, but that of <em>Schenck v. United States:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1085-5\">[W]hether the words used are used in such circumstances and are of such a nature as to create a clear and present danger that they will bring about the substantive evils that Congress has a right to prevent. It is a question of proximity and degree.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1085-6\">21 C.M.A. 564, 570 <em>quoting Schenck v. United States, </em>249 U.S. 47, 52, 39 S.Ct. 247, 249, 63 L.Ed. 470 (1919). We agree with the Court of Military Appeals that this is the standard against which Priest\u2019s conduct must be measured. The Supreme Court has explained that the <em>Brandenburg </em>standard is inapposite in a military context:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1085-7\">In the armed forces some restrictions exist for reasons that have no counterpart in the civilian community. Disrespectful and contemptuous speech, even advocacy of violent change, is tolerable in the civilian community, for it does not directly affect the capacity of the Government to discharge its responsibilities unless it both is directed to inciting imminent lawless action and is likely to produce such action. <em>Brandenburg v. Ohio, </em>[395 U.S. 444, 89 S.Ct. 1827, 23 L.Ed.2d 430 (1969)]. <em>In military life, however, other considerations must be weighed. </em>The armed forces depend on a command structure that at times must commit men to combat, not only hazarding their lives but ultimately involving the security of the Nation itself. Speech that is protected in the civil population may nonetheless undermine the effectiveness of response to command. If it does, it is constitutionally unprotected.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1085-8\"><em>Parker v. Levy, </em>417 U.S. 733, 758-59, 94 S.Ct. 2547, 2563, 41 L.Ed.2d 439 (1974), <em>quoting United States v. Priest, </em>21 C.M.A. 564, 570, 45 C.M.R. 338, 344 (1972). [Emphasis supplied]</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-9\">We now consider whether the military judge\u2019s instructions properly explained the applicable standard. The instructions regarding the Article 134 offenses for which Priest was convicted are set forth in the Appendix to this opinion. Although the military judge did not refer expressly to the First Amendment, the requirements of the First Amendment are reflected in the instructions as a whole. The members of the court-martial were instructed that they must find that \u201cthe pamphlet was printed and distributed with the design to promote disloyalty and disaffection among the members of the Armed Forces . . . [t]hat under the circumstances, the conduct of the accused was to the prejudice of good order and discipline in the Armed Forces . . . \u201d The court was instructed further that \u201conly . acts directly prejudicial to good order and discipline and not . . . acts which are prejudicial only in the remote or indirect sense\u201d were to be considered. \u201cThe court is advised that statements critical of the policies of government are not in and of themselves disloyal and that robust and even harsh, impolite, or unpleasantly sharp criticism of public officials is allowable and is not in and of itself disloyal to the United States. . . . [A] design to promote disloyalty and disaffection among members of the Armed Forces of the United States is an essential element of [the charge].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-14\">We think these instructions properly explained the test of the <em>Sehenck </em>case and required the court to find that the publication, under the circumstances, tended to interfere with responsiveness to command or to present a clear danger to military loyalty, discipline, or morale. The First Amendment requires no more. The Supreme Court has held that Congress may, consistent with the First Amendment, prevent these two \u201csubstantive evils,\u201d i. e., \u201cundermining] the effectiveness of response [by military personnel] to command,\u201d <em>Parker v. Levy, supra, </em>at 759, 94 S.Ct. at 2563, <em>quoting United States v. Priest, 21 </em>C.M.A. 564, 570, 45 C.M.R. 338, 344 (1972), and diminution of military \u201cloyalty, discipline, or morale,\u201d <em>Greer v. Spock, </em>424 U.S. 828, 840, 96 S.Ct. 1211, 47 L.Ed.2d 505 (1976). Accordingly, we reject Priest\u2019s contention that the court was instructed improperly on the First Amendment issue. Having determined that the court was instructed properly, we cannot set aside its findings of fact in a collateral proceeding. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1018\">*1018</page-number><em>Avrech v. Secretary of the Navy, supra, </em>at 373, 520 F.2d at 105.</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-4\">Priest also contends that his conviction cannot stand because there is no evidence to support a finding that his newsletter either undermined or was likely to undermine the effectiveness of response to command.</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-5\">The context of a particular speech determines whether it tends clearly to harm responsiveness to command or to endanger loyalty, discipline, or morale, and thus whether it is protected by the First Amendment. A relatively mild statement of dissatisfaction with military policy made at the front line of combat might be unprotected whereas the same statement would be protected in another place. When a court-martial hears an Article 134 case in which the defense is the First Amendment, the <em>Schenck </em>case counsels that it must evaluate the potential of the words themselves to erode loyalty, discipline, and morale, in light of the context in which they are uttered, to determine the likely effect of the words on military efficiency. It is this process that is the essence of \u201cbalancing First Amendment rights against the military necessity of the moment\u201d which is \u201cinextricably bound to the fact-finding\u201d role of the court-martial. <em>Avrech v. Secretary of the Navy, supra, </em>at 373, 520 F.2d at 105.</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-6\">The government does not have the burden of showing a causal relationship between Priest\u2019s newsletter and specific examples of weakened loyalty, discipline or morale; the question for the court-martial is whether there is a clear tendency of this type of speech to diminish them. We find the rationale of the Court of Military Appeals persuasive.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1086-7\">[T]he danger resulting from an erosion of military morale and discipline is too great to require that discipline must have already been impaired before a prosecution for uttering statements can be sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"axt-dedup-0\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1086-8\">The hazardous aspect of license in this area is that the damage done may not be recognized until the battle has begun. At that point, it may be uncorrectable or irreversible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1086-10\"><em>United States v. Priest, supra, </em>21 C.M.A. at 570-71, 45 C.M.R. at 344-45.</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-11\">We agree, and find no constitutional error in the military judge\u2019s decision to exclude Priest\u2019s evidence that his newsletter had no harmful effect upon military discipline. Furthermore, because the court-martial was instructed properly on the application of the First Amendment principles to the case, the determination whether there was a clear tendency to diminish responsiveness to command was a finding of fact to be made on the basis of the members\u2019 experience in the military. The newsletters in evidence contain enough material of the sort we have quoted above to support the. conviction; reasonably construed, they were plainly calculated to subvert discipline. Therefore, we reject Priest\u2019s contention that the evidence was insufficient to support a conviction under First Amendment standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-12\">FIFTH AMENDMENT CONTENTION</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-13\">In addition to his First Amendment arguments Priest contends that the Court of Military Appeals violated his Fifth Amendment right of due process by failing to apply to his case its decision in <em>United States v. Harvey, </em>19 C.M.A. 539, 42 C.M.R. 141 (1970). The Court of Military Appeals held that Priest was not entitled to an instruction that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1086-14\">disloyalty charged here is to the United States and not disloyalty to any other person or institution such as the Secretary of Defense or the United States Navy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1086-15\">In the <em>Harvey </em>case the Court of Military Appeals held a similar instruction necessary because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1086-16\">[disavowal by the accused and his listeners of particular orders is not the equivalent of disavowal of the allegiance owed to the United States as a political entity. The risk that the court members mistakenly equated the two by reasonable con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1019\">*1019</page-number>struction of the definition of disloyalty, is too great to be disregarded</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ANf\">19 C.M.A. at 545, 42 C.M.R. at 147.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-4\">In upholding Priest\u2019s conviction upon the ground that the military judge\u2019s instructions were sufficient, the Court of Military Appeals distinguished the <em>Harvey </em>case. The court concluded that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1087-5\">[c]onsidering the totality of the instructions, we are satisfied they avoid the ambiguity of those in <em>Harvey </em>and <em>Gray </em>and present no reasonable risk that the court members predicated their finding that each Newsletter \u201cin its entirety\u201d was disloyal to the United States upon a finding that parts of the publication were disloyal to the military or a public official.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1087-6\"><em>United States v. Priest, </em>21 C.M.A. 64, 66, 44 C.M.R. 118, 120 (1971).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Court of Military Appeals is free to refine and develop its prior decisions without violating the due process rights of the litigants. On collateral review we are concerned only with fundamental constitutional errors. We find no such error here. The court-martial was instructed that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1087-7\">the term \u201cdisloyalty\u201d means not being true to or not being faithful to an authority to whom respect, obedience, or allegiance is due.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AFD\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1087-8\">The court is advised that statements critical of the policies of government are not in and of themselves disloyal and that robust and even harsh, impolite, or unpleasantly sharp criticism of public officials is allowable and is not in and of itself disloyal to the United States.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1087-9\">The First Amendment does not require the specific instruction that Priest proffered. The question whether the instruction fit the specification or met the requirements of military law, and the definition of disloyalty itself \u2014 so long as it comports with the First Amendment standards of clear danger to military loyalty, discipline, or morale or clear tendency to diminish the effectiveness of response to command \u2014 are not proper subjects for this court\u2019s review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-12\">The judgment of the District Court is</p>\n<p id=\"AZ5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-13\">APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-14\">The court is advised that to find the accused guilty of any one of Specifications 4, 5 and 6 of Charge II, it must be satisfied as to that specification by legal and competent evidence beyond a reasonable doubt of the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-15\">(1) That at the time and place alleged in the specification and in the manner alleged in the specification, the accused caused to be printed and distributed a certain pamphlet as described in the specification;</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-16\">(2) That the said pamphlet was distributed to members of the Armed Forces of the United States;</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-17\">(3) That the said pamphlet, taken in its entirety, is disloyal to the United States;</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-18\">(4) That the pamphlet was printed and distributed with the design to promote disloyalty and disaffection among the members of the Armed Forces of the United States;</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-19\">(5) That under the circumstances, the conduct of the accused was to the prejudice of good order and discipline in the Armed Forces or was of a nature to bring discredit upon the Armed Forces.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-20\">These are the elements of Specifications 4, 5 and 6 of Charge II. Each specification avers that the place of the offense was at Washington in the District of Columbia.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-21\">Specification 4 states that the time was on or about 1 April 1969 and describes the pamphlet as being entitled, quote, \u201cOM, The Serviceman\u2019s Newsletter,\u201d with the date of 1 April 1969.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-22\">Specification 5 alleges that the time was on or about 1 May 1969 and describes the pamphlet, quote, \u201cOM, The Serviceman\u2019s Newsletter,\u201d with the date of 1 May 1969.</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1020\">*1020</page-number>Specification 6 alleges that the time was on or about 1 June 1969 and describes the pamphlet as, quote, \u201cOM, The Liberation Newsletter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-5\">The term \u201cdisloyalty\u201d means not being true to or not being faithful to an authority to whom respect, obedience, or allegiance is due.</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-6\">The term \u201cdisaffection\u201d as used in these specifications means disgust or discontent with, or ill will, disloyalty, or hostility toward an authority to whom respect, obedience, or allegiance is due.</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-7\">In connection with the last element of these offenses under Charge II, you are advised that \u201cto the prejudice of good order and discipline\u201d refers only to acts directly prejudicial to good order and discipline and not to acts which are prejudicial only in the remote or indirect sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-8\">Discredit as used in Article 134 means \u201cto injure the reputation of.\u201d It refers to conduct which has a tendency to bring the service into disrepute or which tends to lower it in public esteem.</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-9\">The court is advised that the making of disloyal statements in violation of Article 134, as alleged in each of the Specifications 4, 5 and 6 of Charge II, is a lesser included offense of the offense proscribed by Section 2387 of Title 18 of the United States Code which has been here alleged as a violation of Article 134 in each of the Specifications 1, 2 and 3 of Charge II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-10\">You are advised that you may not find the accused guilty of any offense unless you are satisfied of the accused\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-11\">You are also instructed that Specifications 4, 5 and 6 of Charge II are lesser included offenses, respectively, of Specifications 1, 2 and 3 of Charge II. Therefore, you are instructed that if you return a finding of guilty to Specification 1, you may not return a finding of guilty to the lesser included offense of Specification 4. The same rule applies to Specification 2 and Specification 5 and Specification 3 and Specification 6. Specifications 4, 5 and 6 allege that the statements referred to therein are disloyal to the United States. The court is advised that statements critical of the policies of government are not in and of themselves disloyal and that robust and even harsh, impolite, or unpleasantly sharp criticism of public officials is allowable and is not in and of itself disloyal to the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-13\">You are instructed that you should not be influenced in any manner merely because the accused has made any statements with which you do not personally agree or has taken any position which is contra to your views on any particular issue. Further, you are advised that your sole function is to determine whether the accused has committed any of the offenses alleged in the charges and specifications. It is not relevant to your consideration whether or not the accused is a good sailor or whether or not he should be disciplined for any other reason other than the specifications alleged at this trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-14\">At this time I would like to remind you that you have heretofore been instructed to take judicial notice of the fact that views in opposition to the government\u2019s policy regarding Viet Nam are held by substantial numbers of people in various walks of life many of whom are prominent and respected members of professional, academic, political and government circles. This should be considered as evidence along with all the other evidence in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-15\">I have advised you that an intent to interfere with, impair, and influence the loyalty, morale, and discipline of the military and naval forces of the United States is an essential element of Specifications 1, 2 and 3 of Charge II. Further, I have advised you that a design to promote disloyalty and disaffection among members of the Armed Forces of the United States is an essential element of Specifications 4, 5 and 6 of Charge II.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1084-8\">. Defense Requested Instruction XVIII:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1084-9\">The court is further advised that the First Amendment of the Constitution does not permit punishment for statements which amount to mere advocacy of unlawful means to effect political and economic change. Therefore you are advised that even if you find that all of the elements I have set out above have been proven by legal and competent evidence beyond a reasonable doubt you must in addition find further beyond a reasonable doubt that the [statements] Pamphlets in their entirety must amount to an incitement to imminent lawless action and further that the Pamphlets in their entirety are likely under the circumstances to produce such unlawful action. Consequently, in order to convict the accused of any one of the offenses alleged in specifications 4, 5 and 6 of Charge II, you must be satisfied by legal and competent evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that the pamphlet described in a particular specification did in its entirety amount to an incitement to imminent lawless action and was under the circumstances likely to produce such action. This requirement pertains separately to each of these specifications 4, 5 and 6 of Charge II.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1084-16\">(App. 47-48)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1087-10\">. When he rejected Priest\u2019s proposed instruction on disloyalty, the military judge stated that disloyalty to the United States \u201ccertainly includes its various departments or subdivisions.\u201d (App. 49) This was a misstatement of law, but it is not grounds for reversal because the members of the court-martial did not hear it.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
