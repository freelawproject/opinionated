SKELLY WRIGHT, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"AJ8\">In this action the Council of Forest Industries of British Columbia (COFI), an organization of Western Canadian lumber shippers, petitions for review of a portion of an order of the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) issued at the conclusion of a general revenue proceeding.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The ICC\u2019s order authorized up to a seven percent general increase in railroad freight rates and charges, with exceptions covering certain territories, carriers, and commodities.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The exceptions included rates on traffic to or from points in the Western Territory in the United States.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Petitioner challenges that portion of the order that authorizes increased rates on lumber and related articles from origins in Western Canada to points in the United States without simultaneously authorizing a corresponding increase in rail rates on the same articles from origins in Washington and Idaho (the \u201cNorthwest United States\u201d). Alleging that the ICC\u2019s order constitutes a final determination that this discrimination is justified, petitioner urges this court to review the ICC\u2019s action at this time and to find that part of it lacks a rational basis and that part was done without granting petitioner the procedural opportunities required by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-16\">Respondents ICC and the United States, joined by nearly all the railroads in the United States as intervenors, deny petitioner\u2019s substantive contentions and argue further that the ICC has <em>not </em>finally determined that the rate discrimination is justified, and that judicial review is thus inappropriate at this time. They assert that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1058\">*1058</page-number>rather than challenging the general revenue order \u2014 issued after a Section 15(7) (now 15(8))<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> proceeding in which the carriers bore the burden of proof \u2014 petitioner must wait until the carriers who serve the members of COFI actually increase their rates. According to respondents and inter-venors, COFI can then challenge the increases in proceedings under Sections 13(1) and 15(1) of the Interstate Commerce Act (the Act), 49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 13(1), 15(1) (1970)\u2014 proceedings in which the shippers, rather than the carriers, bear the burden of proof \u2014 and judicial review will be available following these administrative proceedings. Although we find the procedures followed by the ICC in general revenue proceedings and the law governing judicial review of such proceedings in need of clarification, we agree with respondents that under the particular circumstances of this case review is not available to petitioner at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b1126-8\">I. THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES INVOLVED</p>\n<p id=\"AZM\">The Act allows the railroads to initiate rate increases by filing tariffs with the ICC. Once a tariff has been submitted, the ICC may investigate whether the increase is lawful and in some cases may suspend the increase for up to seven months pending the outcome of an investigation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> If the ICC <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1059\">*1059</page-number>does not suspend a rate increase, the increase becomes effective within 30 days after it is filed. 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 6(3) (1970). If the ICC does suspend the increase, it becomes effective when the suspension ends unless the rate has been found unlawful. In an investigation of a proposed rate increase conducted pursuant to Section 15(7) (now 15(8)) of the Act, the railroads have the burden of proving that an increase is just and reasonable.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> If such an investigation reveals that any portion of an increase is \u201cnot justified\u201d after the increase has been in effect, the railroads may be ordered to refund any excess amounts collected pursuant to the increase.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1127-11\">Once the ICC has approved a rate or has failed to declare it unlawful, those who wish to challenge the rate may file a complaint with the ICC under Section 13(1),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> but in any ICC investigation of such a complaint (under Section 15(1)),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the complainant bears the burden of proving that the rate is unlawful, <em>see Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe R. Co. v. Wichita Board of Trade, </em>412 U.S. 800, 812-813, 93 S.Ct. 2367, 37 L.Ed.2d 350 (1973) (plurality opinion of Marshall, J.). Furthermore, if the ICC in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1060\">*1060</page-number>Section 15(1) proceeding finds a rate discriminatory, the successful claimant is not automatically entitled to a refund of \u201cover-payments\u201d but may recover only the actual damages it has suffered in the marketplace as a result of the discriminatory rate.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1128-4\">Procedures following this general outline govern both rate filings by individual carriers and general revenue proceedings like that involved in this case.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> General revenue proceedings are initiated when all or substantially all the nation\u2019s railroads submit a tariff proposing an across-the-board increase in rates. The ICC may find such general increases just and reasonable after taking evidence relating to the general need for increased revenues, <em>see New England Divisions Case, </em>261 U.S. 184, 196-199, 201-203, 43 S.Ct. 270, 67 L.Ed. 605 (1923), or may approve the increase by declining to find it unlawful after an investigation pursuant to Section 15(7) of the Act (the procedure followed in this case). <em>See United States v. Louisiana, </em>290 U.S. 70, 73-79, 54 S.Ct. 28, 78 L.Ed. 181 (1933). <em>See generally Aberdeen &amp; Rockfish R. Co. </em>v. <em>SCRAP (SCRAP II), </em>422 U.S. 289, 311-316, 95 S.Ct. 2336, 45 L.Ed.2d 191 (1975); 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1102 (1976). In theory the ICC does not consider or determine the lawfulness of particular rates in general revenue proceedings. The crucial issue in such proceedings is the need of the carriers for increased revenues, not whether any particular application of the increase is just or reasonable. Nevertheless, the effect of ICC approval of a general increase is to shift the burden of proof from those favoring an increase to those opposing it. Once the general increase has been approved, specific increases within the approved limit are subject to attack only in proceedings under Sections 13(1) and 15(1). This burden-shifting procedure is presumably justified by the need for quick action and the assumption that once a general need has been demonstrated most individual increases will be found just and reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1128-8\">II. JUDICIAL REVIEW OF ICC ORDERS IN GENERAL REVENUE PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b1128-9\">Prior cases have considered three types of challenges to ICC actions in general revenue proceedings; (1) challenges to the general rate increase as applied to particular commodities based on the alleged unreasonable effect of the increase on the particular commodities; (2) challenges to the reasonableness of the general increase as a whole <em>{e.g., </em>a claim that the carriers do not need increased revenue); and (3) challenges to the adequacy of the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) prepared in conjunction with the general revenue proceeding. It seems settled that challenges of the first, more narrow, type must be brought under Sections 13(1) and 15(1) of the Act, rather than in suits seeking review of the ICC\u2019s determination that the general increase is just and reasonable. <em>Electronic Industries Ass\u2019n v. United States, </em>310 F.Supp. 1286 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1061\">*1061</page-number>(D.D.C. 1970) (three-judge court), <em>aff\u2019d mem., </em>401 U.S. 967, 91 S.Ct. 1188, 28 L.Ed.2d 318 (1971) (suit by a national organization of manufacturers of electronic products seeking to annul only that portion of an ICC general increase order permitting an increase in rates for transporting two electronic products); <em>Florida Citrus Comm\u2019n v. United States, </em>144 F.Supp. 517 (N.D.Fla. 1956) (three-judge court), <em>aff\u2019d mem., </em>352 U.S. 1021, 77 S.Ct. 589,1 L.Ed.2d 595 (1957). Since the ICC normally limits itself in general revenue proceedings to broader issues and expressly reserves judgment on whether any particular rate instituted under the general ceiling would be just and reasonable, the courts have concluded that the ICC\u2019s general action leaves questions about particular rates open to be determined in later proceedings focusing on individual applications of the general increase. Judicial review is held to be available only after the appropriate administrative remedies have been exhausted. <em>See Algoma Coal &amp; Coke Co. v. United States, </em>11 F.Supp. 487, 495-496 (E.D.Va. 1935) (three-judge court).</p>\n<p id=\"b1129-4\">The law with respect to judicial review in cases involving the second type of challenge \u2014 challenges to the bases for the ICC\u2019s approval of the general increase as a whole \u2014 is still uncertain. Although two courts have held that even the ICC\u2019s conclusions as to the reasonableness of a general increase are unreviewable, the Supreme Court affirmed these cases by an equally divided vote, leaving its decision without precedential effect.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>See Alabama Power Co. v. United States, </em>316 F.Supp. 337 (D.D.C. 1969) (three-judge court), and <em>Atlantic City Electric Co. v. United States, </em>306 F.Supp. 338 (S.D.N.Y. 1969) (three-judge court), both <em>aff\u2019d mem. </em>by an equally divided Court, 400 U.S. 73, 91 S.Ct. 259, 27 L.Ed.2d 212 (1970). Allowing review when petitioners raise broad challenges to the Commission\u2019s approval of a general increase is attractive because it would avoid needless relitigation, because challenging such general conclusions in individual proceedings would be difficult or impossible, and because this sort of threshold question should be determined at the outset.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Furthermore, in contrast to its avoidance of questions about particular rates, the ICC in general proceedings focuses its attention on broad issues. In apparent recognition of these policy considerations, the United States and the ICC now take the position that the ICC\u2019s conclusions on general issues such as the need of the nation\u2019s railroads for increased revenues should be immediately reviewable.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>See SCRAP II, supra, </em>422 U.S. at 317 n.18, 95 S.Ct. 2336; <em>Asphalt Roofing Manufacturers Ass\u2019n v. ICC, </em>186 U.S.App.D.C. 1, 7-8, 567 F.2d 994, 1000-1001 (1977); brief for respondents at 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b1129-7\">The Supreme Court specifically reserved the question raised in <em>Alabama Power </em>and <em>Atlantic City Electric </em>in its only decision upholding review of ICC action in a general revenue proceeding, <em>SCRAP II, supra, </em>422 U.S. at 317-318 n.18, 95 S.Ct. 2336. <em>SCRAP II </em>involved the third type of challenge to ICC general revenue orders \u2014 an attack on the adequacy of the ICC\u2019s Environmental Impact Statement issued to accompany the agency\u2019s general order. The Court held that the EIS was reviewable because the general proceeding qualified as a major federal action that required its own EIS and that the determinations in the EIS accompanying the ICC\u2019s order were therefore final. Nevertheless, emphasizing the ICC\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1062\">*1062</page-number>polver to limit the scope of its general revenue proceedings,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> the Court held that the EIS with respect to a general revenue proceeding may similarly be limited in comprehensiveness. The Court therefore refused to affirm a three-judge District Court\u2019s conclusion that the EIS under review was inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-4\">The current law may thus be summarized as follows: Review of ICC orders approving a general increase is <em>not </em>available when the petitioners are actually seeking review of the reasonableness of <em>particular rates </em>because these issues are not appropriate for consideration in general proceedings, are not addressed by the ICC, and remain open for determination in individual proceedings under Sections 13(1) and 15(1). Review of ICC orders <em>might </em>be available when petitioners challenge the bases for the ICC\u2019s general determinations (such as a finding that the carriers need an increase in revenue) because general proceedings are the appropriate forum for considering such issues, the ICC addresses them, and its conclusions are effectively final. Review of the adequacy of the ICC\u2019s EIS accompanying a general revenue order <em>is </em>available because the EIS represents a final determination of issues related to the general revenue proceeding, but the standard for review in such cases is limited by the narrow scope of issues covered in a general proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-5\">III. REVIEW IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THIS CASE</p>\n<p id=\"av1-dedup-0\">The case before us does not fit nicely into any of the categories developed in prior case law. It is not based on an EIS, and the issue it raises falls somewhere between the general issues that the ICC customarily addresses in general revenue proceedings and the particular issues that it supposedly ignores. By the terms of the ICC order one geographical area was excluded from the general increase. Petitioner claims that this exclusion caused transportation rates to be higher for its members than for their competitors in the Northwest United States,'and that the ICC\u2019s action was discriminatory and prejudicial in violation of Section 3(1) of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-9\">While accepting the position that general challenges to ICC general increase orders are immediately reviewable, the ICC and the United States claim that this petition is not reviewable at this time because it is essentially a challenge to a particular rate. Respondents thus assert that the case is controlled by <em>Electronic Industries, supra. </em>Petitioner contends that the <em>issue </em>involved is not any particular rate but the broad territorial discrimination resulting from the exclusion of shipments from a large geographical area.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> COFI also points out that the ICC \u201cconsidered\u201d the claim raised here in the proceedings below and published its \u201cconclusion\u201d that the discrimination was justified in an appendix to its order.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Petitioner argues that this finding constitutes a final determination that will control any subsequent proceedings and should therefore be reviewed now. The Government responds that in spite of the language in the appendix the ICC did not give the mat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1063\">*1063</page-number>ter \u201cfull consideration,\u201d that the ICC order specifically left the issue open,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and that a proper determination will be made after full consideration in the appropriate context \u2014 a proceeding under Sections 13(1) and 15(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1131-4\">These conflicting contentions reflect the divergence between the ICC\u2019s actual practice in general revenue proceedings and the ideal paradigm of a proceeding limited solely to a consideration of general revenue needs. In many cases, such as the one involved here, the tariff approved by the ICC not only implements a so-called general increase in maximum rates, but also exempts certain particular territories, carriers, or commodities from the increase. These exemptions \u2014 termed exceptions, flagouts, and holddowns \u2014 may be fairly narrow or, as that involved here, more general in character. The presence of such exemptions in general revenue orders weakens the policy argument against immediate judicial review of the general increase as applied to particular rates \u2014 at least those rates affected by the exemptions. The ICC apparently has taken time to consider the situations of particular commodities, territories, and carriers, and has taken action that specifically affects them.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Nevertheless, the ICC in this case resists judicial review of a complaint growing out of an exception to its general order, urging that the issue involved was ancillary to the general proceeding, was given only cursory consideration,- and has not been finally determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b1131-9\">Including certain exceptions in general increase orders may in some cases be useful,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and if such exceptions are to be included, a preliminary review by the ICC of the justification for any exception, based on some sort of <em>prima facie </em>evidence standard like that apparently employed in the proceedings below, may be a salutary procedure. Nevertheless, in light of the differences in burden of proof and nature of recovery that may result when an exception is included as part of a general order,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> we are disturbed by the ICC\u2019s failure to articulate the standards and procedures to be employed in such a preliminary inquiry or to clarify the influence of any preliminary conclusion on later proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1132-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1064\">*1064</page-number>Despite these concerns, we are not persuaded that the particular circumstances of this case warrant a result different from that in <em>Electronic Industries. </em>Unlike <em>Alabama Power, </em>this case is not a class action challenging the entire general increase order. Petitioner here, like the petitioner in <em>Electronic Industries, </em>challenges only those portions of the general increase order that may affect the rates for its particular commodities \u2014 lumber and related articles. Although petitioner claims that the <em>issue </em>it raises \u2014 broad territorial discrimination \u2014 is general in character, all its major arguments are based on data from the lumber industry alone. A general proceeding is not necessary to resolve these arguments or to grant the relief they require. More importantly, although COFI claims that the ICC considered the discrimination issue and made a final determination, the Commission did not purport to give full consideration to the discrimination issue, and its \u201cconclusions\u201d appeared only in a brief passage in an appendix to its order. We emphasize in particular that the ICC has represented in its brief and at oral argument that this \u201cconclusion\u201d is not \u201cfinal\u201d and will in no way influence the outcome of a subsequent proceeding under Sections 13(1) and 15(1).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Finally, we note that we must decide this case in the shadow of the possibility that judicial review might not be available even if COFI\u2019s challenge were clearly general and even if the issue it raises had been effectively settled in the general proceeding. If the Supreme Court were to decide that the reasoning in <em>Alabama Power </em>and <em>Atlantic City Electric </em>should be followed, then review would be unavailable <em>a fortiori </em>in cases such as this one. Although the ICC and the United States now apparently agree that these cases were wrongly decided, the Supreme Court has thus far failed to resolve this troublesome uncertainty or to provide guidelines for resolving intermediate cases like the one we decide today. Unfortunately, the circumstances of this case do not squarely present the issue raised in <em>Alabama Power </em>and <em>Atlantic City Electric, </em>and this petition is therefore an inappropriate vehicle for deciding that still unsettled question.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1132-7\">We therefore decline to review the ICC\u2019s action as it affects petitioner at this time, and we conclude that petitioner is limited to its remedies under Sections 13(1) and 15(1). COFI\u2019s petition is accordingly</p>\n<p id=\"b1132-8\">\n<em>Dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1125-9\">.

There are, of course, differences between general proceedings and individual rate filings.

The ICC\u2019s order in Ex Parte 318 indicates that the Commission gave at least some consideration to those rates affected by the exceptions that were challenged during the proceeding. <em>See, e.g., </em>Ex Parte 318, <em>supra </em>note 2, at 79-86, 121-193, JA 79-86, JA 121-193. The ICC actions in allowing an exception to remain in the tariff, requiring that an exception be removed, insisting on an additional exception, or refusing to insist on an exception affect the burden of proof in proceedings concerning the rates in question. <em>See </em>text and notes at notes 5-10 <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b1131-11\">. For example, a rate increase might be inappropriate for a particular commodity, territory, or carrier because of the economic condition of the carrier or industry involved, environmental considerations, <em>see SCRAP II, supra </em>note 15, or the existence of competition from other modes of transportation (the apparent ground for the exception involved in this case). Exempting rates from the increase where an increase would clearly be unreasonable or unjust or discriminatory avoids the necessity for additional proceedings where the end result is not in doubt. We note in passing, however, that it is not completely clear to this court why exceptions are necessary when competition from other carriers is the problem and an order that only authorizes <em>maximum </em>rates is involved. In such circumstances carriers presumably can and will set their actual rates below the maximum.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b1131-12\">. <em>See </em>text and notes at notes 5-10 <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b1132-4\">. <em>See </em>brief for respondents at 17-19.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b1132-5\">.
