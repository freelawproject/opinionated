The Board found in an unfair labor practice proceeding that the union <em>qua </em>employer had violated \u00a7 8(a)(4) of the National Labor Relations Act (\u201cthe Act\u201d) by firing Pennacchini in retaliation for her refusal to testify voluntarily for the union in an earlier unfair labor practice proceeding.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 219 NLRB 1188 (1975). Section 8(a)(4) states that it shall be an unfair labor practice for an employer \u201cto discharge or otherwise discriminate against an employee because he has filed charges or given testimony\u201d in an NLRB proceeding. The union petitions for reversal of the Board order on the grounds, <em>inter alia, </em>that the Board\u2019s findings are not supported by substantial evidence, that \u00a7 8(a)(4) does not protect employees who have refused to offer testimony, that Pennacchini was a \u201cmanagerial\u201d employee not protected by the Act, and that the reinstatement order constituted an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-18\">The principal factual dispute before the Board was whether Anna Pennacehini\u2019s discharge had been motivated, at least in part, by her refusal to testify for her employer in an unfair labor practice proceeding involving a former fellow employee, Barbara Frazier. Frazier was discharged by the union in October 1972, and immediately initiated proceedings against the union, alleging that her discharge was violative of the Act. According to Pennacchini,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> union president Horace Brown told her on several occasions in early 1973 that she was expected to testify at Frazier\u2019s hearing, and he also directed Pennacchini to prepare a list of alleged improprieties committed by Frazier, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>based on rumors that he (Brown) had heard. Pennacchini further maintains that on the day before the Frazier hearing, she was asked by the union\u2019s attorney if she was prepared to testify at the hearing to substantiate the allegations in the list she had prepared for Brown. Her response was that she had \u201cnever personally observed any\u201d of the misconduct alleged in the list, and that she knew that the attorney \u201cwould not want [her] to testify to something [she] did not personally observe.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">Pennacchini was not called as a witness by either side at the Frazier hearing, although the union could have subpoenaed her testimony under \u00a7 11(1) of the Act. Approximately one month later, Brown fired Pennacchini in a termination letter that accused her of \u201cextraordinary disloyalty\u201d and of \u201cconveniently\u201d forgetting certain facts that tended to incriminate Frazier.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">Shortly after receiving the termination letter, Pennacchini filed an unfair labor practice charge against the union. The Administrative Law Judge concluded that Pennacchini \u201cwas an essentially truthful witness.\u201d 219 NLRB at 1194. He also concluded that the union had terminated Pen-nacchini \u201cbecause she refused to appear voluntarily as a witness in the unfair labor practice proceeding involving a former fellow employee, on the ground that she had no direct knowledge of the matters about which she was to be questioned.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Board adopted the findings and conclusions of the Administrative Law Judge, noting that it was \u201cabundantly clear that Pennac-chini\u2019s discharge was motivated, at least in part, by her refusal to cooperate with the Respondent, . . . when, in the presence of Brown and the Respondent\u2019s counsel, she disclaimed firsthand knowledge of Frazier\u2019s shortcomings.\u201d 219 NLRB at 1188.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-14\">We have carefully reviewed the record, and conclude that the Board\u2019s findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole. <em>Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, </em>340 U.S. 474, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951). According to Pennacchini\u2019s credited testimony, she was asked by the union if she would testify in support of certain allegations against Frazi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>er and she refused. The termination letter demonstrates that Pennacchini\u2019s conduct with regard to the Frazier hearing was clearly on Brown\u2019s mind when he fired her. Based on this evidence, the Board could reasonably conclude that the firing was at least partially motivated by Pennacchini\u2019s refusal to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">We recognize that Pennacchini\u2019s discharge may have been motivated by factors other than her refusal to testify: indeed, the termination letter suggests several possible explanations.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> But it is not the job of this Court to conduct a de novo consideration of the evidence: we need only find that there was substantial evidence to support the Board\u2019s conclusion. Moreover, the Board was not obligated to find that Pennacchini\u2019s refusal to testify was the sole motivating factor in her discharge. <em>See NLRB v. </em>West <em>Side Carpet Cleaning Co., </em>329 F.2d 758, 761 (6th Cir. 1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">As we read the Board\u2019s findings, Pennacchini was fired because she would not testify in support of the union\u2019s position at the Frazier unfair labor practice proceeding. The principal legal issue in this case is whether such a discharge constitutes a violation of \u00a7 8(a)(4) of the Act. We believe that it does.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">Although the specific language of \u00a7 8(a)(4) refers only to an employee who \u201chas filed charges or given testimony,\u201d the Supreme Court has read the statute to protect other employees as well. In <em>NLRB </em>v. <em>Scrivener, </em>405 U.S. 117, 92 S.Ct. 798, 31 L.Ed.2d 79 (1972), the Court held that \u00a7 8(a)(4) precludes the discharge of an employee for giving written sworn statements to a Board field examiner. The employee had not \u201cfiled charges or given testimony,\u201d but the Court felt that Congress had intended to protect employee participation in the investigatory, as well as the hearing stages of Board proceedings.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-7\">The Act\u2019s reference in \u00a7 8(a)(4) to an employee who \u201chas filed charges or given testimony,\u201d could be read strictly and confined in its reach to formal charges and formal testimony. It can also be read more broadly. On textual analysis alone, the presence of the preceding words \u201cto discharge or otherwise discriminate\u201d reveals, we think, particularly by the word \u201cotherwise,\u201d an intent on the part of Congress <em>to afford broad rather than narrow protection to the employee. Id. </em>at 122, 92 S.Ct. at 801 (emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b658-10\">This interpretation was consistent with the purpose of the section, which was to ensure that all persons with information about unfair labor practices \u201c \u2018be completely free from coercion against reporting them to the Board.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 121, 92 S.Ct. at 801, quoting <em>Nash v. Florida Industrial Comm\u2019n, </em>389 U.S. 235, 238, 88 S.Ct. 362, 19 L.Ed.2d 438 (1967). Such \u201ccomplete freedom\u201d is necessary, said the Court, \u201c \u2018to prevent the Board\u2019s channels of information from being dried up by employer intimidation of prospective complainants and witnesses.\u2019 \u201d 405 U.S. at 122, 92 S.Ct. at 801, quoting <em>John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. NLRB, </em>89 U.S.App.D.C. 261, 263, 191 F.2d 483, 485 (1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-11\">Similar considerations militate in favor of extending statutory protection to the activity involved in this case. Although Pennac-chini was not prevented from reporting information to the Board, the coercion applied against her had a direct bearing on a pending Board proceeding. Had she acquiesced in her employer\u2019s request that she testify against Frazier, she could very well have perjured herself before the Board. The result would have been more serious than a closing of \u201cchannels of information\u201d to the Board. It would have been the outright misleading of the Board. Coercing employees to give untrue testimony just as surely undermines the integrity of Board proceedings as does coercing employees to give no testimony at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>The fact that Pennacchini never actually gave testimony or spoke with a Board agent is irrelevant. As the Court pointed out in <em>Scrivener, </em>the practicalities of administrative action require that \u00a7 8(a)(4) protection not be limited to particular, discrete stages of Board proceedings.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aqc-dedup-0\">An employee who participates in a Board investigation may not be called formally to testify or may be discharged before any hearing at which he could testify. His contribution might be merely cumulative or the case may be settled or dismissed before hearing. <em>Which employees receive statutory protection should not turn on the vagaries of the selection process or on other events that have no relation to the need for protection. </em>It would make less than complete sense to protect the employee because he participates in the formal inception of the process (by filing a charge) or in the final, formal presentation, but not to protect his participation in the important developmental stages that fall between these two points in time. This would be unequal and inconsistent protection <em>and is not the protection needed to preserve the integrity of the Board process in its entirety.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ae_\">405 U.S. at 123-24, 92 S.Ct. at 802 (emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">We think that the \u201cintegrity of the Board process in its entirety\u201d would be seriously undercut if employers were allowed to freely discharge employees who because of lack of knowledge refuse to testify in support of the employer position at an unfair labor practice hearing.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Employees might well feel compelled to offer misleading statements to the Board if they knew they could be fired for showing reticence in coming forward with testimony favorable to the management side. Fair adjudication of disputes requires that witnesses be free from excessive external pressures to manufacture or withhold particular evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-8\">The legislative history of \u00a7 8(a)(4) supports application of the statute in this case. In the Senate debates on the Wagner Act, of which \u00a7 8(a)(4) was a part, Senator Wagner gave the following example of the kind of coercion that \u00a7 8(a)(4) was designed to alleviate:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-9\">In certain plants which now have company-dominated unions, the employees were asked to sign petitions, to be sent to their representatives, opposing this bill. I received personal letters from workers in which they said they had signed these petitions because they knew if they did not do so their jobs would be lost, and that they needed their jobs in order that their families might eat. <em>It is that sort of discrimination which we wish to prevent.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-10\">79 Cong.Rec. 7676 (1935) (emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b659-11\">Coercing employees to sign petitions with which they do not agree is closely analogous to coercing employees to give testimony they believe to be false. The intent of the Act\u2019s authors was that workers should not feel compelled by the threat of employer retaliation to misrepresent their own knowledge or beliefs on matters relevant to the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-12\">Respondent argues that protecting a refusal to testify will actually dry up channels of information to the Board by encouraging the withholding of evidence. What we are protecting here, however, is not simply a refusal to testify: if that were the only issue, then the union would have subpoenaed Pennacchini, as the Act clearly permits it to do. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 161(1). Rather, we are protecting employees from pressure to deliver false or misleading information to the Board. Section 8(a)(4) by itself neither encourages nor discourages testimony: it simply leaves employees free to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>choose their actions before the Board without fear of employer reprisals.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">Respondent has maintained throughout the proceedings that Pennacchini was a \u201cmanagerial\u201d employee, not subject to the protections of the Act. <em>NLRB </em>v. <em>Bell Aerospace Co., </em>416 U.S. 267, 289, 94 S.Ct. 1757, 40 L.Ed.2d 134 (1974). Pennacchini\u2019s job involved preparation of the union newspaper. The union contends that, in that capacity, she exercised such independence of judgment as to identify her with management. The Board expressly adopted the finding of the Administrative Law Judge that Pennacchini was not a managerial employee. 219 NLRB at 1188 n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">Our standard of review on this issue is whether the Board\u2019s decision has \u201cwarrant in the record\u201d and a \u201creasonable basis in law.\u201d <em>NLRB v. Hearst Publications, </em>322 U.S. 111, 131, 64 S.Ct. 851, 88 L.Ed. 1170 (1944). <em>See also </em>K. C. Davis, Administrative Law of the Seventies \u00a7 30.-00 at 691 (1976). We find that standard to be fully met in this case. \u201cManagerial\u201d employees are those \u201cwho formulate, determine, and effectuate an employer\u2019s policies.\u201d <em>Eastern Camera &amp; Photo Corp., </em>140 NLRB 569, 571 (1963), <em>cited with approval </em>in <em>NLRB v. Bell Aerospace Co., </em>416 U.S. 267, 290 n. 19, 94 S.Ct. 1757, 40 L.Ed.2d 134 (1974). The determination of an employee\u2019s managerial status \u201cdepends upon the extent of his discretion, although even the authority to exercise considerable discretion does not render an employee managerial where his decision must conform to the employer\u2019s established policy.\u201d 140 NLRB at 571. According to Pennacchini\u2019s credited testimony, she had nothing to do with the policies concerning what should be printed in the union newspaper and never decided what should be included in an article. She would always submit items suggested for publication to the union\u2019s chief executive officer for approval, and rarely (if ever) expressed an opinion to him on the substance of the articles she was directed to publish. Her other duties were to proofread collective bargaining agreements, prepare flyers and handbills, construct photographic layouts, and occasionally run the duplicating machine. She did not attend any strategy meetings of union officials.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-10\">This evidence provided a sufficient basis upon which the Board could reasonably conclude that Pennacchini did not \u201cformulate, determine, and effectuate\u201d her employer\u2019s policies. There is \u201cwarrant in the record\u201d to support the premise that her job-related decisions had to \u201cconform to the employer\u2019s established policy,\u201d and were not the result of her independent judgment. In this regard, this case is distinguishable from <em>Wichita Eagle &amp; Publishing Co., Inc. v. NLRB, </em>480 F.2d 52 (10th Cir. 1973), <em>cert. den. </em>416 U.S. 982, 94 S.Ct. 2383, 40 L.Ed.2d 758 (1974) where the Court found an editorial writer of a daily newspaper to be a \u201cmanagerial\u201d employee. The writer in <em>Wichita Eagle </em>\u201ccould, and did, propose topics for editorials, [and] propound her own viewpoint in an effort to influence editorial policy on various subjects.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 55. Here, there was ample testimony \u2014 which the Board found credible<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u2014 that Pennacchi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>ni neither contributed her own views or proposed editorial topics. Rather, she simply did what she was told.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">Respondent also argues that reinstatement is an inappropriate remedy because \u201cthere is no position to which Pennacchini can be reinstated.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This claim is without merit. Neither the Board nor the Administrative Law Judge made a specific finding that Pennacchini\u2019s position had been eliminated. Even if there were such a finding, this Court cannot disturb the reinstatement order \u201cunless it can be shown that the order is a patent attempt to achieve ends other than those which can fairly be said to effectuate the policies of the Act.\u201d <em>Virginia Electric and Power Co. v. NLRB, </em>319 U.S. 533, 540, 63 S.Ct. 1214, 1218, 87 L.Ed. 1568 (1943). We see no attempt to evade the purposes of the Act here. Indeed, reinstatement of Pennacchini will effectuate the Act\u2019s goal of protecting employees from unfair labor practices by making them whole after wrongful discharge, and by deterring future violations of the Act. <em>See Golden State Bottling Co. v. NLRB, </em>414 U.S. 168, 181-82, 94 S.Ct. 414, 38 L.Ed.2d 388 (1973). To allow an employer to evade a reinstatement order by styling the wrongful discharge of an employee as an \u201celimination\u201d of her position would deny that employee a meaningful remedy and actually thwart the goals of national labor policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">The situation here is distinguishable from that in <em>NLRB v. Schnell Tool &amp; Die Corp., </em>359 F.2d 39 (6th Cir. 1966), where this Court refused to enforce a Board reinstatement order against employers who had sold their businesses subsequent to violating the Act. Issuance of an enforcement decree there would have been a \u201cvain act\u201d because any reinstatement order would have been ineffective against the successor employers, whose liability under the Act had not yet been determined by the Board. Here, the employer against whom enforcement is sought is the same employer found in violation of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-11\">Likewise distinguishable is <em>Trico Products Corp. v. NLRB, </em>489 F.2d 347 (2d Cir. 1974), where the Second Circuit refused to order reinstatement of employees who would have been laid off in any event for economic reasons. Respondent here admits that the Union still publishes a newspaper, albeit through an independent contractor. The fact that an employer may have hired an independent contractor to do the work of a wrongfully discharged employee does not preclude the reinstatement remedy. <em>Fibreboard Corp. v. NLRB, </em>379 U.S. 203, 85 S.Ct. 398, 13 L.Ed.2d 233 (1964). <em>See also NLRB v. Jackson Farmers, Inc., </em>457 F.2d 516, 518 (10th Cir. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-12\">Respondent further urges that reinstatement would be improper because of a \u201cbasic antagonism\u201d between Pennacchini and the union president (Brown).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In an election shortly before Pennacchini\u2019s discharge, she openly and vigorously supported Brown\u2019s opponent for the union presidency. The union seems to feel that this conduct precludes the possibility of future harmonious relations between Pennacchini and Brown, and that requiring them to work together on production of the union newspaper would create an intolerable situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>Circuit Courts have on occasion refused to enforce reinstatement orders where the employee involved had shown extreme disloyalty or antagonism toward the employer. In <em>NLRB v. Bin-Dicator Co., </em>356 F.2d 210 (6th Cir. 1966), this Court denied reinstatement where the employee had threatened to cause the plant manager to \u201cspend some time in a wheel chair,\u201d made threatening gestures at supervisors, and threatened to strike a foreman with a heavy metal casing.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Likewise, in <em>NLRB v. National Furniture Mfg. Co., </em>315 F.2d 280, 286-87 n. 7 (7th Cir. 1963), the Court refused to order reinstatement where the employee had shown a \u201cdisrespectful attitude\u201d toward the employer\u2019s general manager, had made damaging statements to at least one customer, and had made derogatory remarks about the personnel manager. And in <em>NLRB </em>v. <em>Valley Die Cast Corp., </em>303 F.2d 64, 66 (6th Cir. 1962), we denied reinstatement to an employee who with threats prevented maintenance men from entering a company building.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">These cases involved acts of employee antagonism far more flagrant than that alleged here. Pennacchini did not threaten union officials and in no way disrupted her employer\u2019s work. Of course, Pennacchini\u2019s prior opposition to Brown\u2019s re-election is likely to cause some friction if she resumes her former position. We are, however, bound to give \u201cspecial respect\u201d to the Board\u2019s choice of remedy, based on its judgment as to how effectively to promote the goals of the Act. <em>NLRB v. Gissel Packing Co., </em>395 U.S. 575, 612 n. 32, 89 S.Ct. 1918, 23 L.Ed.2d 547 (1969). As noted by the First Circuit in a similar case, the Board \u201cmay have believed that a less complete remedy would leave doubt as to whether the Act fully protected the rights of employees.\u201d <em>Trustees of Boston Univ. </em>v. <em>NLRB, </em>548 F.2d 391, 393-94 (1st Cir. 1977). Under these facts, we cannot say that the reinstatement order constituted an abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">We have considered all of Respondent\u2019s other arguments and find them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-8\">We find that there is substantial evidence to support the Board\u2019s findings, accordingly enforcement is GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b656-14\">. The Board also found that Pennacchini\u2019s discharge violated \u00a7 8(a)(1) of the Act, which makes it an unfair labor practice \u201cto interfere with, restrain, or coerce employees in the exercise of rights guaranteed in Section 7 of this Act.\u201d Because of our disposition of the \u00a7 8(a)(4) charge, we need not review the Board\u2019s finding with respect to \u00a7 8(a)(1). <em>See NLRB v. Scrivener, </em>405 U.S. 117, 125, 92 S.Ct. 798, 31 L.Ed.2d 79 (1972).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b656-20\">.

Not only did you conveniently \u201cforget\u201d those facts which you had previously told me about Mrs. Frazier, which had in part influenced my decision to terminate her, but by communicating to a person suing the Union the confidences of your employer and its attorney in connection with the defense of that matter, you violated every obligation of trust due to your employer. Secondly, you were plainly responsible for the unauthorized and surreptitious release of the Union\u2019s mailing list in connection with a campaign mailing by Ray Soncrant. Quite apart from the malicious content of that document, you violated your obligation to maintain the confidence of that list, which was entrusted to you only for authorized purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"AQ7\">As the chief executive officer of this Union, I would find intolerable disloyalty to the Union and breaches of its confidences by any employee. But for such misconduct to occur by an employee in your sensitive and confidential relationship is inexcusable. The Union obviously cannot be in the position of having its policies and confidences violated by someone whose very job responsibility it is faithfully to execute and protect them.</p>\n<p id=\"AhlT\">Although, as chief executive officer, I am constitutionally empowered to discharge you without cause, I point out all of these matters so there will be no false accusations as to the reason for your discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"A8o\">Sincerely,</p>\n<p id=\"A-c\">/s/ Horace Brown</p>\n<p id=\"AzH\">Horace Brown</p>\n<p id=\"AHE\">President</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b658-8\">.

In <em>Hoover Design Corp. v. NLRB, </em>402 F.2d 987 (6th Cir. 1968), this Court ruled that the discharge of an employee for threatening to go to the Board or threatening to file charges with the Board did not constitute a violation of \u00a7 8(a)(4). Although we are not presented with a case involving \u201cthreats\u201d to file charges, we note that <em>Hoover Design </em>was decided prior to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Scrivener. </em>To the extent that <em>Hoover Design </em>is inconsistent with <em>Scrivener, </em>it is obviously no longer binding authority.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b660-6\">. This is not to suggest that \u00a7 8(a)(4) protects improper employee conduct, such as perjury, before the Board. Since there are no allegations of misconduct by Pennacchini in Board proceedings, we are not presented with that question in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b660-7\">. The Board adopted the following conclusion of the Administrative Law Judge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-8\">Although [Pennacchini] performed duties that placed her somewhat above the level of other clerical and office employees, the evidence, on balance, convinces me that she was not in the managerial category. As we have seen, she frequently consulted with the executive head of the Union and, while she exercised considerable independence of judgment respecting the specific content of the editorials she wrote on behalf of the head of the Union, they were subject to discussion with her superiors before being composed and published. 219 NLRB at 1193-94.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A_m\">Respondent suggests that a finding that Pen-nacchini exercised \u201cconsiderable independence of judgment respecting the specific content of the editorials she wrote\u201d compels a finding that she was managerial employee. As we interpret the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s decision, and the testimony he credited, Pennacchini\u2019s independence of judgment went only to the form, and not the substance of the editorials.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b661-7\">. In endorsing the findings of the Administrative Law Judge with regard to Pennacchini\u2019s non-managerial status, <em>see </em>note 7, supra, the Board also noted that \u201cPennacchini\u2019s alleged \u2018managerial\u2019 status had drastically changed in the months preceding her discharge.\u201d 219 NLRB at 1188 n. 3. This \u201cfurther weaken[ed] the argument that she enjoyed such special status.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b661-8\">. The actual order was that Pennacchini be offered \u201cimmediate reinstatement to her former job, or if that job no longer exists, to a substantially equivalent position, without prejudice to her seniority and other rights and privileges.\u201d 219 NLRB at 1194. Determination of whether \u201ca substantially equivalent\u201d position is available is ordinarily left to the compliance stage of Board proceedings. <em>See North Valley Lumber Sales, Inc., and Ralph Allen, </em>229 NLRB No. 178 (1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b661-14\">. Respondent attempted to show before the Administrative Law Judge that Pennacchini was guilty of misconduct that might preclude a reinstatement order. The judge considered the chief claim of misconduct and found the evidence to be \u201cinconclusive.\u201d 210 NLRB at 1193 n. 8.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"Aa7\">. In <em>Bin-Dicator, </em>the Court gave \u201cspecial examination\u201d to the reinstatement order because the Board order conflicted with that of its trial examiner. 356 F.2d at 215. Here, the Board and its Administrative Law Judge are in complete agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b662-5\">. See <em>also NLRB v.
