Muller, an employee of a commodity option firm, with misappropriating customers\u2019 funds, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, a federal regulatory agency, sought and obtained a federal court preliminary injunction against Muller\u2019s concealing or disposing of his assets. Muller appeals from the injunction on two grounds: <em>first, </em>the regulatory agency has no jurisdiction over the London commodity options he sells because they are not specifically enumerated in the statute and are in foreign, not interstate, commerce and, <em>second, </em>the agency failed to present a <em>prima facie </em>case of illegal conduct or the reasonable likelihood of future violations. Holding that the Commission has jurisdiction not only over options in specifically enumerated commodities, but over <em>all </em>other commodity option transactions, including Muller\u2019s \u201cLondon commodity options,\u201d and that the evidence was sufficient to support the injunction, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1366-5\">Muller, vice president and director of Economic Research Analysts Commodities, Inc., sold \u201cLondon commodity options\u201d to the public. A \u201cLondon commodity option\u201d is a contractual right to buy or sell a specified futures contract for a particular commodity traded on the London markets, at a specified price within a specified period of time. There are two London commodity markets on which options are traded: \u201chard\u201d commodities, like gold, silver and other metals, traded on the London Metal Exchange; and \u201csoft\u201d commodities, like cocoa, grain, coffee, rubber and sugar, traded through the International Commodities Clearing House.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1366-12\">The Commission charged Muller with fraudulently converting and misappropriating for his own use funds entrusted to his care by customers of the commodity option firm by which he was employed, in violation of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission Act of 1974, 7 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 6c(b), and antifraud Regulation 32.9, 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 32.9 (1977). Muller makes essentially two arguments that these London commodity options, in which his customers were dealing, are not within the regulatory power of the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b1366-13\">First, Muller argues such options are not subject to the regulatory authority conferred by 7 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 6c(b), which he contends authorizes the Commission to regulate only option transactions involving those agricultural commodities that are explicitly enumerated in \u00a7 2 of the Act.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The enumeration does not include the commodities sold through the London markets.</p>\n<p id=\"b1366-14\">The restrictive interpretation urged by Muller is foreclosed by the wording of the Act and its legislative history. Prior to the passage of this Act, the Commodity Exchange Act did apply only to certain agricultural commodities that were specifically enumerated in \u00a7 2. It totally banned option transactions in these commodities. The 1974 Act was passed to fill the regulatory gaps in commodities trading.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It expanded the definition of \u201ccommodity\u201d to include, in addition to those commodities expressly enumerated, \u201call other goods and articles . . . and all services, rights <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1299\">*1299</page-number>and interests in which contracts for future delivery are presently or in the future dealt in . . . 7 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2. The Act continues the Commodity Exchange Act\u2019s ban on all option transactions involving the specifically enumerated agricultural commodities. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 6c(a).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In addition, however, \u00a7' 6c(b) subjects option transactions in non-enumerated commodities to regulations promulgated by the Commission.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Act clearly applies to option transactions in non-enumerated commodities.</p>\n<p id=\"b1367-6\">Muller next argues that these London options involve <em>foreign </em>commerce and are outside of the statute and regulations, which only apply to transactions involving <em>interstate </em>commerce. The Act\u2019s definition of \u201cinterstate commerce\u201d is sufficiently expansive to include the London options. The Act broadly defines \u201cinterstate commerce\u201d as commerce between any state, territory, possession, the District of Columbia, <em>\u201cand any piace outside thereof.\u201d </em>7 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2. Section 3, which elaborates on when a transaction shall be considered to be in interstate commerce, defines state as including territory, the District of Columbia, possession of the United States, and foreign nation. 7 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3. Thus, when these sections are read together, it is apparent that the jurisdiction of the Commission is sufficiently broad to encompass transactions involving foreign commerce, such as the London options. <em>Cf. British American Commodity Options Corp. v. Bagley, </em>552 F.2d 482 (2d Cir.) (London options impliedly found by the Second Circuit to be within the jurisdiction of the Commission), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 98 S.Ct. 427, 54 L.Ed.2d 297 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1367-16\">The Commission has exercised this broad authority through the regulations it has promulgated under its delegated rulemak-ing authority. Antifraud Regulation 32.9, 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 32.9 (1977), applies to \u201cany commodity option transaction.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This would include the full scope of the Act, including transactions involving foreign commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b1367-17\">Muller challenges the jurisdiction of the district court to enjoin him from using any funds in his personal or business accounts before the civil action at hand has been decided or. terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1367-18\">The Commodity Futures Trading Commission is authorized by 7 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 13a-1 to institute an action in federal district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1300\">*1300</page-number>court whenever it appears that violations of any provision of the Act have occurred.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> That section provides that upon a proper showing, the district court may issue a permanent or temporary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-4\">It has long been recognized that in an action brought to enforce the requirements of remedial statutes such as this Act, a district court has broad discretion to fashion appropriate relief. In actions for a statutory injunction, the agency need not prove irreparable injury or the inadequacy of other remedies as required in private injunctive suits. A <em>prima facie </em>case of illegality is sufficient. <em>Commodity Futures Trading Commission v. British American Commodity Options Corp., </em>560 F.2d 135, 141-142 (2d Cir. 1977), <em>petition for cert. pending, </em>46 U.S.L.W. 3438 (Jan. 10, 1978); <em>Commodity Futures Trading Commission v. J. S. Love &amp; Assoc. Options, Ltd., </em>422 F.Supp. 652, 661 (S.D.N.Y.1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-5\">Muller contends the Commission must show that he has engaged in illegal conduct and that there is a \u201creasonable likelihood\u201d of future violations. For the issuance of the present injunction, however, it is not necessary for the Commission to show that new funds might be misappropriated. If the Commission had been seeking an injunction against \u201cfuture violations\u201d of the Act by Muller, it might be necessary to show this. The injunction here, however, does not enjoin defendant from continuing violations by misappropriating customer funds, but rather prevents defendant from further dissipating the funds he allegedly has already misappropriated. The district court has inherent power as a court of equity to order such temporary, ancillary relief in order to preserve the status quo so that an ultimate decision for the Commission could be effective. <em>SEC v. Manor Nursing Centers, Inc., </em>458 F.2d 1082, 1105\u20141106 (2d Cir. 1972); <em>SEC v. R. J. Allen &amp; Assoc., Inc., </em>386 F.Supp. 866, 881 (S.D.Fla.1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-10\">In this case, Muller advised his employer, Economic Research, that he had made arrangements with Commodity Analysis, Inc. for the purchase of London options for Economic\u2019s customers, and that Commodity Analysis had opened a bank account in Southeast First National Bank of Miami, Florida. In fact, Muller had not entered into any agreement with Commodity Analysis on Economic\u2019s behalf, nor did Commodi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1301\">*1301</page-number>ty Analysis have an account in the Miami bank. Rather, Muller himself had opened that account in the name of Commodity Analysis. Checks in excess of $263,000 were issued by Economics to this Commodity Analysis \u2014 Muller bank account. Muller supplied Economic with fictitious confirmation purchase statements from Commodity Analysis to conceal his fraud. Muller used the money from the account to purchase commodity future contracts, in his wife\u2019s maiden name, from two brokerage firms. By the time the case came to court, the Commission reported that less than $20,000 remained in this account.</p>\n<p id=\"b1369-5\">Having concluded that the option transactions were covered by the Act and that the Commission had presented a strong <em>prima facie </em>showing that defendant had violated 7 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 6c(b) and Regulation 32.9, the district court enjoined defendant, or anyone connected with him, from concealing or disposing of his assets in any manner, except that defendant could withdraw not more than $1,000 during any 30 day period for his necessary living expenses. This temporary freeze of defendant\u2019s assets was reasonably necessary to assure that the court\u2019s jurisdiction would not be defeated by the defendant\u2019s disposition of assets in the event the court should ultimately order disgorgement of the allegedly misappropriated funds. Defendant had already lost a large amount of the funds through his unsuccessful personal trading in commodity futures. He refused to assist the court in locating the remaining funds. Under these circumstances, the district court did not abuse its discretion in preventing defendant from dissipating his assets pending resolution of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1369-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1366-6\">.
