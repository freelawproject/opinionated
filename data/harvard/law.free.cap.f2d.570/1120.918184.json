After careful consideration, we have concluded that the contentions raised by the defendants do not justify reversal of the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-24\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-25\">The defendants were convicted of operating an illegal gambling business<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> or aiding and abetting the operation of an illegal gambling business,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and conspiring . 'to obstruct state law enforcement relating to gambling.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The gambling business, a numbers game, was conducted in the towns of Clairton and Elizabeth, Pa. All the defendants who participated' in the illegal gambling business, except Bazzano, were public officials.</p>\n<p id=\"b1191-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1123\">*1123</page-number>The evidence adduced by the Government was voluminous and a brief summary of it will suffice. Basically, the evidence was of two types: adding machine tapes proven to be business records of the gambling operation, and testimony by a number of witnesses who had been involved in the gambling operation. The evidence established that Bazzano had run the gambling operation and that the other defendants accepted payments from the gambling operation in exchange for letting the operation continue without interference.</p>\n<p id=\"b1191-5\">Mrs. Elizabeth Stanizzo, a former employee of the gambling operation, extensively detailed the illegal gambling business. Mrs. Stanizzo had known defendant Bazzano for 20 years, and her late husband had been Bazzano\u2019s partner in the business. She testified that Bazzano ran the gambling operation and that the other defendants received payments from the operation. Another witness, Moody, corroborated some of Mrs. Stanizzo\u2019s testimony. Moody, who for a time was part owner of the operation, testified that he had worked for Mr. Staniz-zo in the business and that Mr. Stanizzo had dealt with Bazzano. A former Allegheny County detective, Hammer, testified that he had accepted protection payments from numbers writers in the Clairton area. His testimony also corroborated some of Mrs. Stanizzo\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b1191-6\">Defendant Matz was the Mayor of Clair-ton. Testimony indicated that Matz allowed Bazzano to operate the numbers business in Clairton and that Matz received payment from one of Bazzano\u2019s employees. The adding machine tapes indicate that payments were made to \u201cMayor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1191-12\">There was sufficient testimony to support the jury\u2019s verdicts convicting the other public official defendants as indicated in the footnote.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1191-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1191-14\">The charge of prosecutorial misconduct stems from a meeting between two witnesses, Moody and Stanizzo, and F.B.I. Agent Fitzpatrick, who had investigated the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1191-15\">When Moody, who was testifying under immunity, took the stand, he requested to speak with the judge in chambers. In chambers, with counsel present, Moody stated that a few days before he was to testify, Fitzpatrick read Moody\u2019s grand jury testimony to Mrs. Stanizzo and read Mrs. Stanizzo\u2019s grand jury testimony to Moody. Defense counsel immediately moved for a mistrial or, in the alternative, that both Moody and Mrs. Stanizzo \u201cbe dismissed as witnesses and not called by the government\u201d (N.T. IX \u2014 63). The court denied the motions after oral arguments and Moody was allowed to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b1191-16\">On cross-examination, defense counsel questioned Moody about the meeting with Fitzpatrick. He testified that Fitzpatrick <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1124\">*1124</page-number>read selected pages of each witness\u2019 grand jury testimony in the presence of both witnesses (N.T. IX-133). He also testified that, in his opinion, Fitzpatrick \u201cdoctored\u201d Moody\u2019s testimony with Mrs. Stanizzo\u2019s so that their stories would be the same (N.T. IX-133-34).</p>\n<p id=\"b1192-4\">Mrs. Stanizzo was also cross-examined on this subject, and her account differed from Moody\u2019s. She testified that Fitzpatrick did not read any of her grand jury testimony, but, rather, told her that he did not have to read it to her because she knew what she had said. She testified that he read from some papers to Moody in her presence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1192-5\">After Mrs. Stanizzo\u2019s testimony, the defendants moved that her testimony be stricken on the ground that the meeting with Fitzpatrick violated F.R.Crim.P. 6(e) and constituted prosecutorial misconduct. Defendants also moved for a dismissal of the indictment on the same grounds. The motions were denied. The defendants again press this argument in this court, claiming that the conduct in violation of Rule 6(e) denied them a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1192-13\">We hold that at least some of the conduct testified to was prosecutorial misconduct violative of Rule 6(e), but that this conduct did not constitute reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1192-14\">F.R.Crim.P. 6(e) provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"anp-dedup-0\">\u201cSecrecy of Proceedings and Disclosure. Disclosure of matters occurring before the grand jury other than its deliberations and the vote of any juror may be made to the attorneys for the government for use in the performance of their duties. Otherwise a juror, attorney, interpreter, stenographer, operator of a recording device, or any typist who transcribes recorded testimony may disclose matters occurring before the grand jury only when so directed by the court preliminarily to or in connection with a judicial proceeding or when permitted by the court at the request of the defendant upon a showing that grounds may exist for a motion to dismiss the indictment because of matters occurring before the grand jury. No obligation of secrecy may be imposed upon any person except in accordance with this rule.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1193-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1125\">*1125</page-number>The language pertinent here is: \u201cDisclosure . may be made to attorneys for the government for use in the performance of their duties\u201d and an \u201cattorney . may disclose matters . . . only when so directed by the court . . . Thus, we are faced with two questions: Did the Government attorney use the material in the performance of his duties? Did the Government attorney disclose matters without court direction?</p>\n<p id=\"b1193-7\">In answering the first question, we need not decide the issue of whether it is proper for material to be disclosed to an F.B.I. agent working for the Government attorney. The 1977 amendment to Rule 6(e) was enacted to permit such disclosure.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that such a disclosure was proper under the earlier version of Rule 6(e) applicable here,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the F.B.I. agent cannot use the disclosed material in a manner which is not permissible for the Government attorney. The scope of authority of the F.B.I. agent, acting as an agent for the Government attorney, is limited to the scope of authority of the Government attorney. <em>Cf. </em>Restatement of Agency, 2d, \u00a7 20. Apparently, in this case, if Moody\u2019s testimony was accurate, the Assistant United States Attorney, perhaps knowingly, used the F.B.I. agent as a conduit to disclose the grand jury testimony of two of the Government witnesses to each other prior to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1193-12\">The defendants do not object to the disclosure by the agent to a grand jury witness of that witness\u2019 testimony,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> but the objection is to the verbatim disclosure of Mrs. Stanizzo\u2019s testimony to Moody, and vice versa, in an attempt to \u201cshape\u201d their trial testimony so that each witness\u2019 testimony will corroborate the other\u2019s. These facts are distinguishable from a pre-trial interview in which the prosecutor indicates to a witness in general terms the evidence which other witnesses may give. In this latter situation, the interview may be conducted without disclosure of specific statements made to the grand jury, and therefore Rule 6(e) would not be involved. Furthermore, when potential trial witnesses who testified before the grand jury are not identified by name, there is no violation of the purpose of Rule 6(e) to encourage witnesses to testify without fear of retaliation. <em>See, e. g., Pittsburgh Plate Glass Co. v. United States, </em>360 U.S. 395, 400, 79 S.Ct. 1237, 3 L.Ed.2d 1323 (1959); <em>Posey v. United States, </em>416 F.2d 545, 557 (5th Cir. 1969), <em>cert. denied, </em>397 U.S. 946, 90 S.Ct. 964, 25 L.Ed.2d 127 (1970). Finally, such a pre-trial interview may simply serve to refresh a witness\u2019 memory rather than improperly to influence his testimony. As the Supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1126\">*1126</page-number>Court has stated, \u201can attorney must respect the important ethical distinction between discussing testimony and seeking improperly to influence it.\u201d <em>Geders v. United States, </em>425 U.S. 80, 90 n.3, 96 S.Ct. 1330, 1336, 47 L.Ed.2d 592 (1976). Of course, at times the line between refreshing a witness\u2019 memory and seeking improperly to influence his testimony may be difficult to draw, and each case must be decided on its facts. We merely hold that on the particular facts of this case, if the agent read Moody\u2019s testimony verbatim to Mrs. Stanizzo in an attempt to \u201cshape\u201d Mrs. Stanizzo\u2019s trial testimony to coincide with Moody\u2019s, the agent\u2019s conduct fell on the impermissible side of the line. Therefore, on Moody\u2019s account, the Government attorney\u2019s use of grand jury material went beyond the proper use of that material in the performance of his duties.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1194-4\">With regard to the second question (1127 above), through the F.B.I. agent, the Government attorney disclosed grand jury testimony without court direction, if Moody\u2019s testimony was accurate. Therefore, the Government attorney, perhaps unknowingly, violated Rule 6(e). However, as noted below, there were credibility difficulties with Moody\u2019s testimony. Although we find the violation of Rule 6(e) as testified to by Moody improper, we do not think the defendants were denied a fair trial under the facts presented by this record.</p>\n<p id=\"b1194-8\">First, Moody\u2019s and Mrs. Stanizzo\u2019s accounts of what occurred at the meeting with Fitzpatrick differed: Moody claimed that Fitzpatrick attempted to \u201cdoctor\u201d the testimony and read each witness\u2019 testimony to the other witness. Mrs. Stanizzo testified that Fitzpatrick merely read from some papers, presumably a portion of Moody\u2019s testimony,<footnotemark>9a</footnotemark> to Moody in her presence, but made no attempt to coach her or to tell her what to say. Of course, even given Mrs. Stanizzo\u2019s version of the conduct if the papers read were grand jury transcripts, the conduct violates Rule 6(e), but on this version the conduct is not as egregious as the misconduct alleged by Moody. The trial judge could have believed Mrs. Stanizzo\u2019s account rather than Moody\u2019s, and we cannot say his decision to believe her account was erroneous. There is evidence in the record that Moody, who was being forced to testify under immunity, did not want to testify and was using this incident as a convenient way to avoid testifying and to avoid implicating his friends.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Throughout his testimony he exhibited a hostility toward the Government. N.T. IX-67, 109, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1127\">*1127</page-number>123. Consequently there is reason to be suspicious of the accuracy of Moody\u2019s account of the meeting and to accept Mrs. Stanizzo\u2019s account, as the fact finder could conclude that she was a more disinterested witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b1195-5\">Secondly, the trial judge found that the witnesses\u2019 testimony \u201cvaried in a number of respects, and all the circumstances militate against any inference that the testimony of Moody and Mrs. Stanizzo was \u2018shaped\u2019 . .\u201d <em>United States v. Bazzano, </em>Crim.No. 75-192, slip op. at 8-9 (W.D.Pa., Nov. 9, 1976). Having carefully reviewed the record, we find ample support for this position. Thus, the trial judge was acting well within his discretion in allowing these witnesses to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b1195-7\">Third, because there is ample evidence to support the view that any attempt to shape the witnesses\u2019 testimony was unsuccessful, we think the evidence of improper influence affects the credibility, not the admissibility, of the testimony, see <em>Geders v. United States, </em>425 U.S. 80, 89-90, 96 S.Ct. 1330, 47 L.Ed.2d 592 (1976); <em>United States v. Hood, </em>493 F.2d 677, 680 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>419 U.S. 852, 95 S.Ct. 94, 42 L.Ed.2d 84 (1974), and, of course, the credibility of witnesses is a question for the jury. See, e. <em>g., United States </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>449 F.2d 743, 743 n.3 (3d Cir. 1971). Moody, Mrs. Stanizzo, and Fitzpatrick were cross-examined vigorously about the meeting at which the grand jury testimony was read by Fitzpatrick. Therefore, the jury was fully apprised of all three accounts and was able to weigh the credibility of Mrs. Stanizzo accordingly.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> As the Supreme Court has stated: \u201cThe established safeguards of the Anglo-American legal system leave the veracity of a witness to be tested by cross-examination, and the credibility of his testimony to be determined by a properly instructed jury.\u201d <em>Hoffa v. United States, </em>385 U.S. 293, 311, 87 S.Ct. 408, 418, 17 L.Ed.2d 374 (1966).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1195-11\">Finally, even assuming that Mrs. Stanizzo\u2019s testimony was tainted by improper influence, her testimony was still not sufficiently harmful to require reversal. The only defendant who attempts to show that he was prejudiced by Mrs. Stanizzo\u2019s testimony is Matz, who claims that he was implicated by her trial testimony but was not implicated by her grand jury testimony. Even if Mrs. Stanizzo\u2019s testimony regarding Matz had been stricken, there would have been sufficient evidence to convict Matz because the tapes indicated that he received bribes and there was ample evidence that whenever the tapes indicated that a person received bribes, that person did receive bribes. Therefore, even if it had been error to admit Mrs. Stanizzo\u2019s testimony regarding Matz, it would have been harmless error beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1196-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1128\">*1128</page-number>We emphasize that our holding that the prosecutorial misconduct in violation of Rule 6(e) does not require a new trial is limited to the facts of this case. Under other circumstances, for example, when a witness appears to have changed his or her testimony as the result of some improper influence or when the evidence against the defendants is not as strong as it is here, a violation of Rule 6(e) may well require a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1196-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1196-5\">Defendant Bazzano contends that the district court denied him effective assistance of counsel during sentencing because the trial judge referred to published sentencing guidelines but failed to provide those guidelines to defense counsel or to make them part of the record. We find this argument unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1196-6\">Counsel did not request to see the sentencing guidelines or to have them made part of the record at the time of sentencing. Nor did Bazzano raise the issue of ineffective assistance of counsel in his post-trial motions. This court will not pass on issues not raised in the district court \u201cunless the error be so fundamental in nature as to deprive a party of fundamental justice.\u201d <em>United States v. Moore, </em>453 F.2d 601, 604 (3d Cir. 1971).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1196-7\">We do not think failure to disclose the sentencing guidelines deprived Bazzano of fundamental justice. Bazzano was sen-fenced to seven years\u2019 imprisonment and fined $40,000. The maximum sentence possible was 35 years\u2019 imprisonment and $140,-000. in fines.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Therefore, the sentence was well within the statutory maximum. <em>See United States v. Fessler, </em>453 F.2d 953, 954 (3d Cir. 1972). Moreover, the guidelines referred to by the trial judge, entitled Part 2 \u2014 Parole, Release, Supervision and Recom-mitment of Prisoners, Youth Offenders and Juvenile Delinquents, are published at 28 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 2.1-2.58, and often cited by this court. <em>See, e. g., United States v. Somers, </em>552 F.2d 108 (3d Cir. 1977); <em>United States v. Salerno </em>(appeal of Silverman), 538 F.2d 1005 (3d Cir. 1976).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Since the guidelines should be familiar to anyone practicing criminal law in this Circuit and since they have been published in the Code of Federal Regulations, they were readily available to defense counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1196-12\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1196-13\">We have considered these other contentions of one or more defendants and reject them:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1196-14\">A. Where it is established that the prosecutor failed to furnish exculpatory statements of many witnesses who were called to testify, the district court should have conducted a hearing and required the production of statements and grand jury testimony of other witnesses whom the Government did not call to testify to determine whether additional exculpato<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1129\">*1129</page-number>ry evidence or evidence which would tend to negate the guilt of defendant had been withheld from counsel for defendant as alleged in the motion for new trial.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1197-5\">B. The district court erred in failing to instruct the jury that certain witnesses are available to the Government where the Government may grant them immunity but not available to the defendant and, therefore, the inference that their testimony would be adverse to the Government is a permissible one which the jury may draw.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1197-6\">C.

However, I am constrained to add some thoughts concerning Bazzano\u2019s contention as to the sentence imposed on him, and the judge\u2019s alleged failure to explain the basis of that sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-7\">The key facts bearing upon Bazzano\u2019s sentencing may be quickly summarized. With respect to all counts on which he was convicted, Bazzano received a sentence of seven years in prison and a fine of $40,000. After the penalty was imposed, the trial judge stated that Bazzano\u2019s sentence was predicated upon the \u201cguidelines that have recently been published.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1198-8\">At oral argument Bazzano\u2019s counsel remarked that he was not aware of the identity of the guidelines to which the judge referred. After further questioning by the panel, however, counsel admitted that he had not pressed the trial judge for any additional explanation of the basis for the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-9\">Two points are evident in light of these facts. First, this is not a case in which the district judge gave no reasons for Bazzano\u2019s sentence. Although the grounds for the sentencing decision were not set forth in detail, it cannot be claimed that the judge made no attempt to explain the matters influencing him. \u00a1</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-13\">Additionally, there is no indication that Bazzano was foreclosed from requesting a further explanation by the court. Since Bazzano\u2019s counsel apparently was unaware of the nature of the guidelines to which the judge referred, it is rather puzzling that he did not seek some additional elaboration of the basis for the decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-14\">In light of these factors, Bazzano\u2019s argument that he was deprived of the effective assistance of counsel, because the attorney was unable to discover the grounds of the penalty,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> cannot succeed. The facts simply do not support the major premise of such a position, namely, that counsel had no opportunity to learn the reasons for the sentencing determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-15\">Nonetheless, this does not end the matter. Although this Court was not asked by the parties to adopt a rule that the reasons for sentences should be given in all cases, in my view, the procedural requirement of a statement of reasons should be adopted for <em>future </em>cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-16\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-17\">The traditional principle guiding appellate courts faced with challenges to sentences, in this Circuit and elsewhere, is to defer to the discretion of a trial court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As a general rule, \u201ca federal appellate tribunal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1131\">*1131</page-number>will not review a judgment of sentence that is within the statutory maximum unless there be a showing of illegality or abuse of discretion.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The rationale behind this precept is that trial judges, by virtue of their knowledge of the circumstances of a criminal case, are in the best position to impose a penalty, taking into account the individual conditions of the defendant<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and the nature of his crime.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1199-5\">Yet the principle of deferring to the discretion of a trial court clearly does not require abdication of an appellate court\u2019s responsibility to superintend the sentencing process. Moreover, respect for a district court\u2019s discretion in framing the substance of sentences within statutory limits entails no lack of power to review sentencing procedures. Indeed, \u201cthe careful scrutiny of the <em>judicial process </em>by which the particular punishment was determined\u201d is \u201ca necessary incident of what has always been appropriate appellate review of criminal cases.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1199-6\">a.</p>\n<p id=\"b1199-7\">In the course of reviewing the process of sentencing, the Supreme Court in <em>United States v. Tucker, </em>404 U.S. 443, 92 S.Ct. 589, 30 L.Ed.2d 592 (1972), held that it was proper to remand the case for reconsideration of a sentence when the district judge explicitly took into account the defendant\u2019s record of prior convictions, and it later was determined that two of the convictions were constitutionally invalid. The Supreme Court was able to conclude, by reviewing the transcript of the sentencing proceeding, that constitutionally impermissible convictions had been weighed by the trial court.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As the Supreme Court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1199-17\">The record in the present case makes evident that the sentencing judge gave specific consideration to the respondent\u2019s previous convictions before imposing sentence upon him. Yet it is now clear that two of those convictions were wholly unconstitutional under <em>Gideon </em>v. <em>Wainwright, </em>372 U.S. 335, 83 S.Ct. 792, 9 L.Ed.2d 799.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1199-18\">The Supreme Court further emphasized that Tucker\u2019s sentence might have been different had the district judge not taken into account the invalid data.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1199-19\">Thus, <em>Tucker </em>stands for the proposition that a district judge, in the exercise of his discretion, must not rely upon incorrect evidence of prior convictions or upon previous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1132\">*1132</page-number>convictions illegally obtained.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The principle underlying this proposition, stated generally, appears to be that it is unfair for a person to suffer a penalty which, at least to a significant degree, was designed to fit a set of facts that is inapplicable to the individual on whom the sentence is imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-4\">b.</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-5\">In some cases, such as in <em>Tucker </em>itself, a reviewing court may be able to conclude, simply on the basis of the record, that a trial judge relied upon specific misinformation about the defendant.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> It is not difficult to foresee, however, that the record of a case will not always reveal clearly whether a sentencing tribunal took into consideration erroneous data.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Where the record is silent or unclear on the matter, such a gap could be filled by a statement of the reasons for the sentence. At the very least, then, the procedural requirement of a statement of reasons for sentences would assist appellate courts in such circumstances in carrying out the mandate of <em>Tucker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1200-6\">Moreover, the requirement of a statement of reasons would appear to intrude less on the discretion of a trial court than a process of inferring broadly what a judge\u2019s reasoning regarding a sentence might have been. When no statement of reasons is set out, an appellate court, in order to vindicate the principle that only correct information may be considered in sentencing, is forced to draw inferences from the record about the district judge\u2019s views.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> However, if a frank statement were made by the trial judge regarding the basis of a sentence, a reviewing court could concentrate on such an explicit enunciation of the factors on which the judge relied. This is not to say that, in all cases in which an appellate court questions the veracity of the information considered in sentencing, confining review solely to the statement of a trial judge would be adequate. Nevertheless, it seems reasonable that in the normal case it would suffice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-13\">Some appellate tribunals have demanded that a district court articulate the basis of its sentence when it is ordered to <em>resentence </em>a defendant.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Latimer</em><footnotemark><em>16</em></footnotemark><em> </em>is a good example of a situation in which the most direct response by an appellate court, when it questions whether a sentence depended upon invalid information, is to require the trial court to state its reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-14\">In <em>Latimer, </em>the defendant was convicted of impeding with a deadly weapon F.B.I. agents from performing their duties. The government, in its brief on appeal, referred to knowledge by the district court of tests <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1133\">*1133</page-number>performed on a bullet found in a gun held by the defendant at the time of his misconduct, which indicated that the gun had misfired.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The appellate court stressed that such information would seem to indicate that the defendant might have pulled the trigger while pointing the gun at the .F.B.I. agents, and that this would be a more serious crime than the one for which the defendant was charged and sentenced. The government\u2019s brief thus raised \u201cthe possibility that the district court may have sentenced Latimer for a more serious offense than the one for which he was convicted . .\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Since there was no way to be certain that this did not occur, the appellate court vacated the sentence and remanded the case with instructions that the district court file a statement of the reasons for the penalty ultimately imposed.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1201-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-6\">The justification for requiring a statement of reasons for sentences is not confined to situations where, on appeal, there is a serious question concerning the validity of the basis of a sentence.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> If the need fully to review the accuracy of the information utilized in sentencing were the central support for a statement of reasons, then all that would be indicated, when the grounds of a sentence are in doubt, would be a direction that the trial judge <em>upon remand </em>articulate the reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-12\">Although the value of such a requirement seems plain, a broader change would also seem to be in order. The rationality and fairness of the sentencing process, and the likelihood that a given sentence will contribute to the promotion of the aims of our system of criminal justice, would be measurably heightened by requiring federal judges generally to give the reasons for the penalties they impose.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1201-13\">a.</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-14\">There are several policy justifications for the requirement that a trial judge elaborate the factors influencing a particular sentence. First, it would help to assure that the sentence fits the circumstances of a given defendant. For if a judge must elaborate the grounds of a sentencing determination, his attention will necessarily focus on the particular aspects of a case that are apposite to punishment.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> \u201cA Sphinx-like silence on the court\u2019s part precludes anyone (including the parties, the judge and an appellate tribunal) from learning whether he acted in error.\u201d <em>United States v. Brown, </em>479 F.2d 1170, 1172 (2d Cir. 1973); <em>accord, United States v. Velazquez, </em>482 F.2d 139, 142 (2d Cir. 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-15\">Moreover, such a requisite would help to guarantee that the basis of a sentence is fundamentally rational and objective, and not rooted in nonartieulable considera<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1134\">*1134</page-number>tions.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Although any sentencing decision may rest in part on a sense of the case and of the defendant that will be difficult to state with clarity, and although some aspects of the decision may be founded on ineffable factors, it should ultimately be grounded upon concrete and identifiable items revealed in the course of the trial and the sentencing proceeding.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Insisting on a statement of reasons \u201c. . . would encourage the judge to clarify and justify, in his own mind, the grounds for the sentence he chooses. As a result, sentencing decisions would tend, on the whole, to be more carefully thought out.\u201d <em>United States v. Velazquez, </em>482 F.2d 139, 142 (2d Cir. 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-5\">As Judge Wyzanski wrote twenty-five years ago on the question whether a judge should give the reasons for his sentence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ai5-dedup-0\">Eminent and wise judges have warned me against this. Our judgment, they say, is better than our reasons. And it is in vain to attempt to explain the exact proportions attributable to our interest in punishment, retribution, reform, deterrence, even vengeance. But are these arguments valid? For there is grave danger that a sentencing judge will allow his emotion or other transient factors to sway him. The strongest safeguard is for him to act only after formulating a statement of the considerations which he allows himself to take into account.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1202-9\">The requirement of a statement of reasons for a sentence would also reinforce the dignity of the accused, who thereby would be treated as a subject worthy of an explanation for a decision by a representative of the state so poignantly affecting him and his family. Such action by the sentencing judge in many cases could be of therapeutic worth to a defendant. <em>See Dorszynski v. United States, </em>418 U.S. 424, 456, 94 S.Ct. 3042, 41, L.Ed.2d 855 (1974) (Marshall, J., concurring in judgment).<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Moreover, such an explanation could have great value for correctional authorities when, as is often the case, a sentence results in commitment or continued supervision of a defendant.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1203-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1135\">*1135</page-number>In addition, requiring a sentencing tribunal to articulate the basis for its determination and, where appropriate, affording a defendant an opportunity to learn the reasons for the extent of his punishment, would increase the sense of the defendant and the public generally that the\" criminal process is fair and legitimate. More and more, we are coming to realize that for our system of criminal justice to be respected by the participants in it as well as by the public, it must be observed to be fair. It is not enough for it to be technically correct, although that, too, is a fundamental aim. Requiring that the basis of a sentence be set forth by a trial judge would promote the principle that \u201cto perform its high function in the best way \u2018justice must satisfy the appearance of justice\u2019 \u201d.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1203-5\">The reality of justice would also be enhanced by such a step. From a defendant\u2019s perspective, the requirement of a statement of reasons would reduce the potential for unbridled discretion on the part of a judge in a situation in which the liberty of an accused is directly at stake.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> From the public\u2019s viewpoint, this requirement would aid the citizenry in becoming better informed about the use of judicial power in criminal cases and, in particular, about the nature and grounds of the penalties imposed in the public\u2019s name.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1203-11\">b.</p>\n<p id=\"b1203-12\">The major arguments adduced for rejecting the requirement of a statement of reasons for sentences are, at least to me, unconvincing. First, it is difficult to see that such a rule would be an undue burden on trial courts, for, as Justice Marshall has stated, \u201cit is not burdensome to give reasons when reasons exist.\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A_x\">In addition, the tradition of deferring to the discretion of trial courts is not a sufficient basis for failing to effectuate a change in sentencing policy.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Indeed, to warrant adherence to present practices, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1136\">*1136</page-number>there should be proffered an independent justification for them, especially since it has become increasingly clear that a requirement for a statement of reasons would maximize the achievement of fundamental purposes in our criminal justice system.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Further, we have uncovered no data showing that the range of a trial court\u2019s discretion would be unduly constrained by asking a judge to elaborate the reasons for his sentencing determinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-4\">Another argument sometimes advanced for not imposing such a procedural requirement is that sentences cannot be \u201cexplained\u201d in an orderly manner because the decisional processes leading to them are not structured.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> The major difficulty with this position, putting aside the point that it apparently rests on an unsupported psychological premise, is that it proves too much. Surely many complex decisions in the judicial process have at their base some nonarti-culable factors. But this point alone is not a sufficient justification to forego the attempt to make and to support major choices in a careful, rational manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-10\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-11\">To fail to insist that trial judges present the reasons for sentences is in effect to ignore the existence of unevenness in present practices. Since courts have displayed great sensitivity to the procedural rights of defendants during other stages of the criminal process, the act of sentencing itself is in the rather unique position of relative freedom from procedural scrutiny.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> This is especially disconcerting because, in our criminal justice system, guilty pleas have become the norm.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Since more than 80% of all criminal cases involve no judicial determination of guilt,<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> from a practical perspective sentencing decisions may well be the most important ones made by trial judges in criminal cases. In such a system, it is particularly incongruous to fail to accord to a defendant at sentencing the kind of procedural protections provided at other stages of the criminal process.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1204-12\">A further anomaly exists in this Circuit, where Pennsylvania and New Jersey re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1137\">*1137</page-number>quire trial judges to give reasons for sentences while the federal courts do not.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Although this alone is, of course, an insufficient ground for imposing the requirement on district courts, it should not be overlooked. Particularly when the policy arguments tend to point in one direction,'it is important to consider the value of having a procedural system in which the federal courts do not diverge increasingly and substantially from state courts in the safeguards afforded defendants.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1205-5\">To persist in declining to require that district judges provide reasons for sentences is also to overlook a growing body of legal literature \u2014 representative of judges, lawyers, scholars, and other commentators on the criminal process \u2014 affirming the merit of such a procedure.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> For instance, as the American Bar Association Project on Minimum Standards for Criminal Justice recommended nearly a decade ago:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1205-13\">The sentencing judge should be required in every case to state his reasons for selecting the particular sentence imposed. Normally, this should be done for the record in the presence of the defendant at the time of sentence. In cases in which the sentencing judge deems it in the interest of the defendant not to state fully the reasons for the sentence in the presence of the defendant, he should prepare such a statement for transmission to the reviewing court as a part of the record.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1205-14\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-15\">In view of these considerations, the time is now ripe to require, on the basis of our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1138\">*1138</page-number>supervisory power over district courts in this Circuit,<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> that trial judges set forth the reasons for the sentences they impose.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> Such a rule would help to assure that sentences are grounded on the facts of a particular case, and would serve the broader aims of promoting the defendant\u2019s rehabilitation as well as the fairness and rationality of sentencing procedures. It would also eliminate the undue delay that frequently results when the sentencing process is questioned in an appellate court, and the trial judge has not given his reasons for the sentence.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> These gains would obtain without overly burdening trial judges, and without invading the realm of their discretion to set sentences on the basis of their knowledge of the defendant and the circumstances surrounding the crime.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1198-10\">. The guidelines to which the judge referred were not identified, although it seems likely that they were the guidelines adopted by the Parole Commission. <em>See </em>28 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 2.1-2.58. <em>Cf. </em>Appellant\u2019s brief at p. 32, where a conjecture is made that the guidelines might have been the sentencing standards incorporated in a pending Senate bill. For a discussion of the bill\u2019s provisions, see Kennedy, <em>Criminal Sentencing: A Game of Chance, </em>60 <em>Judicature </em>208, 212-215 (December 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-11\">As the majority properly points out, Bazzano made no attempt to ask the court to clear up any doubt regarding the nature of the guidelines applied in his case. He did not ask the district court for an explanation of the meaning of the term \u201cguidelines\u201d or for a statement of the reasons for his sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1198-18\">. See appellant\u2019s brief at pp. 31-32. Bazzano claims that the \u201cguidelines\u201d should have been made available to him. Yet his counsel was not precluded from requesting them, and thus it is not now appropriate for Bazzano to complain about the fact that the judge did not articulate more fully the reasons for the sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1198-19\">. <em>See United States v.

Jackson, <em>Judges </em>370 (1974) (\u201cThe psychological roots of a judge\u2019s sentence reach into a bog where most judges fear to tread.\u201d). Nevertheless, \u201ca good sentence is one which can be reasonably explained,\u201d Youngdahl, <em>Remarks Opening the Sentencing Institute Program, </em>35 F.R.D. 387, 388 (1964). By having to state his reasons for a sentence, a trial judge will of necessity focus on the factors relevant to punishment in a given case, and this by itself should make the process more rational. <em>See ABA </em>Project in Minimum Standards for Criminal Justice, <em>Standards Relating to Appellate Review of Sentences </em>(hereinafter cited as <em>ABA Project) </em>\u00a7 2.3(c) and commentary (e) at 45-47 (App. Draft 1968). In addition, sentences that may seem arbitrary or irrationally-based in the absence of an explanation might well have a reasonable foundation. Such a matter can be known with definiteness only when the basis of a sentence is explicitly stated. <em>See </em>Coburn, <em>Disparity in Sentences and Appellate Review of Sentencing, </em>25 <em>Rutgers L.Rev. </em>207, 217 n.63 (1971).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b1202-11\">.

Of course, there may be instances in which an explanation would lead to greater harm than benefit to a defendant. In such a case, a trial judge should not make the reasons available to the defendant, although he still should articulate his reasons and incorporate them in the record. The reasons thus would be transmitted to the reviewing court if there is an appeal, and to the corrections authorities if the defendant is committed. This procedure would protect the value of having a statement of reasons, the special sensitivities of a defendant and the discretion of a sentencing judge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b1202-13\">. <em>See ABA Project, </em>note 24 <em>supra, </em>at 46.

A constitutional question of due process dimensions may also be involved in the failure of judges to give reasons for sentences. That issue is not considered in this opinion, although, if the requirement of a statement of reasons is not adopted, it may well have to be addressed in future cases. <em>See generally </em>Ber-kowitz, <em>The Constitutional Requirement for a Written Statement of Reasons and Facts in Support of the Sentencing Decision: A Due Process Proposal, </em>60 <em>Iowa L.Rev. </em>205 (1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"44\">\n<p id=\"b1206-6\">. It seems important to underscore what is <em>not </em>being recommended in this concurring opinion. First, the particular procedural requirement supported herein should not be confused with a broader recommendation made in some quarters for appellate review of the substance of sentences. <em>See, e. g., </em>Kennedy, Criminal Sentencing: <em>A Game of Chance, </em>60 <em>Judicature </em>208, 212-213 (December 1976); Comment, <em>Appellate Review of Sentences: a Survey, </em>17 <em>St. Louis L.J. </em>221, 244 (1972). Since appellate review of the substance of sentences would go much farther than a procedural requirement that reasons for sentences be advanced, -the former matter must be analyzed separately. That task is not intended to be undertaken, nor its result in any way presupposed, in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-23\">In addition, a distinction should be drawn between the suggestion that a statement of reasons be required, on the one hand, and the demand that a statement of a certain type or duration be mandated, on the other hand. It is urged here only that some statement of reasons for sentences be provided by trial judges. The additional question of what sort of explanation is required in certain circumstances is a matter worthy of separate consideration in an appropriate case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"45\">\n<p id=\"b1206-24\">. Such delay occurs when the appellate court is forced to remand a case for reconsideration of the sentence because no clear basis of the sentence has been enunciated. <em>Cf. United States </em>v. <em>Eberhardt, </em>417 F.2d 1009, 1014-1015 (4th Cir. 1969), where Judge Sobeloff wrote of a trial judge\u2019s sentencing power:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AkS2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1139\">*1139</page-number>\u201c[I]t is true that he could sentence only for the offense of which the defendants had been convicted . <em>Precisely what passed through the judge\u2019s mind is purely speculative </em>and we have no reason to think that the judge undertook to impose a penalty for the second offense.
