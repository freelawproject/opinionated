The checks were cashed in Cincinnati and were forwarded to the supposed payor bank in Pensacola, Florida.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-26\">This appeal presents as its only substantial contention that the federal jurisdictional support for the portion of the statute at issue pertains only to transporting and not to \u201ccausing to transport\u201d such items.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-27\">Interesting as is the logic of appellant\u2019s argument, it has been made before and where the defendant, as here, has been charged with violating \u00a7 2314 and \u00a7 2(a) (aiding and abetting) and \u00a7 2(b) (causing), it has been squarely rejected by this and other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>courts. <em>United States v.
