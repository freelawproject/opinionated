Following a hearing an administrative law judge dismissed the complaint and the Board divided 2-1 in reversing the decision of the administrative law judge. The decision and order of the Board are reported at 223 N.L.R.B. No. 194 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1372-16\">Upon consideration of the entire record together with the briefs and oral arguments of counsel the court concludes that the Board failed to apply the controlling law as set forth in <em>Howard Johnson Co., Inc. v. Detroit Local, etc., Union, </em>417 U.S. 249, 94 S.Ct. 2236, 41 L.Ed.2d 46 (1974), to the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1372-17\">The application for enforcement is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
