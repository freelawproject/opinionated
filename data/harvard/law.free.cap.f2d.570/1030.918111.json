At the time of the passage of OSHA, there was some concern that the Act not result in the wholesale federalization of occupational safety.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Therefore, in \u00a7 18 of OSHA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 667 (1970), Congress provided that a state may reassume responsibility for occupational safety and health by submitting an acceptable plan to the Secretary of Labor. The issue presented by this case is the validity of the criteria used by the Secretary of Labor for approval of state plans.</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-15\">A. <em>Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1101-16\">There are two stages to the state plan approval process, initial approval and final approval, and the implementation of an approved plan is monitored at all times.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Section 18(c) of OSHA<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> sets out criteria for determining plan acceptability. \u201cThe Sec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1034\">*1034</page-number>retary shall approve the plan submitted by a State ... if such plan in his judgment\u201d satisfies the stated criteria. These initial approvals do not necessarily cede federal jurisdiction to the state nor affect the federal enforcement program\u2019s operation within the state. Instead, there is a concurrent jurisdiction period of at least three years during which the Secretary monitors the state program for compliance with \u00a7 18(c) and may enforce the federal program. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 667(e), (f) (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-4\">This case requires us to focus on the standards for evaluating state plans set forth in \u00a7 18 of OSHA, and particularly the requirement of (c)(2), that the state standards be \u201cat least as effective\u201d as the federal standards, and of (c)(4) and (5), that there be adequate assurances that the state agency administering the plan will have sufficient \u201cqualified personnel\u201d and \u201cadequate funds\u201d to enforce the state standards.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1102-5\">The AFL-CIO challenged the regulations of the Secretary that interpreted \u201cadequate funds\u201d and \u201cqualified personnel necessary for enforcement of [the state] standards.\u201d It claimed the regulations only parroted the language of the statute, established no rational criteria and guidelines for evaluating the sufficiency of a state\u2019s plan in terms of effective inspection and enforcement, and have resulted in state plans with wide disparities in manpower commitments and fund allotments.</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-6\">The District Court upheld the Secretary of Labor\u2019s regulations on motions for summary judgment.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It held that \u201cthe Secretary has promulgated rational, ascertainable standards for personnel and funding.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The District Court interpreted those standards to require that the state effort be at least comparable to what the federal effort would have been in the absence of an approved state plan. The District Court also held that the Secretary of Labor had consistently and properly applied those standards. The AFL-CIO has appealed that decision to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-13\">B. <em>Contentions on Appeal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1102-14\">To state adequately the contentions of the parties on appeal, we set forth the text of OSHA\u2019s \u00a7 18(c)(2), (4), (5). Those subsections state that the \u201cSecretary shall approve the plan submitted by a State under subsection (b), or any modification thereof, if such a plan in his judgment \u2014 \u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1102-15\">(2) provides for the development and enforcement of safety and health standards relating to one or more safety or health issues, which standards (and the enforcement of which standards) are or will be at least as effective in providing safe and healthful employment and places of employment as the standards promulgated under section 6 [29 U.S.C. \u00a7 655 (1970)] which relate to the same issues, and which standards, when applicable to products which are distributed or used in interstate commerce, are required by compelling local conditions and do not unduly burden interstate commerce,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AcWJ\">. . . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1102-16\">(4) contains satisfactory assurances that such agency or agencies have or will have the legal authority and qualified personnel necessary for the enforcement of such standards,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1102-17\">(5) gives satisfactory assurances that such State will devote adequate funds to the administration and enforcement of such standards .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1102-18\">The AFL-CIO contends that the Secretary exceeded the scope of his authority by interpreting the requirements of \u00a7 18 to mandate only the provision of staff and funding levels \u201cat least as effective as\u201d the Federal enforcement program.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It empha<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1035\">*1035</page-number>sizes that (4) and (5) do not contain the \u201cat least as effective as\u201d criterion explicitly used in (2) and (3) of \u00a7 18(c),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and it argues that \u201cadequate funds\u201d and \u201cqualified personnel necessary for the enforcement of such standards\u201d mean force and funding levels sufficient to ensure that the normative standards are in fact enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-4\">To demonstrate the invalidity of use of an \u201cat least as effective as\u201d standard for subsections (c)(4) and (5), the AFL-CIO notes that the federal benchmarks that have been employed by the Secretary are predicated on federal enforcement levels that are artificially low because the Secretary deliberately withheld commitment of adequate resources until he knew the full extent of likely state participation. It cites testimony given by Assistant Secretary of Labor George Guenther before the Senate Subcommittee on Appropriations on April 16, 1972.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1103-5\">[W]e have consciously attempted to control the level of our staff resources until we get a better reading of State participation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1103-6\">We have had some pressure on us, as you are aware, to substantially increase our forces immediately. We have refrained from requesting those kinds of increases for the reason that we don\u2019t believe that it\u2019s responsible to beef up the Federal program to such a level, and then find the States coming onboard, and have to withdraw from that staff level.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1103-7\">The Secretary maintains that this attitude was prompted by a lack of funding and \u201cby Congress\u2019 repeated expressions of concern regarding possible State dislocations produced by precipitous Federal movement in this delicate area.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1103-14\">The Secretary argues that subsections (4) and (5) must be read in light of subsection (2), which he characterizes as the \u201coverriding criterion.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Subsection (2) states that the Secretary shall approve the state plan if it, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cprovides for the development and enforcement of safety and health standards relating to one or more safety or health issues, which standards (and the enforcement of which standards) are or will be at least as effective in providing safe and healthful employment and places of employment as the standards promulgated under section 6.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The Secretary maintains that with the inclusion of the parenthetical phrase, Congress indicated that state plan approvals were to be governed by direct comparison of state funding and personnel with that of the federal program which would otherwise be operative.</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-15\">C. <em>Court\u2019s View of OSHA \u00a7 18(c)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1103-16\">After consideration of the text, legislative history and purpose of OSHA, we reach a conclusion as to the meaning of the statute that is different from that of either party \u2014 but that comports, we think, both with an effective enforcement program and a dynamic federal-state partnership in occupational health and safety matters. We hold that in referring to personnel and funding levels in terms of adequacy or sufficiency, Congress clearly intended that the states assure effective enforcement programs. In granting initial approval to state plans, the Secretary can consider \u2014 as interim federal benchmarks \u2014 whether the state is willing to provide personnel and funding \u201cat least as effective as\u201d that pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1036\">*1036</page-number>vided by the federal government. But such interim federal benchmarks must be part of an articulated, coherent program calculated to achieve a fully effective program at some point in the foreseeable future. As we discuss in part D of this opinion, the interim federal benchmarks that have been used for initial approval of state plans are not part of such a program. To comply with the mandate of the statute, the regulations and program directives establishing the benchmarks must be supplemented.</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-4\">We now set forth the several pertinent considerations that have led us to our interpretation of \u00a7 18(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-5\">\n<em>1. Statutory Language</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-6\">We think, along with plaintiffs, that there is significance in the fact that the \u201cat least as effective as\u201d criterion was explicitly set forth in \u00a7 18(c)(2) as to <em>standards </em>in state plans, but was omitted when Congress moved from standards to enforcement in subsections (4) and (5). The omission of the \u201cat least as effective as\u201d language from (4) and (5), dealing with personnel and funds, is the more conspicuous in view of insertion of these words in subsection (3). The Secretary\u2019s argument that the use of the \u201cat least as effective as\u201d language in subsection (2) is an overriding criterion, with no need for explicit repetition in (4) and (5), is difficult to reconcile with the existence of such repetition in (3) of \u00a7 18(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-7\">In interpretation, we must serve the legislative purpose. The purpose of OSHA, as explicitly set forth in \u00a7 2(b)(10), is \u201cto assure so far as possible every working man and woman in the Nation safe and healthful working conditions and to preserve our human resources ... by providing an effective enforcement program.\u201d <footnotemark>14</footnotemark> This clear statement of purpose in \u00a7 2 gives context for the use of such terms as \u201cadequate\u201d and \u201cnecessary\u201d in \u00a7 18(c), the context of providing \u201can effective enforcement program.\u201d \u201cIt is our duty \u2018to give effect, if possible, to every clause and word of a statute\u2019 . . . rather than to emasculate an entire section.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1104-13\">\n<em>2. Legislative History</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-14\">It is a well-known canon of construction that the language of a statute is the best indication of legislative intent. <em>Browder v. United States, </em>312 U.S. 335, 338, 61 S.Ct. 599, 85 L.Ed. 862 (1941). Here we find that the legislative history also comports with our interpretation of the statutory language.</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-15\">Subsections (2), (4) and (5) of 18(c) moved from introduction to passage virtually without change, and were not the subject of extensive discussion in Congressional committees or in floor debates.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The Senate Report states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1104-16\">Moreover, whenever a State wishes to assume responsibility for developing or enforcing standards in an area where standards have been promulgated under this act, the State may do so under a state plan approved by the Secretary of Labor. The plan must contain assurances that the State will develop and enforce standards at least as effective as those developed by the Secretary, that the State will have the legal authority, per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1037\">*1037</page-number>sonnel and funds necessary to do the job . . ..<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1105-5\">The House Report contains a virtually identical passage.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1105-6\">The language of both committee reports carefully distinguished between standards and the means to enforce them. As to the latter, once the standards were set there were to be assurances that the state would have the resources \u201cnecessary to do the job.\u201d The language straightforwardly expresses a Congressional intention that approved state programs assure sufficient resources to effectively enforce the standards set forth in those programs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-7\">The foregoing recognizes a requirement for state plans. It does not, however, mandate a rigid approach toward state efforts that would make the perfect the enemy of the good. The legislative history develops another consideration of material importance \u2014 and that is time.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Congress was aware that both the states and the federal government would need time to bring a program of this type on-line. Thus \u00a7 18(c)(4) states that a state plan must give \u201csatisfactory assurances that such agency or agencies <em>have or will have </em>the legal authority and qualified personnel necessary for the enforcement of such standards.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Time is needed to staff up enforcement efforts. Moreover, switching jurisdiction from the state to federal authority entails significant transition costs. Concern was expressed on the floor of the Senate lest precipitate federal preemption mean the loss of the services of the state occupational safety and health machinery to the detriment of the overall effort.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1105-12\">\n<em>3. Overall Ascertainment of Legislative Purpose</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-13\">If we were controlled by the text alone, it might be argued that the \u201cat least as effective as\u201d concept is completely irrelevant for subsections (c)(4) and (5), where those words are omitted. An overall ascertainment of legislative purpose, however, bids us take into account practical necessities, including the concern for precipitate preemption brought out in the legislative history. In the application of a new federal statute, there is a likely Congressional contemplation of maximizing use of existing state machinery. \u201cFederalism\u201d cannot be invoked categorically where it would defeat the national objective. A sensitivity to state participation has value, however, where the state administration can be integrated with federal application\u2014 either as a supplement, or as a stopgap measure, or as a delegation under federal control. We have been instructed that a federal statute should not be given a rigid interpretation that would \u201cprevent States from undertaking supplementary efforts toward [the] very same end.\u201d <em>New York State Department of Social Services v. </em>Dublino, 413 U.S. 405, 419, 93 S.Ct. 2507, 2516, 37 L.Ed.2d 688 (1973).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1106-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1038\">*1038</page-number>Taking all these considerations into account, we hold that it is reasonable for the Secretary to employ federal \u201cat least as effective\u201d benchmarks under (4) and (5) of \u00a7 18(c), if those objectives are integrated with the objectives of \u201cnecessary\u201d personnel and \u201cadequate\u201d funds. The resultant of these vectors of analysis is the approval of current federal levels of personnel and funds as benchmarks for state plans, provided they are part of a coherent program to realize a fully effective enforcement effort at some point in the foreseeable future. These benchmarks must be pragmatic in terms of time frame but not lax in goal, and sustain state efforts that are reasonably adapted to realize the Act\u2019s objectives within the same time frame as the federal effort.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-4\">D. <em>Analysis of Regulations</em></p>\n<p id=\"ada-dedup-0\">Plaintiffs contend that the regulations and program directives that establish the federal benchmarks do not satisfy the statutory criteria. In support of his motion to dismiss and his position that he has rationally considered the relevant factors in administering \u00a7 18(c)(4) and (5), the Secretary submitted regulations and program directives to the District Court. He also submitted documents on the approved Illinois Plan, which has been used in this litigation as a representative state plan the approval of which illustrates the Secretary\u2019s review standards and procedures.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1106-9\">In this action for declaratory and injunctive relief, the appropriate standard of review is whether the Secretary\u2019s regulations are arbitrary and capricious or inconsistent with the governing statute. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A) (1976). The District Court held them valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-10\">The question before this court is whether the standards used by the Secretary reflect the \u201cmandate in the legislative charts\u201d and a reasoned course in achieving that mandate.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Although the intermediate federal benchmarks used in approving and monitoring state plans need not require a fully staffed effort, there is a duty on the Secretary to articulate how those benchmarks relate to the ultimate realization of a full effort.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1106-11\">Given the obligation to provide \u201cadequate\u201d funds and \u201cnecessary\u201d personnel, the Secretary\u2019s regulations would obviously be deficient if they contemplated that state plans that received approval on the basis of an interim benchmark could then stand still, without any obligation to keep pace with the improving federal effort. At oral argument, government counsel advised that the states were required to upgrade their programs. The court asked for supplemental memoranda on this matter.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1039\">*1039</page-number>government\u2019s memorandum states that state programs are required to keep pace with the federal effort throughout the initial and final approval stages.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> What is unclear is what was the Secretary\u2019s \u201creasoned course\u201d in achieving OSHA\u2019s mandate \u2014 how did the lower initial benchmark levels relate to ultimate realization of the Act\u2019s goals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-4\">The Secretary describes the benchmark revision process as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1107-5\">From 1972 to June 1974 \u2014 the complete period covered by [the] initial approvals [contested in this case] \u2014 there was no need to update the original benchmarks. Those benchmarks drew on the State plan portion of the Fiscal 1973 OSHA budget for their projection of the maximum number of inspectors the Federal program might deploy; that budget totalled $69.3 million, of which $27 million was allocated to State plan activities, principally funding of initially-approved State programs; and the Fiscal 1974 budget totalled only $70.4 million, of which $25 million \u2014 a <em>reduced amount </em>\u2014 was allocated to State plans. See Addendum C. Thus the original benchmark figures were a <em>fortiori </em>appropriate as a numerical guide for comparative efficacy through Fiscal 1974.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1107-14\">By Fiscal 1975 data began to become available which enabled not merely an updating based on increased Federal funds for that year, but a more sophisticated benchmark concept. This concept formulated the total number of inspectors needed for an ideally effective pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1040\">*1040</page-number>gram without regard to budget or administrative limitations; measured the total available Federal and State inspectors against the ideal total for each; then compared the two percentages to determine whether the State program was \u201cas effective\u201d at that time as the Federal program in the area of enforcement personnel.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1108-4\">The Secretary submitted a \u201crelatively final draft\u201d of the \u201cOSHA System for Enforcement Planning and Resource Allocations\u201d <footnotemark>29</footnotemark> which sets out the ideal number of inspectors for a total Federal-State program. These data are based on information concerning the relative hazardousness of various industries in different geographical areas and the number of safety inspections necessary as a result. We are informed that this system was developed for OSHA planning and budget reasons as well as state plan evaluation. \u201c[I]ts Federal figures for nonplan States do not represent the actual Federal deployment in any State, but an even projection designed to provide a theoretical model of equitable Federal enforcement with available Federal funds.\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> But the Secretary concludes \u201cthe ultimate test is still a direct comparison of Federal vis-a-vis State personnel to determine approved States\u2019 current \u2018as effective\u2019 status.\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1108-5\">In the last analysis, the \u201cOSHA System for Enforcement Planning and Resource Allocation\u201d does nothing to justify the standards employed in granting initial plan approval. It remains the case that however poor the federal effort, a state plan is approved if it is marginally better. For the years 1972 to 1974 this was clearly the case. For 1975, again, the state effort is compared with the federal effort \u201cas is\u201d. The federal effort is now described as a percentage of what is really needed, but all that is required of an approved state plan is that its percentage be at least as high as that of the federal effort. Although we think Congress conceded the Secretary some practical flexibility in administering OSHA, this rudderless scheme of plan approval cannot be reconciled with the mandate that state plans assure \u201cnecessary\u201d personnel and \u201cadequate\u201d funds. The Secretary must have some plan to reach that objective and the states must subscribe to that timetable as a precondition to implementation of the state plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-13\">We disagree with the District Court that the Secretary\u2019s regulations on number of personnel and funding provide the kind of specificity required for administering a state plan approval program in a consistent and rational manner. As to the \u201cnecessary\u201d number of state personnel, the District Court relied principally on Program Directive No. 72-24.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> But that Directive is simply a list of general considerations; there is no guidance given as to how these various considerations are to be weighed.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1109-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1041\">*1041</page-number>The program fares no better, in terms of satisfying OSHA\u2019s objectives, with the promulgation of Program Directive No. 72-26. All that directive requires is that the State assure a program as effective as a theoretical construct of what the Federal program would be without state participation\u2019\u2019 and with current appropriations.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> On reading what has been presented to us, we have some questions as to the nature of the \u201ctheoretical construct.\u201d<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> But that is not the central issue in this case. The vice of Program Directive No. 72-26 is that it makes no attempt whatever to link the resulting benchmarks to ultimate realiza-yon 0\u00a3 ^he Act\u2019s objectives.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Aae\">As to the requirement of \u201cadequate funds\u201d we agree with the Secretary that the \u201coverall sufficiency of a State\u2019s funding is inevitably tested by the personnel sufficiency criteria.\u201d \u201c[Enforcement staff and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1042\">*1042</page-number>necessary support salaries and fringe benefits constitute the principal cost element in any enforcement system.\u201d<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Once the Secretary articulates adequate personnel criteria, acceptable \u201cadequate funding\u201d requirements will follow.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1110-4\">We affirm the District Court\u2019s holding that the regulations concerning qualifications of state inspectors are valid. We find detail in these regulations sufficient to permit the Secretary to approve plans in a manner consistent with the mandate of the Act.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1110-5\">E. <em>Relief</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1110-6\">We declare that the Secretary has a duty to establish criteria that are part of an articulated plan to achieve a fully effective enforcement effort at some point in the foreseeable future. The \u201cOSHA System for Enforcement Planning and Resource Allocation\u201d has been drawn up with ideal benchmarks. Accordingly, with a planning horizon and an appreciation for administrative lags, the Secretary should be able to articulate a series of benchmarks clearly related to eventual achievement of the goals of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-7\">This is an action for equitable relief wherein considerations of the public interest weigh heavily. We decline to enjoin implementation of any of the state plans that have been approved to date by the Secretary. The problems we have identified do not necessarily mean that the Secretary erred in giving an initial approval based on present \u201cas effective as\u201d criteria. What those problems require is that in addition there be an articulated and coherent program moving from an initial \u201cas effective as\u201d approach toward the personnel and funding levels needed for satisfactorily effective enforcement. These criteria can be provided by supplements to the approval process.

Although Regulations Part 1902 set forth indices of effectiveness for standards and enforcement provisions under State plans, neither the regulations nor the Act provide definition of the term \u201csufficient number of adequately trained and qualified personnel necessary for the enforcement of the standards.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1108-16\">b. In presenting its proposal for staffing under an 18(b) plan, a State should relate its proposal to the factors discussed below in order to show sufficiency.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1108-17\">c. The basic factor is the scope of the State plan under section 1902.2(c) of the Regulations. Under these provisions, the scope will necessarily be defined in terms of the issues covered, the standards included in the issues, and the employers and employees covered within the issues. The scope of the State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1041\">*1041</page-number>plan would thus be both quantitative (employers and employees affected) and qualitative (hazards for which protection is provided). Under section 18(c)(4), necessary enforcement staff is related to the enforcement of standards, but the population affected determines the breadth of the application of the standards. Where the State plan is \"developmental\u201d with regard to the issues or standards for which the responsibility for enforcement is assumed, staffing would be affected by the projected timetable for implementation of the plan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AhxT\">d. After determining the scope of the State plan, additional factors could affect the sufficiency showing, such as geography, organizational structure, and degree of experience and training of staff. Thus, accessibility of staff over a wide geographical area, or in a small highly concentrated area, as well as experience and competency of staff would affect the sufficiency of their number.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AC3C\">e. An important additional factor bearing on the sufficiency of State staffing would be the program goals for the State program and staff needed to accomplish them. State program goals are required under section 1902.-3(1) of the Regulations to be \u201cconsistent with the goals of the Act.\u201d It should be noted that an important feature of the Federal compliance staff utilization in relation to the goals of the Act has been the establishment of inspection priorities, which include emphasis on special targets. Such emphasis enables OSHA to achieve 100% coverage each year of particularly high hazard industries and to focus on major health hazards. OSHA has also established a broader presence through the general inspection program. Establishments to be inspected are selected out of a random cross-section of establishments of all sizes, in all covered industries.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b1109-18\">. The methodology for determining benchmarks is set out in Program Directive No. 72-26 as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1109-20\"><em>Methodology. </em>The interim benchmark level for FY 1973 represents a theoretical construct of what the Federal program would be <em>without </em>state participation. It consists of the <em>planned </em>deployment [of] Federal [compliance safety and health officers] and [industrial hygienists] plus an additional 600 positions achieved by converting approximately half of the planned FY 1973 resources. The total of these <em>line inspection positions </em>were distributed by State according to the covered workforce in each State yielding the benchmark levels shown in the attachment. In some of the smaller States, e. g., Alaska and Vermont, this resulted in only one or two positions. A benchmark level of four is established as a minimum. (Emphasis in original).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1109-22\">As this methodology is explained in the Secretary of Labor\u2019s brief, the federal benchmark figures were arrived at by adding the total number of federal personnel available to the number that could be added if no funds were given to the states pursuant to state plans. These personnel were then divided among the states according to their relative work force sizes. Brief for the Secretary of Labor at 12-13.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"35\">\n<p id=\"b1109-23\">. It is obvious that the \u201ctheoretical construct\u201d itself is not consistent with a fully effective enforcement program. Even if we assumed that current funding levels were calculated to realize a fully effective enforcement effort in all plan and nonplan states, an assumption that is clearly incorrect, the \u201ctheoretical construct\u201d would not yield numbers of enforcement personnel consistent with a fully effective effort in each state. The core difficulty is that in drawing up its figures, the government starts with present funding levels, which cover 100% of the cost of federal personnel, but which, in view of \u00a7 23(g) of OSHA 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 672(g) (1970), cover not more than 50% of the cost of state personnel. Implicit in the theoretical construct is the assumption that the same funds would be provided if the federal government had <em>total </em>enforcement responsibility. Assuming comparable salary levels, this would represent a reduction in enforcement personnel equal to at least 50% of those now compensated by the states.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"36\">\n<p id=\"b1109-24\">. Program Directive No. 72-26 was rescinded by Program Directive No. 74-11. But the import of the Secretary\u2019s Supplemental Memorandum is that the numeric benchmark concept still plays a central role in the plan approval process.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"37\">\n<p id=\"b1110-8\">. Brief for the Secretary of Labor at 58.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"38\">\n<p id=\"b1110-9\">. This is not to suggest that the Secretary should not explicitly promulgate funding benchmarks consistent with realization of the Act\u2019s ultimate objectives. Certainly there must be funding for equipment, travel, and other necessary expenses of any enforcement program. But once the Secretary has calculated proper personnel benchmarks it should prove a relatively simple matter to draw up funding benchmarks.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"39\">\n<p id=\"b1110-10\">. <em>See AFL-CIO v. Brennan, </em>390 F.Supp. 972, 975 (D.D.C.1975) (discussing \u201cqualified personnel\u201d criteria).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"40\">\n<p id=\"b1110-11\">. We realize that the Secretary may draw up his plan and find that at some point in the future Congress is unwilling to appropriate the funds requested. The significance of such actions will depend on the nature of the Congressional action and its history. It may reflect a Congressional estimate that the same goals may be achieved with less expenditure, through greater efficiency. However, it may evince a legislative judgment that the administrative goal was excessive. If Congress approves only X% of the Secretary\u2019s benchmark, a legitimate corollary would be the Secretary\u2019s approval of state plans that provide detailed assurances to meet at least X% of the Secretary\u2019s benchmark during the appropriate time frame. As this court noted in <em>NRDC v. Train, </em>166 U.S.App.D.C. 312, 333, 510 F.2d 692, 713 (1975) (footnotes omitted):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1110-19\">We think the court may forebear the issuance of an order in those cases where it is convinced by the official involved that he has in good faith employed the utmost diligence in discharging his statutory responsibilities.

The statutory alternative is federal administration. It is thus incongru<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1043\">*1043</page-number>ous to suggest that a state OSHA plan must have \u201cnecessary\u201d personnel and \u201cadequate\u201d enforcement funds which are substantially in excess of what the alternative federal administration would afford.</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-4\">Such being the intent of the Act and Congress being its author, it is proper to gauge what Congress considered to be \u201cnecessary\u201d and \u201cadequate\u201d for state administration by what amounts Congress has made available for the alternative federal administration.</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-5\">The present lawsuit is overly ambitious and seeks extreme relief. Its objective is to wrap up the entire nation in one ball of wax and get a nationwide decree declaring how many inspections each state shall have and what sums each state shall appropriate for administration and enforcement. Raising issues in such a broad context prevents careful consideration of the basic problems. To my mind the largest approach should be on a state-by-state basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-6\">The scheme of the Act requires safety and health standards for particular hazards and these, which involve industrial activity and states of varying geographical size, differ greatly throughout the nation. The establishment of \u201cdisparate\u201d numbers of inspectors in various states is thus a necessary fact of life. For a court to impose proper generalized personnel requirements for each state in the nation is a practical impossibility. A great deal of discretion must be left to federal and state administrators. Our task in this case is rendered more onerous by the fact that appellants are basically attacking the approval by the Secretary of some 25 state plans; but the record is devoid of the relevant facts with respect to the separate states. Under such circumstances, it is my view that the proper relief would be to remand the case for a more definite statement by appellants, order the necessary discovery, and thus develop some concrete facts upon which to determine whether the action of the Secretary has, or has not, been arbitrary and capricious. But the issues on that basis would be almost unmanageable. Thus, I join in Judge Leventhal\u2019s opinion which calls for action that is moulded in the vein in which the Secretary states he has been approaching the problems.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
