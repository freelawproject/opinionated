Pierce, Judge,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> plaintiff David E. Rolf (Rolf) endorses the district court\u2019s holding on questions of liability, but challenges the district court\u2019s measure of damages. Defendants in turn attack the district court\u2019s theories of liability. In the court below, Judge Pierce imposed aiding and abetting liability on defendant Michael Stott (Stott) and derivative liability on his employer, Blyth, Eastman Dillon &amp; Co., Inc. (BEDCO), for Stott\u2019s substantial assistance to and participation in a web of securities fraud perpetrated by defendant Akiyoshi Yamada (Yamada),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> contrary to \u00a7 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (SEA), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78j(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.10(b)-5. Judge Pierce also implied a private cause of action under New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) Rule 405 and under Article III, Section 2 of the constitution of the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD). The Judge then awarded damages and interest totaling $55,790. We agree with Judge Pierce on the aiding and abetting liability of Stott. We therefore affirm as to him and in view of BEDCO\u2019s acknowledgment for purposes of this appeal that it is vicariously liable by reason of Section 20 of the 1934 Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78t(a), affirm also as to it. Brief for Defendants-Appellees-Cross-Appellants at 28n.*. Accordingly, we do not reach the question whether there is an implied cause of action under the NYSE rule or the NASD constitution. We disagree with Judge Pierce on the measure of damages, however, and accordingly remand for reconsideration thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-15\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b109-16\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b109-17\">Rolf is an ophthalmologist from Shaker Heights, Ohio. Long an investor and an aggressive trader in the stock market, he began his association with Eastman Dillon Union Securities &amp; Co., BEDCO\u2019s predecessor firm, in 1963 when he entrusted a discretionary account to S. Logan Stirling, a partner of the firm. The value of Rolf\u2019s portfolio at that time was approximately $400,000. In March of 1969 Stirling was forced to retire owing to ill health. At the end of April, a BEDCO partner assigned the Rolf account to Stott, a registered representative with the firm for 11 years during 4 of which he was a manager of BED-CO branch offices. Stott then telephoned Rolf and offered his services. Rolf, however, wanted an investment advisor to manage his account, not simply a broker. Stott, therefore, at Rolf\u2019s request, supplied the names of two investment advisors. Rolf ultimately interviewed and selected Yama-da, one of the \u201cnew breed\u201d of young mon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>ey-managers with supposed expertise in research and \u201cspecial situations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">The district court found that Rolfs investment intent was to combine Yamada\u2019s and Stott\u2019s strengths into a \u201cStirling-type\u201d operation, 424 F.Supp. 1021, 1028 (1977). By combining Yamada\u2019s youth and zeal with Stott\u2019s reliability and supervision, Rolf hoped to realize, as he had with Stirling\u2019s advice, substantial capital gain in an investment program emphasizing preservation and augmentation of capital. In furtherance of these investment objectives, Rolf executed a broad authorization giving his investment advisor, Yamada, full trading discretion. Rolf left the account and its accompanying trading commissions with Stott and BEDCO in return for Stott\u2019s supervision of Yamada.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">On May 9, 1969, the date of the trading authorization, Rolf\u2019s equity in his portfolio stood at $1,423,000. The portfolio consisted of 21 good quality, listed securities and the warrants of two companies.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> By January of 1970 Yamada had liquidated the entire portfolio, selling 14 issues at a loss. The net value of Rolf\u2019s portfolio had declined to approximately $712,000 of which $338,000 was invested in the restricted stock of Dela-nair, Inc.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> During this period of portfolio liquidation. Yamada and Stott were in daily contact. The district court found that out of 41 issues purchased for Rolf in the complaint period Stott \u201ceither recommended or was somehow involved with the decision to purchase\u201d 12 securities, some of which were highly speculative. <em>Id. </em>at 1030.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">With the rash of new, unfamiliar securities which found their way into Rolf\u2019s portfolio, Rolf became concerned and sought assurances from Stott as early as July, 1969. Specifically Rolf wished to ascertain that Yamada\u2019s purchases were consistent with the former\u2019s investment goals and strategy. To assuage Rolf\u2019s fears, the district court found, Stott undertook a hand-holding operation whereby Stott would reassure Rolf of Yamada\u2019s competence whenever Rolf questioned it. <em>Id. </em>at 1031. For example, when in August, 1969, Yamada decided to purchase nearly $400,000 in Dela-nair stock, Rolf checked with Stott who assured the doctor that if Yamada recommended the stock, then it was safe to proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-11\">By March 29, 1970, the value of Rolf\u2019s portfolio had dropped to $446,000 of which nearly one-half was tied up in Delanair. In early April, Rolf complained to Stott who began to assume the posture that he was a mere \u201corder taker.\u201d Rolf disagreed with this self-description, asking Stott to \u201cwork closely with Aki,\u201d and reminded Stott that Stott was his \u201cman in N.Y.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1032\u2014 33. Later, on December 14, 1970, Rolf again asked Stott to \u201ckeep [his] pulse on the situation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b110-12\">The district court discredited Stott\u2019s testimony that he was not involved in the management of Rolf\u2019s portfolio specifically finding that Stott was in fact so enmeshed. <em>Id. </em>at 1028, 1030, 1031. Stott and Yamada were in daily contact. Stott made numerous recommendations to Yamada for Rolf accounts using BEDCO research analysis, <em>id. </em>at 1030, but never counseled against a Yamada purchase. <em>Id. </em>at 1033. And most <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>of the trades were executed through Stott at BEDCO. For those stocks purchased through other brokerage houses, because of BEDCO internal rules, Stott received confirmation slips. Additionally, such securities were delivered to and held by BEDCO.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">The district court\u2019s finding on the question of Stott\u2019s attitude toward the quality of the purchases is not altogether clear. The lower court states on the one hand that it gives <em>\u201csome </em>weight to Yamada\u2019s statement that Stott referred to the stocks in the Rolf account as \u2018junk,\u2019 \u201d <em>i.e., </em>of very low quality. <em>Id. </em>at 1033 (emphasis added). But the Judge goes on to conclude \u201cthat Stott did indeed consider many of the securities to be \u2018junk\u2019 and that he told this to Yama-da.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">The district court unequivocally found, however, that Yamada was engaged in fraudulent stock manipulations, of which Stott was ignorant. The district court also concluded unambiguously that Yamada\u2019s overall management of the account was fraudulent in nature, over and above the specific manipulations of which Stott was unaware. <em>Id. </em>at 1043. Stott was of course knowledgeable that many of the securities purchased for Rolf were highly speculative, \u201chigh-fliers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1035. Nevertheless, neither Stott nor BEDCO ever identified any security as unsuitable for Rolf. <em>Id. </em>at 1036. Stott\u2019s services to Rolf consisted solely of certain \u201cbuy\u201d recommendations, executing transactions and performing the accompanying paperwork. The court concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-7\">Stott\u2019s practice of continually voicing his confidence in Yamada and in Yamada\u2019s investment decisions constituted a fraud upon Dr. Rolf, who sincerely believed that Stott had some basis for his statements. The statements of support and the assurances which were repeatedly made were made with willful and reckless disregard for whether they were true or false.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b111-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 1042.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b111-12\">District Court Holding</p>\n<p id=\"b111-13\">The district court based liability on alternative legal theories. The first was that Stott owed a fiduciary duty to Rolf which he breached; that by virtue of that breach Stott aided and abetted Yamada\u2019s fraud and was therefore liable under \u00a7 10(b) of the SEA, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78j(b), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.10(b)-5; and that BEDCO\u2019s liability for Stott\u2019s participation in Yamada\u2019s fraud derives alternatively from the common law doctrine of respon-deat superior or the securities law doctrine of controlling persons liability, \u00a7 20(a), SEA, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78t(a). The district court also rested liability on an implied private cause of action from violations of NYSE Rule 405 and the NASD constitution, Article III, Section 2.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Judge then awarded damages of $55,790, on a \u201cchurning\u201d theory, even though he dismissed plaintiff\u2019s churning claim, on the ground that any other measure of damages would be \u201cspeculative.\u201d 424 F.Supp. at 1045.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-14\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b111-15\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b111-16\">At the outset, we note that the evidence in this ease against Stott, while not overwhelming, is substantial. We are bound by the district court\u2019s findings, as we discern them, on the basis of the clearly erroneous rule. Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a); <em>see United States Steel and Carnegie Pension </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number><em>Fund, Inc. v. Orenstein, </em>557 F.2d 343 (2d Cir. 1977) (sub silentio). We have held on countless occasions that on review of district court findings, \u201cwe may not substitute our judgment on facts for that of the trial judge, who was in a superior position to appraise the evidence, and we may not reverse his findings unless, on the entire record, we are \u201c \u2018 \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Zenith Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine Research, Inc., </em>395 U.S. 100, 123 [89 S.Ct. 1562, 23 L.Ed.2d 129] (1969), <em>quoting United States v. United States Gypsum Co., </em>333 U.S. 364, 395 [68 S.Ct. 525, 92 L.Ed. 746] (1948).\u201d <em>Van Alen v. Dominick &amp; Dominick, Inc., </em>560 F.2d 547, 550 (2d Cir. 1977). This is true because the trial judge is particularly able to assess the demeanor and credibility of witnesses. <em>Id. </em>at 551; <em>see Newburger, Loeb &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Gross, </em>563 F.2d 1057, at 1070 (2d Cir. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">Liability</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">\n<em>A. Stott</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">There is no doubt that Yamada perpetrated a gross fraud upon Rolf in violation of \u00a7 10(b) and Rule 10b-5. We conclude that Stott, by virtue of assurances of confidence in Yamada and in Yamada\u2019s investment decisions and by virtue of his reckless disregard of whether those assurances were true or false and of substantial evidence that Yamada was improperly and fraudulently managing Rolf\u2019s account, participated in and lent assistance to the fraud upon Dr. Rolf. The reasoning which leads us to this conclusion follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">1. <em>Reckless disregard of truth or falsity as constituting scienter. </em>The starting point is <em>Ernst &amp; Ernst v. Hochfelder, </em>425 U.S. 185, 96 S.Ct. 1375, 47 L.Ed.2d 668 (1976). In <em>Hochfelder, </em>the Supreme Court explicitly failed to decide whether \u00a7 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 may, in appropriate circumstances, give rise to aiding and abetting liability and, if so, the elements of such a cause of action. <em>Id. </em>at 192 n. 7, 96 S.Ct. 1375. Although the Supreme Court has, therefore, not passed on the issue, our court has adopted the position that \u00a7 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 do permit the imposition of aiding and abetting liability. <em>Hirsch v. DuPont, </em>553 F.2d 750, 759 (2d Cir. 1977); <em>see Brennan v. Midwestern United Life Insurance Co., </em>417 F.2d 147 (7th Cir. 1969), <em>cert. denied, </em>397 U.S. 989, 90 S.Ct. 1122, 25 L.Ed.2d 397 (1970); Note, <em>Accountants\u2019 Liabilities for False and Misleading Financial Statements, </em>67 Colum.L.Rev. 1437, 1448 (1967). Of course, the basic holding of <em>Hochfeider, </em>that scienter is an element of the \u00a7 10(b)/Rule 10b-5 cause of action,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> also establishes the standard for aiding and abetting liability.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b112-13\">The question then becomes precisely what level of scienter is required in this type of 10b-5 case and whether the district court\u2019s findings indicate that plaintiff\u2019s proof satisfies that standard. We conclude on one of the questions left open by <em>Hochfelder, </em>428 U.S. at 194 n. 12, 96 S.Ct. 1375, that at least where, as here, the alleged aider and abettor owes a fiduciary duty to the defrauded party,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> recklessness satisfies the scienter requirement. We arrive at this conclusion for several reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-14\">First, by leaving open the possibility that recklessness might satisfy the scienter requirement, the Supreme Court recognized that in certain instances a recklessness standard might be appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"ap-dedup-0\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number><em>See Sundstrand Corp. v. Sun Chemical Corp., </em>553 F.2d 1033, 1044 (7th Cir. 1977) (\u201cno hint in <em>Hochfelder </em>that the Court intended a radical departure from\u201d common law analogue of fraud which imposes liability for reckless behavior), <em>cert. </em>denied, - U.S. -, 98 S.Ct. 225, 54 L.Ed.2d 155 (1977). The relationship most logically subjected to a recklessness standard, rather than some stricter standard involving proof of intent to defraud, is where the aider and abettor owes a direct fiduciary duty to the defrauded party. <em>See Woodward v. Metro Bank of Dallas, </em>522 F.2d 84, 97 (5th Cir. 1975). Liability premised on the recklessness of one\u2019s fiduciary in failing to perform his duty to disclose is a far cry from awarding damages for simple negligence. <em>See Ernst &amp; Ernst v. Hochfelder, supra. </em>Clearly, Stott, as Rolf\u2019s broker, owed Rolf a fiduciary duty. <em>See Hanly v. SEC, </em>415 F.2d 589, 596, 597 (2d Cir. 1969).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">Second, on a linguistic level, the term scienter<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> is used by the Supreme Court to mean, in the disjunctive, \u201cknowing or intentional misconduct.\u201d 425 U.S. at 197, 96 S.Ct. 1375.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Use of the word knowing\u201d implies conduct which is somewhat less directed and focused than \u201cintentional\u201d activity which commonly is characterized by a specific mental state whose animus is to bring about a particular result, see W. Prosser, Law of <em>Torts </em>\u00a7 107, at 700 (4th ed. 1971). \u201cKnowing\u201d is a word laden with common law connotations: at common law, reckless conduct is viewed as a form of knowing conduct. <em>Id. </em>at 701. For example, the common law requirement of scienter as an element of the tort of deceit or misrepresentation may be proved in a number of ways: <em>ii</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-12\">There is of course no difficulty in finding the required intent to mislead where it appears that the speaker believes his statement to be false. Likewise, there is general agreement that it is present when the representation is made without any belief as to its truth, or with reckless disregard whether it be true or false.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b113-13\"><em>Id. </em>(footnotes omitted). It is unquestionable that the common law has served as an interpretive source of securities law concepts. <em>See Holdsworth v. Strong, </em>545 F.2d 687, 693-94 (10th Cir. 1976), <em>cert. denied, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>430 U.S. 955, 97 S.Ct. 1600, 51 L.Ed.2d 805 (1977). The common law tort of fraud has adopted a recklessness standard as one means of satisfying the requisite intent element of that cause of action.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Similarly, securities law cases have recognized that recklessness may serve as a surrogate concept for willful fraud. Concurring in <em>SEC v. Texas Gulf Sulphur Co., </em>401 F.2d 833, 868 (2d Cir. 1968) (en banc), <em>cert. denied sub nom. Coates v. SEC, </em>394 U.S. 976, 89 S.Ct. 1454, 22 L.Ed.2d 756 (1969), Judge Friendly noted the distinction between a \u201cmerely negligent misstatement\u201d and \u201cthe kind of recklessness that is equivalent to wilful fraud.\u201d <em>See </em>Haimoff, <em>Holmes Looks at </em>Hochfelder <em>and </em>10b-5, 32 Bus.Law 147, 162 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">Third, it is consistent with, if not demanded by, precedent in this circuit<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> to hold that reckless conduct satisfies the scienter requirement. <em>See Lanza v. Drexel &amp; Co., </em>479 F.2d 1277, 1306 (2d Cir. 1973) (en banc); <em>Shemtob v. Shearson Hammill &amp; Co., </em>448 F.2d 442, 445 (2d Cir. 1971); Bucklo, <em>The Supreme Court Attempts to Define Scienter Under Rule 10b-5: Ernst &amp; Ernst v. Hochfelder, </em>29 Stan.L.Rev. 213, 214 (1977). <em>Lanza v. Drexel, supra, </em>of course required scienter as an element of a 10b-5 cause of action prior to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Hochfelder. </em>The <em>Lanza </em>test was stated in terms of \u201cwillful or <em>reckless </em>disregard for the truth,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1306 (emphasis added), thereby recognizing that either intentional or reckless behavior is the predicate mental state for 10b-5 liability. The <em>Hochfelder </em>Court noted that a number of courts of appeals \u201chave held that some type of <em>scienter </em>\u2014 i. <em>e., </em>intent to defraud, reckless disregard for the truth, or knowing use of some practice to defraud \u2014 is necessary in such an action\u201d and then cited <em>inter alia </em>our decision in <em>Lanza, </em>425 U.S. at 194 n. 12, 96 S.Ct. at 1381. Thus, on balance, we consider that <em>Hochfelder </em>left intact our rule that recklessness is a form of scienter in appropriate circumstances.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>A final basis for applying a recklessness standard in certain instances rests perhaps on the practical problem of proof in private enforcement under the securities laws. Proof of a defendant\u2019s knowledge or intent will often be inferential, see Ruder, <em>Multiple Defendants in Securities Law Fraud Cases : Aiding and Abetting, Conspiracy </em>in Pari Delicto, <em>Indemnification, and Contribution, </em>120 U.Pa.L.Rev. 597, 635 (1972), and cases thus of necessity cast in terms of recklessness. To require in all types of 10b-5 cases that a factfinder must find a specific intent to deceive or defraud would for all intents and purposes disembowel the private cause of action under \u00a7 10(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">2. <em>Other elements of aiding and abetting liability. </em>Given, then, that we find aider and abettor liability appropriate under \u00a7 10(b) and given that we believe at the very least that fiduciaries have acted with scienter when they have been reckless, we pass to the other well-established elements of the aiding and abetting cause of action. The first element that a plaintiff must prove is that the primary party, here Yamada, as distinguished from the secondary aiding and abetting party, committed a securities law violation. <em>Woodward v. Metro Bank of Dallas, supra, </em>522 F.2d at 95; <em>see SEC v. Coffey, </em>493 F.2d 1304, 1316 (6th Cir. 1974), <em>cert. denied, </em>420 U.S. 908, 95 S.Ct. 826, 42 L.Ed.2d 837 (1975); <em>cf. Landy v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., </em>486 F.2d 139, 162 (3d Cir. 1973) (requiring \u201cindependent wrong\u201d instead of independent securities law violation), <em>cert. denied, </em>416 U.S. 960, 94 S.Ct. 1979, 40 L.Ed.2d 312 (1974). The district court found, and we see no basis for concluding otherwise, that Yamada\u2019s overall management of the account in violation of his fiduciary duties owed by reason of the investment advisory agreement was fraudulent. 424 F.Supp. at 1043. Indeed the district court called Yamada\u2019s handling of the account a \u201cgross fraud.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Moreover, Stott and BEDCO in their brief acknowledge that Yamada committed securities fraud. Their very purpose is to point the finger at Yamada in order to exonerate Stott. Brief for Defendants-Appellees-Cross-Appellants at 28, 34, 42, 44, 47. There is therefore no reason to analyze Rolf\u2019s portfolio on a stock by stock basis to determine which purchases and sales constituted frauds upon Rolf, a more specific and particularized investigation which we might have to undertake if Yamada had merely manipulated two or three stocks without engaging in a more exhaustive and all-encompassing web of fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">The second requirement for establishing the aiding and abetting violation is Stott\u2019s knowledge of Yamada\u2019s fraud. We have indicated above that the scienter element may be satisfied by proof of reckless conduct. While the evidence in this case is not overwhelming, we believe it is sufficient to sustain Judge Pierce\u2019s findings on the basis of the clearly erroneous rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-9\">Reckless conduct is, at the least, conduct which is \u201chighly unreasonable\u201d and which represents \u201can extreme departure from the standards of ordinary care . to the extent that the danger was either known to the defendant or so obvious that the defendant must have been aware of it.\u201d <em>Sanders v. John Nuveen &amp; Co., </em>554 F.2d 790, 793 (7th Cir. 1977).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Stott was aware that the quality of the securities being purchased by Yamada was very low. The daily contact between Stott and Yamada gave Stott ample opportunity to supervise the investment advisor, an obligation which the lower court found Rolf had sought and Stott had undertaken to perform. Stott\u2019s most egregious breach of his duty to Rolf was his constant reassurance that Yamada knew what he was doing and that if Yamada were purchasing stocks they must be satisfactory. These representations were conclusorily made to Rolf without investigation and with utter disregard for whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>there was a basis for the assertions. \u201cA representation certified as true when knowledge there is none, a reckless misstatement, or an opinion based on grounds so flimsy as to lead to the conclusion that there was no genuine belief in its truth, are all sufficient upon which to base liability.\u201d <em>State Street Co. v. Ernst, </em>278 N.Y. 104, 112, 15 N.E.2d 416, 418-19 (1938). Stott\u2019s representations and opinions were given without basis and in reckless disregard of their truth or falsity.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">The third and final requirement to establish the aiding and abetting violation is that Stott rendered substantial assistance to Yamada in the fraudulent mismanagement of Rolf\u2019s portfolio. One commentator has suggested that substantial assistance might include \u201crepeating . . . misrepresentations (or aiding in their preparation), by acting as conduits to accumulate or distribute securities, by executing transactions or investing proceeds, or perhaps by financing transactions.\u201d 2 A. Bromberg, <em>Securities Law </em>\u00a7 8.5 (515) (1974). In this case, Stott\u2019s assistance was both active and passive. He processed many of the relevant securities orders; he reassured Rolf of Ya-mada\u2019s competence; and he either recklessly failed to learn of or failed to disclose Yamada\u2019s web of fraud. <em>See Woodward v. Metro Bank of Dallas, supra, </em>522 F.2d at 96-97. The effect of Stott\u2019s \u201chand-holding operation\u201d was to prevent Rolf from discovering Yamada\u2019s fraud. Stott\u2019s acts, therefore, were a substantial causal factor in the perpetuation of Yamada\u2019s fraud and in the cumulation of Rolf\u2019s losses. <em>See Lan-dy v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., supra, </em>486 F.2d at 163. We therefore affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment to the extent that it found Stott an aider and abettor of Yamada\u2019s fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-8\">\n<em>B. BEDCO</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b116-9\">While there is disagreement among the circuits<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and, perhaps, even disharmony within the Second Circuit<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> on the relationship between \u00a7 20(a) of the 1934 Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78t(a), and the common law doctrine of respondeat superior, BEDCO has conceded \u201cfor the purposes of this appeal\u201d that if Stott is found liable it is vicariously liable under Section 20, even though the decision below stated that \u201cBEDCO did not have actual notice of the fraud.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b116-10\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b116-11\">Damages</p>\n<p id=\"b116-12\">We are not capable of precisely measuring Rolf\u2019s damages on this appeal, although we do not think that they were so speculative as to compel resort solely to damages as in a churning case, for commissions paid the broker (and interest thereon). Accordingly, we remand to the district court to determine damages in accordance with the guidelines set forth below.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>First, the district court should determine as near as possible the time when Stott began to aid and abet Yamada\u2019s fraud<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and compute the market value of Rolf\u2019s portfolio on that date. Second, the district court should subtract the value of the portfolio on the date when Stott\u2019s participation in and assistance to the fraudulent scheme ceased from the value on the date when Stott became an aider and abettor. This amount is Rolf\u2019s gross economic loss.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Note, <em>Churning by Securities Dealers, </em>80 Harv.L.Rev. 869, 884 (1967). The district court should then reduce Rolf\u2019s gross economic loss by the average percentage decline in value of the Dow Jones Industrials, the Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s Index, or any other well recognized index of value, or combination of indices, of the national securities markets during the period commencing with Stott\u2019s aiding and abetting and terminating with its cessation.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Thus if during the relevant period the stock market declined in value by 25%, then Rolf\u2019s gross economic loss should be reduced by 25%. Because plaintiff\u2019s theory of liability is to the effect that Stott\u2019s aiding and abetting prevented Rolf\u2019s discovery of Yamada\u2019s fraud, it is not fair to reduce damages any further by the amount of loss on a discrete transaction to which Stott had no connection because he did not execute the transaction, recommend the security, or reassure Rolf with respect to that security.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> However, should the loss on the Delanair stock <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>be determined to have occurred during the aiding and abetting period, Rolfs damages must be reduced by $175,000, the amount for which he settled his claims against several Delanair-related defendants. We also hold that Rolf is entitled to a return of commissions paid to Stott and BEDCO, but only as to transactions falling within the aiding and abetting period, with interest thereon as determined by the district judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">Finally, we request the district judge to reconsider his decision on the question of prejudgment interest in view of our obvious conclusion that Rolf was deprived of a principal sum. <em>See Nelson v. Hench, </em>428 F.Supp. 411 (D.Minn.1977). While such an award is a matter of judicial discretion, <em>Blau </em>v. <em>Lehman, </em>368 U.S. 403, 414, 82 S.Ct. 451, 7 L.Ed.2d 403 (1962); <em>Norte &amp; Co. v.

That language states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-9\">Use of the word \u201cmanipulative\u201d is especially significant.

The <em>Hochfelder </em>opinion also noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-15\">Although the extensive legislative history of the 1934 Act is bereft of any explicit explanation of Congress\u2019 intent, we think the relevant portions of that history support our conclusion that \u00a7 10(b) was addressed to practices that involve <em>some element of scienter </em>and cannot be read to impose liability <em>for negligent conduct alone.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b113-16\">425 U.S. at 201, 96 S.Ct. at 1385 (emphasis added). The Court seems to have recognized that scienter is not a rigid concept encompassing only the definitive intent to accomplish a specific purpose.

Adoption of a recklessness standard in this case does not result in liability for \u201cwholly faultless conduct\u201d and thereby does not impede an important policy of \u00a7 10(b) and Rule 10b-15 as recognized in <em>Hochfelder.

At the outset of Yamada\u2019s stewardship, they were of generally high quality. If the district judge should determine that, when the aiding and abetting period began, the quality of stocks in the portfolio was such that a broad-based index would not be representative of those stocks, then he may select a more appropriate gauge, perhaps a portion of an index, perhaps a composite of indices, perhaps expert opinion. <em>See generally, </em>Mullaney, <em>supra </em>note 21, at 288-90.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b117-15\">.

Hochfelder, </em>425 U.S. 185, 96 S.Ct. 1375, 47 L.Ed.2d 668 (1976), but also overlooks findings below and undisputed evidence that foreclose Rule 10b-5 liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-11\">With regard to the \u201cfraud\u201d by Yamada that Stott is held to have aided and abetted, Judge Pierce found, and the majority here seems to agree, that \u201cStott did not know of the direct frauds which Yamada was perpetrating on Rolf\u201d \u2014 such as the investment adviser\u2019s manipulation of the public market price of certain securities obtained for Rolf\u2019s account and the use of the purchasing power of that account to make purchases of securities that might improve the price for others. Nor is there any basis for a finding that Stott shut his eyes to any such manipulation or use of Rolf\u2019s account to help others. Indeed, it is undisputed that at all pertinent times Yamada\u2019s reputation as an investment adviser was excellent and his successful accomplishments in the trade were well known. Even on the majority\u2019s \u201caiding and abetting\u201d theory, therefore, Stott could not be held responsible for Ya-mada\u2019s manipulations, since they were not known to Stott and would not have been readily apparent upon exercise of due diligence, including compliance with New York Stock Exchange Rule 405 (\u201cknow your customer\u201d rule).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-12\">Because even the majority concedes that \u201cStott was ignorant\u201d of Yamada\u2019s \u201cstock manipulations,\u201d it becomes important to determine what was the fraud \u201caided and abetted\u201d by Stott through some \u201creckless disregard\u201d on his part. The majority opin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>ion, making precious little mention of any frauds committed by Yamada, fails completely to describe or analyze the specific fraud or frauds that were furthered by Stott other than to suggest that they were \u201cYamada\u2019s investment decisions\u201d and his conversion of Dr. Rolf\u2019s portfolio into securities that were highly speculative and of very low quality compared with the type of securities that had been there when the account had been managed directly by Mr. Stirling of BEDCO. What the district court labelled \u201ctantamount to fraud\u201d \u2014 Yamada\u2019s investment of Rolf\u2019s account in unsuitable securities, so-called \u201chigh fliers,\u201d \u201cjunk,\u201d or \u201clow quality\u201d issues \u2014 is characterized by the majority in conclusory fashion as part of \u201ca more exhaustive and all-encompassing web of fraud.\u201d The majority\u2019s forbidding label cannot alter the fact that, when this case is stripped of the brooding omnipresence of Yamada\u2019s flagrant manipulations as it must be, nothing remains but an unfocused allegation that Stott lulled Rolf into acquiescence in Yamada\u2019s investment of his account in unsuitable securities. To hold that he thereby aided and abetted a Rule 10b-5 \u201cfraud\u201d is to confuse the common law duties of fiduciaries or accountants, see, e. g., <em>Ultramares Corp. v. Touche, </em>255 N.Y. 170, 190, 174 N.E. 441, 449 (1931), with the limited prohibitions of \u00a7 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 against the use of any \u201cmanipulative or deceptive device or contrivance\u201d in the purchase or sale of securities.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">Even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the investment of a customer\u2019s funds in unsuitable securities could on occasion rise to the level of Rule 10b-5 fraud, the majority errs in concluding that Stott\u2019s conduct, principally his assurances regarding Yamada\u2019s competency as investment counsel, coupled with Stott\u2019s personal belief that some of the investments were \u201cjunk,\u201d establishes recklessness equivalent to an intentional and deliberate participation in or aiding and abetting of such \u201cfraud.\u201d In my view this determination violates fundamental principles established by the Supreme Court in <em>Ernst &amp; Ernst v. Hochfelder, </em>supra, and stems from an erroneous concept of \u201crecklessness\u201d or \u201creckless disregard\u201d of material facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">In <em>Hochfelder </em>the Court reversed a decision of the Seventh Circuit which had held \u201cthat one who breaches a duty of inquiry and disclosure owed another is liable in damages for <em>aiding and abetting </em>a third party\u2019s violation of Rule 10b-5 if the fraud would have been discovered or prevented but for the breach. 503 F.2d 1100 (1974).\u201d 425 U.S. at 191, 96 S.Ct. at 1380 (emphasis added). The Supreme Court held that proof of scienter, i. e., an \u201cintent to deceive, manipulate or defraud,\u201d was essential and that this element was not satisfied by proof of negligence or breach of a duty to inquire. It left open the \u201cquestion whether, in some circumstances, reckless behavior\u201d might be treated as the equivalent of scienter, 425 U.S. at 194 n. 12, 96 S.Ct. at 1381.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">While <em>Hochfelder </em>did not clarify entirely the meaning of scienter, it did make clear that the failure of a fiduciary or accountant to fulfill a \u201ccommon-law and statutory duty of inquiry,\u201d 425 U.S. at 192, 96 S.Ct. at 1380, which would reveal fraud on someone else\u2019s part, is not without more the equivalent of scienter as defined by the Court. Since <em>Hochfelder </em>we have reiterated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ABp\">\u201c . . . before [a party] can be held liable as an aider and abetter, there must be a showing that [such a party]: (a) knew of the investment adviser-client relationship; (b) had knowledge of the fraud; and (c) acted in concert with the investment adviser. Cf. <em>Ernst &amp; Ernst v. Hochfelder, </em>425 U.S. 185 [96 S.Ct. 1375, 47 L.Ed.2d 668] (1976).\u201d <em>Abrahamson v. Fleschner, </em>568 F.2d 862, at 871-872 n. 16 (2d Cir. 1977).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b119-9\">See also <em>Hirsch </em>v. <em>du Pont, </em>553 F.2d 750, 759 (2d Cir. 1977) (\u201cknowing assistance of or participation in a fraudulent scheme gives rise to liability under \u00a7 10(b) as an aider and abettor . . . knowledge of the fraud ... is indispensable\u201d); <em>Kerbs v. Fall River Indus., Inc., </em>502 F.2d 731, 739-40 (10th Cir. 1974); <em>SEC v. Coffey, </em>493 F.2d 1304, 1316 (6th Cir. 1974), <em>cert. denied, </em>420 U.S. 908, 95 S.Ct. 826, 42 L.Ed.2d 837 (1975). Accordingly, in my view, before \u201creckless disregard\u201d may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>equated to scienter, there must be a showing that the party charged with violation of Rule 10b-5 deliberately shut his eyes to the obvious, such as material facts that would be patent upon a mere cursory examination or review.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Failure to conduct an investigation \u2014 even if required by one\u2019s status as a fiduciary \u2014 will not suffice.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">Judged by this standard, the facts as stated by the majority fail to support a conclusion that Stott participated in any fraud with the scienter required by <em>Hoch-felder. </em>As proof that Stott \u201crendered substantial assistance to Yamada in [his fraud],\u201d the majority relies upon Stott\u2019s processing of Yamada\u2019s securities orders given pursuant to his discretionary authorization from Rolf, Stott\u2019s representations to Rolf to the effect that Rolf could depend on his adviser\u2019s judgment, and Stott\u2019s failure to disclose Yamada\u2019s fraud (i. e., the purchase of low-grade securities). However, the majority is vague as to how any of this conduct can be said to have been undertaken with the \u201creckless disregard\u201d that must be treated as the equivalent of knowledge of Yamada\u2019s fraud. Apparently, the theory of the majority opinion is that Stott\u2019s continuing expressions of confidence in Yamada and his willingness to accept the adviser\u2019s orders were reckless in view of his \u201c[awareness] that the quality of the securities being purchased by Yamada was very low.\u201d The opinion describes Stott\u2019s reassurances regarding Rolf\u2019s reliability as having been made \u201cconclusorily . . . without investigation and with utter disregard for whether there was a basis for the assertions.\u201d Likewise, it states that Stott \u201ceither recklessly failed to learn of or failed to disclose Yamada\u2019s web of fraud\u201d \u2014 again referring only to the purchase of unsuitable securities. However, even conceding that Stott believed some or many of Yamada\u2019s purchases to be \u201cjunk\u201d, it would have required a considerable investigation for him to determine whether Yamada\u2019s widely-recognized reputation for brilliance was unwarranted or whether the ratio of risk to return on Rolf\u2019s portfolio as a whole was consonant with the doctor\u2019s investment objectives. A failure to perform such an investigation without more does not, after <em>Hochfelder, </em>establish scienter.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-8\">Sympathetic as I am to vigorous enforcement of the antifraud provisions of our federal securities laws, I cannot subscribe to a process of extrapolation, approved by the majority opinion, whereby Yamada\u2019s investment of Rolf\u2019s account in unsuitable securities is elevated to the level of Rule 10b-5 fraud and Stott\u2019s personal belief that some of the investments were \u201cjunk\u201d is recognized as a sufficient basis for concluding that he acted with scienter. Reasoning along these lines, the majority has ended up with a holding that is virtually indistinguishable from that reversed in <em>Hochfelder. </em>A broker (Stott) is held liable under Rule 10b-5 for negligence in failing to make an adequate inquiry into the investments recommended by the plaintiff\u2019s investment adviser (Yamada), who turned out to be dishonest even though widely acclaimed as a competent and successful investment adviser at the time. In short, stripped of its conclusory characterizations, the majority opinion would barely make out a case of negligence on the part of Stott, much less one of his deliberately shutting his eyes to facts that would have revealed the \u201cfraud\u201d on Yamada\u2019s part. When additional lower court findings and undisputed evidence, unmentioned or glossed over by the majority, are taken into account, the failure to make out a case of \u201cfraud\u201d based on unsuitable investments or aiding and abetting of that fraud by recklessness becomes apparent. In the first place, Dr. Rolf was no novice or \u201cbabe in the woods\u201d in the investment field. He had had 19 years of experience, includ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>ing 10 years completely on his own, during which he was his own adviser and the supervisor of various trading accounts maintained by him with several different Cleveland brokers. Having tasted success in the predominantly bull market of the 1950s and 1960s, Rolf had advised Stirling of BEDCO as early as June, 1967, that his \u201cobjective [was] to double my equity\u201d and told Yama-da as late as September 1970 (after the value of his portfolio had greatly declined, principally because of investments made by Yamada), \u201cAs you recall, we started out with roughly $2,000,000 of Securities which could be used for trading. ... It was my impression that we would wind up with 3.5 to 5 million in a year\u2019s time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">The picture that emerges from these and other statements made by Rolf is one of a sophisticated investor in securities who was well aware of the difference between gilt-edge, relatively safe securities, on the one hand, and speculative \u201chigh fliers,\u201d on the other, and who had determined to get richer quick by choosing an aggressive program involving high-risk, OTC stocks in the hope that his adviser would succeed in picking a few big winners, but well aware of the pitfalls that were involved.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">From this record it is small wonder that when introduced by Stott to a couple of prospective investment advisers, whom he personally interviewed, he chose 26-year old Yamada, \u201cone of the \u2018new breed\u2019 of young money-managers who had emerged as highly successful in the stock market\u201d during the late 1960s by dealing in special situations, mutual funds, new issues, hedge funds and assorted speculative ventures.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Rolf\u2019s correspondence discloses that he could hardly be classified as a naive, trusting person of limited intelligence looking for safe investments designed to yield substantial income and security. Rolf testified that he \u201cwanted somebody other than Stott\u201d to handle his account. In short, he <em>wanted </em>to gamble on some \u201chigh fliers\u201d and for this he looked to Yamada, not Stott. Indeed, Rolf never even met Stott in person until October, 1970, some 17 months after Rolf had selected Yamada as his investment adviser. By that time Rolf\u2019s portfolio had declined in market value from $1,423,000 to approximately $223,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-11\">The tenuousness of holding Stott liable as an aider and abettor is further underscored by the anomalous nature of his responsibilities toward Rolf, once Rolf had chosen Yamada rather than BEDCO to advise him as to his investments. The oral Rolf-Stott arrangement, according to Judge Pierce\u2019s findings, was that while Yamada alone would have discretionary responsibility with respect to what was to be bought and sold for Rolf\u2019s account, Stott would \u201csupervise his [Rolf\u2019s] account and Rolf understood that Stott was to look after his interests.\u201d In such a context the role of overseer, in the absence of some fixed written delineation of authority and responsibility, borders on the meaningless.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It is an elementary market fact, which should be judicially noticeable, that since there are literally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>thousands of business ventures traded on various exchanges in the United States, it is impossible for any one investment adviser or brokerage concern to follow all traded business ventures closely or to maintain sufficient information with respect to each and every one to furnish an informed expert opinion with respect to its prospects as an investment. As a result, each investment adviser and group of security analysts on the staff of a broker or investment banking concern usually limits itself to in-depth study of a fraction of the entire gamut, maintaining a detailed analysis of each company in the selected group, based on studies of every available bit of information about it, including visits to and conferences with its top personnel, customers and others. Although an adviser or brokerage house may have expertise with respect to companies within its selected group, it would have much less knowledge, or even none, about hundreds of other traded companies unless it undertook a special study.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">If Rolf had looked to Stott and BEDCO for investment counsel, as he had to Stirling, Stott would undoubtedly have learned more about Rolf\u2019s investment objectives and maintained for him a portfolio of securities with which BEDCO\u2019s experts were intimately familiar. As it was, Stott was justified in relying upon Yamada\u2019s expertise with respect to the securities recommended by him. Although Stott may have personally thought that some of the latter were \u201cjunk\u201d or \u201chigh fliers\u201d it must be remembered, first, that Yamada then enjoyed an excellent reputation as a successful adviser. Once a student at the Harvard Business School, he had risen rapidly to the position of officer in the investment banking firm of Kuhn Loeb &amp; Co., described by Judge Pierce \u201cas a conservative and prestigious firm which generally handled \u2018triple-A\u2019 clients,\u201d where Yamada developed \u201cexpertise in research and \u2018special situations\u2019.\u201d Yamada had then left Kuhn Loeb to form a partnership with others, including Keither Funston, former President of the New York Stock Exchange, John Burns, former President of RCA and Chairman of the Board of Cities Service, and J. Richardson Dilworth, head of the Rockefeller Brothers Fund. Yamada was well known in the securities field, managed approximately $20 million for customers and was in daily consultation with numerous securities firms. Rolf himself, an experienced trader on his own behalf, after personally interviewing Yamada was favorably impressed by him as \u201cvery brilliant and capable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">In short, although Rolf later testified, after Yamada\u2019s advice had proved disastrous, that he had \u201cexpected BEDCO to <em>look after </em>his account,\u201d (emphasis added), Rolf never put this in writing or defined precisely what was to be BEDCO\u2019s area of responsibility other than to keep him advised as to what securities were being purchased and sold for the account. On the contrary, by letter dated May 9, 1969, to BEDCO Rolf directed, \u201cYou will kindly follow his [Yamada\u2019s] instructions in every respect concerning my account with you as he may order and direct.\u201d Rolf had what amounted to a custody account with BEDCO. When it came to investment decisions, although Stott (whom Rolf had never met and hardly knew) made recommendations to Yamada, it was clear that Yamada was in command.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">Against such a background, I fail to find any substantial basis for holding that Stott\u2019s assurances to Rolf, made long prior to the time when Yamada\u2019s fraud and manipulations became known, regarding Ya-mada\u2019s competence and Stott\u2019s expressions of opinion to the effect that if Yamada recommended certain investments they must be all right, constituted aiding and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>abetting of any fraud on Yamada\u2019s part.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Although Stott might have personally considered some of the investments made by Yamada to be unproved and hence \u201cjunk,\u201d it would have been foolhardy for him to voice such a view to Rolf, since Yamada, who was in command and had gained his reputation in part from his successful dealing in special situations, might well be possessed of detailed information not available to or obtained by BEDCO or Stott. Absent evidence to the contrary, we cannot assume that Stott\u2019s views were based on independent research, as distinguished from hunch. Some of the greatest gains and widest movements in traded securities have occurred in OTC stocks, of which astute advisers have taken advantage because of intensive private investigation revealing business prospects or probable takeovers not generally known. In this case, for instance, as Judge Pierce noted, \u201cYamada made fairly substantial profits for Rolf on short-term trading in six of the seven manipulated stocks\u201d which he bought for Rolf in 1970. 424 F.Supp. at 1034.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">An analysis of the securities issues purchased by Yamada for Rolf reveals that many of the investments, although they declined in market value when the bloom faded on the bull market, were concededly not unsuitable, that others were listed on major stock exchanges, and that some \u201cunsuitable\u201d issues turned out to be profitable.. Of the 40-odd security issues purchased for Rolf\u2019s account which form the basis of his claim, the district court found that Stott had \u201ceither recommended or was somewhat involved with the decision to purchase the following twelve.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> There is no evidence that any of these 12 were unsuitable for Rolf\u2019s account. Nor was there any testimony as to the suitability of certain other securities bought for Rolf.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b123-13\">Under these undisputed circumstances, including Yamada\u2019s investment of a substantial portion of Rolf\u2019s account in apparently suitable securities, I cannot share the majority\u2019s conclusion that investment of the balance in securities labelled unsuitable by an expert witness amounts to fraud, much less that Stott\u2019s conduct aided and abetted such \u201cfraud.\u201d I favor holding a broker to his duties under Rule 405, for violation of which remedies are provided by the New York Stock Exchange, N.Y.S.E. Constitution Art. VIII, Rules 481, <em>et seq. </em>(providing for arbitration of disputes between member firms and others) and \u00a7\u00a7 6, 13 (authorizing suspension, expulsion, fines and censure), and an investment adviser for fraud in violation of the Investment Advisors Act, see <em>Abrahamson v. Fleschner, </em>568 F.2d 862 (2d Cir. 1977). But to hold that investment of a customer\u2019s account in unsuitable securities constitutes \u00a7 10(b) fraud and that a broker who executes orders given by an investment adviser pursuant to his discretionary authority may be held liable as an aider and abettor of such fraud, places an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>extraordinary and unconscionable burden on both the adviser and the broker.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">Nor do I agree with the district court\u2019s view that an implied right of action for damages in favor of Rolf may be based on Stott\u2019s alleged violations of N.Y.S.E. Rule 405<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> or Article III, \u00a7 2, of the Rules of Fair Practice of the National Association of Securities Dealers.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Accepting the premise that \u201cthe court must look to the nature of the particular rule and its place in the regulatory scheme, with the party urging the implication of a federal liability carrying a considerably heavier burden of persuasion than when the violation is of the statute or an SEC regulation,\u201d <em>Colonial Realty Corp. v. Bache &amp; Co., </em>358 F.2d 178, 182 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>385 U.S. 817, 87 S.Ct. 40, 17 L.Ed.2d 56 (1966), we must also follow the guidelines established by the Supreme Court in <em>Cort v. Ash, </em>422 U.S. 66, 78, 95 S.Ct. 2080, 45 L.Ed.2d 26 (1975), which require us to determine (1) whether the plaintiff is a member of the class for whose especial benefit the. law was intended; (2) whether Congress expressed any preference for or against a remedy; (3) whether a private action would be consistent with the underlying purposes of the legislative scheme; and (4) whether the cause of action is one in an area traditionally relegated to state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">Applying these guidelines, it is not at all clear that Rule 405 or Art. III, \u00a7 2, were intended solely for the particular benefit of investors. Indeed, they appear designed as much to protect brokers from being victimized by unscrupulous customers. See <em>Landy v. FDIC, </em>486 F.2d 139, 166 (3d Cir. 1973), <em>cert. denied, </em>416 U.S. 960, 94 S.Ct. 1979, 40 L.Ed.2d 312 (1974). To imply a damages remedy based on nonfeasance or gross negligence would, moreover, run counter to the principles of <em>Hochfelder </em>and possibly inhibit the NYSE and NASD from promulgating additional standards for the guidance of their members. In short, NYSE and NASD rules are not the same for the purpose of implied remedies as SEC rules. See <em>Jenny v. Shearson, Hammill &amp; Co., </em>[1974-75 Transfer Binder] Fed.L.Sec.Rep. (CCH) \u00b6 95,021, at 97,582 (S.D.N.Y.1975); <em>Plunkett v. Dominick &amp; Dominick, </em>414 F.Supp. 885 (D.Conn.1976). Lastly, whatever obligation might be imposed by rule on a broker dealing solely with his customer, the interposition of an investment adviser with the sole discretionary authority to determine what investments shall be made for the customer weighs against extending any liability of the broker that might otherwise be implied on the basis of a direct broker-customer relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-10\">For these reasons, I would reverse the judgment of the district court and remand with directions to enter judgment in favor of the defendants dismissing the action.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b120-6\">. The cases cited by the majority do not warrant the recognition of any more inclusive definition of scienter. See, e. g., <em>Lanza v. Drezel &amp; Co., </em>479 F.2d 1277, 1306 <em>&amp; </em>n. 98 (2d Cir. 1973) (en banc) (judgment for defendant affirmed; no showing that he \u201cwillfully closed his eyes to or turned his back\u201d on the fraud; material failure to disclose must be apparent \u201cwithout any extraordinary effort.\u201d); <em>Sanders v. John Nuveen &amp; Co., </em>554 F.2d 790, 793 (7th Cir. 1977) (no finding that \u201cdanger was either known to the defendant or so obvious that the defendant must have been aware of it\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b121-7\">. Judge Pierce found Rolf to be a \u201csophisticated\u201d investor, willing to take \u201csubstantial risks\u201d and \u201cto engage in extensive trading,\u201d who \u201cwanted a very aggressive investment program\u201d and \u201ckept careful watch over his securities,\u201d verifying current market prices frequently and employing a bookkeeper to follow his investments.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b121-8\">. Rolf and Yamada both testified that from the outset of their relationship it was agreed that in an effort to obtain a greater capital gain on Rolfs investments than he was presently able to realize Yamada would be making changes in Rolfs portfolio.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b121-9\">. The weakness inherent in attempting to predicate liability on Stott\u2019s telephonic agreement to \u201clook after\u201d Rolfs account is underscored by Rolfs maintenance of accounts with at least seven brokerage concerns other than BEDCO, through which purchases and sales were executed, some on Yamada\u2019s advice, at a net loss of $133,229, without the knowledge or participation of Stott or BEDCO. The other concerns included Lynch, Jones &amp; Ryan; Kordich, Victor &amp; Neufeld; Woodcock, Moyer, Fricke &amp; French; Provident Securities; Bearwald &amp; De-Boer; Amswiss International; and Laird Incorporated. Although it seems that Stott often received notice of transactions conducted through firms other than BEDCO, he was hardly in a position to influence specific purchases or sales.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b122-5\">. Rolf also appears to have made some investment decisions that may not have been shared even by Yamada, much less by Stott. For instance, in June 1969, Rolf opened a non-discretionary account with Hornblower &amp; Weeks-Hemphill &amp; Noyes, through which he purchased</p>\n<p id=\"b122-9\">American Scientific Corp.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-10\">Dasa Corp.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-11\">Data Network Mega Systems, Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-12\">Ampex Corp.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-13\">Mohawk Data Science.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b123-6\">. Moreover, the generality of Stott\u2019s conclusory assurances \u2014 \u201cthat Yamada knew what he was doing and that if Yamada were purchasing stocks they must be satisfactory\u201d \u2014 must have made it readily apparent to Rolf from the outset that Stott was relying on Yamada\u2019s excellent reputation rather than on an investigation into the merits of each investment, conducted personally or through BEDCO\u2019s staff of analysts. Otherwise, he would have reported to Rolf on the results of his independent research.
