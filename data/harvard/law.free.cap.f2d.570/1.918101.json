Street was tried first, convicted, appealed, and lost. The others met the same fate later in two additional trials. All of the convictions were affirmed on appeal, appellant Street\u2019s by an unpublished opinion of this court, Kilcullen\u2019s and Reddall's by decision at 546 F.2d 435 (1st Cir. 1976), Dannon\u2019s in an unpublished opinion, dated November 15, 1976, and Cowden\u2019s by an opinion published at 545 F.2d 257 (1st Cir. 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-21\">Now Street has proffered newly discovered evidence which he claims is material on the issue of his knowledge, an essential element of the offense charged. The evidence is the testimony of two co-defendants, who refused to testify at Street\u2019s trial for Fifth Amendment reasons, and information about a witness\u2019 bankrupt financial situation. This witness had claimed to be worth ten million dollars at the time of the criminal acts, in 1973. A motion for new trial asserts that he filed a Chapter XIII bankruptcy petition in 1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-22\">The motion for new trial was denied by the trial court in an opinion which found the bankruptcy evidence cumulative and impeaching and the co-defendants\u2019 expected testimony \u201cfor the most part ... either cumulative or impeaching in nature\u201d as well as consisting \u201cprimarily of inadmissible hearsay.\u201d In the final paragraph of the court\u2019s opinion the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-23\">Finally, I conclude that for the reasons stated above, the proffered evidence, for the most part, is either cumulative or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>impeaching in nature and thus does not constitute newly discovered evidence, and, more importantly, having in mind that three different juries convicted the five defendants involved in this case, I rule that, in any event, it is not evidence of a caliber which would \u201cprobably produce a different verdict in the event of a new trial.\u201d <em>United States v. Strauss, </em>443 F.2d 987.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">The government seems to concede that even though the trial court seemed clearly to base its decision to overrule the motion for new trial on several grounds, the inclusion of the \u201cprobably produce a different verdict\u201d ground must be squarely faced by this court. This results from the fact that the trial court did not definitely finally determine that the motion for new trial failed to meet the other required standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">The appellant concedes in its brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-6\">The overwhelming weight of authority has established very definite criteria that must be satisfied in order for a defendant to succeed on a motion for new trial. As set forth in the district court\u2019s memorandum these include:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-7\">1. The evidence must be newly discovered or unavailable at the time of trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-8\">2. Facts must be alleged from which the court may infer diligence on the part of movant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-9\">3. The new evidence relied on must be material.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-10\">4. The new evidence must not be merely cumulative or impeaching.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b70-11\">Although the appellant describes these four criteria as being \u201cset forth in the district court\u2019s memorandum,\u201d he does not state them accurately. We prefer to set out the criteria as actually stated by the trial court, since this is what the appellant purports to rely upon in his brief here. The trial court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-12\">It is settled law that in order to succeed on a motion for new trial based primarily on the grounds of newly discovered evidence, the movant-defendant must show (a) that the evidence was unknown to him at the time of trial, <em>United States v. Granger, </em>504 F.2d 585 (9 Cir. 1974); (b) that the failure to discover the evidence was not due to a lack of diligence, <em>United States v. Schwartzbaum, </em>527 F.2d 249 (2 Cir. 1975); (c) that the new evidence is material, <em>United States v. Giglio, [Giglio v. United States] </em>405 U.S. 150, 92 S.Ct. 763, 31 L.Ed.2d 104 (1972); (d) that the new evidence is neither cumulative nor impeaching, <em>Mesarosh v. United States, </em>352 U.S. 1, 9, 77 S.Ct. 1, 1 L.Ed.2d 1 (1956); (e) that the new evidence would probably produce an acquittal, <em>United States v. Agurs, </em>427 U.S. 97, 111 n. 19, 96 S.Ct. 2392, 49 L.Ed.2d 342 (1976); <em>United States v. Schwartzbaum, supra. </em>Motions for a new trial are directed to the discretion of the trial court. Both the weight of the new evidence and the credibility of witnesses are to be considered by the court. <em>United States, v. Zannino, </em>468 F.2d 1299, 1303 (1 Cir. 1972), <em>cert. denied, </em>410 U.S. 954, 93 S.Ct. 1419, 35 L.Ed.2d 687 (1973).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b70-15\">It will be noted that the appellant did not include the fifth criterion as used by the trial court, but as to that the appellant states: \u201cThese four criteria are universally cited in almost all cases. A fifth test is also usually applied. That test is the \u2018probability test.\u2019 \u201d The fact that it is usually applied, as stated by the appellant, is fully confirmed by the Supreme Court\u2019s statement in <em>United States v. Agurs, </em>427 U.S. 96, 111, 96 S.Ct. 2392, 2401, 49 L.Ed.2d 342 (1976). Although the precise question as to the standards to be applied in a motion for new trial was not before the Supreme Court in <em>Agurs, </em>the Court there spoke of \u201cthe severe burden of demonstrating that newly discovered evidence probably would have resulted in acquittal.\u201d This test is then described in a footnote in the following terms: \u201cThis is the standard generally applied by lower courts in evaluating motions for new trial under Fed.Rule Crim.Proc. 33 based on newly discovered evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 111 n. 19, 96 S.Ct. at 2401.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-16\">Appellant correctly notes that several courts of appeals have established somewhat differing standards as to this fifth criterion, citing <em>United States v. Strauss, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>443 F.2d 986, 989 (1st Cir. 1971), for the proposition that this court has not yet resolved the issue. In that case we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A_\">As the Supreme Court has noted, courts have traditionally applied two somewhat different tests for determining whether newly discovered evidence warrants a . new trial. <em>See United States v. Johnson, </em>327 U.S. 106, 111 n. 5, 66 S.Ct. 464, 90 L.Ed. 562 (1946). The majority rule, derived from the case of <em>Berry v. Georgia, </em>10 Ga. 511 (1851), requires that the evidence \u201cmust be such, and of such nature, as that, on a new trial, the newly discovered evidence would probably produce an acquittal.\u201d <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>32 F.2d 127, 130 (8th Cir. 1929); <em>accord, United States v. Craft, </em>421 F.2d 693 (9th Cir. 1970); <em>Hudson v. United States, </em>387 F.2d 331 (5th Cir. 1967), cert. denied, 393 U.S. 876, 89 S.Ct. 172, 21 L.Ed.2d 147 (1968); <em>Anderson v. United States, </em>369 F.2d 11 (8th Cir. 1966), cert. denied, 386 U.S. 976, 87 S.Ct. 1171, 18 L.Ed.2d 136 (1967). The Seventh Circuit rule, first announced in <em>Larrison v. United States, </em>24 F.2d 82, 87-88 (7th Cir. 1928), is somewhat less stringent. Under the <em>Larrison </em>rule a new trial must be granted if, on the basis of the newly discovered evidence, \u201c(a) The court is reasonably well satisfied that the testimony given by a material witness is false [and] (b) That without it the jury <em>might </em>have reached a different conclusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 87; <em>accord, Gordon v. United States, </em>178 F.2d 896, 900 (6th Cir. 1949).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b71-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 989 (footnote omitted) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">This court in <em>Strauss </em>decided that there had been no false testimony and that therefore the <em>Larrison </em>rule was \u201cinoperative.\u201d The court held that \u201cthe record amply supports both that finding and the Court\u2019s evaluation of the newly discovered evidence in light of the <em>Berry v. Georgia </em>standard.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 990.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">This court has most recently dealt with this subject in our opinion this term in <em>In Re United States, </em>565 F.2d 173 (1st Cir. 1977). In that case, this court considered the question whether the trial court had properly granted a motion for a new trial. We there stated that one of the standards set by Rule 33 and the pertinent law was that the newly discovered evidence \u201cmust be such as to have some effect on the outcome (the degree of such effect being as yet an issue of some disagreement among the circuits).\u201d Thereafter, the opinion stated: \u201cSimilarly, respondent failed to establish that the outcome of the trial would likely have been different had the jury been presented with the January 4, 1972 agreement\u201d and then elaborated in the footnote as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-9\">There is some uncertainty whether the standard to be applied against Rule 33 motions is the majority rule, that the evidence \u201cwould probably produce acquittal,\u201d <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>32 F.2d 127, 130 (8th Cir. 1929), or a minority position, that it \u201cmight\u201d have caused the jury to reach a different result. <em>Larrison v. United States, </em>24 F.2d 82, 87-88 (7th Cir. 1971). <em>See United States v. Strauss, </em>443 F.2d 986, 989 (1st Cir. 1971). We need not resolve that question since the evidence here fails under either standard.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Av1\"><em>Id. </em>177 n.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-10\">Thus, it is clear that where the trial court places its denial of a motion for new trial on the absence of probability of a different result, we must face the question of whether that is a correct standard. This court has said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-11\">Motions for a new trial are directed to the trial court\u2019s discretion. Under its broad power, the court may weigh the evidence and consider the credibility of the witnesses. The remedy is sparingly used, the courts usually couching their decisions in terms of \u201cexceptional cases\u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b71-12\"><em>United States v. Leach, </em>427 F.2d 1107, 1111 (1st Cir. 1970) (citations omitted). This basic standard of review as announced by this court adds weight to the government\u2019s argument that this court should follow the clear majority of the circuits in requiring that a movant for a new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence must convince <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>the trial court that the new evidence would \u201cprobably\u201d bring about a different result.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">The appellant contends that \u201cfollowing <em>Strauss </em>the evidence should have been reviewed to determine whether the jury <em>\u2018might have reached a different conclusion.\u2019 \u201d </em>Reference to <em>Strauss </em>indicates clearly that this court has construed the <em>Larrison </em>rule to be that a new trial must be granted if \u201c \u2018(a) the court is reasonably well satisfied that the testimony given by a material witness is false [and] (b) that without it the jury <em>\u2018might have reached a different conclusion.\u2019 \u201d </em>Here, the motion for new trial does not allege perjury or prosecutorial misconduct as possible bases for further application of the <em>Larrison </em>test. In the absence of either of these factors, we find no basis for applying the more lenient test of \u201cmight,\u201d since in fact this court in <em>Strauss </em>rejected <em>Larrison </em>as a standard where there was no proof of false swearing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">We conclude that the trial court did not err in overruling the motion in this case. The judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b72-15\">. For a clear discussion of the two criteria and the extent to which they have been recognized in the several circuits, the case of <em>United States v. Stofsky, </em>527 F.2d 237 (2d Cir. 1975), is particularly instructive. It also demonstrates that the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has abandoned its prior practice of testing the motion for new trial by both standards.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
