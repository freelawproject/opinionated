In affirming the district court\u2019s order, we choose to discuss only Johnson\u2019s claim of an illegal search and seizure.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-14\">Johnson asserted his claim of an illegal search and seizure on direct appeal to the Wyoming Supreme Court. <em>Johnson v. State, </em>562 P.2d 1294 (1977). That court framed the issue as follows at 1298:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Akv\">\u201cAlthough in this case no motion to suppress any of these exhibits was made prior to trial, under Rule 40(e)(1), W.R. Cr.P., nor was any objection made upon this basis to the admission of this evidence at the trial, appellant now contends that the court upon its own motion should have inquired of the witnesses and then suppressed exhibits I, III, and IY; and that the failure to do so constituted plain error . . . \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b987-16\">In determining not to reach the merits of Johnson\u2019s Fourth Amendment claim, the Wyoming Supreme Court followed the general rule that ordinarily a claim of an illegal search and seizure cannot be heard on appeal if there was neither a motion to suppress nor an objection to introduction of the evidence at the trial, and stated at 1298:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AYP\">\u201cThe rule requiring objection at trial is not lightly to be set aside and thus permit a defendant to let in evidence at trial as a hedge to insure reversal on an appeal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b987-17\">In <em>Stone v. Powell, </em>428 U.S. 465, 96 S.Ct. 3037, 49 L.Ed.2d 1067 (1976), the Supreme Court held that habeas review of a Fourth Amendment claim is barred where the state has afforded the defendant a full and fair opportunity to litigate that claim. Thus the question presented is whether Johnson had a \u201cfull and fair opportunity\u201d to litigate his claim where the Wyoming Supreme Court refused to review that claim due to his failure to make a timely motion to suppress or a timely objection at trial. This court\u2019s opinions in <em>Chavez v. Rodriguez, </em>540 F.2d 500 (10th Cir. 1976); <em>Redford v. Smith, </em>543 F.2d 726 (10th Cir. 1976); and <em>Sandoval </em>v. <em>Aaron, </em>562 F.2d 13 (10th Cir. 1977) do not amplify the meaning of \u201cfull and fair opportunity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b987-18\">However, <em>O\u2019Berry v. Wainwright, </em>546 F.2d 1204, 1216-1218 (5th Cir. 1977), cert. denied, contains a full discussion of this question, the reasoning of which we adopt. That court concluded at 1212 that <em>Townsend v. Sain, </em>372 U.S. 293, 83 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"920\">*920</page-number>745, 7 L.Ed.2d 770 (1963) is not the sole appropriate test for determining what \u201cfull and fair\u201d consideration means. That court noted that the issue had been exhaustively-argued before the state appellate court and that O\u2019Berry made no claim of ineffective assistance of counsel in that regard. Therefore, the court held at 1216 that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b988-4\">\u201cThe <em>Stone </em>\u2018opportunity for full and fair consideration\u2019 requirement is satisfied where the state court is squarely faced with petitioner\u2019s Fourth Amendment claim, but chooses to resolve that claim on an independent, adequate, non-federal state ground, at least where the state ground does not unduly burden federal rights.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b988-5\">Therefore we hold that where Johnson presented his Fourth Amendment claim to the Wyoming Supreme Court, where the Wyoming Supreme Court applied an adequate procedural ground in refusing to reach the merits of that claim, and where Johnson\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is not related to this issue, habeas review of the Fourth Amendment claim is barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-6\">In connection therewith, Johnson\u2019s failure to make a motion to suppress or timely objection at trial amounted to an independent adequate state procedural ground which precludes habeas review. See <em>Francis v. Henderson, </em>425 U.S. 536, 96 S.Ct. 1708, 48 L.Ed.2d 149 (1976), failure to make a timely objection to the makeup of a grand jury; <em>Wainwright v. Sykes, </em>433 U.S. 72, 97 S.Ct. 2497, 53 L.Ed.2d 594 (1977), failure to make a contemporaneous objection to the admission of a confession at trial. In view of the Supreme Court\u2019s extensive discussion in <em>Wainwright </em>v. <em>Sykes, supra, </em>its rejection of the sweeping language of <em>Fay </em>v. <em>Noia, </em>372 U.S. 391, 83 S.Ct. 822, 9 L.Ed.2d 837 (1963), which had established the \u201cknowing waiver\u201d or \u201cdeliberate bypass\u201d rule, and its detailed reasons for requiring federal courts to recognize state procedural rules, we believe that <em>Sykes </em>is applicable to the failure to move to suppress or object to evidence allegedly obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment in the present action. See also, <em>Wainwright v. Sykes, supra, </em>at 2506, n.11; and <em>O\u2019Berry v. Wainwright, supra, </em>at 1213, n.14.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-8\">When this case was docketed in this court the parties were notified that the appeal would be decided on the original record without oral argument. The parties were invited to submit memoranda in support of their respective positions. Both parties have done so. We have thoroughly reviewed the files and records in this case and are convinced that the order of the United States District Court for the District of Wyoming should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
