The appeal to the Superior Court sought by corrections of the finding to supplant this conclusion by one that plaintiff\u2019s silicosis was contracted as a result of his employment by the defendants. The trial court ruled that such corrections as to subordinate facts as the plaintiff might be entitled to would not materially affect the ultimate conclusion, and that to reverse the latter would be to find contrary to the commissioner upon conflicting medical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>testimony. Our study of the record confirms this ruling. While the plaintiff called two medical witnesses whose testimony would indicate that the plaintiff\u2019s condition was traceable, at least in part, to his work for the respondents, the expert produced by the defendants\u2014a specialist in diseases of the chest, of unquestionable qualifications\u2014expressed a positive opinion that the plaintiff\u2019s work with the defendants was not a material factor in and did not materially contribute to his disability. This opinion was given after examination of X-rays of the plaintiff\u2019s lungs and in response to a hypothetical question fairly stating the evidential facts as to the plaintiff\u2019s industrial history. The commissioner was quite warranted in according decisive weight to it, and his resulting conclusion, being one of fact reached upon conflicting evidence, must stand. <em>Tippman </em>v. <em>State, </em>119 Conn. 1, 4, 174 Atl. 296, and cases cited; <em>Lemieux </em>v. <em>Highland Dairy Co., Inc., </em>121 Conn. 483, 486, 185 Atl. 433.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">There is no error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
