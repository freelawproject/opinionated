Thus, under\n   <em>\n    Howell\n   </em>\n   , a state court can divide MRP only to the extent it is disposable retired pay, as defined by \u00a7 1408(a)(4)(A), and a state court may not enter orders that \"displace the federal rule and stand as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the purposes and objectives of Congress.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604091\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1400/#p1402\">\n    137 S.

However, we focus our attention on the definition of \"disposable retired pay,\" which is the relevant benefit that Congress has authorized state courts to divide as part of dissolution proceedings. Federal law does not permit states to divide MRP but rather grants them the authority to \"treat\n   <em>\n    disposable retired pay\n   </em>\n   \" as community property. \u00a7 1408(c)(1) (emphasis added). \"Disposable retired pay,\" in turn, is defined as \"the total monthly retired pay to which a member is\n   <em>\n    entitled\n   </em>\n   .\" \u00a7 1408(a)(4)(A) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b615 We read \"entitled\" to mean a member has applied and been approved for military retirement benefits. Although Congress did not define \"entitled,\" our interpretation effectuates its intent in passing the USFSPA. The legislative history reveals Congress's intent that a military member must retire to become \"entitled\" to MRP.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   S. Rep. No. 97-502, at 17 (1982) (\"[I]t is not enough that the member has sufficient years of service so that the member could, if the member so desired, retire .... Rather, the member must have actually retired from the uniformed service or entered some other status in which the member is actually entitled to receive retired or retainer pay.\"). The Department of Defense's regulations also support this interpretation of \"entitled.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   7B Department of Defense, DoD 7000.14-R,\n   <em>\n    Military Pay Policy and Procedures - Retired Pay\n   </em>\n   29-6 (2018) (defining entitlement as \"the legal right of a military member to receive military retired pay\" and differentiating \"members who actually receive retired pay\" from \"those who qualify by completing the required years of service\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b616 Moreover, the grant of authority for states to treat disposable retired pay as community property only applies to \"disposable retired pay\n   <em>\n    payable\n   </em>\n   to a member.\" \u00a7 1408(c)(1) (emphasis added). Unlike the employee spouse's retirement plan in\n   <em>\n    Koelsch\n   </em>\n   , military retirement based on years of service is discretionary, and thus a member's interest in MRP is neither vested nor mature until the member retires and benefits are approved.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%208323\">\n    10 U.S.C. \u00a7 8323\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (granting permissive, not mandatory, authority to retire an officer after twenty years of service). Pay that may never be received, and the grant of which is discretionary, is not \"payable\" to a member. To the same effect,\n   the legislative history states that \"the provisions of section 1408 only will permit payments [to a former spouse] to be made from a member's or former member's 'retired or retainer pay,' \" S. Rep. No. 97-502, at 15, rather than from active duty pay or prospective retirement pay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b617 Finally, \u00a7 1408(c)(3) would be meaningless if \"entitled\" means \"eligible\" as Wife argues. If a member were \"entitled\" to disposable retired pay before retiring, then Congress would have had no reason to explicitly note that courts cannot force retirement in order to effectuate payments under the USFSPA. Although the USFSPA contemplates that a court may order the division of disposable retired pay in advance of retirement, the statutory scheme does not contemplate implementation of that order until the member actually retires.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1408(d)(1) (\"In the case of a member not entitled to receive retired pay on the date of the effective service of the court order, such payments shall begin not later than 90 days after the date on which the member first becomes entitled to receive retired pay.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b618 Because the USFSPA only permits state courts to divide \"disposable retired pay,\" and no entitlement to MRP exists until the member retires and is approved to receive such benefits, state courts cannot order service members to make MRP-based payments to former spouses before retirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b619 Here, at the time of the dissolution, Husband had not applied for, had not been approved to receive, and was not receiving MRP. The dissolution decree provided for a payment to Wife of her share of Husband's MRP starting when Husband purportedly would be eligible to retire. This part of the decree was in error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b620 Before a military spouse retires, a court remains free to enter orders awarding a former spouse his or her share of MRP, but such orders cannot require payment until the military spouse retires.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 1408(a)(4)(B) (freezing benefits for decrees finalized before retirement); \u00a7 1408(d)(1) (contemplating orders served on the Secretary before entitled to payment). Notably, in\n   <em>\n    Howell\n   </em>\n   , the United States Supreme Court observed that a state \"remains free to take account of the contingency that some military retirement pay might be waived, or ... take account of reductions in value when it calculates or recalculates the need for spousal support.\"\n   <em>\n    Howell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604091\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1400/#p1402\">\n    137 S. Ct. at 1406\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We express no view, however, on whether or how the court on remand should make any adjustments based on MRP-related contingencies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b621 For the foregoing reasons, we vacate paragraphs 24 through 30 of the court of appeals' opinion, we vacate the portion of the decree providing for a\n   <em>\n    Koelsch\n   </em>\n   order, and we remand the case to the superior court for further proceedings. We deny Wife's request for attorney fees and grant Husband's request for costs upon compliance with Arizona Rule of Civil Appellate Procedure 21.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
