The Division denied the requests, and after a contested case hearing, the Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH) upheld the Division's determinations. Mr. McCallister filed his petition for review in the district court of the county where he was injured (Campbell County, Wyoming).

In 2016, Mr. McCallister's physicians requested that the Division preauthorize the purchase of several non-typical items to help him manage his condition at his home in rural Albany County. The Division refused to pay for the items, and Mr. McCallister objected and requested a hearing. An \"in-person contested case hearing\" was held before an OAH hearing examiner in Laramie County on May 4, 2017. On June 5, 2017, the hearing examiner issued her \"Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order\" upholding the Division's determinations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The signature line indicated the hearing examiner's office was located in Laramie County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   [\u00b6 5] The Division's notices of referral of the claims to the OAH for a contested case hearing did not specify any county in a heading. The OAH, however, responded with a document which did include such a heading. Thereafter in the administrative proceedings, the Division's pleadings and the OAH orders, including its final decision, were captioned as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    IN THE OFFICE OF ADMINISTRATIVE HEARINGS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-18\">STATE OF WYOMING COUNTY OF CAMPBELL IN THE MATTER OF THE WORKER'S COMPENSATION CLAIM OF BLAINE M.

DEPARTMENT OF WORKFORCE SERVICES, WORKERS' COMPENSATION DIVISION, Respondents.</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   [\u00b66] Mr. McCallister filed a petition for judicial review of the OAH decision in the Campbell County district court on June 30, 2017. In his petition for review, Mr. McCallister stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to Wyoming Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 16-3-114(a), 27-14-602, and 27-16-612 (sic) and Wyo. R. App. P. 12. All administrative remedies have been exhausted prior to the filing of this petition. Venue is proper in this Court as the Petitioner was employed by Robinson Profiling &amp; Grinding, LLC ... in Campbell County, Wyoming at the time of the injury.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   [\u00b67] On July 31, 2017, the Division filed a motion to dismiss Mr. McCallister's petition for review, asserting he should not have filed in the Campbell County district court. Mr. McCallister responded to the motion to dismiss, stating: \"From the onset of this multi-year administrative proceeding, the Division has consistently and routinely captioned (and venued) this workers' compensation claim in Campbell County, Wyoming, despite the Petitioner residing in Albany County, Wyoming, and the Division being located in Laramie County, Wyoming\". He continued, \"the administrative action, by the Division's choosing, occurred in Campbell County, Wyoming, despite the location of the hearing(s) associated with this workers' compensation claim.\" In the alternative, Mr. McCallister requested that his case be transferred to one of the counties where venue was proper because a dismissal would result in his appeal being \"time-barred.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   [\u00b68] The district court denied the Division's motion to dismiss and affirmed the OAH\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   decision on the merits.

It claims that he was required by \u00a7 16-3-114(a) to file his petition for judicial review in either the district court for the county in which the administrative action was taken or the district court in the county where he resided. Mr. McCallister counters that, while he may have filed his petition for review in the wrong venue, the Campbell County district court had jurisdiction to hear and decide his case. He further argues that the Division waived the right to challenge venue because it did not appeal the district court's order denying its motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A.

The use of the term \"venue\" in Rule 12.03 raises the question of whether the Court could use its \u00a7 16-3-114 rulemaking power to label the requirement of filing in the correct district court a matter of venue rather than jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   [\u00b629] Considering the clear language of \u00a7 16-3-114, we conclude the Court's authority does not extend that far. It defies logic to believe the legislature would have specifically designated the courts where a party is \"entitled to\" judicial review and then delegated authority to this Court to make the location a non-jurisdictional matter of venue. We do not interpret statutes in a manner that produces an absurd result.\n   <em>\n    Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v.

Rule 12.01 confirms the legislature is responsible for making judicial review available and the rules do not affect jurisdiction: \"\n   <strong>\n    To the extent judicial review of administrative action by a district court is available\n   </strong>\n   , any person aggrieved or adversely affected in fact by a final decision of an agency ... may obtain such review as provided in this rule.\" (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   [\u00b630] Furthermore, the \"venue\" language in Rule 12.03(a) can be reconciled with \u00a7 16-3-114(a). Rule 12.03 's use of the term venue simply refers to the petitioner's right to choose from among the courts listed in \u00a7 16-3-114(a) as having jurisdiction. Rule 12.06, which states that the petition for review shall include a \"concise statement showing jurisdiction and venue,\" supports that reading of Rule 12.03. Rule 12.06 acknowledges jurisdiction and venue are distinct requirements. A petitioner must include a statement showing that jurisdiction exists in certain district courts under \u00a7 16-3-114(a) and the petitioner has chosen one of those courts as the appropriate venue. In this case, the district courts in both Laramie County (the place where the agency action was taken) and Albany County (the county of Mr. McCallister's residence) would have had jurisdiction over Mr. McCallister's petition. He could have chosen one of those courts as the venue for filing his petition for judicial review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   [\u00b631] Typically, this Court does not resort to rules of statutory construction when the language of the statute is clear.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Mathewson v.

Mr. McCallister does not identify any hearing or other OAH action that occurred in Campbell County. He also does not cite to any authority establishing that an agency takes action by listing a location on a pleading if there is no showing that the agency actually did anything at that location. Consequently, there is nothing to indicate the OAH decision upholding the Division's denial of benefits to Mr. McCallister (the agency action) was \"taken\" in Campbell County. Campbell County is only connected to this case because that is where the injury occurred, and the claimant was originally treated at the hospital in Gillette. The record does not indicate that any administrative action happened in Campbell County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   [\u00b648] Furthermore, the pleadings do not show that Mr. McCallister filed his petition for review in Campbell County because that is where the administrative action occurred. Mr. McCallister stated that he was \"employed by Robinson Profiling &amp; Grinding, LLC ... in Campbell County, Wyoming at the time of the injury\" as his basis for designating Campbell County as the \"venue\" for judicial review. While we agree the caption of Mr. McCallister's administrative case may have been confusing because it listed Campbell County, \u00a7 16-3-114(a) cannot be read as stating that an aggrieved party is entitled to judicial review in the county where he was employed or the county where the injury occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   [\u00b649] Mr. McCallister does not point to anything in the record indicating the OAH took agency action in Campbell County. He also does not provide any legal authority that an agency takes action in a county simply by naming the county in the caption. The administrative action he appealed was the OAH decision issued in Laramie County after the \"in-person contested case hearing\" conducted in the same county. Under \u00a7 16-3-114(a), the district court in Laramie County and the district court in the county of Mr. McCallister's residence, Albany County, had jurisdiction for judicial review of the OAH decision.

A legislature fully cognizant of the authority cited here might well decide not to enact legislation to correct a non-existent problem by overruling\n   <em>\n    Moller\n   </em>\n   . Although it is a noble-sounding phrase, I do not see the \"continued injustice\" the majority evidently fears could result from continuing to apply the rule in\n   <em>\n    Moller\n   </em>\n   . In this case, all that would result from the continued vitality of the rule in that case is that an injured worker would get judicial review of an Office of Administrative Hearings' decision he claims to be erroneous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   [\u00b658] For these reasons, I would consider \u00a7 16-3-114(a) to be a rule of venue rather than one limiting jurisdiction. I agree with the majority that any challenge to venue has been waived by the Division's failure to contest the district court's denial of its motion to dismiss. I would therefore address the merits of Mr. McCallister's appeal.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
