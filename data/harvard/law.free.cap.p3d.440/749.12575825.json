(Mother) petitioned the juvenile court to terminate the parental rights of her ex-husband, C.L.W. (Father), as to their children, C.C.W. and Z.C.W. (collectively, the Children). After Mother presented her case-in-chief, Father asked the court to dismiss Mother's petition. The court granted the motion on the ground that-although Father had abandoned the Children and had twice been incarcerated for violently attacking Mother and, later, another woman-it was not in the Children's best interest to terminate Father's parental rights. Mother and the Guardian ad Litem (the GAL) appeal, contending that the court misapplied the law to the facts. In one significant respect, we agree, and therefore vacate the juvenile\n   court's determination and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b62 Mother and Father married in September 2005. Z.C.W. was born in August 2006 and C.C.W. in January 2009. Shortly after C.C.W. was born, and when Z.C.W. was three years old, Father brutally attacked Mother and threatened to kill her at gunpoint after the two had an argument about Father's infidelity. Father was charged with aggravated kidnapping and two counts of aggravated assault, and ultimately pled guilty to kidnapping and aggravated assault. The court presiding over his criminal case sentenced him to prison, where he was incarcerated from April 2010 to March 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b63 While Father was incarcerated, Mother filed for divorce, and a divorce decree was entered in 2010 that awarded Mother sole physical custody of the Children. Mother and Father have each remarried thereafter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b64 In 2014, one year after his release from prison, Father violated his parole by leaving the state, attacked another woman in Missouri, and later pled guilty to domestic assault. For this crime, he was incarcerated in Missouri from May 2014 to December 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b65 In October 2016, just before Father was released from prison for the second time, Mother petitioned the juvenile court to terminate Father's parental rights. Mother filed the petition because she believed, among other things, that Father had abandoned the Children, and because she believed that reintroducing Father into the Children's lives would be disruptive and potentially violent. The case proceeded to trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b66 After Mother presented her case-in-chief, but before he put on any evidence of his own, Father asked the court to dismiss Mother's petition. The juvenile court granted Father's motion and entered findings of fact and conclusions of law, wherein it found that Father had abandoned the Children but that Mother had not shown that it was in the Children's best interest to terminate Father's parental rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b67 The juvenile court first found that there were grounds for termination because Father did not attempt to communicate at all with the Children beginning in 2012, during his first incarceration, and through 2016 when Mother filed her termination petition. Significantly, Father did not attempt to communicate with the Children during the year between his two terms of incarceration, even though an order of therapeutic reintroduction had been entered to reestablish Father's relationship with the Children. The court found that, rather than take advantage of this opportunity, Father left the state, violated his parole, and committed another assault. As a result of Father's neglect of his parental responsibilities, the court found that he destroyed the parent-child relationship. Accordingly, the court found that Father had abandoned the Children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b68 The court also found that Mother's testimony regarding Father's attack on her was credible. In the court's words, \"Father's crimes were extremely violent, and they caused his victims, [Mother] in particular, unthinkable physical and emotional injuries.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Notwithstanding this determination, the court found that Father's history of violence toward women did not make him an unfit parent because those acts were against adults, not children. In particular, the juvenile court stated that, while Father's \"crimes may have made him a terrible husband, ... assaulting your spouse or another person[ ]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   does not necessarily mean that you are unable to fulfill your duties as a parent.\" The court found it significant that \"[t]here is no evidence that [Father] is an inherently violent person or that he has been violent with his own or other children.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b69 Having found that there were grounds for termination-namely, abandonment-the court began its best-interest analysis. The court found that under Mother's care, the Children were good students, excelled in extracurricular activities, and enjoyed \"security and stability.\" Somewhat contradictorily, the court then stated that Mother \"has not necessarily had consistently stable relationships in her own life which [h]as resulted in some instability or inconsistency in the [C]hildren's lives.\" The court added that the Children \"have experienced a changing landscape of parental figures during their entire lives, and two of these significant changes have nothing to do with [Father].\" The court stressed that, at the time, there was no plan for Mother's current spouse to adopt the Children, and therefore \"there is no other individual, step-parent or otherwise, available to take over that legal parental role.\" However, the court also found that Mother's spouse was \"developing a parent relationship\" with the Children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b610 The court found that the Children have not asked about Father and \"have no information\" about him. But the court expressed its view that \"Father's circumstances are different now.\" Although Father suffers from post-traumatic stress and bipolar disorders, he \"obtained treatment for his mental health needs while incarcerated and he currently receives therapy and medication management\" through the federal government's Department of Veterans Affairs. Since being released from prison, Father has been \"a coach and a mentor to other children.\" Father now resides with his second wife and two stepchildren. He has also maintained contact with his older daughter who is the Children's half-sister and whom the Children know. The court stressed that Father \"does not have the ability to ever assume full custody of the [C]hildren,\" that he is willing to participate in reunification services, and that he \"desires the opportunity to provide love, support and guidance to the [C]hildren.\" The court specifically found that, if the reunification process were \"done properly, Father could be a positive person in the [C]hildren's lives .... There are adequate and protective measures built into the reunification process that take into consideration the [C]hildren's needs.\" The court concluded that \"[t]here is insufficient evidence that [Father] exercising parent-time with the [C]hildren would cause significant harm or risk of harm to the [C]hildren's physical, mental or emotional well-being.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b611 Also, during its best-interest determination, the court found it significant that the Children might be eligible to receive support payments from the federal government as a result of Father's military service. While Father was incarcerated, Mother was able to apply for an apportionment of his benefits to be used as support for the Children. During Father's incarcerations, the Children obtained approximately $38,000 in support. The court found that these payments amounted to child support.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b612 After considering all of its findings, the court concluded that there were no \"compelling reasons to terminate [Father's] parental rights and that it [was] not strictly necessary to terminate [Father's] parental rights.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   ISSUE AND STANDARD OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b613 Mother and the GAL contend that the juvenile court erred in granting Father's motion to dismiss, asserting that Mother presented clear and convincing evidence that Father's parental rights should be terminated. A court may grant such a motion \"if (1) the claimant has failed to introduce sufficient evidence to establish a prima facie case, or (2) the trial court is not persuaded by that evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    In re J.A.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20UT%20App%2029\">\n    2018 UT App 29\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 26,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12569661\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/424/913/\">\n    424 P.3d 913\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation simplified).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b614 In this case, although the juvenile court determined that statutory grounds existed to terminate Father's parental rights, the court granted Father's motion on best-interest grounds, concluding that the evidence Mother presented in her case-in-chief did not provide \"compelling reasons\" to terminate Father's rights. Because termination decisions \"rely heavily on the [trial] court's assessment and weighing of the facts in any given case,\" its decision \"should be afforded a high degree of deference.\"\n   <em>\n    In re B.R.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8362626\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/171/435/\">\n    2007 UT 82\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 12,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8362626\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/171/435/\">\n    171 P.3d 435\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

While expressing no opinion on the ultimate decision to be made in this case, we agree that the juvenile court's analysis was materially flawed and that remand is therefore required.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b616 Under Utah law, before terminating a parent-child relationship, a court must find (1) that there are grounds for termination and (2) that terminating parental rights is in the child's best interest. Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 78A-6-506(3) (LexisNexis 2018). There is no dispute that the juvenile court properly found that, as a result of Father's abandonment of the Children, there were grounds for termination. The dispute solely concerns the court's best-interest analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b617 Mother first argues that it \"is well settled\" that where grounds for termination are established, it is \"almost automatically\" in the child's best interest to terminate parental rights. Because the juvenile court found that Father had abandoned the Children, she asserts that the court should have automatically concluded that it was in the Children's best interest to terminate Father's parental rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b618 We have indeed previously stated that \"where grounds for termination are established, the conclusion that termination will be in a child's best interest follows\n   <em>\n    almost automatically\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    In re G.J.C.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6773794\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/379/58/\">\n    2016 UT App 147\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 25,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6773794\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/379/58/\">\n    379 P.3d 58\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added) (quotation simplified),\n   <em>\n    abrogated by\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re B.T.B.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20UT%20App%20157\">\n    2018 UT App 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12574176\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/436/206/\">\n    436 P.3d 206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But, as we recently concluded in\n   <em>\n    In re B.T.B.\n   </em>\n   , our \"almost automatically\" line of cases was not supported by statutory language or Utah Supreme Court case law, and we disavowed all of our cases that had relied upon the concept.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20UT%20App%20157\">\n    2018 UT App 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 44 &amp; n.12,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12574176\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/436/206/\">\n    436 P.3d 206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   We noted that the \"almost automatically\" characterization had gone too far, and that the \" 'best interest' inquiry requires courts to examine all of the relevant facts and circumstances surrounding the child's situation, not just the specific statutory grounds for termination.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 55. We therefore determined that \"the 'best interest' inquiry should be applied in a more thorough and independent manner than some of our cases might suggest.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2. We therefore reject Mother's contention that, after determining there were grounds for termination, the juvenile court should have automatically concluded that it was in the Children's best\n   interests to terminate Father's parental rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b619 It does not follow, however, that Mother's appeal is unsuccessful. In particular, we are troubled by the juvenile court's treatment of Father's history of domestic violence. Although it recognized that \"Father's crimes were extremely violent, and they caused his victims, [Mother] in particular, unthinkable physical and emotional injuries,\" the juvenile court concluded that \"assaulting your spouse or another person[ ] does not necessarily mean that you are unable to fulfill your duties as a parent,\" and that \"when assessing the issue of unfitness to parent ... the focus is on the parent's interactions with children\" rather than on the parent's interactions with other adults.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   While it is true that a history of domestic violence does not necessarily lead to parental termination in every case, we nevertheless find the juvenile court's statements problematic, and emphasize that-even where there is no evidence of violence toward children-it is inappropriate to completely separate or compartmentalize a parent's history of domestic violence toward other adults from the best-interest inquiry regarding that parent's child.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b620 Such compartmentalization conflicts with the statutory view that a history of violent behavior has relevance, especially when committed against \"the other parent of the child.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 78A-6-316(2)(iv) ;\n   <em>\n    cf. id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 76-5-109.1 (criminalizing actions of domestic violence committed \"in the presence of a child,\" even if the child is not the direct victim).

Each case must be judged on its own merits, and in appropriate cases a trial court might reasonably find, among other things, that the domestic violence issues in the case are not sufficient to counsel in favor of termination; that the parent in question has taken meaningful steps to change his or her life and make amends; that under the circumstances presented there is no significant risk of continued violence; or that, even when all incidents of past violence are fully considered, the children would be better off with the parent still playing an active role in their lives than they would be if the parent's rights were terminated. But the trial court must carefully explain its reasons for so finding, and it is not sufficient to say, as the juvenile court essentially did here, that acts of domestic violence are not relevant in a termination case simply because none of the violence was directly visited upon the Children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b624 Again, we recognize that the juvenile court made these comments in the context of assessing Father's fitness as a parent under statutory grounds. While the juvenile court did not repeat these comments in the \"best interest\" portion of its analysis, and while the juvenile court did make general findings that Father's \"circumstances are different now\" because, among other things, Father has \"obtained treatment for his mental health needs\" and \"currently receives therapy,\" the juvenile court never directly grappled with Father's violent history in its best interest analysis. It may be that the juvenile court espouses the view that, in this case, the steps Father has taken to address his situation have ameliorated any risk that his violent past might pose to his successful reintroduction into the Children's lives. But the juvenile court did not expressly explain why it believes this is so and, evaluated against the backdrop of the compartmentalizing comments it made in the course of its \"fitness\" analysis, we cannot construe the juvenile court's best-interest discussion as containing\n   adequately articulated reasons for its decision.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b625 Accordingly, we conclude that the juvenile court's best-interest determination was materially flawed, because the court did not appropriately consider what effect, if any, Father's history of domestic violence might have on his efforts to reestablish a relationship with the Children. We therefore vacate the juvenile court's order dismissing Mother's petition, and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion. We do not, however, make any effort to urge the juvenile court to reach one conclusion or another upon reconsideration.

We caution trial courts to avoid unnecessarily drawing negative inferences from a battered spouse's decision to maintain a relationship with the batterer, or from a battered spouse's decision to decline to immediately seek help.

First, she asserts that the juvenile court focused too heavily on\n    <em>\n     Mother's\n    </em>\n    fitness as a parent, in violation of our earlier pronouncement that \"the best interests prong of the termination statute does not anticipate an evaluation of a parent whose fitness has not been challenged by a cross-petition to terminate parental rights.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     In re A.M.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7335477\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/208/1058/\">\n     2009 UT App 118\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , \u00b6 23,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7335477\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/208/1058/\">\n     208 P.3d 1058\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . At issue in that case was an effort by the parent whose rights were at issue to subpoena the other parent's \"health records\" in an effort to prove\n    <em>\n     her\n    </em>\n    unfitness.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 18, 21.

That case is easily distinguishable from this one, in that here, the juvenile court's discussion of Mother's living situation came in the context of assessing whether the Children were \"stable,\" and in evaluating Mother's own argument that adding Father back into their lives would affect their stability. Taking such things into account as part of the holistic \"best interest\" inquiry is entirely proper, and a far cry from, for instance, giving the respondent in a termination case access to the petitioner's health records.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    Second, Mother asserts that the juvenile court relied too heavily on the possibility that termination of Father's parental rights might result in the Children losing any right to receive any of Father's veterans' benefits. This issue was not well briefed by the parties from a legal standpoint, and its resolution also depends upon factual issues not specifically found by the juvenile court, which phrased its findings on this issue in hypothetical, conditional terms (e.g., the Children \"would potentially\" lose veterans' benefits because Father \"could object\" to their receiving them). To the extent this issue remains relevant on remand, the juvenile court may invite the parties to explore it in a more meaningful way.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
