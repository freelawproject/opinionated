Gloria Petelle, Michael's mother and heir, appeals the trial court's denial of her motion to terminate Michelle's right to intestate succession. We hold that the right to intestate succession is a marital right that, although derived from statute, arises because of a person's marital status. By agreeing to a final settlement of all marital rights, Michelle waived that right by signing the Separation Contract. Therefore, we reverse and remand with instructions for the trial court to grant Gloria's motion to terminate Michelle's right to intestate succession. We\n   also deny Michelle's request for attorney fees on appeal and at the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b62 Michael and Michelle married on May 20, 2011. On January 27, 2017, Michael filed a petition for dissolution of their marriage. On February 14, 2017, Michael and Michelle executed the Separation Contract that divided\n   their property and debts. Michael died on May 1, 2017, before a final decree of dissolution was entered. He did not have a will, and he had no children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63 Michelle submitted a petition for letters of administration, appointment of an administrator, an order of solvency, and nonintervention powers on May 10, 2017. Her petition did not disclose the existence of the dissolution action or the Separation Contract. Furthermore, she did not give notice to any of Michael's heirs of her intent to petition for nonintervention powers, as required by RCW 11.68.041. Gloria contested Michelle's nonintervention powers. The trial court revoked Michelle's nonintervention powers and required her to post a $ 100,000 bond but allowed Michelle to continue as Michael's personal representative. It also awarded attorney fees to Gloria.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 Gloria then petitioned the court on September 27, 2017, for an order terminating Michelle's right to intestate succession. The trial court denied Gloria's motion but reserved ruling on Michelle's motion for attorney fees. Gloria appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   RIGHT TO INHERIT AS A \"SURVIVING SPOUSE\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b65 Gloria argues that Michelle and Michael's marriage was defunct and, therefore, Michelle is not entitled to inherit as a \"surviving spouse\" because her marriage to Michael was \"terminated\" under RCW 11.02.005(17).

A decree of separation that does not terminate the status of spouses or domestic partners is not a dissolution or invalidation for purposes of this subsection.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   (Emphasis added.) \"Terminated\" is not defined in the statute, but the dictionary defines \"terminate\" as \"to bring to an ending or cessation in time, sequence, or continuity : CLOSE ... to form the ending or conclusion of ... to end formally and definitely (as a pact, agreement, contract).\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   WEBSTER'S THIRD NEW INTERNATIONAL DICTIONARY 2359 (2002). Using this definition of \"terminated,\" the term is susceptible to two or more meanings because it is not clear what action is required to \"terminate\" a marriage or domestic partnership. Therefore, it is necessary to consult the legislative history of the statute to ascertain the legislature's intent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b68 RCW 11.02.005(17) was revised in 2008 as part of a broader bill expanding domestic rights and responsibilities of all couples recognized as domestic partners under Washington's State Registered Domestic Partnerships Act, chapter 26.60 RCW. H.B. 3104, 60th Leg., Reg. Sess. (Wash. 2008). The statute's references to domestic partners and domestic partnerships and the word \"terminated\" were added as part of this revision. Based on the final bill report, \"terminated\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   refers to a process for ending a domestic partnership with the Secretary of State.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FINAL B. REP. ON SECOND SUBSTITUTE H.B. 3104, 60th Leg., Reg. Sess. (Wash. 2008). Contrary to Gloria's contention, the legislature did not add \"terminated\" to describe a marriage that is defunct. Because Michelle was not in a domestic partnership with Michael that was terminated by the Secretary of State, she is a surviving spouse under the statute and is entitled to inherit 75 percent of his separate property, absent a waiver of that right.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   WAIVER OF MARITAL RIGHT TO INTESTATE SUCCESSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b69 Gloria next argues that Michelle waived her right to inherit Michael's property as a \"surviving spouse\" by entering into the Separation Contract.

Michael and Michelle's Separation Contract states that \"[a]ll property which shall hereafter come to either party shall be his or her separate property and neither party shall hereafter have any claim thereto.\" This is similar to the separation agreement in\n   <em>\n    Lindsay\n   </em>\n   , which the court held \"showed an intent to prevent, waive, and abandon what a surviving spouse could normally take.\"\n   <em>\n    Lindsay\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1681857\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/91/944/#p950\">\n    91 Wash.

As such, Michelle waived her marital right to intestate succession by entering into the Separation Contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b622 Michelle argues that\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Lindsay\n   </em>\n   are distinguishable because those cases dealt with the homestead right applicable to disinherited spouses, not the right to intestate succession. Although it is true that\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Lindsay\n   </em>\n   do not address the rights of a surviving spouse to intestate succession, the analysis is still instructive. Both cases analyzed whether a separation contract that is a final settlement of a married couple's property and rights, effective even upon death, evidences an intent to waive the statutory marital rights of a surviving spouse. Michelle's right to intestate succession, like the homestead right, is a statutory marital right due to a surviving spouse. For that reason,\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Lindsay\n   </em>\n   are persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b623 Michelle also argues that the parties' subsequent actions in\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Lindsay\n   </em>\n   were vital to the courts' conclusions that the disinherited spouse intended to waive the homestead right. Specifically, she highlights the fact that the spouses in those cases revoked their previous wills that named one another as beneficiaries and executed new wills that did not provide for any inheritance. By contrast, Michelle argues that after she and Michael signed the Separation Contract, they did not take any actions, such as executing a new will, that showed an intent to waive the right to intestate succession. But, the courts in\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Lindsay\n   </em>\n   did not rely on the parties' subsequent actions. In each of those cases, the court reached its conclusion based on that the language of the separation agreements alone.\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2515042\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/28/436/#p439\">\n    28 Wash.2d at 440\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=183%20P.2d%20768\">\n    183 P.2d 768\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"This conclusion [that the parties intended to waive the homestead right] is inescapable under the language that the agreement was to be binding on each of the parties, their heirs and assigns forever.\");\n   <em>\n    Lindsay\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1681857\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/91/944/#p950\">\n    91 Wash.

The\n   parties' subsequent actions, while further supporting their intent to waive their homestead rights, were not relied on to find waiver. Furthermore, in both\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Lindsay\n   </em>\n   , a new will was necessary because the settlement agreement did not automatically disinherit the estranged spouses from one another's existing wills and the parties had to update their wills to reflect that intent. Here, Michael did not have a will and there is no evidence in the record that Michelle had one either, so there was nothing that needed modification. For these reasons, Michelle's attempt to distinguish\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Lindsay\n   </em>\n   is not persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b624 Finally, Michelle argues that even if she waived her right to intestate succession, remand is necessary to determine whether or not she and Michael intended to reconcile. She cites evidence in the record that Michael contacted his attorney on April 2, 2017, to ask that the\n   dissolution be delayed, a no-contact order be removed, and a house in Leavenworth no longer be included in the Separation Contract. But even if this were evidence that Michael and Michelle intended to reconcile, it does not change the result. The Separation Contract states that it may be \"terminated and modified\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   by a written document so reflecting, signed by both parties.\" (Emphasis added.) Michael's email to his attorney was not a modification or termination that was signed by both parties. Furthermore, any extrinsic evidence of Michael's intent to reconcile with Michelle after the execution of the Separation Contract is not needed where the intent of the parties at the time of execution is clear, as is the case here.\n   <em>\n    Berg v.
