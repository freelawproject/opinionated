Amburgey claimed an interest in certain property Volk owned based on her and Volk living and raising their children together for 20 years before separating. The issue here is whether judicial estoppel precludes Amburgey from asserting her CIR claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b62 While she and Volk were still living together, Amburgey filed a bankruptcy petition in federal court that did not list as assets any interest in Volk's property or a potential CIR claim regarding that property. The bankruptcy court discharged her debts. Amburgey subsequently filed a complaint alleging that she and Volk had been in a CIR and seeking an equitable distribution of property from the CIR. Volk asserted that the omission of the alleged CIR property and potential CIR claim as assets in the bankruptcy petition precluded Amburgey's CIR claim under judicial estoppel, and also asserted that Amburgey did not have standing because of the bankruptcy. He filed a summary judgment motion on that issue, which the trial court denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b63 Amburgey subsequently filed a motion to reopen the bankruptcy case and submitted\n   an amended schedule disclosing the CIR claim. The bankruptcy trustee later filed a report stating that no nonexempt property was available for distribution from the estate, and the bankruptcy court again closed the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b64 We hold that the trial court did not err in denying Volk's summary judgment motion because (1) judicial estoppel\n   does not apply, particularly in light of Amburgey's amended bankruptcy schedule that disclosed her CIR claim; and (2) Amburgey has standing to bring a CIR cause of action because the CIR cause of action was not the property of the bankruptcy estate once the bankruptcy case was closed. Accordingly, we affirm the trial court's order denying Volk's summary judgment motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b65 Between 1994 and January 2014, Amburgey and Volk lived and raised two children together in a house that Volk had purchased before the relationship began. Volk apparently accrued retirement benefits during this time. Volk and Amburgey never married and did not comingle their finances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b66 In November 2013, Amburgey filed a voluntary bankruptcy petition, which she signed under oath. She filed as an individual and did not identify a spouse or joint debtor. As part of the petition, Amburgey filed schedules of her assets that included small amounts in bank accounts, miscellaneous personal property, and vehicles. She listed no real property. The primary debts she listed were $ 5,000 owed to the Internal Revenue Service and over $ 30,000 owed on several credit cards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b67 The real property schedule directed Amburgey to list all real property in which she had \"any legal, equitable, or future interest, including all property owned as ... community property.\" Clerk's Papers (CP) at 23. Amburgey stated \"None\" on this schedule and did not list an interest in the house where she lived with Volk. CP at 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b68 The personal property schedule directed Amburgey to list \"all personal property ... of whatever kind.\" CP at 24. The schedule included a specific question about interests in retirement accounts, and Amburgey marked \"None.\" CP at 25. She did not list any interest in Volk's retirement account. The schedule also included a specific question about\n   \"[o]ther contingent and unliquidated claims of every nature,\" and Amburgey marked \"None.\" CP at 25. She did not list a potential CIR claim against Volk.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b69 The bankruptcy court discharged Amburgey's debts in February 2014. No distribution was made to Amburgey's creditors. The bankruptcy case was closed in March.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b610 Amburgey moved out of the house she shared with Volk in January 2014. In 2016, Amburgey filed a complaint asking the court to find that she and Volk had been in a CIR between 1994 and January 2014 and to order an equitable distribution of the property from the CIR.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b611 Volk filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that (1) judicial estoppel barred Amburgey from asserting an interest in Volk's property or a CIR claim regarding that property because she did not list the property or a CIR claim as assets in her bankruptcy schedules, and (2) she lacked standing to bring a CIR claim. The trial court denied Volk's summary judgment motion, ruling that judicial estoppel did not apply. Volk filed a motion for discretionary review of the trial court's ruling, which a commissioner of this court granted.

App. Jan. 17, 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b612 After the parties had filed their opening appellate briefs, Amburgey filed a motion in bankruptcy court to reopen her case to file amended asset schedules. The bankruptcy court entered an order reopening the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b613 Amburgey then filed an amended schedule and marked \"Yes\" for the question about \"[o]ther contingent and unliquidated claims of every nature.\" Smith Decl., Ex. A. For an explanation, she stated,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   Debtor may have an equitable claims [sic] against assets held as separate property by her partner, Christopher Volk, in the nature of claims for residential real estate and retirement funds, all of which would be exempt. Debtor does not believe these\n   claims existed or arose at the time of her Chapter 7 filing\n   under state law but only upon a dissolution of her committed intimate relationship that occurred after filing and discharge. This amendment is for precautionary purposes in the event the case trustee believes there are CIR assets that are [the] property of this bankruptcy estate. This case has been reopened for this purpose.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Smith Decl., Ex. A (capitalization omitted). She also claimed as exempt from the bankruptcy estate her interest in Volk's house up to $ 22,975 and her interest in Volk's retirement funds in an unknown amount.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b614 On February 9, 2018, the bankruptcy trustee filed a report stating that \"there is no property available for distribution from the estate over and above that exempted by law.\" Smith Decl., Ex. B. On February 27, the bankruptcy court entered an order closing the reopened case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b615 Amburgey filed a motion to supplement the record with the bankruptcy court pleadings and for this court to take judicial notice of those pleadings. A commissioner of this court denied the motion but stated that the court would take judicial notice of the bankruptcy court's record.

Judicial Estoppel Analysis\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b627 Volk argues that this case falls within the general rule that judicial estoppel applies when a party fails to disclose a claim in a bankruptcy petition and then subsequently tries to assert that claim against a third party.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Arkison\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3631109\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/160/535/#p539\">\n    160 Wash.2d at 539\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=160%20P.3d%2013\">\n    160 P.3d 13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, none of the core factors support application of judicial estoppel under the facts of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   a. Inconsistent Positions\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b628 The first core factor is whether a party has taken clearly inconsistent positions.\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4358559\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/185/270/#p282\">\n    185 Wash.

But Amburgey's current position is not inconsistent with her position in the bankruptcy court for two reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b629 First, when she filed the bankruptcy petition, Amburgey's CIR claim had not yet accrued. In\n   <em>\n    Kelly\n   </em>\n   , the court held that for statute of limitations purposes, \"an action to divide assets acquired during a CIR accrues when a CIR ends.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4032017\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/170/722/#p732\">\n    170 Wash.

E.D. Tenn. 2018). Therefore, Amburgey's failure to disclose a CIR claim that had not accrued because the CIR had not yet ended is not necessarily inconsistent with asserting a CIR claim once it accrues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b630 Second, even if her initial bankruptcy petition was inconsistent with her current position, Amburgey submitted an amended property schedule that informed the bankruptcy court of her CIR claim. Amburgey's amended disclosure is not inconsistent with her current position. In\n   <em>\n    Chonah\n   </em>\n   , the court concluded that the first factor did not support application of judicial estoppel when an amended bankruptcy filing disclosed a claim not identified in the initial bankruptcy petition. 5 Wash. App. 2d at 148-49,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12569974\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/425/895/\">\n    425 P.3d 895\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We agree under the facts here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b631 Volk argues that Amburgey's amended disclosure is inconsistent with her current position because she still did not list her claimed interest in Volk's property in the\n   property schedules. He also claims that her amended disclosure was designed to convince the bankruptcy trustee that her CIR claim was worthless. But regardless of any such deficiencies, Amburgey's disclosure of her CIR claim is consistent with her current position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b632 Volk also argues that\n   <em>\n    Cunningham v. Reliable Concrete Pumping, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1016098\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/126/222/\">\n    126 Wash.

But in\n   <em>\n    Cunningham\n   </em>\n   , the\n   <em>\n    bankruptcy trustee\n   </em>\n   reopened the bankruptcy, not the debtor.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=108%20P.3d%20147\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=108%20P.3d%20147\">\n    at 226\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=108%20P.3d%20147\">\n    108 P.3d 147\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Misleading Court/Judicial Acceptance of Prior Position\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b634 The second core factor is whether acceptance of the party's current position would create the impression that the court in the previous case or in the current case was misled.\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4358559\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/185/270/#p282\">\n    185 Wash.

A related factor is whether the first court accepted the party's prior position.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=340%20P.3d%20951\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Volk argues that the bankruptcy court's discharge of Amburgey's debts following her initial petition showed that the court accepted and was misled by her failure to disclose her CIR claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b635 This argument may have been valid with regard to the initial discharge. If a bankruptcy court grants a discharge based on the debtor's disclosures, the court accepts the debtor's position for judicial estoppel purposes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Urbick v. Spencer Law Firm\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12456071\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/192/483/#p488\">\n    192 Wash.

The court was not misled once Amburgey disclosed her CIR claim. Under similar facts, the court in\n   <em>\n    Chonah\n   </em>\n   concluded that the second factor did not support application of judicial estoppel. 5 Wash. App. 2d at 149-50,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12569974\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/425/895/\">\n    425 P.3d 895\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Unfair Advantage\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b638 The third core factor is whether a party's assertion of the current position would create an unfair advantage for that party.\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4358559\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/185/270/#p282\">\n    185 Wash.

Volk argues that Amburgey gained an advantage by not disclosing her CIR claim because her debts were discharged in bankruptcy without exposing her interest in Volk's property to her debtors. Again, this argument may have been valid with regard to the initial discharge. If a debtor fails to disclose a claim as an asset in a bankruptcy schedule, the debtor gains an unfair advantage for purposes of judicial estoppel because the debtor denies their creditors an opportunity to assert a claim to the undisclosed assets.\n   <em>\n    Urbick\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12456071\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/192/483/#p488\">\n    192 Wash.

The bankruptcy trustee reported that Amburgey had no nonexempt asserts that could be used to satisfy her creditors. As a result, Amburgey gained no advantage in the bankruptcy case because the subsequent disclosure of the CIR claim made no difference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b640 Volk argues that Amburgey did not properly disclose her claim to an interest in his property and attempted to convey that the CIR claim was worthless. But the bankruptcy trustee had an obligation to fully investigate the CIR\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   claim once Amburgey disclosed it. There is no indication that the trustee was deceived by the nature of Amburgey's disclosure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   \u00b641 We conclude that the third core factor does not support application of judicial estoppel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   d. Summary\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   \u00b642 None of the core factors support application of judicial estoppel here, especially in light of Amburgey's amended bankruptcy disclosure identifying her CIR claim. Accordingly, we hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in ruling that judicial estoppel did not apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   C. STANDING TO ASSERT CIR CLAIM\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \u00b643 Volk argues that the trial court erred in denying his summary judgment motion because Amburgey does not have standing to assert an equitable interest in his property through a CIR claim. He contends that even after Amburgey submitted the amended bankruptcy schedule, the bankruptcy trustee had exclusive authority to assert Amburgey's CIR claim on behalf of the bankruptcy estate. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   \u00b644 Filing a bankruptcy petition creates an estate for the assets and debts of the bankruptcy proceeding.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20541\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

D.N.J. 2016). However, the trustee's exclusive standing does not apply to causes of action that are not property of the estate under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20541\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n   <em>\n    Cargo v.

La. 2009).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   \u00b645 Here, after Amburgey included the CIR claim as a scheduled asset in her reopened bankruptcy case, the bankruptcy trustee stated that there were no nonexempt\n   assets to distribute and that the estate had been fully administered.

Therefore, because the bankruptcy estate did not otherwise administer Amburgey's CIR claim, the equitable claim has reverted to her as if no bankruptcy petition had been filed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 153,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=936%20P.2d%201141\">\n    936 P.2d 1141\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And as the party in interest, Amburgey has standing to assert her CIR claim.\n   \u00b646 Accordingly, we hold that the trial court did not err in denying Volk's summary judgment motion on the issue of standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   D. ATTORNEY FEES ON APPEAL\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   \u00b647 Volk argues that we should award him reasonable attorney fees on appeal under RCW 4.84.185, which allows an award of attorney fees for defending against a frivolous claim or appeal. However, as discussed above, we agree with Amburgey's arguments and they are not frivolous. Accordingly, we decline Volk's request to award attorney fees on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   \u00b648 We affirm the trial court's order denying Volk's summary judgment motion regarding the application of judicial estoppel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   We concur:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   WORSWICK, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   GLASGOW, J.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
