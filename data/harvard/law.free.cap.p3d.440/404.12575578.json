He argues: (1) life with the possibility of parole after twenty-five years for juveniles convicted of first-degree murder constitutes an illegal sentence; (2) article II, \u00a7 15 of the Arizona Constitution should be read more broadly than the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution in the context of juvenile sentencing; and (3) the trial court erred when it stated it had no discretion to order that his sentence for first-degree murder run concurrently with the sentences for the other offenses. Pursuant to Rule 32, Ariz. R. Crim. P., Healer also seeks review of the trial court's order denying in part his petition for post-conviction relief, arguing the court abused its discretion by declining to resentence him as to all counts other than first-degree murder. We have consolidated Healer's appeal with his petition for review. For the reasons that follow, we affirm Healer's sentences, and grant review of his petition but deny relief thereon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b62 In 1994, at the age of sixteen, Healer robbed and murdered his elderly neighbor, stealing $200 and the victim's truck. The jury found him guilty of first-degree murder, first-degree burglary, armed robbery, theft by control, resisting arrest, and two counts of criminal damage. The trial court sentenced him to life imprisonment without the possibility of release for first-degree murder, and additional concurrent and consecutive prison terms totaling 13.5 years to run consecutively to his life sentence. We affirmed his convictions\n   and sentences on appeal.\n   <em>\n    State v. Healer\n   </em>\n   , No. 2 CA-CR 1995-0683 (Ariz.

Our supreme court remanded Healer's case for the specified purpose of giving him an \"opportunity to establish ... that [his] crime[ ] did not reflect irreparable corruption but instead transient immaturity,\" and stated that \"[i]f the State does not contest that the crime reflected transient immaturity, it should stipulate to the defendant's resentencing.\"\n   <em>\n    Valencia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12310265\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/241/206/\">\n    241 Ariz. 206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 18,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12310265\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/241/206/\">\n    386 P.3d 392\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b64 On remand, the state stipulated that Healer should be resentenced on his first-degree murder conviction. The trial court resentenced Healer to life imprisonment with the possibility of parole after twenty-five years. The court concluded it did not have authority to revisit the sentences on the remaining counts and affirmed the prison terms previously imposed for the other offenses. This appeal and petition for review followed. We have jurisdiction pursuant to article VI, \u00a7 9 of the Arizona Constitution and A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 12-120.21(A)(1), 13-4031, and 13-4033(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    Ex Post Facto Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b65 Healer argues life with the possibility of parole after twenty-five years for juveniles convicted of first-degree murder constitutes an illegal sentence because \"no lawful sentence for juveniles convicted of first-degree murder existed\" when Healer committed his offenses. Specifically, he asserts A.R.S. \u00a7 13-716 is an ex post facto law in violation of article I, \u00a7 10, clause 1 of the United States Constitution and article II, \u00a7 25 of the Arizona Constitution.

On appeal of the resentencing, we concluded that although courts have the discretion to order that a death sentence be consecutive or concurrent, the failure to specify does not create the presumption that the sentence was concurrent; therefore, once the death sentence was vacated, the court was sentencing the defendant anew, and could impose a concurrent or consecutive term.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 16, 18.\n   <em>\n    Lambright\n   </em>\n   is inapposite in this instance because the trial court, at Healer's original sentencing, had already determined which terms should run concurrently and which should run consecutively.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b617 In his appeal and petition for review, Healer argues \"it is well established that when an appellate court sets aside one conviction or one sentence, this action may impact other sentences imposed at the same time.\" The Arizona cases Healer cites for this proposition are also inapposite.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.
