They had become friends during their participation in Civil Air Patrol that summer, and on July 23, 2016, they made plans for AK to spend the night at DJJ's home. Their plans changed, however, and they instead decided to spend the night with DJJ's former step-sister, Mikelah Williams, and her twenty-three-year old fianc\u00e9, Ian Sparks. Mr. Sparks and Ms. Williams had recently moved, so DJJ and AK first went to the apartment they had vacated to assist Mr. Sparks in cleaning it. Afterward, Mr. Sparks drove the girls to the new trailer home he shared with Ms. Williams, stopping along the way to buy vodka, energy drinks, and soda for himself and the girls.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   [\u00b64] It was around 10:00 p.m. when Mr. Sparks and the girls arrived at the trailer he shared with Ms. Williams. He left the vodka in his vehicle and told the girls that because Ms. Williams would be upset about the alcohol, they would wait until she went to sleep to drink it. While the girls watched a movie, Mr. Sparks and Ms. Williams retired to their bedroom. Sometime later, Mr. Sparks came out of the bedroom and told the girls Ms. Williams had finally fallen asleep.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   [\u00b65] Mr. Sparks and the girls then left the mobile home and took the vodka and other drinks to a nearby abandoned trailer. There they passed the vodka around and drank from the bottle. Although AK raised the bottle to her mouth and could taste the alcohol, she only pretended to drink it. DJJ, on the other hand, drank to the point of intoxication. As the three drank, they played a game of \"Truth or Dare.\" AK described how the evening then progressed:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Q. Truth or Dare, how did it start? In what sort of things?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   A. Um, so just something stupid, like you have to lick a wall, or stuff like that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Q. And did there come a time where the game got a little more risqu\u00e9?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Q. What did you - can you tell us about that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   A. I think it started daring each other, like kiss each other.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Q. And did there come a point where you and Mr. Sparks got dared to make out?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Q. Can you tell us about that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   A. [DJJ] dared us to kiss, so we kissed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   Q. Okay. Did you want to follow through with that dare?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   A. No.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   Q. Why did you?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   A. Because I was just playing along and trying to have fun, seem like if I didn't.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   Q. When you and Mr. Sparks kissed, were you sitting, or were you standing, or something else?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   A. We were sitting.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   Q. Okay. And how were you sitting?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   A. Like on our knees.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   Q. So face-to-face?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   Q. So after - well, how long do you think the kiss with Mr. Sparks lasted?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   A. A minute or two.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   Q. Okay. Was there any touching at that point?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   Q. What kind of touching?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   A. Like my butt and - yeah.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   Q. I'm sorry? Your butt and?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   A. Um, like my back and my arms.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   Q. Okay. Now, after Mr. Sparks kisses you, what happens next?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   A. Him and [DJJ] kiss. And then he dares me to kiss him again.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   Q. Okay. Now when you see him and [DJJ] kiss, was that the first time that you had seen them kiss?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   Q. Okay. What can you tell us about that kiss?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   A. It lasted like a minute, same with touching.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   Q. Okay. Did you see Mr. Sparks and [DJJ] kiss again later that night?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   Q. Okay. Now let's talk about that. When you saw Mr. Sparks and [DJJ] kissing again later, what can you tell us about that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   A. Um, it was very - they were very into it. It lasted a while.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   Q. Did they both appear to be sort of getting into it?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   Q. Okay. Was Mr. Sparks touching [DJJ]?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   Q. Where?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   A. Everywhere.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   Q. And I'm sorry, when you say \"everywhere\" can you be a little more specific?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   A. Yes. Her torso, her breasts, butt, and stuff between her legs.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   Q. Her torso, her breasts, her rear end, and between her legs?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   Q. Did you say anything to him at that point?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   A. Yeah. I told them that they needed to cool it down.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   Q. Why?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   A. Because she was really drunk, she didn't know what she was doing, and she probably would have been willing to do anything at that point.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   Q. And did Mr. Sparks say anything to you?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   Q. What did he say?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   A. He told me that we should let [DJJ] decide what she wanted.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   Q. Now, you gave an interview with an officer, a female officer; do you remember that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   Q. Okay. And in talking with Nicole Long, do you remember indicating that the exact thing that Mr. Sparks said was, \"it's up to [DJJ] if she wants to have sex or not.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   Q. Is that what Mr. Sparks said?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   Q. Now, how were [DJJ] and Mr. Sparks when they were getting into it? Were they standing? Were they sitting?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   A. They were, like, lying down.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   Q. Okay. Now, you indicated that you saw Mr. Sparks touch [DJJ] between her legs; is that right?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   Q. Did you see Mr. Sparks touch anyone else between their legs that night?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   Q. Okay. Who?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   A. Me.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   Q. What can you tell us about that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   A. It was after I had, like, tried leaving. But - I don't remember if I tried leaving before or after, but he had gotten up and he was, um, asking why I wasn't happy, and said \"I could make you happy.\" And telling me to stay, and let's go have fun. And he was touching me while doing it, and - yeah.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   Q. Okay. When he was saying these things, were you guys standing or sitting?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   A. Standing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   Q. Okay. Were you face-to-face or something else?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   A. Something else.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   Q. Okay. And what was that something else?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   A. He was faced towards my back.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   Q. Okay. So his front would have been touching your back?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n   Q. Okay. And had he wrapped his arms around you?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n   Q. Okay. And where - well, what part of his body was touching what part of your body?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   A. So his torso to my back, his legs to the back of my legs.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n   Q. Did his hands touch you anywhere?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n   Q. Where?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n   A. My breasts, my rear end, between my legs.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-106\">\n   Q. Now, when you say between your legs, do you mean your vagina?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-107\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-108\">\n   Q. Okay. And was this over your clothing or under your clothing?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-109\">\n   A. Over.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-110\">\n   Q. Was he talking into your ear, or was he just talking normal?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-111\">\n   A. In my ear.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-112\">\n   Q. He said that he could make you happy?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-113\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-114\">\n   Q. How did that make you feel?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-115\">\n   A. Gross.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   [\u00b66] A short time later, the three left the abandoned trailer and returned to Mr. Sparks' trailer home. The next morning, AK and DJJ went to a pancake breakfast and then on to DJJ's home. While she was there, Mr. Sparks contacted DJJ and asked her to help him finish cleaning his apartment. DJJ agreed and invited AK to join her, but AK declined. At the apartment, then, only DJJ and Mr. Sparks were present. DJJ described what happened after they started cleaning:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-117\">\n   Q. He asked if you remembered what happened last night?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-118\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-119\">\n   Q. And what did you take that - what did you take that to mean he was talking about?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-120\">\n   A. The drinking.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-121\">\n   Q. Okay. And what happened after he asked you that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-122\">\n   A. I had said yes. And then he kept on, like, moving closer. And then I had turned my head and he was like right there, like kind of like really, like, on my shoulder. And then he had kissed me.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-123\">\n   Q. Was - well, did you kiss him back?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-124\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-125\">\n   Q. Okay. Did he touch you at all -\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-126\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-127\">\n   Q. -- while you guys were kissing?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-128\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-129\">\n   Q. Tell us about that, please.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-130\">\n   A. He touched me, like on my breasts and like on my stomach, and on my legs.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-131\">\n   Q. And at first was that over the clothes?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-132\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-133\">\n   Q. When you say that he was touching your legs, do you mean between your legs, or on your legs?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-134\">\n   A. On my legs and between my legs.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-135\">\n   Q. Now, so it started with kissing and some touching over your clothes. Did it stop there?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-136\">\n   A. No.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-137\">\n   Q. Okay. What happened next?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-138\">\n   A. He had started to undress me, and I had started to undress him.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-139\">\n   Q. Okay. And did you take off - or did you guys take off all of your clothes?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-140\">\n   A. No.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-141\">\n   Q. What did you leave on?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-142\">\n   A. My bra.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-143\">\n   Q. Okay. Did Mr. Sparks get fully undressed?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-144\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-145\">\n   Q. Okay. What happened after you both got undressed?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-146\">\n   A. We had sex.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-147\">\n   Q. When you say that you had sex, did Mr. Sparks put his penis inside your vagina?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-148\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   [\u00b67] About a week later, DJJ attended a Bible camp outside Lander, Wyoming. While there, she told friends what had happened with Mr. Sparks, and those friends encouraged her to tell her mother. She also told the camp director what had happened, and when her mother picked her up from camp, she reported the incidents to her. When they returned to Gillette, DJJ's mother took her to the police department to report the incidents. In addition to the acts described above, DJJ reported two additional incidents of sexual intercourse with Mr. Sparks in the week following the July 23rd incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   [\u00b68] Following an investigation, the State filed an information charging Mr. Sparks with three counts of second degree sexual\n   abuse of a minor as to DJJ, one count of third degree sexual abuse of a minor as to AK, and two counts of furnishing alcohol to a minor, with one count for each girl. Following a preliminary hearing, the circuit court bound over all charges but the count for sexual abuse of AK on January 3, 2017. It was not bound over because the State failed to establish AK's age, an element of the offense. On January 13, 2017, the State filed a separate information recharging the count of sexual abuse of a minor in the third degree as to AK, and on March 7, 2017, that count was bound over to district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   [\u00b69] On March 22, 2017, the State filed a motion to consolidate the cases for trial and sentencing. Following a hearing, the district court granted the State's motion over Mr. Sparks' objection. In ruling that joinder was appropriate, the court found that the offenses were of similar character in that they involved sexual abuse of minors. The court further found that the acts were part of a connected transaction, though Mr. Sparks' behavior with DJJ progressed further. Finally, the court found that evidence of the offenses would be admissible in separate trials under Rule 404(b), and it expressed its willingness to consider instructions or verdict forms to minimize any prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   [\u00b610] On October 22, 2017, Mr. Sparks filed a motion to allow him to present evidence concerning DJJ's familiarity with certain sexual acts, a past false allegation of sexual abuse, and a suicide attempt in 2016 pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%206-2-312\">\n    Wyo. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 6-2-312\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the rape shield statute. The State opposed the motion, and following a hearing, the district court ruled that the evidence concerning DJJ's familiarity with certain sexual acts and her suicide attempt were inadmissible. As to the alleged prior false accusation of sexual abuse, the court found that Mr. Sparks had presented sufficient information to warrant an in-chambers hearing on the probative value versus unfair prejudice of the proffered evidence. On February 1, 2018, the court held that hearing and found that the evidence had limited probative value and that probative value was substantially outweighed by its potential for prejudice. The court therefore ruled the evidence inadmissible under both W.R.E. 403 and the rape shield statute.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   [\u00b611] Following a three-day trial, a jury convicted Mr. Sparks of one count of second degree sexual abuse of a minor against DJJ, of one count of third degree sexual abuse of a minor against AK, and of both counts of contributing alcohol to a minor. The jury acquitted on two of the counts of second degree sexual abuse against DJJ. The district court sentenced him to concurrent sentences that totaled six to ten years. Mr. Sparks thereafter filed a timely notice of appeal to this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Joinder\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   [\u00b612] We review a district court's decision to allow the joinder of charges for an abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    Hereford v.

Indeed, the jury acquitted Appellant on one of the sexual assault charges, which strongly suggests that it held the State to its burden of proof, evaluated the evidence relating to each charge separately, and ultimately found the proof wanting in that respect.

For purposes of this particular hearing in ruling on this, the Court's going to conclude, and I'm relying mainly on the offer of proof submitted by the defense, page 5 of 7 of Officer Stroup's report, the Court's going to conclude that two statements were made to the effect at issue here.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-218\">\n   * * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-219\">\n   So for purposes of this hearing, the Court's going to find that [DJJ] claimed to have had sex with her father in one instance and claimed to have had sex with her father and had become pregnant by him in another instance in an anonymous communication, i.e., not with her true identifiable name or identity[,] to individuals who use a handle, not their true identity[,] on the Internet in hookup apps for these sexual venues. So the young lady made the statement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-220\">\n   * * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-221\">\n   And the argument here for admission here is that this was an example of her making a false statement to garner attention. And to the Court that's an important argument, to garner attention, and saying Judge, that's what she's doing here. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, that's what she's doing here, she's making a completely false accusation against this defendant as a means of garnering attention from the authorities, I suppose.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-222\">\n   Well, what attention did she garner here? From looking at this report, none. I\n   don't see anybody sending return messages: Oh, you poor girl, this, that and the other thing. In fact, probably I'm guessing men who receive messages like this probably think Boy, she's really vulnerable, now I can really take advantage. So I'm not sure she received any attention, it would just mean that she attempted to garner it. I'm just saying that there appears to be probably nothing reciprocal in terms of attention coming her way.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-223\">\n   But suffice that to say with all of that predicate, the Court does find that the statements are relevant. Now, how relevant? The Court's of the view that the relevance is of half measure. And the reason I say that is going back to this set and setting of these declarations. I'm not sure I can really put my finger on it, but to me it's a lot different for somebody to make declarations of this kind, a girl of 14, 15 years of age, when she's not identified, making statements to the Internet universe to people who are not identified. That's different from this young lady walking down the street, tugging on the shirt sleeve of somebody of consequence in her life, and falsely stating \"dad had sex with me and I became pregnant by him.\" And that's why I say this material, while relevant, is only relevant to a half measure.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-224\">\n   I think the set and setting of these declarations on the Internet on these anonymous sex apps or hookup apps renders this material, the relevancy of this material quite attenuated, although to an extent it is relevant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-225\">\n   We then turn to Rule 403, and the Rape Shield law requires the Court to determine whether or not the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs the probability that its admission will create prejudice.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-226\">\n   And I think the Court has to take into account the other factors under Rule 403, which include confusion of the issues, misleading the jury, considerations of undue delay, waste of time, this kind of thing. And the Court is of the view that the probative value of this evidence, diluted as it is for the reasons I've just explicated, is substantially outweighed by its prejudicial effect, and outweighed by its likelihood for distracting the jury, confusing the issues at hand, misleading the jury.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-227\">\n   And the Court takes into account and is persuaded by the argument of the State's attorney under\n   <em>\n    Budig\n   </em>\n   , which discusses the reasoning behind the Rape Shield law. And the Rape Shield law I think is intended to, and I think they said this in\n   <em>\n    Budig\n   </em>\n   , to encourage, not discourage, I should say, people from reporting instances of sexual assault.

They were statements made anonymously to an anonymous person and therefore could result in no consequences to her or her father. The anonymous nature of the communication gave DJJ license to say anything she wanted without concern for follow-up. In contrast, although DJJ did discuss her sexual contact with Mr. Sparks with friends at camp and with the camp counselor, the report she made was to her mother and law enforcement. That was plainly not an anonymous statement from which no consequences would flow. The district court concluded that because the circumstances and consequences were so different, the probative value of DJJ's internet declarations was limited. This conclusion is neither unreasonable nor arbitrary and capricious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-234\">\n   [\u00b637] We likewise find nothing unreasonable in the district court's view that the potential for the evidence to distract and mislead the jury and confuse the issues outweighed its limited probative value. DJJ had no recollection of making the online statements concerning her father, so the only way that evidence could come in would be through the police report, assuming its admissibility. If the police report could have been admitted, it would require testimony as to the circumstances of the report DJJ's mother made to law enforcement and the nature of the anonymous communications, which would in turn require delving into DJJ's online sexual activities. To admit the evidence without that context would leave the jury confused and potentially misled as to the nature of both the statements and the police report. Given the marginal relevance of the evidence, we can find no abuse of discretion in the district court's decision to avoid the potential prejudice and confusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-235\">\n   [\u00b638] It is for this reason that we also agree with the district court that the evidence implicated the rape shield statute.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Unless the evidence were admitted in a way that was confusing and potentially misleading, it would require testimony concerning DJJ's use of hook-up apps and her online activities of a sexual nature, in other words her prior sexual conduct.
