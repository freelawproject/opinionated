Baxter; and Blair M. Walker (collectively, Cypress). Cougar alleged, among other things, violations of the Utah Uniform Securities Act,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2061-1-1\">\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 61-1-1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   to -206 (LexisNexis 2018),\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Following a jury verdict in Cougar's favor on both counts, Cypress moved for a new trial, asserting that the verdict was \"contrary to law,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Utah R. Civ. P. 59(a)(7), which motion the trial court denied. We affirm the trial court's denial of Cypress's motion for a new trial and further conclude that it did not err in holding Robert N. Baxter in contempt for transferring funds in violation of the court's order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b62 To make a long story short,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Cypress approached Cougar in 2009 about\n   participating as co-lender on a loan associated with a real estate development project in Trinidad, Colorado (the Trinidad Project). Cypress had committed to loan $ 4.8 million\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   for the funding of the Trinidad Project, and Cougar eventually agreed to finance half of that sum in exchange for a note from Cypress in the principal amount of $ 2.8 million. However, of the $ 4.8 million that Cypress had agreed to extend for the funding of the Trinidad Project, the project ultimately received only $ 1.7 million-$ 1.5 million of which Cougar funded. The Trinidad Project borrower eventually defaulted on the loan and, following a sequence of events, Cougar initiated the current action against Cypress on October 17, 2013, asserting securities fraud and other claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63 In bringing its claim for securities fraud against Cypress, Cougar alleged that Cypress \"made untrue statements of material facts regarding the value and nature of the collateral that would be pledged\" to secure Cougar's loan and \"made untrue statements of material facts regarding [Cougar's] approximately 50/50 participation in the [Trinidad Project loan].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b64 Following a four-day trial in 2017, the jury returned a special verdict in favor of Cougar on its securities fraud and breach-of-the-implied-covenant claims, awarding $ 4 million and $ 1 million in damages, respectively. Because the damage awards were duplicative, the trial court entered judgment in favor of Cougar in the sum of $ 4 million, plus postjudgment interest, costs, and attorney fees. Cypress subsequently filed post-trial motions seeking judgment notwithstanding the verdict, a new trial, and to set aside the judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Utah R. Civ. P. 50, 59, 60(b). The trial court denied the motions, and Cypress appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b65 At oral argument, Cypress's appellate counsel, who was not trial counsel, astutely recognized that the briefing in this case was unfocused and unduly complex. Counsel accordingly repackaged Cypress's position on appeal to showcase a single potentially dispositive argument: that the trial court erred in denying Cypress's rule 59 motion for a new trial because the verdict was \"contrary to law.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2061-1-1\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   R. 59(a)(7). Specifically, he argued that the two-year statute of limitations barred Cougar's securities fraud claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2061-1-22\">\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 61-1-22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (7)(a)(ii) (LexisNexis 2018) (providing that a claim brought under the Utah Uniform Securities Act is barred after \"the expiration of two years after the discovery by the plaintiff of the facts constituting the violation\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b66 Cypress premises its argument on Cougar's receipt of two emails more than two years before Cougar brought suit. In March 2009, Cypress sent an email to Cougar detailing issues with some of the collateral securing the loan. And in March 2011, Cypress sent an email detailing the parties' current percentage interest in the Trinidad Project loan, which was not 50/50. The 2011 email was sent to an administrative assistant,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   but Richard Miller, the owner of the entity that manages Cougar, never reviewed it. Cypress argues that the emails conferred sufficient actual or inquiry notice upon Cougar to trigger the running of the two-year statute of limitations for its securities fraud claim, which would have elapsed by the time Cougar commenced its action in October 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b67 Ordinarily, \"we review an appellant's allegations of legal error under [ rule] 59(a)(7) [of the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure] for correctness,\" but \"reverse and order a new trial only if we (1) identify a legal error that would be grounds for a new trial under [ rule] 59(a)(7) and (2) determine that the error resulted in prejudice necessitating a new trial.\"\n   <em>\n    ASC Utah, Inc. v.

In denying Cypress's motion for a new trial, the court briefly addressed Cypress's argument based on the sufficiency of the evidence,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Utah R. Civ. P. 59(a)(6), by stating that the argument failed because Cypress had not marshaled the evidence supporting the jury's verdict. The court made no specific mention of Cypress's contention that the verdict was \"contrary to law,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6982685\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/282/1009/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   R. 59(a)(7), other than to state that Cypress failed to cite to the record where it had preserved its remaining issues-thereby implicitly refusing to reach the merits of that specific argument. And because \"courts are required to explain the basis for their decisions only when they\n   <em>\n    grant\n   </em>\n   motions for a new trial-not when they deny such motions,\"\n   <em>\n    ASC Utah\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6964960\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/309/201/\">\n    2013 UT 24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 21,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6964960\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/309/201/\">\n    309 P.3d 201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis in original), the court did not commit legal error in declining to address the merits of that particular argument.

Cypress contends that the plain error doctrine applies to its rule 59(a)(7) argument. To establish plain error, a defendant must show that \"(i) an error exists; (ii) the error should have been obvious to the trial court; and (iii) the error is harmful.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20 (quotation simplified).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b611 Cypress argues that the trial court plainly erred by failing to properly instruct the jury regarding the two-year statute of limitations applicable to Cougar's securities fraud claims. Specifically, Cypress contends that the court should have instructed the jury \"that Cougar is imputed to know or ought to know that which its agent [i.e., the administrative assistant] knows or ought to know.\" Because we conclude that any alleged error in the jury instructions was not \"obvious to the trial court,\" Cypress has failed to carry its burden of establishing plain error.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b612 The jury was given the following instruction, approved by Cypress at trial, regarding Cypress's statute of limitations defense:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   The statute of limitations governs the amount of time in which a party may bring a claim after the discovery of that claim. For securities fraud, the statute of limitations is two (2) years. [Cougar] filed its complaint on October 17, 2013. If you find that [Cougar] knew of the alleged securities fraud before October 17, 2011, you\n   must find that [Cougar's] securities fraud claim fails in violation of the statute of limitations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Cypress argues that this instruction was insufficient because \"[t]he jury could do nothing with the statute of limitation instruction and undisputed facts without being told, as well, that an agent's knowledge is imputed to the corporation.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Citing\n   <em>\n    State v.

Cypress never proposed the instruction that it now faults the trial court for not providing, nor did it object to the manner in which the court instructed the jury concerning the statute of limitations. To the contrary, Cypress not only stipulated to the relevant jury instruction but requested it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, Cypress has not directed us to anything in the record that shows it alerted the court to its statute of limitations argument based on the administrative assistant's receipt of the 2011 email. Prior to trial, Cypress never moved the court for summary judgment based on its discovery of the 2011 email. Nor, following the conclusion of Cougar's case-in-chief, did Cypress move the court for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to rule 50 based on its statute of limitations argument.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Utah R. Civ. P. 50(a). Indeed, the 2011 email was never even admitted into evidence at trial-it was only briefly alluded to during the direct- and cross-examination of Richard Miller, the owner of the entity that manages Cougar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b614 Against this backdrop, Cypress fails to address how the existence of the 2011 email and its allegedly dispositive legal implications should have been obvious to the trial court. Given how the case was tried, there was nothing in the parties' course of conduct to suggest to the court that an error had occurred, plain or otherwise. Quite the opposite, Cypress's conduct and stipulation to all of the jury instructions would have lulled the court into a sense that the trial was moving forward as it should, pending ultimate resolution by a properly instructed jury. Despite this, Cypress basically asserts that the court should have, on its own initiative, realized that an email that was never entered into evidence and was only fleetingly mentioned in the course of a four-day trial merited an additional jury instruction. We conclude that such a scenario would have been anything but obvious to the trial court. Cypress has therefore failed to establish plain error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b615 As a final point on appeal,\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Robert N. Baxter, one of the principals of Cypress Capital III, LLC, argues that the trial court abused its discretion in holding him in contempt.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 78B-6-301(5) (LexisNexis 2018). \"When reviewing\n   a [trial] court's decision to find a party in contempt, we review the [trial] court's findings of fact for clear error and its legal determinations for correctness.\"\n   <em>\n    Rosser v.

After Cougar learned of the transfer, it sent a letter to Cypress advising that it would seek contempt sanctions against Cypress unless the transferred funds were paid over to Cougar. Baxter, his wife, and their company, Baxter Properties, LLC, then filed a motion to interplead $ 115,000 of the transferred funds and sought a determination that the funds belonged to Baxter Properties-and not to the Baxters. Cougar subsequently filed a motion seeking a contempt determination against Baxter. Following an evidentiary hearing on both motions, the trial court determined that the transferred funds belonged to the Baxters-not Baxter Properties-and, pursuant to Utah Code section 78B-6-301(5), held Baxter in contempt for his violation of the Stay Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b617 Generally, \"to prove contempt for failure to comply with a court order it must be shown that the person cited for contempt knew what was required, had the ability to comply, and intentionally failed or refused to do so.\"\n   <em>\n    LD III, LLC v.

Baxter does not challenge the trial court's determination that he knew of and had the ability to comply with the Stay Order. Rather, he argues that the trial court erred in finding that the transferred funds did not belong to Baxter Properties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b618 Baxter correctly recognizes that, at the evidentiary hearing, he bore the burden of rebutting, by clear and convincing evidence, the presumption that funds in a bank account belong to the owners of that account.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Peterson v.

But instead of discussing the evidence supporting the trial court's finding that he failed to overcome the presumption that the transferred funds belonged to him, Baxter highlights the evidence that supports his contention that the funds belonged to Baxter Properties. He argues that this \"evidence clearly and convincingly demonstrate[d] that the $ 230,000 on deposit in the account was the property of Baxter Prop[erties].\" Because Baxter has not \"adequately marshaled the evidence\" or \"otherwise ... carr[ied] [his] burden in demonstrating clear error,\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   we presume that the evidence supports the trial court's finding\" that the transferred funds belonged to him and his wife.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Grimm v.
