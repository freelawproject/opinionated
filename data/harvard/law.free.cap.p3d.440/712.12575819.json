We conclude that it should, and therefore determine that the prosecutor's probation violation report was timely filed on the last day of Lee Ralph James's probation period. Accordingly, the district court correctly ruled that the justice court had authority to revoke James's probation, and we therefore deny James's petition for extraordinary relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b62 On November 12, 2014, in West Valley City Justice Court, James pled guilty to misdemeanor assault. The court imposed a jail sentence of 180 days, but suspended that sentence and placed James on probation \"for twelve months.\" Among other conditions of probation, the court ordered James not to commit \"violations of the law[,] save perhaps a minor traffic offense.\" Exactly one year later, on November 12, 2015, West Valley City (the City) prosecutors filed an affidavit in support of a motion for order to show cause, alleging that James had violated his probation by, among other things, committing\n   another assault on November 5, 2015, before the expiration of the twelve-month probationary period. After holding an evidentiary hearing, the justice court found James to be in violation of his probation and sentenced him to additional jail time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63 James appealed the justice court's decision to the district court, as is his right under rule 38 of the Utah Rules of Criminal Procedure, and argued that the order to show cause affidavit had been filed at least one day too late. He asserted that the \"twelve-month\" probationary period to which he had been sentenced had expired at midnight (i.e., 11:59 p.m.) on November 11, 2015, and that expiration of that time period deprived both the justice court and the district court of authority to revoke his probation. James further argued that, even though the alleged probation violation had occurred on November 5, during the probationary period, the City's failure to alert the court of that violation before the end of the probationary period deprived the court of authority to take action related to the alleged violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 The district court initially agreed with James and dismissed his case, but later reconsidered its ruling and determined that, as calculated under the method set forth in rule 2 of the Utah Rules of Criminal Procedure, James's probationary period did not expire until midnight (i.e., 11:59 p.m.) on November 12, and the City had therefore timely filed its affidavit. The district court eventually found James in violation of probation and remanded the matter to the justice court, which sentenced James to sixty additional days in jail. Before serving his sixty-day sentence, James filed a petition for extraordinary writ with this court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 James argues that the twelve-month probationary period imposed by the justice court in 2014 expired before the filing of the City's probation violation report, thus divesting the court of power to find him in violation of his probation. \"A court's power to grant, modify, or revoke probation is purely statutory.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

This argument is misguided. As an initial matter, the statute does not define the term \"twelve months,\" or give any indication as to how that period of time is to be computed. Thus, there is no indication, from the statutory language, that defining \"twelve months\" by reference to rule 2 would be contrary to legislative intent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Indeed, the 2014 version of rule 2 applies to \"any period of time\" applicable in a criminal case,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Utah R.

But these facts do not mean that James's probationary period, if computed according to rule 2, would be for a period longer than \"twelve months.\" As noted, the 2014 version of rule 2 applies to \"any period of time\" applicable in a criminal case,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Utah R. Crim.

Crim. P. 1(b) (stating that the rules \"shall govern the procedure in all criminal cases\"), and posits that the computation of his probationary period is a substantive (rather than a procedural) matter. The computation of time strikes us as an intuitively procedural matter,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Shady Grove Orthopedic Assocs., P.A. v. Allstate Ins.

As an initial matter, James reads too much into rule 1(b) : that rule's mention of the uncontroversial fact that the rules of criminal procedure govern procedural\n   issues should not be read to exclude the possibility that the rules might also include discussion of some substantive issues. Examination of the rules as a whole reveals that they include discussion of a number of issues that arguably could be considered substantive, or that at least have significant constitutional implications.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12447674,3582260\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/393/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   R. 7B(b) (discussing the probable cause standard that applies at preliminary hearings);\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12447674,3582260\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/393/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   R. 8(a) (stating that a defendant \"has the right to self representation, and if indigent, has the right to court-appointed counsel\" in most cases);\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12447674,3582260\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/393/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   R. 40(b) (stating that \"[p]roperty or evidence may be seized pursuant to a search warrant if there is probable cause to believe\" that the property was unlawfully acquired or is connected to illegal conduct).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b613 Moreover, although to our knowledge no Utah appellate court has spoken on this matter, federal courts have applied their analogous rule-based time-counting methodology to the computation of probationary time periods.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v.

And without a statutory limit on the length of probation, the application of rule 2 to this case does not, as James contends, \"alter, expand or modify the substantive law.\" Indeed, as the probation statute has been interpreted by our supreme court, the legislature gave the courts the power to sentence defendants to probation for any amount of time the courts see fit, and the courts' decision to define how that time period should generally be computed-absent a more specific provision in the applicable court order-strikes us as entirely in keeping with the mandates of the substantive law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b615 James was sentenced to \"twelve months\" probation on November 12, 2014.

James is correct that Utah case law indicates that probationary periods cannot be indefinite.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     State v. Candedo\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6993260\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/232/1008/\">\n     2010 UT 32\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , \u00b6 22,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6993260\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/232/1008/\">\n     232 P.3d 1008\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (stating that \"defendants ... are not held under probation indefinitely\"). But defining the time period through the lens of rule 2 does not make the period indefinite; indeed, rule 2 provides a uniform, predictable way to compute such periods. Moreover, James goes too far when he implies that applying rule 2 to computation of probationary periods would allow the prosecuting entity to make motions, pursuant to rule 2(b), to extend the time period. It does not necessarily follow, simply from application of rule 2(a) to this situation, that rule 2(b) would also apply. The federal courts, in interpreting the analogous rule 6 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, have held that, while the time-counting provisions of rule 6(a) are used to define statutory limitation periods, courts may not use the other provisions of rule 6 to extend periods of time beyond those set by Congress.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Argentine Republic v.

Cir. 2011) (per curiam) (\"Every court to have considered this question has held that Rule 6(b) may be used only to extend time limits imposed by the court itself or by other Federal Rules, but not by statute.\").\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    In his briefing, James does not do much to address the complexities of the substance-procedure distinction, which can be a \"slippery\" one.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     State v.
