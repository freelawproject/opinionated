A joint stipulation signed by respondent and the office of the Disciplinary Administrator was filed September 18, 2018. A hearing was held on the complaint before a panel of the Kansas Board for Discipline of Attorneys on September 21, 2018, where the respondent was personally present and represented by counsel.

'It is professional misconduct for a lawyer to ... commit a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyer's honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer in other respects.' KRPC 8.4(b). The respondent has been convicted of driving while intoxicated in Missouri on four occasions. The respondent's last conviction was classified as a class E felony. The respondent's convictions adversely reflect on the respondent's fitness as a lawyer. Accordingly, the hearing panel concludes that the respondent violated KRPC 8.4(b).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   \" KRPC 8.4(d)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   \"36.

The respondent engaged in conduct that was prejudicial to the administration of justice when he went to the municipal courthouse on March 11, 2016, while intoxicated and was unable to represent the city at the scheduled hearings. Additionally, the respondent engaged in conduct that was prejudicial to the administration of justice when he failed to appear in court as scheduled on July 28, 2016, in 10 juvenile offender and child-in-need-of-care cases. As such, the hearing panel concludes that the respondent violated KRPC 8.4(d).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   \" KRPC 8.4(g)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   \"37.

The respondent engaged in other conduct that adversely reflects on his fitness to practice when he drove after his license was revoked and when he violated the terms of probation and bond. Thus, the hearing panel concludes that the respondent violated KRPC 8.4(g).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   \" Rule 203(c)(1)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   \"38.

The respondent, however, failed to notify the disciplinary administrator of the charge as required by Rule 203(c)(1).

Finally, the hearing panel recommends that the respondent be required to undergo a reinstatement hearing under Rule 219 prior to the consideration of a petition for reinstatement.

With no exceptions before us, the panel's findings of fact are deemed admitted. Supreme Court Rule 212(c), (d) (2019 Kan. S. Ct. R. 261). Furthermore, the facts before the hearing panel establish by clear and convincing evidence the charged misconduct in violation of KRPC 8.4(b) (2019 Kan. S. Ct. R. 387) (commission of a criminal act reflecting adversely on the lawyer's honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer); 8.4(d) (misconduct prejudicial to the administration of justice); 8.4(g) (misconduct that adversely reflects on the lawyer's fitness to practice law); and Supreme Court Rule 203(c)(1) (2019 Kan.

We therefore adopt the panel's findings and conclusions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The only remaining issue before us is the appropriate discipline for respondent's violations. The hearing panel recommended that respondent be suspended from the practice of law for a period of 18 months, retroactive to July 13, 2018, the date respondent was temporarily suspended. The hearing panel also recommended that respondent be required to undergo a reinstatement hearing under Rule 219 (2019 Kan. S. Ct. R. 270). At the hearing before this court, at which the respondent appeared, the office of the Disciplinary Administrator recommended that the respondent be indefinitely suspended. The respondent requested a temporary suspension, that the suspension be suspended, and that he be allowed to practice under the terms of his proposed plan of probation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   It is clear to all on the court that respondent has made significant strides to address the ethical lapses in his life that led to the violations. Those violations, however, were serious in nature. Though every disciplinary case is unique and will turn on its specific\n   facts, we are informed by our prior decisions addressing similar circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Although a felony DUI conviction is not a breach of professional duty to a client, it violates KRPC 8.4(b) because it is a violation of the attorney's \"primary duty to the court and the bar, and it erodes the public confidence in the judicial system.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Laskowski\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4252073\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/282/710/#p713\">\n    282 Kan. 710\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 713-14,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4252073\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/282/710/#p713\">\n    147 P.3d 135\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2006). It is expected that the \"trust and confidence placed on those that practice law also requires compliance with the law.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Frahm\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4148128\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/291/520/#p527\">\n    291 Kan. 520\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 527,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4148128\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/291/520/#p527\">\n    241 P.3d 1010\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010). And when noncompliance with the law results in a felony DUI conviction, this court has imposed sanctions varying from indefinite suspension to a two-year suspension from practicing law. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Laskowski\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4252073\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/282/710/#p713\">\n    282 Kan. at 713-14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4252073\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/282/710/#p713\">\n    147 P.3d 135\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (suspending attorney from the practice of law indefinitely after receiving a felony DUI);\n   <em>\n    In re Johns\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4148846\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/291/638/#p644\">\n    291 Kan. 638\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 644,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4148846\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/291/638/#p644\">\n    243 P.3d 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010) (suspending attorney for two years after receiving a felony DUI conviction).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The varying sanctions imposed by this court result from a careful consideration of mitigating and aggravating facts in each case. This court has imposed less serious sanctions where the respondent has shown accountability by self-reporting their criminal conviction to the office of the Disciplinary Administrator, entering into a monitoring agreement with the Kansas Lawyers Assistance Program, and attending AA meetings.\n   <em>\n    Johns\n   </em>\n   , 291 Kan. at 639,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4148846\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/291/638/#p644\">\n    243 P.3d 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
