The RMC is the United Methodist denomination's regional representative in Utah.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b62 In 2012, a group of TUMC members purported to amend TUMC's articles of incorporation by removing any reference to the United Methodist Church and changing the corporation's name to the Laumalie Ma'oni'oni Free Wesleyan Church of Tonga (Free Wesleyan).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Prior to these changes, Etimani Ma'afu was the president of TUMC's board of directors, but the amendments\n   purported to remove him from that position. Free Wesleyan filed a claim against Ma'afu in the district court, seeking an injunction forbidding him from acting on behalf of the corporation and a declaratory judgment that Free Wesleyan was the only entity entitled to control church property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63 The RMC, joined by various parties affiliated with the United Methodist Church, filed a separate lawsuit arguing that Free Wesleyan's actions were invalid and unenforceable because the dissident members did not comply with TUMC's governing documents. The RMC also claimed that, even if the dissident members' actions were proper, those members were not entitled to use the local church property because it was held in trust by TUMC for the benefit of the United Methodist denomination. The RMC's case was consolidated with Free Wesleyan's case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 After discovery, the district court granted Ma'afu and the RMC's joint motion for summary judgment, determining that Free Wesleyan's actions were not authorized under TUMC's governing documents. The court then entered a final judgment restoring TUMC \"to how it existed prior to the improper corporate acts.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 Free Wesleyan appeals. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b66 The United Methodist Church is \"a 'connectional' network of distinct, but affiliated entities known as local churches, charges, conferences, boards, commissions and agencies.\" The denomination has a \"hierarchical\" structure\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   consisting of multiple tiers, and each affiliated entity is subject to a higher authority within that multi-tier structure. Thus, although local churches are incorporated as individual entities, they are members of a \"regional conference,\" which charters the local church and oversees the local congregation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b67 Within the United Methodist Church, each of the affiliated entities is required to follow the denomination's governing document: The Book of Discipline (the Discipline). In addition to detailing religious doctrine, the Discipline establishes requirements for governance of the local churches and procedures for implementing changes at the local level.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b68 Under the Discipline, decisions regarding local churches are made by two groups: the Charge Conference and the Church Conference. The Charge Conference is the \"connecting link between the local church and the general Church.\" That is, it serves as the local \"unit in the connectional system of the United Methodist Church.\" The Charge Conference consists of a \"church council\" made up of elected local church members and \"any others as may be designated in the Discipline.\" At annual or special meetings, the Charge Conference elects officers of the local congregation, authorizes property transfers, and makes other major decisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b69 The Church Conference \"encourage[s] broader participation by members of the church\" by \"extending the vote\" on any issue generally decided by the Charge Conference \"to all professing members of the local [congregation].\" A Church Conference may be called \"at the discretion of the district superintendent or following a written request to the district superintendent by ... the pastor, the church council, or 10 percent of the professing membership of the local [congregation].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b610 The Discipline requires any meeting of the Charge Conference or the Church Conference to be called and presided over by the district superintendent. Regardless of the type of meeting, the Discipline does not authorize voting by proxy or mail-in voting. Instead, at a Charge Conference, \"[t]he members present and voting at any duly announced meeting shall constitute a quorum.\" And at a Church Conference, the vote\n   extends \"to all professing members of the local church present at [the] meetings.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b611 The Discipline also establishes that all \"properties of the United Methodist local churches ... are held,\n   <em>\n    in trust\n   </em>\n   , for the benefit of the entire denomination, and ownership and usage of church property is subject to the\n   <em>\n    Discipline\n   </em>\n   .\" The Discipline authorizes regional conferences to bring suit in their own names to protect and enforce denominational interests in matters of local church property, governance, and operations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b612 Utah's regional conference is the RMC. In 1978, the RMC chartered a local congregation in Salt Lake City-TUMC-and appointed a minister to oversee the congregation. Under the RMC's direction, TUMC filed its original articles of incorporation (the Original Articles) with the State of Utah. The Original Articles included these provisions: (1) \"The purpose for which the corporation is organized is to conduct and operate a United Methodist Church and congregation according to the Discipline\"; (2) \"All title to real property bought and sold by the [c]orporation shall be in full conformity with the Discipline\"; (3) \"The internal affairs of the corporation shall be managed and controlled by the Board of Trustees of the corporation. The bylaws ... may be amended by the board ..., provided that they remain in accord with these Articles of Incorporation and with the Discipline\"; (4) \"The Board of Trustees shall consist of the members of the Board of Trustees of the Tongan United Methodist Church of Salt Lake City, elected and organized as prescribed in the Discipline\"; and (5) \"Upon dissolution, all net assets and property transfer to the [RMC].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b613 A provision in the Original Articles titled \"Amendments\" provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   These [Original Articles] may be amended by the vote of at least two-thirds of the members of the corporation present at the annual meeting or at a special meeting of the corporation called for that purpose.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b614 After its incorporation, TUMC operated as a local congregation of the United Methodist Church for thirty-four years. In conformity with the Discipline, it elected officers, purchased property, and held annual Charge Conferences, presided over by the district superintendent. In 2012, as the result of a dispute between the RMC and the local congregation, a group of local leaders attempted to disaffiliate TUMC from the United Methodist Church. They proposed amendments to the Original Articles that removed any reference to the United Methodist Church or the Discipline, and changed the corporation's name to Free Wesleyan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b615 TUMC's corporate secretary sent a letter titled \"Important Corporate Notice Regarding Proposed Amendments to Articles of Incorporation\" to all local members. The letter explained the proposed amendments and directed members to vote yes or no on an attached ballot and mail it to the corporation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b616 When the RMC learned of the mail-in vote, it sent a letter to the local congregation informing it that the results of the vote \"will not be valid and will be legally unenforceable\" because the vote \"does not comply\" with the \"process for calling and holding a church membership meeting\" as established by the Discipline. The letter specified that a Church Conference must be called and presided over by the district superintendent and held in person, and that \"[t]he only votes that count are those cast by eligible church members in attendance at a properly called meeting.\" It also stated that the proposed amendments would not \"allow the new church to take the [local congregation's] property and building\" because, \"[u]nder the [Discipline], all church property is owned by the local church\n   <em>\n    in trust for\n   </em>\n   The United Methodist Church.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b617 Despite the RMC's letter, the local leaders proceeded with the mail-in vote, and the proposed amendments were approved by two-thirds of the members. Based on the results, the local members purported to elect a new board of directors, and the board filed the amended articles of incorporation (the Amended Articles) with the Division of Corporations and Commercial Code (the Division).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b618 At the time of the mail-in vote, Ma'afu was the president of TUMC's board of directors, but he was removed from that position under the Amended Articles. Ma'afu refused to recognize the amendments and\n   continued to use local church property and withdraw funds from the local church's account.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b619 In response to Ma'afu's actions, on the same day the Division received the Amended Articles, Free Wesleyan filed with the district court a claim against Ma'afu seeking a declaratory judgment \"with respect to the rights, status, and other legal relations between the parties.\" Free Wesleyan also asked for a temporary restraining order forbidding Ma'afu from representing \"that he is an authorized agent of the Corporation,\" and sought damages for \"the value of the property converted by [Ma'afu]\" and an award of costs and attorney fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b620 The RMC filed a motion to intervene in the case. The motion cited provisions from the Discipline that authorize the RMC \"to bring suit and intervene in its own name to protect denominational interests in matters of local church governance, operations and property.\" It claimed that the United Methodist Church held an irrevocable trust in the local church property, and asserted that the \"property is necessarily affected by the purported amendment to [the Original Articles]\" and the dissident members' efforts to assume control of the property and spend the church's assets. The district court granted the motion to intervene, concluding that the RMC had \"alleged a sufficient interest ... to intervene as a matter of right.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b621 The RMC also contested before the Division TUMC's filing of the Amended Articles. In a letter, it asked the Division to \"conduct whatever investigation you deem appropriate to determine the validity of the contested filings.\" The RMC also asked the Division to change the principals of the corporation back to the principals who were in place before the mail-in vote.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b622 After receiving the RMC's objections, the Division sent a letter to counsel for the parties, stating that the Division was \"unable to clearly establish whether the filings were made with authority or not.\" It therefore took the filings on \"good faith,\" but placed on hold all contested changes until it received \"a court order or a notarized document signed by all parties that specifically states the name of the non-profit corporation and the roster of officers and directors.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b623 Free Wesleyan informed the Division that it intended to challenge the decision to place the changes on hold. At the Division's request, Free Wesleyan produced affidavits from its members stating that they agreed to adopt the Amended Articles. The Division then removed the \"hold\" and accepted the Amended Articles. A note in the Division's records says, \"Although Principals still in dispute, renewal authorized.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b624 The Division issued Free Wesleyan new \"Certificates of Existence.\" The certificates listed the new corporate name and certified that Free Wesleyan was \"authorized to transact business and was duly registered under the laws of the State of Utah,\" had \"paid all fees and penalties owed,\" had filed \"its most recent annual report,\" and had not filed \"Articles of Dissolution.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b625 Later, the RMC filed a separate district court action against Free Wesleyan, seeking a declaratory judgment that the mail-in vote was not authorized and that \"its claimed results are null and void.\" In response, Free Wesleyan filed a motion to consolidate the RMC's action with its own. The motion said that each of the parties claim the \"control and access to the same property,\" and \"[c]onsolidation will enable one Court to adjudicate all issues that have been raised as to the Church Property in one action.\" It also noted that the district court would \"necessarily decide\" all of the parties' claims by \"determining whether the [Church] ... properly amended its articles of incorporation and changed its name.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 78B-6-403(1) (LexisNexis 2018) (\"When declaratory relief is sought all persons shall be made parties who have or claim any interest which would be affected by the declaration ....\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b626 The district court granted Free Wesleyan's motion to consolidate the two actions. After discovery, the RMC and Ma'afu filed a joint motion for partial summary judgment. They argued that Free Wesleyan's actions, including electing a new board and filing the Amended Articles, were invalid because the mail-in vote did not comply with the Discipline, which, according to them, had been\n   incorporated by reference into the Original Articles. They asked the district court to issue an order invalidating the changes and restoring the corporation's name and principals to what they had been before the mail-in vote.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b627 Free Wesleyan opposed the motion on three grounds. First, it argued that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the RMC and Ma'afu failed to exhaust their administrative remedies with the Division. Second, it asserted that the RMC and Ma'afu lacked standing because they were not members of the corporation and had no independent interest in its internal actions. Third, it argued that the Amended Articles were valid because they were approved according to the procedures detailed in the corporation's governing documents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b628 The district court granted the motion for partial summary judgment. It rejected Free Wesleyan's exhaustion of administrative remedies argument, stating that \"the Division made no determination regarding the parties' rights, the validity of the vote by mail, or the [Amended] Articles.\" Thus, there was nothing \"before the Court to indicate this action should be considered as an appeal from a determination made by the Division.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b629 Next, the court determined that it \"need not decide whether the RMC or [Ma'afu] would have standing to bring their claims\" because Free Wesleyan placed the validity of its actions at issue when it asserted its claims against Ma'afu. Thus, the RMC and Ma'afu had \"the ability to file any relevant motions regarding the subject matter of [Free Wesleyan's] claims.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b630 The court then analyzed whether Free Wesleyan's actions were valid under the corporation's governing documents. Recognizing the constitutional restraints of a dispute over church property, the court based its determination on \"sources that do not implicate matters of church doctrine.\" (Citing\n   <em>\n    Jones v. Wolf\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6184346\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/443/595/#p603\">\n    443 U.S. 595\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 603,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6184346\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/443/595/#p603\">\n    99 S.Ct. 3020\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6184346\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/443/595/#p603\">\n    61 L.Ed.2d 775\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1979).) The court stated that, if it were to ignore the provisions of the Discipline, Free Wesleyan's actions likely were valid. (Citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2016\">\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -6a-709 (LexisNexis 2013) (allowing nonprofit corporations to hold special meetings and hold votes by mail, \"[u]nless otherwise provided by the bylaws\").) But the court concluded the Discipline was \"expressly incorporated by reference into the Original Articles.\" Thus, to \"give full effect to all the provisions of the Original Articles,\" the court read \"the Original Articles to require compliance with the Discipline before holding a special meeting or attempting to amend the [Original Articles].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b631 And because \"[n]either the vote by mail nor the meeting held by the board of directors before holding the vote complied with the Discipline\"-the meeting was not called by the conference superintendent nor were the voting members physically present at the meeting-\"[n]one of the subsequent Corporate Actions were undertaken with authority\" and were therefore invalid. After granting the motion for partial summary judgment, the court concluded that the other issues raised by the parties, \"including the competing claims regarding ownership of church property,\" were moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b632 The RMC notified the Division of the district court's decision, and the Division rescinded the Amended Articles, reinstated the Original Articles, and reverted the corporation's name and officers of record to those in place prior to the mail-in vote. Thereafter, the district court entered a final judgment in which it invalidated Free Wesleyan's actions and \"restored the corporation to how it existed prior to the improper corporate acts.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b633 Free Wesleyan appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   ISSUES AND STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b634 Free Wesleyan appeals the district court's judgment on three grounds.

On appeal, Free Wesleyan does not challenge the RMC's intervention, and we see no reason to conclude it was improper. Free Wesleyan asserted in its complaint that it had legally disaffiliated from the United Methodist denomination and asked the district court for a declaration that\n   it is the only entity authorized to control the local church property, \"including granting or denying access to any person desiring to enter and/or occupy [it].\" With that declaration, Free Wesleyan seeks to prevent local United Methodist members from accessing the church property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   \u00b655 The RMC claims a denominational trust interest in the local church property and argues that Free Wesleyan's actions to enjoin its use as a United Methodist church and convert it to a Free Wesleyan church violate that trust. \"When declaratory relief is sought all persons shall be made parties who have or claim any interest which would be affected by the declaration.\" Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 78B-6-403(1) (LexisNexis 2018). As the district court noted in its summary judgment ruling, determining the validity of Free Wesleyan's corporate actions \"could affect the RMC's rights and interests to the [church property] and the rights of the members of the [local] church that the RMC purports to represent.\" Thus, as an intervenor-defendant, the RMC has standing to file motions presenting arguments relevant to Free Wesleyan's claims. And as previously discussed, Free Wesleyan's declaratory judgment action turns on whether its corporate actions were valid under the Original Articles. Accordingly, the RMC has standing to argue that Free Wesleyan's corporate actions were invalid.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6993245\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/232/999/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   \u00b656 The RMC also has standing as a plaintiff in the consolidated case. In its lawsuit against Free Wesleyan, the RMC, along with other parties affiliated with the United Methodist Church, claimed that Free Wesleyan and its members \"believe that they are able to transfer and take control of all church property contrary to the Discipline.\" (Emphasis omitted.) In support of that claim, the RMC asserted that Free Wesleyan has \"taken possession of real and personal property owned by [TUMC]; sequestered and spent funds of [TUMC]; effected name changes to ownership records of real and personal property owned by [TUMC]; and otherwise purported to assume use of and control over [TUMC]'s primary place of worship.\" And \"absent a court order, [Free Wesleyan] will not deliver possession of the property at issue to [the RMC] or to ... the local church members who have retained their affiliation with the [United Methodist Church].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   \u00b657 In Utah, the RMC is authorized to enforce the United Methodist Church's denominational interests in matters of local church property, governance, and operations. In that capacity, it has standing to enforce its claimed denominational trust and assert that Free Wesleyan improperly claims \"ownership and control\" of the local church property.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6993245\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/232/999/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 78B-6-401(1) (LexisNexis 2018) (\"Each district court has the power to issue declaratory judgments determining rights, status, and other legal relations within its respective jurisdiction.\"). Indeed, as the district court recognized in its summary judgment ruling, a determination of the validity of Free Wesleyan's corporate actions \"would necessarily resolve all of the parties' claims.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   \u00b658 Free Wesleyan's motion to consolidate the RMC's action with its own action further supports our conclusion that the RMC has standing. In that motion, Free Wesleyan asserted that each of the parties claim the right over the \"control and access to the same property,\" and \"[c]onsolidation will enable one Court to adjudicate all issues that have been raised as to the Church Property in one action.\" It also noted that the district court would necessarily decide all of the parties' claims by \"determining whether [Free Wesleyan] properly amended its articles of incorporation and changed its name.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   \u00b659 Free Wesleyan, Ma'afu, and the RMC each claim an interest in the local church property. And a determination of Free Wesleyan's corporate actions is essential to each of those claims. Thus, we conclude that the RMC and Ma'afu have standing to challenge the validity of Free Wesleyan's corporate actions, including the Amended Articles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   B. Statutory Standing\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   \u00b660 Free Wesleyan argues that the Act prohibits the RMC and Ma'afu from challenging the validity of the corporation's actions. It notes that, \"in certain instances, statutory provisions may preempt the traditional elements of standing whereby only those specifically granted standing under the statute may assert standing.\" (Citing\n   <em>\n    R.P. v.

That section governs challenges to a nonprofit corporation's \"ultra vires\" acts. It provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   (1) Except as provided in Subsection (2), the validity of corporate action may not be challenged on the ground that the nonprofit corporation lacks or lacked power to act.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   (2) A nonprofit corporation's power to act may be challenged: (a) in a proceeding against the nonprofit corporation to enjoin the act brought by: (i) a director; or (ii) one or more voting members in a derivative proceeding; (b) in a proceeding by or in the right of the nonprofit corporation, whether directly, derivatively, or through a receiver, trustee, or other legal representative, against an incumbent or former director, officer, employee, or agent of the nonprofit corporation; or (c) in a proceeding by the attorney general under Section 16-6a-1414.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2016\">\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -6a-304(1) - (2) (LexisNexis 2013).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   \u00b662 After reviewing section 16-6a-304, we conclude that, in this case, it does not preempt traditional standing. As the RMC and Ma'afu note in their brief, Free Wesleyan-as the corporation-initiated this case \"to determine the 'respective ownership, rights and obligations' of the parties based on the mail-in [vote] initiated by the dissident members.\" That is, in its lawsuit against Ma'afu-a former director, according to Free Wesleyan-the corporation requested a declaratory judgment determining whether the mail-in vote and the subsequent corporate actions were valid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   \u00b663 \"The primary purpose of [ section 16-6a-304 ] ... is to eliminate a corporation's ability to avoid its obligations to third parties by raising a defense of ultra vires.\"\n   <em>\n    Reedeker v.

Thus, notwithstanding section 16-6a-304, we conclude that Ma'afu and the RMC-as parties to Free Wesleyan's action-have standing to challenge the validity of the mail-in vote as well as the subsequent corporate actions, including the Amended Articles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   \u00b665 Next, Free Wesleyan asserts that the RMC and Ma'afu \"make several claims that are claims owned by the Corporation\" and argues that, under the Act, such claims must be brought in a derivative proceeding. The Act establishes that \"a proceeding may be brought in the right of a nonprofit corporation\" by \"a voting member\" of the corporation or \"a director in a nonprofit corporation that does not have voting members.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2016\">\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -6a-612(1) (LexisNexis 2013). According to Free Wesleyan, section \"16-6a-612 is fatal to the RMC [and Ma'afu's] claims\" because they \"are not voting members of the Corporation and did not comply with this section of the Act.\" That is, it argues that the RMC and Ma'afu \"are precluded by [ section] 16-6a-612 from having standing to raise [their] claims.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   \u00b666 We also reject this argument. Contrary to Free Wesleyan's assertions, the RMC and Ma'afu do not assert derivative claims.

Summary Judgment\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   \u00b668 Free Wesleyan contends on two grounds that the district court erred in granting partial summary judgment to the RMC and Ma'afu. First, it argues the district court erred in determining that the mail-in vote was not authorized under the corporation's governing documents. Second, it argues that the district court's interpretation and application of the Discipline violated the corporation's and the corporation's members' constitutional rights.

Free Wesleyan does not point to any evidence to support that claim. Instead, it points to the absence of proof, claiming \"there is no evidence that the terms of the Discipline were ever provided to the members of the Corporation\" and \"without evidence to the contrary,\" it argues, \"the proper inference is that the terms of the Discipline were not known or easily available.\" But contrary to Free Wesleyan's assertion, the undisputed evidence before the district court supported its conclusion that the terms of the Discipline were known or easily available to the corporation and its members when the Original Articles were executed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   \u00b673 To become affiliated with the United Methodist Church, local congregations must agree to adhere to and follow the Discipline. The evidence in this case establishes that the corporation and its members agreed to this requirement when they executed the Original Articles. Indeed, the corporation's stated purpose \"is to conduct and operate a United Methodist Church and congregation according to the Discipline.\" The Original Articles also state that \"[a]ll title to real property bought and sold by the [c]orporation shall be in full conformity with the Discipline,\" that the internal affairs of the corporation and the corporation's bylaws must \"remain in accord with ... the Discipline,\" and that \"[t]he Board of Trustees shall ... [be] elected and organized as prescribed in the Discipline.\" Additionally, the same year the Original Articles were executed, the corporation purchased property, and the grantor required the property to be \"used, kept and maintained as a place of divine worship ... subject to the Discipline.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   \u00b674 Following incorporation, the local congregation functioned according to the Discipline for more than thirty years. Of particular relevance here, it conducted annual Charge Conferences, which were presided over by the district superintendent. This is not surprising, given that the Discipline is the governing document of the United Methodist Church, is published every four years, and is made available to local congregations. Because TUMC was a self-professed affiliate of the United Methodist Church, it is unreasonable to infer that the corporation and its members did not have access to the Discipline when the Original Articles were executed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Surety Underwriters v.

In resolving the dispute, the court looked to the corporation's governing documents, \"without inquiring into matters of church doctrine.\" The Discipline requires any meeting of the Charge Conference or the Church Conference to be presided over and called by the district superintendent. The Discipline does not authorize mail-in voting.
