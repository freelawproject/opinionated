(collectively, Westgate) appeal the district court's ruling that a document outside the \"Declaration of Condominium and Declaration of Covenants, Conditions and Restrictions\" (the Declaration) for the condominium was enforceable under the doctrines of promissory estoppel and ratification. The Lodge at Westgate Park City Resort and Spa Condominium Association Inc. (the Association) appeals the district court's determination that the term \"Common Areas and Facilities\" under the Declaration is limited to the building's foundation. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b62 Westgate is the developer of a resort in Park City, Utah. The resort includes timeshare units as well as whole ownership units. Construction of the whole ownership portion began in 2006 and is known as the Lodge at Westgate Park City Resort &amp; Spa (the Project).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63 Westgate started selling condominium units at the Project before construction commenced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The parties do not dispute that \"prospective purchasers received [a] draft [of] [the Declaration], the Purchase &amp; Sale Agreement, the Bylaws of the Association, the Association's Articles of Incorporation, and an estimated budget for assessments for 2007.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b64 The Purchase &amp; Sale Agreement informed purchasers that the Project was in a pre-construction phase, stating \"the buyer acknowledges that the seller has disclosed to the buyer that a final subdivision map for the condominium has not yet been approved and recorded.\" The Purchase &amp; Sale Agreement further disclosed that \"the budget was only an estimate and that actual costs for the line items were subject to change.\" The Declaration was recorded in 2007.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b65 The Project was completed in 2008. The 2009 budget was the first to be prepared for the Project in its fully operational form. The proposed 2009 budget was substantially higher than the 2007 estimated budget and the 2008 budget.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   By this time, condominium sales had mostly come to a stop due to the collapsed national economy. Many owners were upset by the proposed 2009 budget. \"More than 40 owners called and/or emailed the Resort's General Manager [ (General Manager) ] and members of his team ... expressing their dissatisfaction with and rejection of the proposed budget.\" \"The predominant sentiment of the owners was to try to work out a solution with Westgate rather than pursue litigation, although litigation was definitely an option for many of the owners.\" Some owners met with attorneys to explore legal alternatives. A group of owners retained counsel and threatened legal action against Westgate. The Chief Operating Officer (COO) of Westgate was aware of these threats.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b66 Dissatisfaction among the owners caused General Manager to set up a \"conference call with all interested owners to explore solutions to the problems created by the proposed 2009 budget.\" During the conference call, General Manager requested that the owners establish a group which became known as the Owners Finance Committee (the OFC). The OFC's purpose \"was to work with Westgate to achieve a mutual agreement between the developer and the homeowner[s] with regards to the budget ... start[ing] with cost allocation methodologies and continu[ing] to the HOA fee.\" General Manager notified COO about the OFC and of his efforts to resolve the budget concerns with the OFC. COO expressed his approval of the committee and \"encouraged an on-going dialogue between Westgate and the OFC.\" Neither Westgate nor any of the owners objected to the formation or composition of the OFC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b67 Over the next five months, the OFC and Westgate met \"essentially weekly\" to work on a compromise budget and methodology. Throughout the process the OFC reported its progress to General Manager and solicited feedback from the owners. General Manager also reported the progress to Westgate's senior management (including COO). During the negotiations, the OFC requested to meet with COO to discuss various issues with the proposed 2009 budget. Before the meeting, General Manager provided COO with a summary of his meetings with the OFC, including the issues they had resolved. General Manager told COO that \"he had been able to forestall a class action lawsuit by forming the OFC and working with it in good faith to resolve the budget crisis.\" COO met with several members of the OFC in July 2009.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b68 On November 6, 2009, General Manager sent a letter to all the owners and Westgate stating that there were still some issues to be resolved. It stated that \"[t]he methodology outlined in the [Budget] exhibits applies to all future budget preparation and will be the guideline on how we decide on expenses moving forward on the 2010 budget and thereafter.\" The letter also stated \"[t]here may be some inconsistencies in various condominium documents but the [Budget] exhibits take precedent over those for the associated budget items.\" Around November 19, 2009, one of the members of the OFC sent an amended budget document to General Manager. He\n   responded by email, stating it \"looked great and it look[ed] like everything [was] covered as discussed.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b69 The OFC met with General Manager on November 23, 2009, and General Manager signed each page of the finalized budget document (the 2009 Budget Methodology). The district court's findings of fact stated, \"Westgate ... and the OFC understood that the [2009 Budget Methodology] was inconsistent with the [Declaration] in many particulars. That is why [the November 6, 2009 letter] stated that the [2009 Budget Methodology] took precedence over the inconsistent provisions in the Declaration.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b610 The 2009 Budget Methodology determined the Project's budgets for the next four years. During these years, Westgate never disavowed the November 6, 2009 letter and did not inform the OFC or the owners that the 2009 Budget Methodology was invalid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b611 Throughout the negotiation process up to the date the 2009 Budget Methodology was signed, \"Westgate was aware that several condominium owners had consulted or were continuing to consult counsel\" regarding the increased proposed budget. But once the 2009 Budget Methodology went into effect, not a single owner filed a lawsuit against Westgate. The owners relied on the 2009 Budget Methodology and, with this reliance, let the statutes of limitation lapse on their various claims. The owners also paid their retroactive assessments to Westgate for the years 2009 to 2013 in reliance on the 2009 Budget Methodology.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b612 Around 2013, a fresh dispute arose between Westgate and the owners after new management took over operation of the resort. The dispute began because the budget for 2013 deviated from the 2009 Budget Methodology in a number of ways.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Association filed a lawsuit against Westgate and Westgate counterclaimed. Westgate and the Association each filed cross-motions for a preliminary injunction. The court held a hearing on the motions and ordered the parties to abide by the 2009 Budget Methodology during the pendency of the litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b613 After a bench trial, the district court issued findings of fact and conclusions of law and ruled that the 2009 Budget Methodology was enforceable under the doctrines of promissory estoppel and ratification.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The parties moved to amend and clarify the findings of fact and conclusions of law, and the court amended its findings. A final judgment was entered in 2017 and each side appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   ISSUES AND STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b614 We address two of the issues Westgate raises on appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   First, Westgate\n   argues the Association does not have standing to seek enforcement of the 2009 Budget Methodology because the court determined \"that the owners, not the Association, relied upon Westgate's promise and ratified Westgate's conduct.\" \"Whether a party has standing is primarily a question of law, which we review for correctness.\"\n   <em>\n    Edwards v. Powder Mountain Water and Sewer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6994886\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/214/120/\">\n    2009 UT App 185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 10,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6994886\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/214/120/\">\n    214 P.3d 120\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b615 Second, it contends the facts of the case preclude the district court from enforcing the 2009 Budget Methodology under the doctrine of promissory estoppel. Promissory estoppel is a doctrine of equitable relief, which presents \"mixed questions of fact and law.\"\n   <em>\n    Richards v. Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6993974\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/222/69/\">\n    2009 UT App 315\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 11,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6993974\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/222/69/\">\n    222 P.3d 69\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation simplified).

First, it contends the district court erred \"by interpreting the Declaration to limit the [Condominium's] common areas and facilities to [the Project's] foundation contrary to the Declaration's own provisions and the Utah Condominium Ownership Act.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b617 Second, the Association contends the district court \"erred by ignoring the evidence that the parties to [the 2009 Budget Methodology] intended all budget categories, including the amenities use fee, to be subject to a future increase[ ] clause, and by reducing damages awarded to the [Association] for excess fees charged by Westgate.\" \"We interpret the provisions of the Declaration as we would a contract.\"\n   <em>\n    B.

Ample evidence supports enforcing the 2009 Budget Methodology under the theory of promissory estoppel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   III. The Cross-appeal\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b632 In its cross-appeal the Association argues the district court made three errors. Additional factual context is necessary to understand each of these arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b633 The Association first argues that the court made an erroneous factual determination that the Declaration limited \"Common Areas and Facilities\" to the building's foundation. In its complaint, the Association sought declaratory and injunctive relief that the Association, not Westgate, controls the common areas of the Project. The district court dismissed this cause of action finding that the common areas are controlled by Westgate under the Declaration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b634 The Association next argues the district court erred in its finding that the \"Amenities Use Fee\" of the 2009 Budget Methodology is not subject to a future increases clause. As part of the sales launch for the Project, potential purchasers were informed they would be able to use amenities from existing projects for a fee instead of having to build new amenities. The 2007 budget provided to the potential purchasers included an Amenities Use Fee. The proposed 2009 budget kept the Amenities Use Fee the same as the 2007 budget but the owners' use of amenities and the fees they would pay were further negotiated as part of the 2009 Budget Methodology. During negotiations the Association wanted to keep the Amenities Use Fee the same for 2010 to 2011 and afterwards have the fee subject to a future increases clause. But the future increases clause did not appear on the finalized 2009 Budget Methodology. The Association argued the reason the agreement regarding the future increases clause did not appear on the finalized 2009 Budget Methodology is that the Amenities Use Fee agreement was provided as a pdf file and the OFC did not know how to merge the future increases clause language into the final document because it was a pdf. The district court rejected this argument and ruled that because the future increases clause was omitted from the final 2009 Budget Methodology the parties did not intend to limit the amenities fees and therefore the Association could not claim the right to a refund of those higher payments in its damages claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b635 Finally, the Association argues the district court erred in declining to adopt the Association's proposed final judgment and order for failing to comply with rule 58A of the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure. At the conclusion of trial the court invited each side to submit post-trial briefs. After the briefs were submitted the court issued its findings of fact and conclusions of law, which were subsequently amended at the request of both sides. In the amended findings the court asked the Association to submit a proposed form of judgment. After the Association submitted the proposed form, the court determined that its form was improper and declined to sign it. The Association argues this decision was in error and asks us to remand with instructions for the court to amend its judgment accordingly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   A. Common Areas and Facilities\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b636 The Association contends the district court erred by interpreting the Declaration to limit the Project's \"Common Areas and Facilities\" to the building's foundation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \u00b637 \"We interpret the provisions of the Declaration as we would a contract.

Some of those provisions referenced \"pipes, shafts, wires\" and other utilities, which the court agreed created an ambiguity over the meaning of \"Common Areas and Facilities.\" We agree with the court that the Declaration is ambiguous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \u00b639 The district court then considered extrinsic evidence to resolve the ambiguity. It looked to the Plat, Amended Plat, and the Declaration and determined that the parties intended to limit the \"Common Areas and Facilities\" to the foundation. The original Plat recorded in 2007 included a note that stated that \"Common Areas and Facilities consist of the foundation of the building.\" An Amended Plat was recorded in 2009 and contained the same note as the 2007 Plat but also contained a separate sheet that depicted the foundation as the \"Common Areas and Facilities\" of the Project. Based on this evidence the court made a factual finding that \"Common Areas and Facilities\" is limited to the building's foundation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b640 \"A party challenging the court's interpretation of ambiguous terms of a contract faces a substantial appellate burden.\"\n   <em>\n    Majestic\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10381225\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/818/1311/#p1313\">\n    818 P.2d at 1313\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Based on the evidence presented, we conclude the court did not clearly err in determining that \"Common Areas and Facilities\" under the Declaration is limited to the foundation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   B. Amenity Use Fee\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   \u00b641 The Association also argues the \"trial court erred by ignoring evidence that the parties to the 2009 Budget Methodology Agreement intended all budget categories, including the Amenity Use Fee, to be subject to a Future Increase Clause.\" As a result the Association contends the district court erred in refusing to grant the Association damages for overpaying the Amenity Use Fee from 2013 to 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   \u00b642 First, the Association argues the district court's finding of fact regarding the Amenity Use Fee was clearly erroneous. \"A [district] court's factual findings are clearly erroneous only if they are in conflict with the clear weight of the evidence, or if this court has a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made.\"\n   <em>\n    Bonnie &amp; Hyde, Inc. v.

The district court did not find this argument persuasive because the email exchange was \"in the midst of the parties' negotiations and discussions regarding the budget and was not the final agreement ratified by Westgate.\" The final agreement ratified by Westgate does not have the future increases clause so \"it is the content of [the final agreement] that controls, not a statement made by [General Manager] in the midst of negotiations.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \u00b645 Our review of the record demonstrates that the district court's finding regarding the future increase clause is not against the clear weight of the evidence and therefore is not clearly erroneous.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bonnie &amp; Hyde,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6967571\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/305/196/\">\n    2013 UT App 153\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 17,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6967571\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/305/196/\">\n    305 P.3d 196\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   \u00b646 Next, the Association argues that because the factual finding was clearly erroneous, the district court also erred in failing to award the Association damages for overpaying the Amenity Use Fee. But because we conclude the court did not err in its factual finding, we also conclude the court did not err in refusing to grant the Association damages. The court found \"the budgets during 2014-16 were voted on and approved by the Association after Westgate no longer controlled the [Association's] Board.\" And contrary to the Association's argument, the court's preliminary injunction did not require the Association to include the higher figures from 2013 in future budgets during the pendency of this litigation.\" The court's preliminary injunction required the parties to establish budgets in compliance with the 2009 Budget Methodology. If the budgets did not comply but were nevertheless agreed to, it was \"not because of a breach of fiduciary duty by Westgate, but an error by the Association no longer controlled by Westgate.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   \u00b647 Because the \"Amenities Use Fee\" is not subject to a future increases clause, we affirm the district court's refusal to grant the Association damages for any overpayment of the \"Amenity Use Fee.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   C. The Judgment\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   \u00b648 Finally, the Association contends the district court erred \"by rejecting certain features of the [Association's] Proposed Final Judgment and Order.\" The court rejected the Association's proposed final judgment and order because it did not comply with rule 58A of the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure. This rule requires that \"[e]very judgment and amended judgement must be set out in a separate document.\" Utah R. Civ. P. 58A(a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   \u00b649 The district court found that the Association's \"proposed Final Judgment and Order\n   does not comply with Rule 58A, [f]ederal case law interpreting the counterpart found in the federal rules, or the Advisory Committee's directives.\" Instead, the court ruled that the Association's proposed order \"recites facts and procedural history and contains rulings not made by this Court in its Amended, Corrected, and Clarified Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, or in its separate Ruling and Order.\" Based on these deficiencies, the court refused to sign the Association's proposed judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   \u00b650 We agree with the district court that the Association's proposed judgment does not comply with rule 58A because it was not set out in a separate document.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   \u00b651 The Association had standing to bring its claims against Westgate seeking enforcement of the 2009 Budget Methodology. The district court did not err in enforcing the 2009 Budget Methodology under the doctrine of promissory estoppel. Likewise, the court did not err in interpreting the Declaration to limit the \"Common Areas and Facilities\" to the building's foundation nor did it err in determining the Amenities Use Fee is not subject to a future increases clause.

First, Westgate challenges the district court's determination that the 2009 Budget Methodology \"is enforceable under the principle of ratification even though [the court] found that [Westgate's General Manager] lacked authority\" to ratify the 2009 Budget Methodology and \"neither Westgate nor the owners received a copy of the [2009 Budget Methodology].\" We decline to address this argument because Westgate failed to preserve it below and failed to argue on appeal that an exception to the preservation requirement applies.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Blanch v.

Westgate argues that it \"had no opportunity to address\" the ratification issue because it \"was never part of the pleadings,\" \"was not litigated at trial,\" and \"was raised for the first time in [the Association's] closing argument (which was after post-trial briefing).\" But after reviewing the record, we conclude Westgate had multiple opportunities to challenge ratification as an inappropriate basis on which to enforce the 2009 Budget Methodology. Westgate failed to \"specifically\" challenge the issue \"in a timely manner\" and support the challenge with \"evidence and relevant legal authority.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20UT%20App%20172\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    (quotation simplified).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    Second, Westgate argues for the first time on appeal that the district court erred in concluding \"that the 2009 Budget Methodology would control over any inconsistencies in the Shared Use Agreement or the Declaration because it essentially acts as an amendment to both the Shared Use Agreement and Declaration without following the proper procedures for a formal amendment.\" Westgate also challenges this conclusion on the basis that \"the Utah Condominium Ownership Act requires that any amendments to a condominium declaration be recorded to be valid.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2057-8-12\">\n     Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 57-8-12\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (LexisNexis 2010) (stating \"[n]either the declaration nor any amendment thereof shall be valid unless recorded\"). After reviewing the record, we conclude neither of these arguments were preserved.

Westgate only argued that the elements of promissory estoppel were not met in this case.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    Finally, Westgate contends the district court erred when it \"fail[ed] to award Westgate damages for the Association's underpayment of the Shared Amenities Fee after the [court] concluded that the Shared Amenities Fee was not capped by the 2009 Budget Methodology.\" On appeal, the appellant \"must explain, with reasoned analysis supported by citations to legal authority and the record, why the party should prevail on appeal.\" Utah R.

Second, Westgate argues the statute is inapplicable because this lawsuit arose out of a dispute over a budget document not \"common areas or units.\" These conclusory statements do not adequately articulate why the statute does not apply here.

The Association contends the Act's definition of \"Common Areas and Facilities\" \"explicitly includes 'the foundations, columns, girders, supports, main walls, roofs, halls, corridors' and 'all other parts of the property necessary or convenient to its existence, maintenance, and safety, or normally in common use.' \" (Citing\n    <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2057-8-3\">\n     Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 57-8-3\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (4)(b) (LexisNexis 2010).) The Act does not require Common Areas and Facilities of condominium projects to include any of these. Instead, by stating \"unless otherwise provided in the declaration,\" the Act defers to the governing documents for a definition of Common Areas and Facilities.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2057-8-3\">\n     Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 57-8-3\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (4) (LexisNexis 2010).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    We base our decision solely upon the plain language of rule 58A.
