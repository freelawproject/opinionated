The State argues the district court erred in ruling the police abandoned the purpose of the initial traffic stop by unlawfully prolonging the stop to verify the passenger's probationary status.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Shortly before midnight, officers stopped Burgess's vehicle for failing to stop before entering a roadway. One officer approached Burgess's side of the vehicle and after calling in the stop, another officer approached the passenger side. The officers talked with Burgess and her passenger for approximately three minutes, gathering identifications, licenses, vehicle registration, and insurance. Burgess had recently purchased the vehicle\n   and had yet to get insurance. As the officers were gathering information, a third officer arrived. After collecting the information from Burgess and the passenger, the initiating officer asked if either was on probation and both responded in the negative. The officers then returned to their patrol car to check Burgess's information and her passenger's information using the in-car computer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The video recording of the traffic stop shows that within a minute, the computer announced a separate \"return\" for each person, relating to warrant and driving status. Burgess's record check was completed. However, instead of beginning the citation process, the officers waited another \"minute or two\" in order for dispatch to verify the passenger's probationary status. After receiving a negative probation response as to the passenger, one officer walked to the vehicle and requested that Burgess exit the vehicle while the officer prepared a citation for failure to have insurance. As Burgess exited the vehicle, the other officer approached the vehicle and began questioning the passenger. Five minutes later, just as Burgess was being handed her citation, the passenger door was opened, the passenger stepped out, and was handcuffed. The passenger had admitted, during that time, to having drugs and paraphernalia. Burgess was then instructed to \"hang back\" while the situation with the passenger was resolved. Thereafter, Burgess consented to a search of the vehicle. A clutch containing contraband was found within the vehicle. Burgess was charged with possession of methamphetamine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Burgess filed a motion to suppress all evidence, arguing that her detention was unreasonably prolonged by police in violation of the Constitutions of the United States and state of Idaho.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In her motion, Burgess argued her detention was unlawfully prolonged twice. First, when the officer abandoned the initial purpose of the traffic stop and detoured to investigate the passenger. Second, when the officer restricted her from leaving the scene after issuing her ticket as the passenger's backpack was searched. The district court identified the dispositive issue as \"whether delaying moving forward with a traffic stop is lawful in order to verify a passenger's probation status.\" The district court granted the motion to suppress, ruling that the officers abandoned the purpose of the stop when they waited for dispatch to verify the passenger's probationary status and that the detour unlawfully prolonged the traffic stop.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The State timely appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The standard of review of a suppression motion is bifurcated.

Therefore, the State argues, the officers did not deviate from the original purpose of the traffic stop. In response, Burgess argues that because the passenger was not the driver or owner of the vehicle, conducting tasks related to him did not serve the mission of the traffic stop or serve any safety purpose. Burgess asserts that suspending issuance of a citation to verify the passenger's probationary status unlawfully extended the stop and was not a justifiable safety measure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides: \"[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated....\" U.S. CONST. amend.

The State cites to out-of-state cases that view inquiry into probation or parole status as within the permissible scope of \"ordinary inquiries incident to a traffic stop.\" However, none of those decisions involve the prolonging of a traffic stop to conduct a probationary status check of a passenger through dispatch. The issue before this Court does not involve the constitutionality of questioning a passenger about his probation or parole status, which is how the State has framed the issue; but rather the constitutionality of delaying the issuance of a traffic citation in order to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The State contends that information gathering as to probation or parole status (a) are ordinary inquiries incident to a traffic stop, (b) applies to both the driver and any passengers of the stopped vehicle, (c) does not initiate a criminal investigation unrelated to the stop, and (d) is not an abandonment of or deviation from the purpose of the stop. Implied within the State's argument is that, since these inquiries are part and parcel of a traffic stop, the time necessary to complete the inquiries does not extend the stop. This is so regardless of whether the time necessary to secure the information as to a passenger exceeds that of the driver and the writing of a citation to the driver does not commence until after securing the passenger information.

Assuming the officers here had every right to run the passenger's information through dispatch to determine probation status, the question is could they constitutionally do so after all information necessary to cite the driver had been obtained without beginning the citation process? The answer is no. First, as noted, we disagree with the State's primary argument that it need not justify the probation inquiry under officer safety. Second, the State has not shown, under the circumstances of this case (or as a general matter), that the probation status of the passenger was necessary for officer safety in continuing to carry out the purpose of the stop. Finally, absent such justification, the probation inquiry cannot, but did, extend the duration of the stop. In\n   <em>\n    Roe\n   </em>\n   , we noted the question of extending a stop relative to passenger information:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   While the first officer identified the driver, the second officer identified the rear seat passengers. The identification ... occurred simultaneously and, thus, the driver and the passengers were not detained any longer than if the officer had only identified the driver. The second officer's verbal request for the identification of the rear passenger did not extend the duration of the stop beyond the time necessary to effectuate the purpose of the stop.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    Roe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1359126\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/idaho/140/176/#p181\">\n    140 Idaho at 182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1359126\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/idaho/140/176/#p181\">\n    90 P.3d at 932\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Under the circumstances, the task of verifying the passenger's probation status through dispatch unlawfully extended the duration of the stop.
