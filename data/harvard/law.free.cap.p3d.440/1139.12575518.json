AMMA defines marijuana as including \"all parts of any plant of the genus cannabis whether growing or not.\" A.R.S. \u00a7 36-2801(8). Consistent with this language, we hold that AMMA's definition of marijuana includes both its dried-leaf/flower form and extracted resin, including hashish.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b62 In March 2013, Jones-a registered qualifying patient under AMMA-was found in possession of a jar containing 1.43 grams, or 0.050 ounces, of hashish. Jones was charged with possession of cannabis and possession of drug paraphernalia (the jar). As defined by Arizona's criminal code, cannabis is a narcotic drug, \u00a7 13-3401(20)(w), consisting of \"[t]he resin extracted from any part of a plant of the genus cannabis, and every compound, manufacture, salt, derivative, mixture or preparation of such plant, its seeds or its resin,\" \u00a7 13-3401(4)(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b63 Jones moved to dismiss the charges, arguing his use was allowed under AMMA.

Agreeing with the State, the trial court denied Jones's motion. After a bench trial, Jones was convicted as charged and sentenced to concurrent 2.5-year prison terms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b64 The court of appeals affirmed Jones's convictions in a divided opinion, holding that AMMA did not immunize his possession of cannabis.\n   <em>\n    State v.

We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b68 We start with the statutory language. Because AMMA specifically defines \"marijuana,\" we apply the statutory definition and look to neither the criminal code nor common understanding.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Enloe v.

Indeed, AMMA's definition of \"marijuana\" stands on its own: it neither cross-references nor incorporates the criminal code definition.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Pirello\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3752578\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/365/399/\">\n    365 Mont. 399\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3752578\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/365/399/\">\n    282 P.3d 662\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 663-65 \u00b6\u00b6 11-18 (2012) (recognizing that the Montana Medical Marijuana Act cross-references and incorporates the criminal code distinction between marijuana and hashish).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b69 AMMA defines \"marijuana\" as \"all parts of [the] plant.\" \u00a7 36-2801(8). The word \"all,\" one of the most comprehensive words in the English language, means exactly that.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Flood Control Dist. of Maricopa Cty. v. Gaines\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"946312\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/202/248/\">\n    202 Ariz. 248\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 252 \u00b6 9,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"946312\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/202/248/\">\n    43 P.3d 196\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 200 (2002). \"Part\" means \"an essential portion or integral element,\" or, as relevant here, \"one of the constituent elements of a plant or animal body.\"\n   <em>\n    Part\n   </em>\n   , Merriam-Webster, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/part (last visited May 20, 2019). Taken together, \"all parts\" refers to all constituent elements of the marijuana plant, and the fact the resin must first be extracted from the plant reflects that it is part of the plant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b610 The State nevertheless argues AMMA does not apply to resin or its extracts. Again, we disagree. Section 36-2811(B)(1) immunizes the patient's \"medical use\" of marijuana, defined to mean \"the acquisition, possession, cultivation,\n   <em>\n    manufacture\n   </em>\n   , use, administration, delivery, transfer or transportation of marijuana or paraphernalia relating to the administration of marijuana to treat or alleviate a registered qualifying patient's debilitating medical condition.\" \u00a7 36-2801(9) (emphasis added). AMMA does not define \"manufacture\" but it commonly means \"to make into a product suitable for use.\"\n   <em>\n    Manufacture\n   </em>\n   , Merriam-Webster, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/manufacture (last visited May 20, 2019);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 13-3401(17) (defining \"manufacture\" in the criminal code as to \"produce, prepare, propagate, compound, mix or process, directly or indirectly,\n   <em>\n    by extraction\n   </em>\n   from substances of natural origin or independently by means of chemical synthesis, or by a combination of extraction and chemical synthesis\" (emphasis added)). AMMA anticipates not only that dispensaries will produce marijuana in edible form,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 36-2801(15) (defining \"usable marijuana\" to include mixtures or preparations, to be \"prepared for consumption as food or drink\"), but also that patients will \"consume[ marijuana] by a method other than smoking,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 36-2805(A)(3). Taken together, these statutes indicate AMMA's intent to allow the manufacture and preparation of parts of the marijuana plant for medical use, including extracting the resin.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b611 We are likewise unpersuaded by the State's argument that \u00a7\u00a7 36-2811(B)(1) and 36-2801(1), (15) limit marijuana use to dried flowers. Section 36-2811(B)(1) provides that a registered qualifying patient may not possess more \"than the allowable amount of marijuana.\" Section 36-2801(1) provides that the allowable amount of marijuana is two-and-one-half ounces of \"usable marijuana,\" which \u00a7 36-2801(15) defines as \"the dried flowers of the marijuana plant, and any mixture or preparation thereof, but does not include the seeds, stalks and roots of the plant and does not include the weight of any non-marijuana\n   ingredients combined with marijuana and prepared for consumption as food or drink.\" The State argues that by conjunction these provisions limit marijuana use to \"dried flowers.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    People v. Carruthers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4089401\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich-app/301/590/\">\n    301 Mich.App. 590\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=837%20N.W.2d%2016\">\n    837 N.W.2d 16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 21-24 (2013) (giving controlling weight to the Michigan Medical Mari[j]uana Act's definition of \"usable mari[j]uana,\" meaning \"dried leaves and flowers of the mari[j]uana plant,\" and concluding it does not include \"all parts\" of the cannabis plant or its resin).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b612 But \u00a7 36-2811(B)(1) protects \"the registered qualifying patient's\n   <em>\n    medical use of marijuana\n   </em>\n   ,\" not just the use of the dried flowers of the marijuana plant. (Emphasis added.) Section 36-2801(8) provides the definition of marijuana, and nothing in \u00a7 36-2801(1) or (15) alters its meaning. Rather, by its own language, the limitation in \u00a7 36-2801(1) and (15) pertains only to the\n   <em>\n    amount\n   </em>\n   of marijuana the patient can legally possess, not the\n   <em>\n    type\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    form\n   </em>\n   of marijuana one may possess and use.\n   <em>\n    See Amount\n   </em>\n   , Merriam-Webster, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/amount (last visited May 20, 2019) (defining \"amount\" to mean \"the total number or quantity\"). Accordingly, we decline to follow\n   <em>\n    Carruthers\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b613 Section 36-2806.02 supports this view. First, it authorizes dispensaries to dispense \"marijuana\": it includes no reference or limitation to \"usable marijuana.\" \u00a7 36-2806.02(A)-(B). We decline to adopt an interpretation that presents contradictory definitions and allows the dispensary to dispense \"marijuana\"-all parts of the plant-but only allows the patient to receive \"usable marijuana\"-the dried flowers of the plant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Antonin Scalia &amp; Bryan A. Garner,\n   <em>\n    Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts\n   </em>\n   180 (2012) (\"The provisions of a text should be interpreted in a way that renders them compatible, not contradictory.\"). Second, in dispensing marijuana, the dispensary is required to list \"[h]ow much marijuana is being dispensed,\" \u00a7 36-2806.02(B)(1), and to determine whether the amount to be dispensed would cause patients to exceed their two-and-one-half-ounce limit, \u00a7 36-2806.02(A)(3). Section 36-2806.02 thus supports our interpretation that the limitation refers to the quantity of marijuana that may be dispensed, not its type or form.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b614 The State contends that such a reading will result in the allowance of two-and-one-half ounces of cannabis, equivalent to far more than two-and-one-half ounces of dried flowers and leaves. We disagree. In defining\n   <em>\n    what\n   </em>\n   AMMA protects, \u00a7 36-2801(8) defines marijuana broadly.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 9-12;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 36-2811(B) (immunizing the \"qualifying patient's medical use of marijuana\"). In defining\n   <em>\n    how much\n   </em>\n   marijuana may be possessed, however, \u00a7 36-2801(1) and (15) define the weight more narrowly.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 36-2811(B) (limiting patients' marijuana possession to the \"allowable amount of marijuana\"). Section 36-2801(1) provides that the \"allowable amount of marijuana\" is \"[t]wo-and-one-half ounces of usable marijuana,\" which subsection (15) defines as \"the dried flowers of the marijuana plant, and any mixture or preparation thereof.\" AMMA's weight limitation is based on \"two-and-one-half ounces\" of \"the dried flowers of the marijuana plant,\" regardless of the weight of the product manufactured from those flowers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b615 As stated above, AMMA extends to manufactured marijuana products using extracted resin.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10. Under \u00a7 36-2801(15), these products are \"mixture[s] or preparation[s]\" of the dried flowers of the marijuana plant. We therefore read \u00a7 36-2801(1) and (15) to mean qualifying patients are allowed two-and-one-half ounces of dried flowers, or mixtures or preparations made from two-and-one-half ounces of dried flowers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b616 A plain reading of the relevant provisions compels our conclusion that AMMA protects the use of \"marijuana,\" including resin, so long as the patient does not exceed the allowable amount and otherwise complies with the statutory requirements. Consideration\n   of AMMA's purpose and ballot materials support this plain reading.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ruiz v.

Such an interpretation would preclude the use of marijuana as an option for those for whom smoking or consuming those parts of the marijuana plants would be ineffective or impossible. Consistent with voter intent, our interpretation enables patients to use medical marijuana to treat their debilitating medical conditions, in whatever form best suits them, so long as they do not possess more than the allowable amount.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b618 Separately, the State argues AMMA is preempted by the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act, which is comprised of two components, the Controlled Substances Act (\"CSA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20801\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 801\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 971, and the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (\"FDCA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20301\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 399i. But the State did not raise this argument before the court of appeals or in its petition for review to this Court. Though the State urges us to nevertheless consider the issue because it is one of statewide importance,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Barrio v. San Manuel Div.
