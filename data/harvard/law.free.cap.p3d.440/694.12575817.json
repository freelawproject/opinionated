We therefore reverse that conviction and remand for a new trial on that charge, but affirm in all other respects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b62 While visiting her boyfriend (Boyfriend) at his apartment, Defendant grew tired of Boyfriend's repeated drug use and the two argued. In an effort to stop his drug use, Defendant took away Boyfriend's drugs, put them in her purse, and then went into the bathroom to shower, locking the door behind her. While she showered, Boyfriend banged on the door and continued to argue, demanding that Defendant return his \"stuff.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b63 When Defendant had finished showering, dressed, and exited the bathroom, Boyfriend, Boyfriend's son, and Boyfriend's brother (Brother) were standing at the end of the hall. Brother pointed a gun in Defendant's direction and Boyfriend told Brother, \"Shoot the bitch. Shoot the bitch, motherfucker.\" Scared, Defendant said she tried to call the police but her phone would not work. The three men ran from the apartment and Defendant saw Boyfriend drive away, though she did not know where the other two went.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b64 Defendant then whistled toward a nearby apartment to alert her daughter (Daughter) that they needed to leave. While waiting for Daughter, Defendant ran back inside Boyfriend's apartment to retrieve a loaded .22 caliber pistol, putting it in her bra for safety. She put her purse on the bed in the bedroom and left it there. Defendant again stepped out of Boyfriend's apartment. At the same time Daughter came to Defendant and, by that time, numerous police officers had arrived at the apartment complex. Defendant later testified that she did not know exactly why the officers were there, because everything had happened so fast.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b65 Defendant collected Daughter and walked outside the gate of the courtyard of the apartment complex. Once outside the gate, a police officer approached Defendant and asked if she had seen anyone with a gun or heard anything. Defendant said, \"No,\" and the officer walked away.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b66 A short time later, however, some children in the apartment complex informed the officers that Defendant was the person with a gun. Officers again approached Defendant. One officer testified that he asked Defendant if she had any weapons on her and Defendant said, \"No.\" But the officer's police report does not mention whether he actually asked Defendant about weapons, and Defendant testified that she did not remember such a question. A second officer asked Defendant if she had a weapon on her and Defendant said that she had a gun in her bra. This officer performed a pat down search revealing Defendant's gun where Defendant said the officer would find it. The officer handcuffed Defendant and gave her a\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   warning. Defendant nevertheless agreed to speak with the police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b67 Although Defendant explained to the police what had happened, she could not remember what she and Boyfriend were fighting about. She also did not mention that she had put Boyfriend's drugs in her purse, which was still inside the apartment. While Defendant spoke to police officers, Defendant's sister (Sister) arrived to pick up Daughter. The police allowed Daughter into Boyfriend's apartment to retrieve a few things. Along with her backpack, Daughter brought out Defendant's purse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b68 Sister opened the purse on the ground, looking for a key that Defendant had said was inside her purse. During Sister's search of the purse, police officers saw a suspicious pouch and asked Defendant if she had drugs in her purse. Defendant indicated that she did. The officers' search of the purse revealed what appeared to be drugs and drug paraphernalia, as well as two live .22 rounds and a spent .22 casing. Defendant later testified that the drugs were not hers and that she did not use drugs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b69 The State charged Defendant with several offenses and proceeded to trial on the charges of possession of a firearm by a restricted person, possession of a controlled\n   substance, possession of drug paraphernalia, and carrying a concealed dangerous weapon. Defendant asserted as defenses that she was compelled to possess the gun and drugs and that she innocently possessed the drugs and drug paraphernalia. Defendant requested that the trial court instruct the jury on each of these defenses, but the trial court declined to rule on this request until the evidence had been presented at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b610 At the outset of the trial, the court and the parties discussed whether the officers could testify that they were responding to a report of a \"woman with a gun\" or whether they should be limited to stating that they were responding to a report of a \"person with a gun.\" Defendant objected to the officers' use of the phrase \"woman with a gun,\" specifically arguing that the use of that phrase would lead the jury to improperly infer that she was the subject of the report. Ultimately, the trial court overruled Defendant's objection and allowed the officers to testify that they had been responding to a report of a \"woman with a gun.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b611 At the close of the State's case, Defendant moved for a directed verdict. Defendant asserted that Utah law regarding concealed weapons allowed her to carry a concealed firearm on \"her property,\" and that the State did not present sufficient evidence at trial to establish that Defendant was not on her property when the police found her with the gun. According to Defendant, the State's own evidence showed that the police encountered her \"right outside the apartment complex which is a common area, ... it's her property.\" The trial court concluded, however, that the evidence established that Defendant was not on her property when the police engaged her because Defendant was outside the gate of the apartment complex.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b612 At the close of Defendant's case, the court revived the discussion regarding Defendant's two requested defense instructions-innocent possession and compulsion. As to innocent possession of the drugs and paraphernalia, the trial court determined that there was no evidence of any illegal purpose regarding Defendant's possession of the drugs and paraphernalia. The court denied Defendant's request for an innocent-possession instruction, however, because the evidence showed that Defendant had made no attempt to dispose of the drugs or turn them over to the police. On the defense of compulsion to carry a firearm, the court determined that the defense did not apply because any threat to Defendant had dissipated after the three men left the apartment. With respect to the compulsion to possess drugs, the court determined that Boyfriend's use of drugs throughout the night was not an imminent threat. Accordingly, the court denied Defendant's request for a compulsion instruction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b613 The jury convicted Defendant of two of the four charges: carrying a loaded, concealed firearm and possession of a controlled substance. Defendant appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   ISSUES AND STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b614 Defendant raises four issues on appeal. First, she argues that the trial court erred when it denied her request for jury instructions on her innocent-possession and compulsion defenses. \"We review a [trial] court's refusal to give a requested jury instruction for correctness.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

In assessing hearsay rulings, \"we review legal questions for correctness, factual questions for clear error, and the final ruling on admissibility for abuse of discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

In assessing a directed verdict ruling based upon a claim of insufficiency of the evidence, \"we review the evidence and all inferences which may reasonably be drawn from it in the light most favorable to the verdict of the jury.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Carvajal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20UT%20App%2012\">\n    2018 UT App 12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 16,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12566338\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/414/984/\">\n    414 P.3d 984\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation simplified).

Jury Instructions\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b618 Defendant argues that the trial court erred when it denied her request to instruct the jury on two affirmative defenses: innocent possession and compulsion. Defendant first asserts that she was entitled to a compulsion instruction because she was coerced to possess both the gun and the drugs. She also argues that the jury should have been instructed on the innocent-possession defense regarding Defendant's possession of a controlled substance. We agree with Defendant that the trial court should have instructed the jury regarding Defendant's innocent-possession defense with respect to her possession of a controlled substance. We accordingly reverse that conviction. We otherwise affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b619 When requested by a criminal defendant, a trial court must give an instruction regarding a particular affirmative defense \"if evidence has been presented-either by the prosecution or by the defendant-that provides any reasonable basis upon which a jury could conclude that the affirmative defense applies to the defendant.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

The innocent-possession defense \"applies if (1) the controlled substance was attained innocently and held with no illicit or illegal purpose, and (2) the possession of the controlled substance was transitory; that is, that the defendant took adequate measures to rid [herself] of possession of the controlled substance as promptly as reasonably possible.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22. \"[W]hether a defendant took adequate measures to rid [herself] of a controlled substance as promptly as reasonably possible\" is a question for the jury.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Defendant testified that, following Boyfriend's use of drugs throughout the night, she put Boyfriend's drugs in her purse to prevent his continued use. The drugs remained in Defendant's purse and in the apartment until Daughter retrieved the purse approximately two to three hours after Defendant had taken the drugs from Boyfriend. During that time period Defendant showered while Boyfriend banged on the door demanding the drugs back; Brother pointed a gun at Defendant while Boyfriend shouted, \"Shoot the bitch\"; the men ran away; Defendant tried to get the attention of Daughter in another nearby apartment unit; Defendant obtained a gun from the apartment and returned to collect Daughter outside; and the police questioned and ultimately arrested Defendant on suspicion of possession of a concealed, loaded firearm. It was only subsequent to Defendant's arrest that Daughter retrieved Defendant's purse from the apartment. Defendant then directed Sister to take a key from the purse, at which point the police observed what appeared to be a pouch containing a controlled substance and paraphernalia. Defendant testified, \"At the time, ... I spaced that I even grabbed the drugs from [Boyfriend] and put them in my purse\" because \"so much ... happen[ed] at once.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b622 The trial court concluded that the evidence presented at trial constituted a threshold showing of the first element of the defense-that \"[Defendant] obtained [the drugs] without an illegal purpose to use [them].\" The trial court declined to instruct the jury on innocent possession, however, because the court determined that there was no evidence of the second element-that Defendant's possession was transitory. The court determined that no evidence was presented to show any attempt by Defendant to abandon or destroy the drugs, or turn them over to the police despite having opportunities to do so.

But fearing for one's safety is not the same as being coerced to engage in illegal activity.

Another officer testified regarding \"a dispatch call of a person waving a gun and kids in the area.\" Defendant contends that these statements constituted inadmissible hearsay. Specifically, Defendant challenges the description of the report of a \"female with a gun\" rather than merely a \"person with a gun.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b636 We are not persuaded that, under these circumstances, the description is anything more than the \"information received\" by the officers. First, Defendant does not challenge these statements as the basis for the officers' presence at the apartment complex. In other words, Defendant fails to adequately contest the State's assertion that the statements were not offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. Additionally, Defendant fails to explain how a report of a \"female with a gun\" made the statement \"more specific by repeating definite complaints of a particular crime by the accused.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24 (quotation simplified).

Defendant conceded at trial that she possessed a concealed firearm. Consequently, we address the narrower question of whether the State presented sufficient evidence that she had the concealed firearm \"in or on a place other than [her] ... property.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2076-10-504\">\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 76-10-504\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1) (LexisNexis Supp. 2018). Although Defendant did not live in the apartment unit, she had been visiting Boyfriend at his apartment for a day or two before her arrest. On the morning of the incident and her arrest, Defendant emerged from the bathroom to Brother and Boyfriend pointing a gun at her. Brother and Boyfriend threatened to shoot her and then fled from the apartment. Fearing for her safety, Defendant took a firearm from the closet and concealed it in her bra. She then left the apartment unit and collected Daughter who was coming out of a nearby apartment unit. As police were arriving on the scene, Defendant stepped through the gate of a small fence and waited outside the fenced courtyard area for Sister. The police ultimately detained Defendant in that spot and the State subsequently charged her with carrying a concealed firearm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b639 As to the identification of the particular location, Defendant was just outside the fence that surrounded the apartment courtyard but remained on the grassy area between the apartment building and the sidewalk. Defendant testified that though she was \"right outside the fence\" she did not believe that she had left \"the property.\" The State presented no evidence of property ownership of the grassy area or the delineation of property lines particularly identifying the record owner of that grassy area.

Moreover, Defendant testified that she did not live in the apartment unit and-prior to her arrest-she had been visiting Boyfriend at his apartment for a day or two. Even assuming, without deciding, that owners of condominiums and apartment-rental tenants who have signed a lease have at least a fractional property interest in the common area, Defendant falls outside of even these categories. Under the circumstances presented here, Defendant has no conceivable ownership interest in the common area of this apartment complex, and therefore the common area cannot be said to be Defendant's \"property.\" And the concealed firearm statute therefore forbids her from carrying a concealed firearm in the common area of this apartment complex.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b643 Here, as a threshold matter, the jury heard sufficient evidence to determine, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Defendant carried a concealed firearm while not on \"her property.\" Accordingly, we affirm the trial court's denial of Defendant's motion for a directed verdict on this count.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   IV.

The trial court did not exceed its discretion when it overruled Defendant's hearsay objections to testimony from officers that they responded to a call of a woman with a gun. We are not persuaded that the court erred\n   when it denied Defendant's motion for a directed verdict on the concealed firearm charge.
