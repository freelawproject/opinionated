A woman (Victim) was found fatally stabbed on the side of a road. The ensuing investigation led police to Sergio Briseno Medina. During an interview, detectives (Detectives) read Medina his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Medina invoked his right to counsel, but immediately after invoking, Medina initiated a substantive conversation with the Detectives regarding the investigation, the circumstances surrounding the murder, and the pending charges against him. After the Detectives told Medina that they had \"questions for [him] about [the murder],\" Medina stated, \"I'm gonna answer questions,\" and he demanded to know \"what's going on\" and \"[w]hy is it me ... being targeted for something that I wasn't even nearby.\" During the resulting conversation, Medina made several incriminating statements. Three days later, the Detectives, after confirming that Medina understood he could have an attorney present, interviewed him a second time. The State charged Medina with murder and obstructing justice. Medina moved to suppress his statements made during the interviews, arguing that his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights were violated by the Detectives' questioning without counsel present. The district court granted Medina's motion, and the State appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b62 We reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    The Interviews\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b63 Medina was in Denver, Colorado when law enforcement located him. A search of Medina's and Victim's cell phone records had established that Medina was in the vicinity of Victim's body and her jeep around the time of the murder; a search of the jeep uncovered Medina's fingerprints on the outside of the jeep and Victim's blood on the interior. Medina was arrested and brought into a Denver police station for questioning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b64 Prior to any questioning, the Detectives read Medina his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights, whereupon Medina invoked his right to counsel. The conversation ensued as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   The Detectives: Okay well just so you're aware we just wanna make sure that you are aware of your rights okay you still have those (inaudible) and you wanna find out and you wanna have a discussion with us and we wanna make sure you know your rights okay?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Medina: Ya.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   D: So you do know you have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to have an attorney present with you while you're being questioned. If you can't afford to hire one, one will be appointed to represent you before any questioning if you wish. Okay?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   M: Can I have an attorney present then?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   D: So ... and if you ... so you're saying you don't wanna talk to us without your attorney present?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   M: Well ya the thing is I don't know what's going on.

What's goin on I actually want to know ... That's what ... That's what I'm asking what's goin on. Why is it me that I'm being targeted for something that I wasn't even nearby. It's like what the fuck.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   D: Okay.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b65 Medina went on to explain that he was confused by the circumstances of his arrest. Medina then agreed to answer the Detectives' questions and admitted that Victim was a \"friend,\" that they sold drugs together, and that they had gotten into an argument on the day of the murder. He continued to deny involvement in Victim's murder. The Detectives also questioned Medina about his text messages to his fianc\u00e9e and to another individual.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b66 Three days later, the Detectives interviewed Medina for a second time. The second conversation went as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   The Detectives: So you asked me to do a couple things when we last talked. I did that okay so I got some ... some good news as far as that goes okay, but just as we get talkin I just want to make sure you still are aware of your rights okay? Do you understand your rights too?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   Medina: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   D: That you do have the right to an attorney and you don't have to talk. You can have on[e] present with you and all that right? So you still understand those?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   M: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   D: You're still okay to talk to me then?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   M: Ya.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b67 Thus, the Detectives confirmed Medina's understanding that he could have an attorney present or continue to speak with the Detectives without an attorney present. Medina then claimed that he spoke with Victim on the phone while he was at or near a specific Maverick gas station and that during the call, \"[Victim] was talking and laughing with somebody in the background.\" But surveillance footage obtained by police from the Maverick store refuted Medina's story-he was nowhere to be seen at or near the store during the time Medina claimed to be there. The State subsequently charged Medina with murder and obstructing justice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <em>\n    The Motion to Suppress\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b68 After the State filed charges against him, Medina moved to suppress the statements made to the Detectives during his interrogation, arguing that they persisted in questioning him after he had invoked his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   right to an attorney. The district court granted the motion, finding that Medina had invoked his right to counsel, and that even though he had \"initiated ... further conversation, as he continued to talk after his request for counsel,\" he did not knowingly and intelligently waive his right to counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The court further ruled that because Medina did not waive his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights in the first interrogation, his statements in the second interview were also inadmissible. But the court qualified the ruling, stating that had\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   procedure been properly followed in the first interview, \"the second recitation of\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   preceding the [second] interview would have been adequate.\" The State then successfully petitioned for leave to take an interlocutory appeal from the district court's order granting Medina's motion to suppress his statements to police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   ISSUE AND STANDARD OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b69 We address only one issue in this case: whether the district court correctly granted Medina's motion to suppress. Rulings regarding the validity of a\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   waiver are reviewed for correctness, while granting \"some degree of discretion to the trial court because of the wide variety of factual settings possible.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

The district court even conceded that \"the Detectives did not do much prodding.\" While the Detectives did go on to ask questions such as, \"Is that what happened with her,\" and make statements such as, \"We can have a discussion,\" those statements were made after Medina's completely unsolicited statements regarding his sister, his hands, the police, his drug usage, and his demand to know more about the investigation against him. Medina's desire to \"tell ... what really happened,\" followed by making incriminating statements about what happened without further prodding by the investigating officers, constitutes a knowing and intelligent waiver.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hilfiker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10359946\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/868/826/#p831\">\n    868 P.2d at 831\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (cleaned up).

The Utah Supreme Court has held that if \"a defendant makes an ambiguous or equivocal request for an attorney, questioning with respect to the subject matter of the\n   investigation must immediately stop, and any further questioning must be limited to clarifying the request.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Accordingly, because all three conditions to the admission of Medina's statements were satisfied, the district court should have denied Medina's motion to suppress, and his statements in the first interview should have been admitted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   II. The Second Interview\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   \u00b632 The State argues that \"[b]ecause Medina initiated a conversation with the [D]etectives after invoking his right to counsel and validly waived his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights\" during the first interview, the statements Medina made during the second interview should also be admitted. We agree. Prior to the second interview, the Detectives and\n   Medina engaged in the following conversation:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   The Detectives: So you asked me to do a couple things when we last talked. I did that okay so I got some ... some good news as far as that goes okay, but just as we get talkin I just want to make sure you still are aware of your rights okay? Do you understand your rights too?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   Medina: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   D: That you do have the right to an attorney and you don't have to talk. You can have on[e] present with you and all that right? So you still understand those?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   M: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   D: You're still okay to talk to me then?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   M: Ya.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   \u00b633 The district court concluded that the Detectives' second recitation of Medina's\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights prior to the second interview would have been adequate if Medina had voluntarily waived his right to counsel in the first interview. And as discussed,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   Part I, the\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warning given in the first interview was sufficient. Consequently, it carried over to the second interview that was given only three days later.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Maryland v. Shatzer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3582023\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/98/#p110\">\n    559 U.S. 98\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 110,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3582023\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/98/#p110\">\n    130 S.Ct. 1213\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3582023\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/98/#p110\">\n    175 L.Ed.2d 1045\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010) (holding that officers need not re-recite\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings unless fourteen days have passed since the break in custody). And here the Detectives reminded Medina of his right to counsel and confirmed that he understood his rights and still wanted to talk to the Detectives. Therefore, the Detectives did not violate Medina's right to counsel in the second interview and the district court incorrectly granted Medina's motion to suppress the statements made in the second interview.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   \u00b634 Medina initiated further communication with the Detectives regarding topics that were not \"routine\" nor \"unrelated to the crimes charged,\" effectively waiving his right to counsel. Further, his waiver was made knowingly and intelligently, as well as voluntarily. We therefore conclude that the Detectives did not violate Medina's right to counsel in the second interview, and we reverse the district court's grant of Medina's motion to suppress the statements made in both the first and second interviews.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-102\">\n    <em>\n     Miranda\n    </em>\n    rights include the right to remain silent and the right to have an attorney present during custodial interrogation.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Miranda v.
