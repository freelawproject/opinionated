In administrative decisions, DOPL and the Department of Commerce (the Department) each interpreted the governing statute as forbidding such fee awards. Muddy Boys, Inc. (Muddy Boys) challenges those decisions and, although we acknowledge that the statute is not entirely clear, we think the Department has the better of the arguments. Accordingly, we decline to disturb the Department's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b62 Muddy Boys is a drywall contractor that on occasion subcontracted work to a then-licensed company known as ITY LLC (ITY1). Unbeknownst to Muddy Boys, ITY1 lost its contractor's license, and its principal formed a new company known as ITY of Texas LLC (ITY2), but the new company was unable to obtain a contractor's license. ITY2 nevertheless falsely assured Muddy Boys that it was licensed, and offered as proof a state certificate that resembled a license. Muddy Boys apparently fell for the ploy and, under the impression that ITY2 was licensed, continued to subcontract work to the new entity on multiple projects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63 In November 2015, DOPL filed an administrative action against Muddy Boys, accusing it of hiring an unlicensed subcontractor on fifty-eight separate projects, which DOPL contended was a violation of Utah Code section 58-55-501(3), and asserting that Muddy Boys should be assessed a $2,000 fine for each violation, pursuant to Utah Code section 58-55-503(4)(h). In total, DOPL sought to impose a $116,000 fine on Muddy Boys, and also asked for an order placing Muddy Boys's contractor license on probation. As the proceeding progressed, DOPL took the position that these violations were strict liability offenses, and that it did not matter that Muddy Boys may have been unaware that it was hiring an unlicensed subcontractor. DOPL also took the position that Muddy Boys had committed similar offenses before, which increased the fine from $1,000 per occurrence to $2,000 per occurrence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2058-55-503\">\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 58-55-503\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (4)(h) (LexisNexis 2016). Muddy Boys maintained that it had never committed any such violations in the past.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 After substantial motion practice, Muddy Boys prevailed on both of these preliminary issues: (1) DOPL eventually conceded that it needed to prove that Muddy Boys intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly hired an unlicensed subcontractor, and (2) the administrative law judge (ALJ) assigned to the case ruled that any violation in this case would be Muddy Boys's first. After these issues were decided, the case went to trial in November 2016 before the ALJ. Following several hours of testimony, the ALJ ordered a lunch recess and, upon returning from lunch, DOPL made a unilateral motion to dismiss the case with prejudice, which the ALJ granted. At the time, DOPL offered no reason for its motion, although Muddy Boys contends in its brief that DOPL made its\n   motion because it \"finally recognized that it could not prove recklessness.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 Soon after the case was dismissed, Muddy Boys filed a motion before the ALJ, pursuant to a briefing schedule set by the ALJ, seeking to recover more than $80,000 of attorney fees and costs it incurred in defending against DOPL's action. In response, DOPL did not challenge the amount or reasonableness of the proposed fees, but opposed the motion on legal grounds, asserting that attorney fees were not recoverable at all under the relevant statute. In January 2017, after briefing was complete, Muddy Boys submitted the matter to the ALJ for decision. But the ALJ did not issue a decision on Muddy Boys's motion. Instead, more than five months later, in June 2017, the director of DOPL (the Director) issued a lengthy order denying Muddy Boys's motion on the ground that the applicable statute, which authorized \"courts\" to award fees, did not allow fee awards by administrative tribunals.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2058-55-503\">\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 58-55-503\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5)(d) (LexisNexis 2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b66 After the Director issued his decision, and concerned about whether DOPL had communicated ex parte with the ALJ about the motion and whether the ALJ had drafted (but not issued) a recommended decision, Muddy Boys on two separate occasions asked DOPL to produce copies of any communications it might have had with the ALJ about the motion. DOPL refused.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b67 Muddy Boys appealed the Director's decision to the Department. In addition to appealing the merits of that decision, Muddy Boys also asked the Department to address two peripheral issues: (a) whether the Director had a conflict of interest, based on the fact that his agency would have had to pay any fee award out of budgeted funds, such that the Director should not have rendered a substantive decision on its motion; and (b) whether DOPL should be compelled to produce any communications it may have had with the ALJ.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b68 In November 2017, the Department issued an order affirming the Director's decision declining to award fees, but reached that conclusion on completely different grounds, determining that the attorney fees provision in question applied only to proceedings brought pursuant to subsection (5) of Utah Code section 58-55-503, and not to proceedings brought pursuant to subsection (4). In its order, the Department expressly \"decline[d] to address\" either of the peripheral issues Muddy Boys raised.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   ISSUE AND STANDARD OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b69 Muddy Boys asks us to review the Department's order, and argues that both the Department and the Director erred in concluding that the applicable statute, Utah Code section 58-55-503(5)(d), does not allow Muddy Boys to recover attorney fees and costs.

The Department took a different tack, determining that the provision-despite its use of the term \"section\" and not \"subsection\"-authorized fee awards only for actions brought pursuant to subsection (5), and not actions brought pursuant to subsection (4). As it must in order to prevail here, Muddy Boys takes issue with both approaches, asserting that neither is consonant with what it views as the plain meaning of the statutory language.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b614 For the purposes of our analysis, we assume-without reaching the merits of the question-that the Department's analysis was incorrect, and that the legislature's use of the words \"section\" and \"action\" in the first clause of subsection (5)(d) signals an intent that the attorney fees provision could at least potentially apply to all \"actions\" brought pursuant to any of section 503's various subsections. Even if this is the case, however, Muddy Boys is entitled to recover attorney fees as the prevailing party only if the entity positioned to award them is a \"court.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2058-55-503\">\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 58-55-503\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5)(d) (authorizing \"the court\" to award attorney fees).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b615 Muddy Boys correctly points out that it was the Director-and not the Department-that espoused the position, during the administrative proceedings, that administrative tribunals are not \"courts,\" and that therefore, under subsection (5)(d), no party may recover attorney fees incurred in administrative proceedings (as opposed to court proceedings). Despite having already once passed on adopting that position, the Department now defends it, and argues that the legislature's use of the word \"court\" makes clear that no administrative agency is authorized to award attorney fees, even to the prevailing party. Muddy Boys disagrees, and argues that the term \"court,\" as used in subsection (5)(d), is broad enough to encompass administrative tribunals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b616 As with any question of statutory interpretation, we begin here with an examination of the statutory text. The legislature used the word \"court\" to describe the entity that is authorized to award fees. Unfortunately, that term is not defined in the relevant statute.

But a few examples of this kind of in-passing usage are nowhere near enough to overcome near-unanimity among courts-including our own supreme court in\n   <em>\n    Frito-Lay\n   </em>\n   -that have actually considered the question of whether the word \"court,\" in various statutory and constitutional contexts, was intended to include administrative tribunals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b627 Although we acknowledge that the statute is not entirely clear on this point, we conclude that the legislature, in this context, intended to use the term \"court\" in its narrower and more conventional sense: that \"court\" refers to the courts that are part of the judicial branch of government and that possess the full array of judicial power, including the power to issue binding orders and judgments and hold violators in contempt.

The company was inaccurately accused of committing administrative violations, and threatened not only with sanctions against its contractor license but also with imposition of a six-figure fine. It required the expenditure of over $80,000 in attorney fees, and two significant pre-hearing rulings, for DOPL to realize that it could not and should not proceed with its case. If this were just a question of fairness, we would have no trouble concluding that Muddy Boys should be entitled to recover its attorney fees so that it could be made whole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b629 But the question before us is not one of fairness. It is one of statutory interpretation. The statute upon which Muddy Boys rests its claim for attorney fees authorizes only \"the court\" to award attorney fees, and in this context we conclude that the legislature did not intend the term \"court\" to include administrative agencies. Accordingly, we decline to disturb the Department's conclusion that Muddy Boys is not entitled to recover the attorney fees it incurred in successfully defending itself against DOPL's administrative prosecution.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    Muddy Boys also asks us to review the two peripheral issues that the Department declined to decide: (a) whether the Director had a conflict of interest that should have prevented him from issuing a decision on the merits of Muddy Boys's motion, and (b) whether DOPL should have been compelled to produce copies of any communications it had with the ALJ, including a copy of any un-issued draft order. Because we conclude that Muddy Boys was not entitled to recover attorney fees under the governing statute, we need not reach these issues.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    In 2017, this statute was substantively amended, and the pertinent subsection was renumbered to Utah Code section 58-55-503(7)(d).

This resort to shorthand references is something the legislature is known to do in other sections of the code.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2058-55-503\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 63G-4-501 (using \"district courts\" in subsection (1)(a), and then \"court\" in three following subsections);\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2058-55-503\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 63G-4-402 (using \"district courts\" in subsection (1)(a), and then \"court\" in subsequent subsections).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
