The affidavit was executed March 6, 2019.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   \u00b63 Claborn's affidavit of resignation reflects that: (a) it was freely and voluntarily rendered; (b) she was not subject to coercion or duress; and (c) she was fully aware of the consequences of submitting the resignation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   \u00b64 The affidavit of resignation states Claborn's awareness of a grievance received by the Bar Association concerning her conduct and alleging she engaged in conflicting representation of clients. The Bar's Complaint based on this grievance alleges: (1) Claborn represented Daniel Geiser in a divorce case against April Geiser; (2) Claborn visited April Geiser in 2013 while April was incarcerated in order to obtain a waiver of her appearance in the divorce; (3) The documents April Geiser signed \"gave up custody of her older child\", stated Daniel Geiser was not the father of April Geiser's unborn child, April (hereafter Geiser) was not awarded visitation, and she was required to pay child support; (4) Claborn contacted Geiser in April 2014 to discuss Geiser's intentions concerning her unborn child and Claborn's representation of Geiser in a Judicial Review of her criminal case; (5) Claborn started discussions with Geiser about placing her child with Claborn's daughter until Geiser was no longer incarcerated; (6) Claborn delivered a letter to Geiser from Claborn's daughter stating Claborn's daughter would take care of Geiser's child; Geiser gave birth to a boy and she agreed to a temporary guardianship with Claborn's daughter and son-in-law; (7) The infant was released from the hospital to Claborn's daughter and son-in-law who started calling the child by a name other than the one selected by Geiser; (8) Claborn filed a petition for guardianship on behalf of her daughter and son-in-law; (9) The guardianship was granted and included language allowing for the adoption of the child; (10) Claborn informed Geiser by letter that Claborn's daughter and son-in-law were planning to adopt the child, and had decided to give the child a different first name because \"they do not believe the child should be named after the biological father;\" (11) Claborn then filed an Application for Judicial Review concerning Geiser's criminal case and the application was denied; (12) Claborn's daughter and son-in-law, as guardians, filed a petition for adoption without consent; (13) Claborn was not the lawyer for the guardians on their petition for adoption; (14) Geiser filed a petition to modify the guardianship stating she was deceived by Claborn, and Claborn had \"only sent part of the guardianship papers to her to get her to sign;\" (15) Geiser stated she was unaware the guardianship was not a temporary guardianship or that it included a possible adoption; (16) Geiser was released from incarceration; (17) The assigned trial judge denied the petition for adoption and characterized Claborn's actions as \"the most dishonest, deceitful and unethical behavior\" the judge had seen in several years; and (18) Geiser was reunited with her child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b65 The Complaint against Claborn states she represented Geiser in a criminal case\n   while representing Claborn's daughter in the guardianship case involving Geiser's son, and Claborn created a conflict of interest in violation of Rule 1.7 of the Oklahoma Rules of Professional Conduct, 5 O.S.2011, Ch.1, App. 3-A, (ORPC).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Complaint states Claborn had conversations with Geiser when she lacked an attorney, and these conversations were false and misleading regarding Claborn's interests. The Bar asserts Claborn's conduct violated Rules 4.1 and 4.3 of the Oklahoma Rules of Professional Conduct, 5 O.S.2011, Ch.1, App. 3-A.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Complaint alleges Claborn's conduct was prejudicial to the administration of justice and in violation of the Oklahoma Rules of Professional Conduct, 5 O.S.2011, Ch.1, App. 3-A, Rule 8.4(a), (c), and (d),\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Rule 1.3 of the Rules Governing Disciplinary Proceedings (RGDP), 5 O.S.2011, Ch. 1, App. 1-A.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b66 Respondent's resignation states she is aware the allegations against her, if proven, would constitute violations of Rules 1.3 of the Rules Governing Disciplinary Proceedings, 5 O.S.2011, Ch. 1, App. 1-A, and Rules 1.7, 4.1, 4.3, and 8.4 (a), (c), and (d) of the Oklahoma Rules of Professional Conduct, 5 O.S.2011, Ch.1, App. 3-A, as well as her oath as an attorney.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b67 Respondent states she is aware the burden of proof regarding the allegations against her rests upon the Oklahoma Bar Association, and she waives any and all rights to contest the allegations. The record before us shows a motion by the Bar Association before the trial panel to have the allegations in the Complaint be deemed admitted, and an order of a presiding master of the Professional Responsibility Tribunal which grants the motion deeming the Complaint's allegations admitted.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   We need not examine\n   the allegations deemed admitted\n   <em>\n    for the purpose of imposing the proper professional discipline in this proceeding\n   </em>\n   . A proper resignation pending disciplinary proceedings will necessarily result in the Court imposing a rule-mandated degree of discipline tantamount to disbarment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further, the particularized list of all allegations of misconduct against her stated in her affidavit satisfy the requirements of Rule 8.1(b) of the Rules Governing Disciplinary Proceedings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b68 Respondent states her awareness of the requirements of Rule 9.1, of the Rules Governing Disciplinary Proceedings, and she states she shall comply with that Rule \"within twenty (20) days following the date of her resignation.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b69 Her resignation states she surrendered her Oklahoma Bar membership card to the Bar Association \"with this resignation.\" The affidavit from the Bar Association states Claborn surrendered her Bar Association membership card to the Bar on March 6, 2019. Respondent's resignation was executed March 6, 2019. Her statement of compliance with Rule 9.1 shows she is using the \"date of the resignation\" for performing professional obligations. The Bar Association filed its application for approval of the resignation in this Court on March 8, 2019.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b610 If the Court approves a resignation pending discipline, then the Court\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   determine an effective date for the resignation to be the date it was submitted to the Bar Association when the resignation is contemporaneously filed with this Court and the attorney is treating the date of submission as an effective date for all of the attorney's professional obligations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The two days between March 6th and March 8th is sufficiently contemporaneous for dating the resignation\n   from the date of its submission to the Bar Association in the circumstance of respondent treating the resignation as effective on March 6, 2019. We determine the effective date of resignation to be March 6, 2019.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b611 Respondent states her awareness of Rule 8.2, Rules Governing Disciplinary Proceedings, and that approval or disapproval of her resignation is within the discretion of the Supreme Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b612 Respondent states she is aware she may make no application for reinstatement prior to the expiration of five years from the effective date of the order approving her resignation. We construe this language to mean she is aware she may make no application for reinstatement prior to the expiration of five years from the effective date of the order approving her resignation or the effective date of her resignation as determined by the Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Respondent states she is aware that reinstatement requires compliance with Rule 11 of the Rules Governing Disciplinary Proceedings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b613 Respondent states she is aware the Client's Security Fund may receive claims from her former clients, and she shall pay to the Oklahoma Bar Association, prior to reinstatement, those funds, including principal and interest, expended by the Client's Security Fund for claims against her.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b614 Respondent acknowledges she must cooperate with the Office of the General Counsel by providing current contact information and identifying active cases wherein client documents and files should be returned to the client or forwarded to new counsel, and cases where fees or refunds are owed by Claborn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b615 The application for approval of Claborn's resignation filed by the Bar Association states costs were incurred in the investigation, and the Bar Association seeks reimbursement of costs. Respondent's resignation states she has been informed by the Bar Association that costs in the investigation were incurred and the Bar Association is seeking reimbursement. If professional discipline occurs in the form of the Court approving a resignation pending discipline, then costs may be awarded and a respondent shall pay those costs within ninety (90) days unless the Court has determined otherwise upon good cause shown.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b616 The Application lists individual items of cost for which the Bar Association seeks reimbursement, and the Application states a sum of these costs. The expressly specified total amount of costs pled in the Application is $1,148.19. However, this total appears to be approximately 79% of the total amount of the individual items of costs listed in the Application. When the individual items of cost are added together the sum is $1,448.19. The individual items of costs listed in the Application are supported by exhibits attached to the Application. The individual items of costs include three transcript expenses totaling $978.10, and an additional $470.09 for postage, travel mileage for the\n   Bar's investigator and Trial Panel members, and a witness fee with travel mileage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b617 The Court's exercise of exclusive original jurisdiction in a Bar disciplinary proceeding includes a full-scale exploration of all relevant facts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   Due process requires the Bar to allege facts sufficient to put an attorney on notice of the claims asserted against the attorney.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   Respondent had notice the Bar's Application sought costs in the amount of $1,448.19. We award costs in the amount of $1,448.19, and they shall be paid within 90 days of the effective date of this Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b618 The official roster name and address of the respondent is Charlotte Linn Claborn, O.B.A. No. 21139, P.
