Veracity contends that the district court erred in awarding attorney fees under the attorney fees provision and the indemnification provision of the parties' lease agreement. We agree with Veracity that the court erred in awarding fees under the attorney fees provision, but we are unable to review the court's decision under the indemnification provision due to a lack of findings and analysis. We therefore vacate the award and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b62 Veracity leased certain commercial property from MCG. In 2013, MCG filed a complaint for unlawful detainer and other claims against Veracity (the Underlying Action), relying on a written lease agreement (the Lease). The district court granted summary judgment to MCG, concluding that, among other things, Veracity did not have standing to contest the validity of the Lease. Veracity appealed that decision to this court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    MCG S. LLC v. Veracity Networks LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20UT%20App%2033\">\n    2018 UT App 33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 9-10,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12566423\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/415/1174/\">\n    415 P.3d 1174\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63 While the appeal was pending, Veracity filed a complaint for interpleader\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and thereby initiated the present action (the Interpleader Action). In the complaint's general allegations, Veracity described the Underlying Action. It acknowledged the district court's ruling, but it \"maintain[ed] [that the Lease] is invalid\" and noted the pending appeal. Veracity then alleged that after the district court's ruling, it paid monthly rent to MCG, albeit \"under protest.\" It also alleged that after Banner Bank-MCG's assignee of the rent payments-sent notice of assignment of rents and demanded direct payment of rents, Veracity made rent payments to Banner Bank, also \"under protest.\" Finally, it alleged that Shawn Robinson, an attorney for MCG, claimed to have an attorney's lien against the commercial property and demanded that Veracity make rent payments to him. Veracity therefore named MCG, Banner Bank, and Robinson as defendants in the Interpleader Action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 Given the \"competing demands for payment of rent\" and the resulting potential for \"multiple liabilities against Veracity,\" Veracity alleged in the only count of its complaint that although it had \"an obligation to pay monthly rent, in a disputed amount,\" it was \"unable to determine the proper party to whom the rent should be paid.\" Veracity explained the nature of its dispute, alleging that \"Veracity disputes any obligation to pay rent beyond 1.2 times the monthly mortgage payment owed by MCG to Banner Bank and retains an interest in any rents paid beyond that amount.\" And Veracity concluded with the allegation that it was necessary to interplead the current and future rent payments with the district court, because Veracity was \"in doubt as to which claim or claims of the parties are legally correct and have priority, and as [it] also claims an interest in certain portions of the rent payments.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 In its prayer for relief, Veracity requested that \"the Court order that Veracity may interplead the funds at issue with the Court\"; that \"each of the Defendants be restrained from instituting any action against Veracity for the recovery of funds at issue\"; that the court \"adjudge to whom the funds should be paid\"; and that \"Veracity be discharged from all liability under the premises.\" It also requested that \"Veracity be awarded its reasonable fees and costs as provided by law\" and that \"the Court order such other relief as the Court may deem proper.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b66 In answering Veracity's complaint, Robinson admitted that \"his Lien is inferior to the obligation owed to Banner Bank and withdr[ew] his claim for rents.\" Based on a subsequent stipulation, the district court dismissed Robinson from the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b67 Banner Bank answered the complaint by asserting that \"any rents that Veracity admits to owing to MCG under any rental or lease agreement should be immediately paid to Banner Bank.\" It also urged the court to dismiss it from the Interpleader Action \"because there is no interpleader dispute existing between Banner [Bank] and MCG.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b68 MCG moved to dismiss the Interpleader Action. According to MCG, Banner Bank and MCG agreed that the rents owed by Veracity \"should be paid directly to Banner Bank,\" and therefore \"there is no dispute to the funds.\" MCG further argued that \"interpleader requires the plaintiff or stakeholder to disclaim any interest in the funds,\" that Veracity improperly \"continue[d] to maintain an interest in the funds,\" and that through the Interpleader Action Veracity was making an \"inappropriate collateral attack on\" the ruling in the Underlying Action. MCG thus asserted that the Interpleader Action was \"improper and should be dismissed.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b69 Veracity opposed MCG's motion to dismiss. It stated that \"it has been faced with competing demands as to whom rents should be paid and has asserted as much in its complaint, thus stating a claim for interpleader.\" According to Veracity, \"there [was] still a dispute as to the recipient of Veracity's rental payments,\" and \"[i]f MCG and Banner Bank were to stipulate to the proper recipient of the interpleaded funds and future rents and if MCG were to amend its Answer to acknowledge Banner Bank's right to the interpleaded funds and future rents, Veracity would likely agree to dismissal and disbursement of the interpleaded funds to Banner Bank,\" \"subject to reservation of Veracity's claimed interests.\" With respect to Veracity's claimed interests, Veracity asserted that it \"disputes the amount of rent claimed by MCG but, nonetheless, has paid the amount claimed, albeit under protest so as to preserve its rights to recoup overpayments\" and to \"avoid any argument of waiver down the road.\" Veracity further explained that \"[r]eserving its rights and interests to overpayments is entirely consistent with modern interpleader\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and that its \"reservation of rights does not preclude Veracity's interpleader action.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b610 The district court granted MCG's motion to dismiss, concluding that \"there [was] no present basis for an interpleader suit as the interpled Defendants [did] not dispute among themselves as to which of them is entitled to the funds.\" The court explained that neither Robinson nor MCG disputed Banner Bank's rights to the rent payments and consequently Banner Bank has an \"uncontested assignment of rents and is entitled to the rents.\" The court also noted \"the other issues of the complaint have already been determined in another case which is currently on appeal.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b611 After the Interpleader Action was dismissed, MCG moved for an award of its attorney fees, relying on two provisions of the Lease. First, under the attorney fees\n   provision in Paragraph 22.13, MCG argued that as a prevailing party it should receive attorney fees from Veracity in an action brought to interpret the Lease. In support, MCG asserted that \"not only was [the Interpleader Action] brought to determine to whom the rent should be paid under the Lease, but Veracity also put the terms of the Lease at issue in its Complaint.\" Veracity did so, MCG asserted, \"by specifically requesting that [the district court] interpret the Lease in its favor, either by recognizing and accepting its arguments that Veracity should not be held liable for the face value rental amount on the Lease or by holding that Veracity has no liability under the Lease whatsoever for its occupancy of the premises.\" MCG's assertions relied on the portions of Veracity's complaint disputing the amount due under the Lease, claiming to \"retain an interest\" in rents, and asking for its liability to be discharged.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 3-5. Second, under the indemnification provision in Paragraph 11.1 of the Lease, MCG argued that it should receive attorney fees because the litigation was commenced by Veracity, MCG was made a defendant to the case, and \"[t]here has been no willful misconduct or gross negligence by MCG.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b612 Veracity opposed MCG's motion for attorney fees, arguing that the plain terms of the Lease do not provide for an award of fees to MCG. According to Veracity, the Interpleader Action was not an action to \"enforce or interpret any of the provisions\" of the Lease and therefore did not meet any of the predicates for an award of attorney fees under the attorney fees provision. Contrary to MCG's claim that Veracity's complaint put the Lease's interpretation at issue, Veracity stated that, in its complaint, it \"simply included its recitation of the underlying facts and litigation [in the Underlying Action] as background information for the Court ... and to preserve its position that MCG's subject lease is invalid and the rental amounts are in dispute.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Veracity also argued that the indemnification provision similarly does not authorize an award of attorney fees to MCG for the reason that MCG had committed \"willful misconduct and gross negligence.\" Specifically, Veracity argued that MCG did not show that its failure to meet its obligations, which included making its monthly mortgage payments and paying its prior counsel, \"was anything other than willful or negligent.\" Veracity further complained that it had \"had no opportunity to conduct discovery as to MCG's failure to meet its obligations.\" In its reply memorandum in support of its motion for attorney fees, MCG did not respond to Veracity's arguments and allegations related to the indemnification provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b613 The district court granted MCG's motion for attorney fees, stating, \"Pursuant to Rule 73 of the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure and Paragraphs 22.13 and 11.1 of the Lease, MCG is entitled to attorney fees from Veracity ....\" Veracity appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b614 During the pendency of the present appeal, this court reversed the district court's summary judgment in the Underlying Action. Concluding that the district court erred in ruling that \"Veracity could not defend [the] lawsuit by contesting the validity of the lease,\" this court remanded the Underlying Action to the district court for further proceedings.\n   <em>\n    MCG S.

We agree that the district court should not have awarded attorney fees under the attorney fees provision. But because we are unable to discern the basis for the district court's decision to award attorney fees under the indemnification provision, we remand the case for entry of a new decision on that issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   I. The Attorney Fees Provision\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b617 Veracity contends that the district court's award of attorney fees is erroneous under the plain language of the attorney fees provision. That provision, Veracity asserts, \"only authorizes attorney fees in certain types of actions\"-including actions brought to interpret the Lease-and the Interpleader Action \"is not one of them.\" In support, Veracity argues that, in the Interpleader Action, it \"only sought to have the district court resolve the competing claims to Veracity's rent payment,\" not to \"relitigate the amount of monthly rent due under the Lease.\" Veracity explains that its factual recitations about the rent dispute in the Underlying Action were merely \"factual background\" and \"were intended solely to avoid waiving its rights to seek recoupment of rent overpayments in the event that it obtains a rent reduction in the [Underlying Action].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b618 MCG responds that the district court correctly awarded attorney fees under the attorney fees provision because the Interpleader Action qualified as one of the types of actions for which attorney fees are authorized, namely, an action \"brought to ... interpret ... the provisions of this Lease.\" MCG asserts that Veracity \"put the terms of the Lease at issue\" by \"attempt[ing] to use the [Interpleader Action] to have the court interpret its rights under the Lease and to maintain its claim to a portion of the lease payments.\" MCG further asserts that Veracity wanted to use the Interpleader Action \"to get a ruling\" allowing it to \"recover a portion of the monthly lease payments.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b619 The Lease's attorney fees provision, contained in Paragraph 22.13, states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   If any action is brought to recover any rent or other amount under this Lease because of any default under this Lease, to enforce or interpret any provision of this Lease, or for recovery of possession of the Premises, the party prevailing in such action shall be entitled to recover from the other party reasonable attorneys' fees (including those incurred in connection with any appeal), the amount of which shall be fixed by the court and made part of any judgment rendered.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Under this provision's plain language, attorney fees are potentially available in only three types of actions: actions \"brought to recover any rent or other amount under this Lease because of any default,\" actions \"to enforce or interpret any provision of this Lease,\" and actions \"for recovery of possession of the Premises.\" Only the second of these is at issue here. Hence, the question presented is whether the district court correctly decided that the Interpleader Action was an action brought to interpret the Lease.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b620 We agree with Veracity that the Interpleader Action was not brought to interpret the Lease. Veracity's complaint in the Interpleader Action alleged only one count, a count for interpleader. In its prayer for relief, Veracity explained to the district court that because \"there are competing demands by the Defendants against the monthly rent payments and because Veracity is unable to determine the proper party to whom rents\n   should be paid,\" it asked the court to \"order that Veracity may interplead the funds at issue with the Court,\" to restrain the defendants \"from instituting any action against Veracity for the recovery of funds at issue,\" and to \"adjudge to whom the funds should be paid.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   For the district court to act on these requests, it was not required to decide what the Lease meant. Rather, the court would decide to whom rent should be paid by looking at Banner Bank's notice of assignment of rents, Robinson's demand letter, and other related documents. Thus, Veracity's prayer for relief did not request that the district court interpret the Lease in the Interpleader Action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b621 Likewise, Veracity did not ask elsewhere in the complaint for the district court to adjudicate the Lease's meaning or Veracity's rights concerning the Lease. True, Veracity's complaint for interpleader mentioned that Veracity maintained that the Lease was invalid, that the monthly rent was \"a disputed amount,\" and that Veracity \"also claims an interest in certain portions of the rent payments.\" Though allegations like these are perhaps unusual in an interpleader action, Veracity did not seek an interpretation of the Lease or request an adjudication of disputed terms. Rather, Veracity acknowledged in its complaint that issues relating to the interpretation and enforcement of the Lease had been adjudicated in the Underlying Action and were on appeal to this court. The fact that Veracity sought to reserve its rights regarding the funds it had deposited in the event it succeeded on appeal in the Underlying Action does not mean that Veracity sought to adjudicate those issues anew in the Interpleader Action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b622 Moreover, Veracity's subsequent filings in the Interpleader Action confirm that Veracity did not seek relief related to the interpretation of the Lease. For instance, in opposing MCG's motion to dismiss, Veracity stated that it \"asserted the dispute over the amount and its right to recover any overpayments\" in order to \"avoid any argument of waiver down the road.\" Veracity reiterated this point in opposing MCG's motion for attorney fees, asserting that \"its recitation of the underlying facts and litigation\" was included in its complaint \"as background information for the Court ... and to preserve its position that MCG's subject lease is invalid and the rental amounts are in dispute.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   These later statements further support that the complaint's allegations about disputed amounts and claimed interests in portions of the rent payments served to reserve Veracity's rights, not to invite the court to resolve those disputes or claims. We therefore conclude that the Interpleader Action was not brought to interpret the Lease and the district court thus erred in awarding attorney fees to MCG on that basis under the attorney fees provision.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   II. The Indemnification Provision\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b623 Veracity next contends that the district court's award of attorney fees is erroneous under the plain language of the indemnification provision. That provision, contained in Paragraph 11.1 of the Lease, states, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   Tenant shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Landlord ... from and against all demands, claims, causes of action, judgments, losses, damages, liabilities, fines, penalties, costs and expenses, including attorneys' fees, arising from ... any litigation commenced by or against Tenant to which Landlord is made a party without\n   willful misconduct or gross negligence on the part of Landlord.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Veracity argues that this provision is inapplicable for two reasons: first, because indemnification is available only in third-party actions and, second, because MCG's willful misconduct or gross negligence necessitated and prolonged the Interpleader Action. We address each in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   A. Indemnification Between Contracting Parties\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b624 Veracity asserts that the indemnification provision \"does not apply when Veracity sues MCG, but only when MCG is 'made a party' to litigation by some third party.\" Relying primarily on\n   <em>\n    American Rural Cellular, Inc. v. Systems Communication Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11960432\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/939/185/\">\n    939 P.2d 185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Utah Ct. App. 1997), Veracity asserts that \"attorney fees are not available on an indemnification theory when a contract otherwise provides for attorney fees in an intra-party action.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b625 MCG contends that this issue is unpreserved and \"should not be considered because Veracity never raised the issue\" before the district court. MCG also defends the district court's decision on the merits, arguing that the indemnification provision \"should be interpreted based on [its] plain language,\" which does \"not necessarily limit the provision to third-party actions.\" MCG further argues that the Lease's language is distinguishable from the contract in\n   <em>\n    American Rural Cellular\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b626 As an initial matter, we agree with MCG that Veracity did not preserve this issue for appeal. \"Generally, we will not consider an issue unless it has been preserved for appeal by first presenting the issue to the district court in such a way that the district court has the opportunity to rule upon it.\"\n   <em>\n    Pepperwood Homeowners Ass'n v. Mitchell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6866805\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/351/844/\">\n    2015 UT App 137\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 11,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6866805\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/351/844/\">\n    351 P.3d 844\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Veracity did not raise the issue of whether the Lease's indemnification provision applies only to third-party actions when it opposed MCG's motion for attorney fees or at any other time before the district court. Because Veracity did not give the district court an opportunity to rule on the issue, it has not preserved the issue for appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b627 Nevertheless, Veracity asserts that we may reach the issue under plain error review because \"the district court committed plain error when it entered its attorney fee award in conflict with existing case law and the plain language of the Lease.\" \"Under plain-error review, we may reverse the lower court on an issue not properly preserved for appeal if the appellant demonstrates that a prejudicial error should have been obvious to the district court.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6866805\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/351/844/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (cleaned up).

In that case, the plaintiff and defendant had an agreement that included an indemnity clause in which the plaintiff agreed to indemnify and hold the defendant \"harmless from all expenses and attorney fees of whatever kind and nature in any way relating to\" the parties' agreement.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11960432\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/939/185/\">\n    939 P.2d at 192\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (cleaned up).

Because Veracity thus has not shown that the alleged error should have been obvious to the district court, Veracity has not demonstrated that the district court plainly erred in ignoring\n   <em>\n    American Rural Cellular\n   </em>\n   when it awarded attorney fees to MCG under the indemnification provision.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   B. Willful Misconduct or Gross Negligence\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b632 Veracity asserts that even if the indemnification provision could authorize attorney fees in this action, the provision provides for indemnification only when MCG acts without \"willful misconduct or gross negligence.\" And because Veracity \"presented ... uncontested evidence of MCG's willful\n   misconduct or gross misconduct,\" which \"prolonged and complicated the interpleader action,\" MCG was not entitled to indemnification. Veracity also argues that the district court did not \"disclos[e] its rationale\" for awarding fees in the face of Veracity's evidence. MCG counters that \"[b]ecause Veracity could have resolved the dispute without filing an action or naming MCG as a party, [Veracity] cannot claim that the action was caused by MCG's willful misconduct or gross negligence.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b633 The indemnification provision states that \"Tenant shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Landlord\" when, among other things, \"Landlord is made a party [to litigation] without willful misconduct or gross negligence on the part of Landlord.\" Under this plain language, MCG could recover attorney fees only when it has not acted with \"willful misconduct or gross negligence.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b634 For this reason, MCG informed the district court when it moved for attorney fees that \"[t]here has been no willful misconduct or gross negligence by MCG.\" Veracity then contested MCG's assertion, claiming that MCG was \"ignor[ing] the genesis of this action.\" According to Veracity, MCG acted with willful misconduct and gross negligence when it failed \"to make monthly mortgage payments of $ 5,168.72 to Banner Bank\" despite receiving \"almost double that amount\" in monthly rental payments from Veracity and when it failed \"to pay its prior counsel.\" As evidentiary support, Veracity cited correspondence from Banner Bank's counsel and Robinson's demand letter. MCG's conduct, Veracity contended, \"resulted in competing demands for Veracity's rental payments, requiring Veracity to file [the Interpleader Action] in order to resolve those demands.\" Thereafter, MCG did not respond to Veracity's allegations of willful misconduct and gross negligence-even in its reply memorandum in support of its motion for attorney fees. Based solely on the parties' written filings, and without further proceedings, the district court summarily concluded that MCG was entitled to attorney fees under Paragraph 11.1, thereby impliedly concluding that MCG did not act with willful misconduct or gross negligence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b635 Generally, \"where the inadequacy of the [district] court's findings of fact and conclusions of law results in our inability to ascertain the basis of the district court's decision, we are prevented from effectively reviewing the district court's decision and may remand for the entry of more-detailed findings.\"\n   <em>\n    Maak v.

And where the parties controverted whether MCG acted with willful misconduct or gross negligence, the district court was presented with a factual and legal issue. Although the district court's decision awarding attorney fees implicitly resolved the dispute in MCG's favor, we cannot discern the district court's basis for doing so. In particular, the district court's conclusory award of attorney fees under Paragraph 11.1 does not disclose how the court assessed Veracity's evidence, which went unrefuted, or why the court reached its apparent conclusion that MCG did not commit willful misconduct or act with gross negligence. In other words, the district court did not identify the factual or legal basis for its award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b637 Because we lack insight into the district court's rationale for its decision, we cannot effectively review it. We therefore remand the issue of attorney fees under the indemnification provision to the district court for further proceedings, which may require an evidentiary hearing, and for the court to determine the issue anew and to provide reasoned analysis supporting its decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 1, 45-46 (remanding a district court's ruling where this court was \"unable to discern the basis for the district court's conclusion\" because the ruling did not provide \"insight into the district court's reasoning\" or \"indicate what record evidence supports its determination\");\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <em>\n    Tillotson v.
