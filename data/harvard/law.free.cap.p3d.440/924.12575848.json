He now appeals his convictions for one count of aggravated sexual abuse of a child, one count of sexual abuse of a child, and one count of forcible sexual abuse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b62 Cegers raises four issues that we reach on appeal. First, Cegers argues that the district court erred when it allowed the State to admit testimony from M.F.'s high school counselor that bolstered M.F.'s credibility. At trial, M.F.'s counselor testified that she did not believe that M.F. fabricated the allegations against Cegers to receive a school scholarship. Because this testimony offered an opinion as to M.F.'s truthfulness on a particular occasion, it constituted impermissible bolstering. Although Cegers did not raise a bolstering objection, we address the issue on appeal because Cegers has successfully argued that the plain error exception to the preservation rule applies. We conclude that the admission of the counselor's testimony, combined with the district court's subsequent instruction directing the jury to consider the counselor's opinion, amounted to plain error. And because the State introduced no evidence of Cegers's guilt apart from the alleged victims' testimony, Cegers was prejudiced by the impermissible bolstering. Accordingly, we must vacate Cegers's convictions and remand to the district court for a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63 Although we vacate his convictions based on impermissible bolstering, we address three other issues Cegers raises on appeal that may be relevant on remand. With respect to his challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, we conclude that the victims' testimony was not so inherently improbable that it could not sustain his convictions and affirm the district court's denial of his motion for a directed verdict. We also conclude that the jury instructions did not misstate the law or mislead the jury with respect to the intent elements of sexual abuse of a child and forcible sexual abuse. Finally, the district did not err in declining to review M.F.'s medical records in camera because Cegers did not make a threshold showing that the records related to the kind of condition contemplated by rule 506(d)(1) of the Utah Rules of Evidence. Accordingly, we affirm the district court's rulings on these issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   BACKGROUND\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 In June 2011, S.B. disclosed to her brother, mother, and a friend that Cegers had molested her while she was sleeping over with M.F. S.B.'s mother reported Cegers to\n   the police. Shortly thereafter, the police met and spoke with M.F., the daughter of Cegers's girlfriend. M.F. told the police that she was not aware that anything had happened to S.B. while she was at M.F.'s home and that she herself had never been sexually abused by Cegers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 Roughly four years later, Cegers and M.F.'s mother separated. After M.F. and her mother moved out of Cegers's home following a domestic violence disturbance, M.F. told her mother that Cegers had been sexually abusing her since she was five years old. The next day, M.F. also confided in her school counselor that Cegers had sexually abused her throughout her childhood. After M.F. disclosed the abuse to her counselor, the counselor contacted the police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b66 Upon receiving M.F.'s report of abuse, the State charged Cegers with six counts of aggravated sexual abuse of a child,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2076-5-404.1\">\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 76-5-404.1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (4) (LexisNexis Supp. 2018),\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   relating to both S.B. and M.F., and two counts of forcible sexual abuse,\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2076-5-404.1\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 76-5-404, relating to M.F.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b67 Before trial, Cegers filed a motion to sever the charges relating to M.F. and S.B. and a motion to allow Cegers to subpoena M.F.'s medical and school records. The district court denied the motion to sever, concluding that the charges relating to S.B. were properly joined with the charges relating to M.F. and that the joinder did not prejudice Cegers. The district court also denied Cegers's motion to subpoena M.F.'s medical, counseling, and school records under rule 506(d)(1) of the Utah Rules of Evidence. Regarding the medical records, which included counseling records dating back to 1997 and counseling records from some of the hospitals\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   that provided care for M.F. after a suicide attempt in 2013, the court concluded that Cegers had not shown that M.F. suffered from a relevant emotional condition as required by rule 506(d)(1) and that he had not shown with reasonable certainty that the records contained exculpatory evidence. Regarding M.F.'s school records, the district court denied Cegers's request because the defense had failed to \"lay out what the standards of the expectations of privacy are with respect to those records.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b68 Additionally, prior to presentation of the State's evidence at trial, Cegers objected to the \"intent requirements\" in the element jury instructions for sexual abuse of a child and forcible sexual abuse. Specifically, Cegers objected to the instructions' inclusion of \"knowingly\" and \"recklessly\" as possible mental states with which Cegers could have committed the touching elements of both offenses, arguing that sexual abuse of a child and forcible sexual abuse are \"specific intent crime[s].\" The district court overruled Cegers's objection, emphasizing that the Model Utah Jury Instruction after which the instructions were patterned accurately stated that \"it is the more general mens rea that applies with respect to the touching.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b69 At trial, the State introduced testimony from S.B., M.F., M.F.'s counselor, S.B.'s mother, S.B.'s brother, a friend of S.B., and M.F.'s mother. S.B. testified that M.F. was her \"best friend\" until part way through junior high school and that she spent a considerable amount of time at the home that Cegers shared with M.F.'s mother, M.F., and Cegers's other children. She testified that she remained friends with M.F. until Cegers made her feel too uncomfortable to return to their home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b610 S.B. described several incidents where Cegers touched her sexually. According to her testimony, Cegers would wait until she was alone with him and touch her breasts and groin area over and under her clothing. She said these incidents took place in Cegers's home in the living room while she was sleeping or lying on the couch or floor and in the kitchen washing dishes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b611 M.F. testified that she was not aware that Cegers had abused S.B. Although she\n   remembered the police speaking with her about S.B.'s allegations, according to M.F., neither the police nor Cegers ever provided her with specific details. But M.F. testified extensively about her own sexual abuse by Cegers, stating that Cegers began touching her sexually when she was five years old and that the abuse continued into her teenage years. According to M.F., Cegers repeatedly rubbed her vagina over her clothes with his feet and hands, brushed his hands underneath her breasts, and pressed his erect penis against her. M.F. also described incidents where, while she was sitting on the couch in Cegers's living room, Cegers rubbed her vagina over her clothes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b612 M.F. did not disclose Cegers's conduct to anyone until she was eighteen years old. According to M.F., Cegers's relationship with her mother and the other children in the home was tense. M.F. felt that Cegers treated her as his \"favorite\" when she was younger, but he would swear at, hit, and ground his biological children. In addition, M.F.'s mother was financially unstable. M.F. testified that, as a result, she felt her family would suffer if she reported Cegers's abuse. M.F. only disclosed Cegers's abuse to her mother during her senior year of high school. After an altercation involving M.F., her mother, and Cegers that resulted in M.F. and her mother moving out of their shared home, M.F. admitted to her mother that Cegers had been abusing her since she was a young child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b613 M.F.'s high school counselor testified that M.F. also disclosed the sexual abuse to her the day after M.F. reported the abuse to her mother. The counselor testified that she had met with M.F. periodically following M.F.'s attempted suicide years prior and continuing through M.F.'s senior year. During this time, they spoke about M.F.'s discomfort at home, her anxiety, and her academic plans. According to the counselor's testimony, because she had been meeting with M.F. for some time, M.F.'s disclosure came as a surprise to her. The counselor immediately reported the allegations to the police. The police came to the school and interviewed M.F. in the counselor's office.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b614 Around this same time, M.F. applied for a scholarship offered to students who had overcome substantial challenges. In the scholarship application, M.F. included information about Cegers's abuse. When the State asked whether M.F.'s counselor believed that M.F. fabricated her allegations against Cegers to qualify for a scholarship, her counselor responded that the suggestion was \"the most absurd thing [she had] ever heard of. There is--there is no way [she] would ever conceive that that would be possible.\" Cegers objected to this testimony, arguing that the counselor was \"speculating about what's in somebody else's mind.\" The district court overruled Cegers's objection. The counselor explained that she had not spoken with M.F. about the scholarship any more than she had with other students, and she was not sure when, in relation to M.F.'s reports of abuse, M.F. had applied for the scholarship.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   After the State concluded the counselor's direct examination and without prompting from defense counsel or the prosecutor, the district court gave the following instruction to the jury:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   [W]ith respect to the question about the witness'[s] view about whether [M.F.] would have been fabricating in order to get a scholarship. I overruled the objection that was made, which was that a witness can't testify about what's in another person's mind, and that is correct. The witness can't testify about what's in someone else's mind.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   So you are to consider her testimony in that regard only to the extent that she was expressing her opinion based on the period of time that she knew the witness and the overall facts and circumstances, but not because she has the ability to know what another person is thinking.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b615 After S.B., M.F., and the school counselor testified, the State presented testimony from S.B.'s mother, S.B.'s brother, and a friend of S.B., and M.F.'s mother. None of the subsequent witnesses testified that they had witnessed or suspected any sexually abusive\n   behavior by Cegers against the victims. At the conclusion of the State's case in chief, Cegers made a motion for a directed verdict, which the district court denied. Cegers then testified in his own defense and denied ever touching the victims in a sexually inappropriate manner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b616 The jury convicted Cegers of one count of aggravated sexual abuse of a child relating to M.F., one count of sexual abuse of a child relating to S.B., and one count of forcible sexual abuse relating to M.F. Cegers appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   ISSUES AND STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b617 Cegers contends that the district court erred by allowing the State to admit testimony from the school counselor that impermissibly bolstered M.F.'s credibility. If preserved, we review the district court's admission of testimony for an abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    State v. Iorg\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10383533\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/801/938/#p939\">\n    801 P.2d 938\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 939 (Utah Ct. App. 1990). But if a party fails \"to raise a timely and specific objection\" to the district court's evidentiary ruling, the defendant must show that an exception to the preservation rule applies.\n   <em>\n    State v. Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20UT%2076\">\n    2017 UT 76\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 18-19,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12567068\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/416/443/\">\n    416 P.3d 443\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Cegers argues that, if the issue on appeal was not preserved below, the plain error exception applies. \"Under the plain error doctrine, we will reverse the trial court's ruling only if (i) an error exists; (ii) the error should have been obvious to the trial court; and (iii) the error is harmful, i.e., absent the error, there is a reasonable likelihood of a more favorable outcome for the defendant.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

We review the district court's denial of Cegers's motion for a directed verdict because, if the evidence at trial was insufficient to sustain his convictions, double jeopardy may bar retrial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Burks v.

Cegers failed to properly raise this issue in the district court. \"A proper objection puts the judge on notice of the asserted error and allows the opportunity for correction at that time in the course of the proceeding.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

In context, the counselor was offering a \"direct opinion\" as to M.F.'s truthfulness on a particular occasion, namely, when M.F. stated in her scholarship application that Cegers had abused her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b627 A second error occurred when the district court commented on this evidence at the conclusion of the counselor's testimony. Without prompting or input from counsel, the court instructed the jury, \"You are to consider [the counselor's] testimony in that regard only to the extent that she was expressing her opinion based on the period of time that she knew the witness and the overall facts and circumstances, but not because she has the ability to know what another person is thinking.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The limitation-\"but not because she has the ability to know what another person is thinking\"-appears to have been aimed at addressing the misplaced speculation objection. However, the remainder of the instruction told the jury to weigh the counselor's testimony that M.F. had not lied to get the scholarship in light of the counselor's familiarity with M.F. and understanding of the facts and circumstances.

If the counselor had testified more generally that M.F. is not the type of person who would falsely accuse someone for personal gain, the court may well have been correct to instruct the jury that the counselor's testimony could be considered \"only to the extent that she is expressing her opinion\"-presumably, as to M.F.'s reputation for truthfulness-\"based on the period of time that she knew the witness and the overall facts and circumstances.\" But the counselor's testimony was limited to whether M.F. had been truthful on a particular occasion-when she alleged in her scholarship application that Cegers had abused her.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bragg\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7257984\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/317/452/\">\n    2013 UT App 282\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 31,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7257984\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/317/452/\">\n    317 P.3d 452\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[R]ule 608(a) prohibits any testimony as to a witness's truthfulness on a particular occasion.\" (quotation simplified) ). As a result, the instruction directed the jury to give weight to the counselor's opinion that M.F. had not fabricated the allegations in her scholarship application if the jury believed the counselor had sufficient knowledge of M.F. and the surrounding circumstances.

Unlike most cases in which the defendant argues plain error on appeal, Cegers did not simply fail to raise an objection, but instead he raised the wrong objection. By objecting to the counselor's testimony on the ground that she was \"speculating about what's in somebody else's mind,\" Cegers misdirected the court to the rules requiring that lay witness testimony be based on firsthand knowledge.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Utah R.

Similarly, here, M.F.'s counselor testified that she did not believe M.F. was fabricating the allegations in her scholarship application. We cannot distinguish this testimony from the impermissible bolstering we have previously deemed to be plainly inadmissible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b631 But even were we not convinced that the counselor's testimony itself obviously violated the rules of evidence, the initial error cannot be disassociated from the court's instruction directly following this testimony. The court's subsequent instruction had the unintended consequence of exacerbating the bolstering problem by instructing the jury to consider the counselor's testimony \"to the extent that she was expressing her opinion based on the period of time that she knew the witness and the overall facts and circumstances.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Even if the initial bolstering was insufficiently obvious to expect a district court to recognize the error and intervene sua sponte, the subsequent error in commenting on the testimony was more obvious. The curative instruction was issued after the district court had the opportunity to reflect on the admissibility of the testimony and to consider how the jury would evaluate the counselor's testimony in light of the court's directive. And the prospect of commenting on the testimony, without a request or other input from counsel, would surely give the district court pause.

In\n   <em>\n    Stefaniak\n   </em>\n   , for example, we determined that the admission of bolstering testimony was prejudicial when the State produced no physical evidence of the crime or testimony from third parties who had witnessed the alleged abuse and when the victim's \"report was first made several months after the incident, in the midst of domestic turmoil between the victim's mother and [the defendant].\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10346042\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/900/1094/#p1095\">\n    900 P.2d at 1096\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b634 In contrast, in\n   <em>\n    State v.

In addition to the victim's testimony, the State had offered testimony from the victim's mother that she saw the defendant leaving the victim's room naked; testimony from the defendant that he was intoxicated and did not remember the incident; and testimony from a doctor that the victim suffered from severe intellectual disabilities, making it improbable that she fabricated her allegations.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 21-22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b635 Here, the facts more closely resemble those in\n   <em>\n    Stefaniak\n   </em>\n   than those in\n   <em>\n    Adams\n   </em>\n   . The only direct evidence of Cegers's abuse of S.B. and M.F. was their own testimony. They both described similar incidents in which Cegers touched or attempted to touch their genitals while they were asleep or about to fall asleep. As is often the case with sexual abuse, the State had no other evidence to corroborate the victims' allegations. Neither S.B.'s mother, nor brother, nor her friend testified that they had witnessed any sexually abusive or suspicious behavior by Cegers. M.F.'s mother testified that she never suspected that Cegers was sexually abusing her daughter and that she was surprised when M.F. disclosed the abuse to her. M.F. herself testified that she never witnessed Cegers behave in a sexually inappropriate manner toward S.B., even though S.B. testified that M.F. was in the room during some of the incidents of abuse. Cegers also categorically denied both victims' allegations. And although the school counselor had been meeting with M.F. for some time, she testified that M.F. had never reported the abuse to her before.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b636 In addition, M.F. provided conflicting reports to the police about Cegers's abuse. When the police spoke with her after S.B. reported Cegers's abuse, M.F. denied that Cegers had ever touched her inappropriately. When she reported her own abuse years later, M.F. alleged that Cegers had been abusing her since she was five, well before her first conversation with the police about Cegers. Furthermore, just as in\n   <em>\n    Stefaniak\n   </em>\n   , M.F. reported her abuse \"in the midst of domestic turmoil\" between her mother and the alleged perpetrator of her abuse.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10346042\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/900/1094/#p1095\">\n    900 P.2d at 1096\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b637 Given that the jury's verdict hinged on its assessment of the victims' credibility, the counselor's testimony bolstering M.F.'s credibility carried significant weight, made heavier by the district court's instruction to the jury that it could consider the counselor's \"opinion based on the period of time that she knew the witness and the overall facts and circumstances.\" This instruction suggested that the jury should weigh the counselor's opinion as to whether M.F. should be believed in light of the counselor's testimony that she had spent considerable time with M.F. and was aware of the circumstances of her personal and family life. In effect, the district court inadvertently instructed the jury to consider the counselor's testimony in precisely the manner rule 608 prohibits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b638 If the jury credited the counselor's testimony that M.F. had been honest when reporting the abuse, it was not only more likely to believe M.F.'s account but also more likely to believe S.B.'s similar allegations against Cegers. M.F.'s allegations of abuse carried the implication that Cegers had a\n   propensity to sexually abuse minor females and suggested that it was more likely that S.B. was abused in a similar manner.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

As a result, the potentially prejudicial impact of the inadmissible testimony was not limited to the counts involving M.F.

Indeed, in all three instructions, the requirement that Cegers \"did so with the intent to cause substantial emotional or bodily pain to any person, or arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any person\" is listed as a separate element of the offense.

First, in\n   <em>\n    Cardall\n   </em>\n   , the supreme court addressed circumstances where a defendant charged with rape of a\n   child requested review of the alleged victim's \"school psychological records,\" including an \"anxiety exam\" administered by a school counselor and any information pertaining to the victim's prior false allegations of sexual abuse against the school janitor.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11532765\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/982/79/\">\n    1999 UT 51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 10,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11532765\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/982/79/\">\n    982 P.2d 79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation simplified). The court concluded that the defendant had met his burden of showing that the subject of the requested records experienced a \"physical, mental, or emotional condition\" that supported an element of his defense by asserting that the victim was \"a habitual liar, that she fabricated her story about being raped, that she is mentally and emotionally unstable, and that the records show that on at least one previous occasion these psychological traits led her to lie about an attempted rape or sexual touching by the school janitor.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29. In a subsequent case,\n   <em>\n    Worthen\n   </em>\n   , our supreme court explained that the\n   <em>\n    Cardall\n   </em>\n   court had \"seized upon the term 'psychological traits' to describe [the defendant's] assertions that his alleged victim was a habitual liar, a fabricator, and mentally and emotionally unstable\" and, \"[t]ellingly, these psychological traits were accompanied by false allegations of sexual misconduct against a school janitor.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6996231\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/222/1144/\">\n    2009 UT 79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 23,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6996231\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/222/1144/\">\n    222 P.3d 1144\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court noted it was \"more likely than not that none of the victim's traits, taken alone, would have established the existence of an emotional condition.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6996231\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/222/1144/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   \u00b659 In\n   <em>\n    Worthen\n   </em>\n   , the supreme court determined that the victim's \" 'frustration with, and hatred toward' her parents [was] an emotional condition contemplated by [ rule 506(d)(1) ].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28. The defendant, who was the adoptive father of the alleged victim, argued that the victim harbored \"extreme hatred toward[ ] her parents, which drove her to explore a way to escape [their] home[,] ... motivated her attempted suicide, found voice in her violent journal entries, and led her to fabricate abuse allegations.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25. To support this claim, the defendant requested in camera review of the victim's medical records for communications pertaining to the victim's prior denial of abuse by the defendant, \"cognitive problems and major misinterpretation problems,\" and \"motive to fabricate the allegations stemming from her hatred of her parents.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6 (quotation simplified). Our supreme court concluded that because the victim \"demonstrated persistent hostility toward[ ] her parents and repeatedly expressed her desire to leave the home,\" \"the chronic and persistent nature\" of her anger and hatred amounted to a condition, which was an element of the defense's claim that the victim had a motive to fabricate allegations of abuse.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28. The court stressed, however, \"that the fact that [the victim] may have made statements to her therapist that simply conveyed her emotions or feelings does not by itself constitute a mental or emotional condition under the rule merely because those communications may be used for specific impeachment purposes.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29. The court added, \"[i]f feelings themselves were to constitute a mental or emotional condition, the exception to the psychotherapist-patient privilege would devour the privilege.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   \u00b660 Here, Cegers has not demonstrated that the communications contained in M.F.'s medical records reflect a \"condition.\" He represents that the hospital records turned over by the State show that M.F. \"reported at the time of her suicide attempt that her depression was 'occasioned by increased fights with [Cegers] over household chores and being able to spend time with her friends' and she had suicidal thoughts due to ongoing marital discord and the threat of [Cegers and her mother] separating.\" But Cegers does not contend that M.F.'s depression, by itself, is relevant to an element of his claim or defense. Rather, he contends that \"frustration with Cegers over his management of the household and his relationship with [M.F.'s] mother\" rose to the level of a \"diagnosable condition,\" adding that \"[d]epression based on parental discord and frustration over Cegers's management of the household is the kind of condition contemplated in\n   <em>\n    Worthen\n   </em>\n   .\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   \u00b661 Although persistent depression may be a mental or emotional condition, Cegers does not claim that M.F.'s depression was the condition that led to the allegedly false accusations of sexual abuse. Unlike the \"psychological traits\" in\n   <em>\n    Cardall\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Worthen\n   </em>\n   that made it more likely that the victims may have fabricated their stories, Cegers did not claim that M.F.'s depression affected her\n   \"perceptions, behavior, or decision making in a way that is relevant to the reliability of [her] testimony.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Worthen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6996231\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/222/1144/\">\n    2009 UT 79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 21,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6996231\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/222/1144/\">\n    222 P.3d 1144\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Instead, Cegers argued that M.F.'s negative feelings toward Cegers-not her depression-motivated her to lie. The statements M.F. made to mental health professionals regarding those feelings might have been used to impeach her at trial, but \"feelings themselves are not a mental or emotional condition contemplated under the rule.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   \u00b662 Ultimately, this case is distinguishable from\n   <em>\n    Cardall\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Worthen\n   </em>\n   because Cegers has not alleged that M.F. suffered from a psychological condition that would cause her to fabricate sexual abuse allegations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cardall\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11532765\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/982/79/\">\n    1999 UT 51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 29,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11532765\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/982/79/\">\n    982 P.2d 79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Worthen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6996231\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/222/1144/\">\n    2009 UT 79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 23,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6996231\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/222/1144/\">\n    222 P.3d 1144\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The alleged motivation for M.F. to lie relates not to a chronic and persistent \"condition,\" but to her expressed feelings about Cegers. Such feelings alone do not constitute a mental condition under rule 506(d)(1). To hold otherwise would expand the exception to an important privilege so far as to \"devour the privilege\" itself.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Worthen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6996231\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/222/1144/\">\n    2009 UT 79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 27,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6996231\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/222/1144/\">\n    222 P.3d 1144\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We agree with the district court that \"a showing hasn't been made that the kind of condition contemplated by rule 506(d)(1) has been established in this case\" and affirm its denial of Cegers's request for in camera review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   \u00b663 We conclude that the district court did not err in denying Cegers's motion for a directed verdict, in instructing the jury as to the intent elements of sexual abuse of a child and forcible sexual abuse, and in denying Cegers's request for in camera review of M.F.'s medical records. However, because Cegers has established that the admission of the counselor's bolstering testimony was plain error, we vacate his convictions and remand to the district court for a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-108\">\n    Ordinarily, we recite facts in a light most favorable to the jury's verdict, and present evidence that conflicts with the verdict \"only as necessary to understand the issues raised on appeal.\"\n    <em>\n     State v.

Cegers was acquitted of five of the eight charges against him. But because of the manner in which the State charged the offenses, it is unclear what portion of the evidence supports his convictions. As a result, we recite all of the evidence as it was presented at trial with the acknowledgement that the verdict suggests the jury did not find all of these facts to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-109\">\n    Because the statutory provisions in effect at the relevant time do not differ in any material way from the provision now in effect, we cite the current version of the Utah Code.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-110\">\n    As part of discovery, the State had already provided Cegers with records from one hospital that provided care to M.F. after her attempted suicide.

First, Cegers challenges the district court's denial of his motion to sever the charges relating to M.F. from the charges relating to S.B. In denying Cegers's motion to sever, the district court considered the evidence supporting the charges and allegations and determined (1) whether the offenses charged are \"based on the same conduct or are otherwise connected together in their commission\" or are \"alleged to have been part of a common scheme or plan\" and (2) whether the \"defendant ... is prejudiced by a joinder of offenses.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2077\">\n     Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 77\n    </extracted-citation>\n    -8a-1(1), (4)(a) (LexisNexis 2017). Ordinarily, we would review both determinations for a clear abuse of discretion.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     State v. Hattrich\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7257918\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/317/433/\">\n     2013 UT App 177\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , \u00b6 8,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7257918\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/317/433/\">\n     317 P.3d 433\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . But here, the jury acquitted Cegers of all but three of the charges, only one of which related to S.B. And of the offenses for which he was convicted, it is not readily apparent what alleged conduct supported his conviction of which offense. As a result, it is unlikely that the district court's assessment of evidence supporting joinder of the charges relating to S.B. and M.F. would be the same on remand. We therefore see no value in reviewing the court's prior determination.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-113\">\n    Second, Cegers claims that the district court's errors prejudiced him when viewed cumulatively. It is unnecessary to consider this argument because we find that the evidentiary error established on appeal resulted in prejudice and necessitates a new trial.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-114\">\n    Unlike many instructions, which provide that a jury \"may\" consider certain evidence, the curative instruction here directed: \"You are to consider [the counselor's] testimony. ...\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-115\">\n    Some courts have held it plain error not to give a curative instruction when impermissible bolstering occurs.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     People v.
