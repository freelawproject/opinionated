After a trial, the court denied his request, and in addition ordered him to pay the full cost of a custody evaluation. Father now asks us to review the trial court's conclusions, and we agree with Father that those conclusions were infirm. Accordingly, we vacate the trial court's order and remand the case for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b62 After nearly six years of marriage, Father and Amelia Gayatree LeFevre (Mother) divorced in August 2014. They had one child-Child-together, who was five years old at the time of the parties' divorce.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63 For the first few years of their marriage, the couple lived in Cedar City, Utah with Child, who had some medical issues and required extra attention. According to Mother, she provided nearly all care for Child during this time period, even though she was taking classes at a university, and even though Father was not employed full-time. She maintained that Father often refused to help with child care, and when she needed someone to care for Child so that she could attend classes, she found it necessary to call upon her sister, her parents, and even a few friends, because Father was unwilling to do so himself. By the time Child was three,\n   Father had never spent a night alone with Child and was not comfortable doing so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 Mother and Father separated in April 2012. At that point, both Mother and Father left Cedar City to live with family: Mother and Child moved to Boulder, Utah, and Father moved to Kanab, Utah. A few months later, however, in the late summer of 2012, Mother returned to Cedar City to begin work on a master's degree. Father also soon returned to Cedar City, but the parties lived in separate residences. At that point, while Mother continued to act as Child's primary caregiver, the parties worked out an informal parent-time arrangement in which Mother would take Child over to see Father on occasion but, because Father was still not entirely comfortable with caring for Child on his own, Mother was often present during these visits. Most of these visits were daytime visits for a few hours, although Father did care for Child overnight on a handful of occasions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 Mother filed for divorce in August 2012 and, in September 2013, the parties entered into a stipulated settlement agreement that designated Mother as Child's primary physical custodian. The agreement ordered parent-time for Father every other weekend and every other Wednesday evening, a schedule that (although it did not mention the statute) was similar to the one set forth in Utah Code section 30-3-35. Nearly a year later, in August 2014, the trial court signed the Decree, incorporating the parties' agreed-upon custody and parent-time arrangement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b66 During this period, Father and Mother each lived in Cedar City during the week, but on most weekends Mother traveled to Boulder to visit family and to work. Mother always took Child with her to Boulder for the weekends, even on the alternating weekends on which Father would have otherwise been entitled to parent-time, and at the time Father voiced no objection. Father also was not in the habit of exercising the regular mid-week visits to which he was entitled, instead depending on Mother to bring Child over to his house for many short weekday visits as her class schedule allowed. And Father did not exercise his right to a multi-week summertime visit in 2014, even though the stipulation entitled him to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b67 After nearly three years in Cedar City, Mother and Child moved back to Boulder in April 2015, and at this point Father began to regularly exercise the weekend parent-time and the multi-week summertime visits to which the Decree entitled him. Although Father did not exercise his mid-week visits due to the distance between Cedar City and Boulder, he began to make significant efforts to travel to Boulder to participate in important events in Child's life, such as school programs and dance competitions, even when such events did not occur during his weekend. After a while, Father was of the view that things were going so well with his parent-time that he asked Mother if she would agree to increasing the number of overnights he had with Child, but Mother did not agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b68 In November 2015, Father filed a petition to modify the Decree, requesting that the court alter the custody arrangement to designate him, rather than Mother, as the primary physical custodian. In the petition, among other things, Father argued that a modification was warranted because Mother's move to Boulder in April 2015 constituted a substantial and material change in circumstances because Father was no longer able to see Child as often as he had when Mother was living in Cedar City. Father also argued that Mother was not spending a substantial amount of her parent-time with Child because she was working two jobs that required her to leave Child in the primary care of Child's maternal grandmother. Mother opposed Father's petition, and eventually filed a counter-petition requesting that the Decree be modified to remove redundant material, clarify issues, and make minor alterations to the parent-time schedule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b69 In November 2016, while the competing petitions were pending, Mother notified Father that she intended to relocate with Child to Las Vegas, Nevada. Mother proposed that the parties continue to follow the parent-time schedule set forth in the Decree until her move, at which point they should adopt the parent-time schedule found in Utah Code section 30-3-37(6). Father opposed Mother's request, and asked the court to hold a hearing to consider Mother's proposed move. Father also asked the court to appoint a custody\n   evaluator to assess the parties' situation, a request Mother opposed on the ground that no such evaluation was necessary. Mother argued, in the alternative, that if the court did appoint an evaluator, it should order Father to pay all costs associated with the evaluation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b610 In early February 2017, Mother and Child relocated to Las Vegas. Shortly thereafter, the court appointed a custody evaluator (Evaluator) and ordered Father to front the costs associated with the appointment, but stated that it would make a final allocation of costs at a later date. The court also postponed any hearing on Mother's relocation to Las Vegas until after the completion of the custody evaluation. Around this same time, in early 2017, in addition to regularly exercising his weekend and summertime parent-time-which he had been doing since April 2015-Father began to travel to Las Vegas once a week to exercise regular mid-week parent-time with Child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b611 Over the next few months, Evaluator conducted a number of interviews with Father, Mother, and Child, as well as home studies during which she observed Child. On November 1, 2017, Evaluator issued her report, in which she recommended-with one important qualification-that the status quo should continue, with Mother acting as the primary residential parent and with Father exercising parent-time on alternating weekends and Wednesdays during the school year. The important qualification was that, if Father were to move to Las Vegas so as to be geographically closer to Mother and Child, she would alter her recommendation and urge the court to adopt the alternative parent-time schedule specified in Utah Code section 30-3-35.1 (section 35.1), which would result in Father having the right to five overnights (instead of two) in every two-week period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b612 After learning of Evaluator's recommendations, Father almost immediately moved to Las Vegas.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Just a few weeks later, in mid-November 2017, the court held a trial on the competing petitions to modify. Evaluator testified about her report and evaluation, and recommended that, because Father had relocated to Las Vegas, the court should implement a custody and parent-time arrangement based on section 35.1. She opined that adopting section 35.1 would have a positive impact on Child and the proposed schedule would not hurt the bond Child has with Mother, but would strengthen the bond Child has with Father by providing Child an opportunity to develop a structure and routine with him during the additional mid-week and weekend overnights. Evaluator further opined that the proposed schedule would help reduce communication problems the parties had been experiencing under the current schedule because drop-offs during the school year would occur at school. She also offered her observation that Father was a good parent who since April 2015 had made significant efforts to spend quality time with Child, and opined that Father's parenting actions over the past two-and-a-half years were more relevant than his actions during the first six years of Child's life.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b613 Evaluator also recommended that Father's summertime parent-time should occur in one large block to reduce both the number of transitions between the parents as well as the amount of time Child spends in the car traveling back and forth from Las Vegas to Utah. Finally, in an effort to reduce the frequency of Father's requests for virtual parent-time, Evaluator recommended that Father's video or phone chats with Child should be held at scheduled times three days per week, and that the parties' email communications regarding Child be restricted to a\n   particular day per week to facilitate more predictable and reliable communication.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b614 At the conclusion of the trial, and after hearing directly from both Father and Mother, the trial court took the matter under advisement. A few days later, the court issued a written ruling on the petitions to modify, making a few changes to the parties' Decree. Among other alterations, the court ordered that Father's summertime parent-time be exercised in one large block and that Father exercise virtual parent-time only during three half-hour periods scheduled during the week. The court denied all of Father's other requests to alter the custody and parent-time schedule, including Father's request that parent-time during the school year be implemented according to section 35.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b615 On that point, the court determined that the four prerequisites for implementation of the section 35.1 schedule were not met, and made factual findings in support of that conclusion, including the following: that Father \"did not participate actively in [Child's] life until the last couple of years\"; that Father's \"plan to accomplish effective communication is to have a designated email answering day per week\" and that Father's \"plan ... does not appear to be adequate\"; and that Father \"presented no evidence other than his hope\" that increased parent-time would be in Child's best interest. From these findings, the court made legal conclusions that Father \"has not adequately been involved in [Child's] life\"; that Father \"has failed to present a plan to accomplish effective communication\"; and that Father \"has failed to present evidence that it will be in [Child's] best interest to have increased overnight visits.\" Because it considered the statutory prerequisites unsatisfied, the trial court declined Father's invitation to award him additional parent-time under section 35.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b616 The court also ordered Father to pay all costs related to Evaluator's report. Although it did not provide reasons for its decision, it did note that Father \"asked for the child custody evaluation with the hope that somehow it would find in his favor and it did not, so he should pay its entire cost.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   ISSUES AND STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b617 Father now appeals the trial court's ruling on his petition to modify, and asks us to review two aspects of that ruling. Father's main complaint is with the court's decision not to implement a parent-time arrangement based on section 35.1. We review a trial court's custody and parent-time determination for abuse of discretion, and review any underlying factual findings for clear error.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Vaughan v.

In the discussion that follows, we examine each of the three remaining statutory prerequisites and, for the reasons set forth, we agree with Father that the trial court's analysis was infirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b624 The first of the three statutory requirements is that \"the noncustodial parent has been actively involved in the child's life.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2030-3-35.1\">\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 30-3-35.1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2)(a) (LexisNexis Supp. 2018). Father contends that he presented evidence conclusively demonstrating his active involvement in Child's life. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b625 At the outset of the discussion, it is important to note that the trial court did not actually make a finding or a conclusion to the contrary. The court's specific finding was that Father \"did not participate actively in [Child's] life\n   <em>\n    until the last couple of years\n   </em>\n   ,\" implying that Father did participate actively in Child's life during the \"couple of years\" prior to trial. (Emphasis added.) Indeed, the evidence presented to the court was overwhelming that, starting in approximately April 2015, Father exercised regular weekend and summertime parent-time according\n   to the ordered schedule, and that he made extra effort as necessary to attend Child's school functions and other celebrations in her life, even when those occurred outside his customary scheduled parent-time.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b626 From this evidence, however, the trial court concluded that Father \"has not adequately been involved in\" Child's life. In our view, this conclusion is not supported by the evidence presented, and is in any event not the conclusion required by the statute. Indeed, the word \"adequately\" does not appear in the statute, which instead asks the court to determine whether Father has been \"actively\" involved in Child's life.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2030-3-35.1\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As noted above, at least for the thirty months prior to trial, Father was actively involved in Child's life, as the trial court impliedly found.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b627 The only sensible explanation for the trial court's conclusion is that the court was looking primarily at Father's actions during the first six years of Child's life, a period in which Father was not nearly as involved in Child's life as he was during the thirty months leading up to trial. The relevant statute does not indicate whether a court should weigh recent behavior more heavily, and we certainly acknowledge that a parent who-in true \"deathbed repentance\" fashion-has been active in his child's life for only a few days or weeks before trial may comfortably be considered to have not been actively involved in his or her child's life, when that life is examined as a whole. But a parent who has-even in the eyes of his ex-spouse-been actively involved in his daughter's life for the thirty-month period leading up to trial has clearly been \"actively involved\" in her life, and any finding or conclusion to the contrary is clearly erroneous and an abuse of discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b628 Accordingly, we agree with Father that he satisfied the first statutory prerequisite.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b629 Next, the statute requires that Father demonstrate either (i) that \"the parties are able to communicate effectively regarding the child,\" or (ii) that he \"has a plan to accomplish effective communications regarding the child.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2030-3-35.1\">\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 30-3-35.1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2)(b) (LexisNexis Supp. 2018). The trial court found that \"[t]here is little meaningful communication between the parties,\" and concluded that \"[t]he parties do not communicate effectively.\" Father does not challenge these determinations, and thereby concedes that he cannot meet the first statutory alternative. However, Father asserts that he presented a plan to address the parties' communication issues, and argues that he can therefore meet the second statutory alternative. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b630 The relevant statute requires only that Father present a plan for improved communication to the court; it does not require that Father's plan be foolproof or even that Father's plan-or any part of it-be adopted by the court.

Among those were (a) limiting email communication between the parties to a \"designated email day\" on which both parents would be available to electronically express and respond to concerns regarding Child; (b) limiting Father's virtual parent-time to three\n   designated half-hour periods scheduled throughout the week, thereby limiting any ad hoc demands Father might make to speak with Child; and (c) maximizing the number of pickups and drop-offs that would occur at Child's school rather than at Mother's residence, thereby reducing the number of times Mother and Father saw each other.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b632 The trial court ended up adopting one of these three recommendations in its ruling, in that it limited Father's virtual parent-time to three scheduled half-hour periods each week. The court did not adopt the other two parts of this plan, perhaps in part because Mother expressed dislike for the \"designated email day\" idea, but the fact that the court declined to adopt Father's plan in total does not mean that he did not have one. Indeed, the trial court itself referred to \"[Father's] plan\" in its findings, later judging that plan to be inadequate. But an inadequate plan is still a plan, and the statute imposes no requirement that the plan be found by the court to be adequate.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2030-3-35.1\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b633 Under these circumstances, the trial court abused its discretion by concluding that Father \"failed to present a plan to accomplish effective communication.\" Father presented a plan for improved communication to the trial court, and thereby satisfied the second statutory prerequisite.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   C\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b634 Finally, the statute requires that implementation of the alternative parent-time schedule would be \"in the best interest of the child.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2030-3-35.1\">\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 30-3-35.1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2)(d) (LexisNexis Supp. 2018).

But here, the trial court did not engage in a traditional \"best interest\" analysis by weighing the evidence presented by each side and coming to a decision. Instead, the trial court stated flatly that Father had \"presented no evidence other than his hope\" that increased parent-time would benefit Child, and concluded that Father \"failed to present evidence that it will be in [Child's] best interest to have increased overnight visits.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b635 These statements are simply incorrect. Father presented quite a bit of evidence supporting his view that increased parent-time would be in Child's best interest. Most significantly, Father presented the expert testimony of Evaluator, who offered her reasoned professional opinion that the best thing for Child-now that Father had relocated to Las Vegas and was closer to Mother and Child-would be for the court to implement the alternative parent-time schedule set forth in section 35.1. In addition, Father offered his own testimony along those same lines, and even cajoled Mother into acknowledging that Father was \"a good father\" and that she was in favor of Father and Child spending more time together (with the proviso that she preferred that the extra parent-time take place in the summertime, to cut down on the number of exchanges during the school year).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b636 The trial court was certainly free to decline to credit Father's evidence, and to give it less weight than Mother's evidence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Had it done so here, and articulated supported reasons for its decision, we undoubtedly would have affirmed that determination.

But the trial court's stated reasons for rejecting Father's position are unsupported, and are clearly erroneous and an abuse of discretion. We therefore must remand the case for further proceedings on this point, and specifically for the trial court to consider all of the evidence presented and\n   to make a determination as to whether increased parent-time as per section 35.1 would be in Child's best interest. Because all of the other prerequisites are met, if the trial court finds, on remand, that the \"best interest\" prerequisite is also met, the trial court will then be permitted to exercise its discretion, if it so chooses, to implement the alternative parent-time schedule.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2030-3-35.1\">\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 30-3-35.1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2) (stating that, if the statutory prerequisites are met, the court \"may consider\" the increased parent-time schedule);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lay v.

Although Evaluator did not recommend that primary physical custody be changed from Mother to Father, Evaluator did recommend that Father be awarded additional parent-time if he moved to Las Vegas, which he did prior to trial. Accordingly, Evaluator's recommendation at trial was that a parent-time schedule in accordance with section 35.1 should be implemented, which recommendation was in line with Father's ultimate request at trial. In addition, the court's conclusion that Father should pay the entire cost of the custody evaluation because the evaluation did not \"find in his favor\" is inconsistent with a proper subsection (1) analysis. As discussed above, while subsection (1) gives the trial court discretion in determining whether to award the costs of expert witness fees, an award of such fees must be based upon the parties' ability to pay and the reasonableness of the fees, and not upon which party ultimately prevails.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2030-3-3\">\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 30-3-3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1) ;\n   <em>\n    Wilde\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11770799\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/969/438/#p444\">\n    969 P.2d at 444\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
