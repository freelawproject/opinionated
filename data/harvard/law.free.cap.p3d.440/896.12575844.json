Abisai Martinez-Castellanos was convicted of two counts of possession of or use of a controlled substance, one count of possession of drug paraphernalia, and one count of driving with a controlled substance in the body after a Utah Highway Patrol trooper (Officer) found drugs and drug paraphernalia in his car during a traffic stop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   \u00b62 Martinez-Castellanos appealed his convictions to this court, arguing that his trial attorney (Trial Counsel) was ineffective during jury selection and for failing to adequately litigate a motion to suppress evidence. He also argued that the district court erred in post-trial proceedings in which separate conflict counsel was appointed to represent Martinez-Castellanos on whether Trial Counsel was ineffective during the motion to suppress stage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   \u00b63 On appeal, this court determined that, although each of Martinez-Castellanos's claims constituted error, based on the lack of sufficient prejudice, none of those errors warranted reversal on its own. We made that determination, in part, because his claims regarding the motion to suppress required a showing that the motion was meritorious, and the lack of representation that he received on that motion made us reluctant to resolve the issue based on the facts in the record. We nonetheless reversed and remanded for a new trial because the cumulative effect of the errors undermined our confidence that Martinez-Castellanos received a fair trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b64 On certiorari, the Utah Supreme Court reversed our decision, concluding that, without a determination that the motion to suppress was meritorious, two of the three errors could not have caused Martinez-Castellanos any harm and therefore could not cumulate into reversible error. But the court noted that, with such a determination, each of those errors would support a reversal on its own. Thus, the court remanded the case for us to determine the narrow issue of whether the motion to suppress was meritorious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b65 Based on the record and arguments before us, we conclude that the motion to suppress was not meritorious. Specifically, Martinez-Castellanos has failed to demonstrate a reasonable probability that the motion would have been granted but for Trial Counsel's ineffective assistance. We therefore affirm Martinez-Castellanos's convictions because the errors in the district court did not result in sufficient prejudice to warrant reversal. But because of an error in Martinez-Castellanos's sentence for one of the counts of possession of a controlled substance, we vacate his sentence on that count and remand for the district court to correct the error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b66 During a traffic stop in 2010, Officer discovered drugs and drug paraphernalia in Martinez-Castellanos's car.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Officer arrested Martinez-Castellanos and obtained a blood sample that later tested positive for a marijuana metabolite at a level consistent with recent use. The State charged Martinez-Castellanos with two counts of possession or use of a controlled substance, one count of possession of drug paraphernalia, and one count of driving with a controlled substance in the body.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b67 Before trial, Trial Counsel filed a motion to suppress all evidence seized \"at the time of [Martinez-Castellanos's] arrest,\" including the drugs and drug paraphernalia found in the car and the blood sample. The motion asserted that this evidence \"was seized in violation of Martinez-Castellanos's constitutional rights to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures.\" In the motion, Trial Counsel requested an evidentiary hearing \"to determine if appropriate consent was given and, if there was no consent given, that all evidence seized be suppressed and\n   not be admitted as evidence in any proceeding hereafter.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b68 A week after Trial Counsel filed the motion to suppress, the district court held an evidentiary hearing on the motion, at which Officer was the only witness. Officer first discussed his relevant \"training and experience with drug interdiction and detection.\" He said he had \"been an officer for about 20 years in various capacities,\" and had \"been on the Utah Highway Patrol drug and interdiction squad since 2001.\" He had \"been through numerous training classes associated with the interdiction squad\" and was a certified \"drug recognition expert\" as well as a drug-recognition-expert \"instructor.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b69 Next, Officer detailed the traffic stop. He said he initially stopped Martinez-Castellanos because the registration stickers on his California license plates did not comply with California law. And when Officer \"first walked up to the car,\" he noticed Martinez-Castellanos making \"jittery movements.\" Martinez-Castellanos handed Officer the car's registration and \"an expired Colorado driver's license,\" assuring Officer that \"he had a valid Utah license\" but \"just didn't have it with him.\" The registration revealed that, although the car \"was properly registered ..., the proper stickers weren't put on it yet.\" Officer and Martinez-Castellanos then \"had a conversation about\" the improper registration stickers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b610 During the conversation, Officer noticed again that Martinez-Castellanos \"was a little bit jittery.\" That is, he had \"rapid speech and rapid ... jittery movements.\" This made Officer \"a little bit concerned that he might have been on some type of stimulant.\" Officer testified, \"[B]ased on my training and experience as a police officer and dealing with thousands of cars that I've stopped in my career, this made me ... [think] he was under the influence of something.\" According to Officer, Martinez-Castellanos's behavior was \"more ... than what you'd expect based upon nervousness of a driver.\" He explained that, in his experience, \"there's a difference\" between \"nervousness\" and a person who is \"jittery\" and \"talking really fast.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b611 On cross-examination, Officer admitted he had never \"seen [Martinez-Castellanos] before\" and did not \"know anything at all about him\" other than what he observed during the stop. But he said, \"[B]ased on all the people I arrest for stimulants and deal with,\" Martinez-Castellanos's \"jittery movements\" and \"rapid speech\" \"[made me think] he could have been under [the influence of] stimulants.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b612 After informing Martinez-Castellanos that his registration stickers were improper, Officer returned to the patrol vehicle and \"ran checks,\" which confirmed that Martinez-Castellanos had a valid Utah driver license. But the report also revealed that Martinez-Castellanos \"had a criminal history,\" including \"drug offenses.\" Specifically, he had miscellaneous theft charges dating back to 1997, a charge from 2001 that led to a felony conviction for controlled substance possession, a felony charge for controlled substance possession from 2006, and a 2007 probation revocation for possession of a controlled substance. Officer said that Martinez-Castellanos's criminal history \"heightened [his] suspicions that [Martinez-Castellanos] might be [under] the influence of something.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b613 Officer then returned to Martinez-Castellanos's car and, based on his suspicion of impairment, told Martinez-Castellanos he was going to perform \"field sobriety tests\" because \"he was bouncing around a little bit.\" On cross-examination, Trial Counsel asked Officer to clarify \"the basis for doing the field sobriety tests.\" Officer said the main \"reason for doing it\" was the \"jittery movements\" and \"rapid speech,\" which led him to believe that Martinez-Castellanos was under the influence of \"stimulants.\" Further, although Martinez-Castellanos's criminal history \"wasn't the reason [he] did it,\" he said the prior drug-related activity \"added to [his] suspicions.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b614 Upon re-approaching the car, Officer asked Martinez-Castellanos to exit the vehicle and then performed various sobriety and drug-recognition tests. Based on those tests, Officer concluded that Martinez-Castellanos was under the influence. Officer arrested Martinez-Castellanos and proceeded to search the car, discovering the drugs and\n   drug paraphernalia. Later, at the jail, Martinez-Castellanos's blood tested positive for marijuana at a level consistent with recent use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b615 Officer's \"dash-cam\" filmed the traffic stop, but Trial Counsel did not review the video before the hearing. Following Officer's testimony, Trial Counsel requested the video, and the district court instructed counsel for the State to arrange for him to obtain it. The court then said, \"Many times in these types of motions, we have an evidentiary hearing, and then the parties, based on the evidence, sometimes like to submit a brief.\" And the judge asked counsel for both parties, \"[I]f you wanted me to simply make rulings based on what I've heard, or if you intended to brief this before I make a decision.\" Trial Counsel said he \"would like to ... submit a brief on the matter\" after reviewing a transcript of the suppression hearing as well as the dash-cam video.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b616 The court set a briefing schedule, allowing thirty days for Trial Counsel to submit a brief in support of the motion to suppress and fifteen days for the State to respond. Trial Counsel did not file a brief. A week after the deadline, the court granted Trial Counsel's request for additional time, but Trial Counsel again failed to meet the deadline. The State then filed a memorandum in opposition to the motion to suppress, and Trial Counsel did not respond to it. The dash-cam video was attached to the State's memorandum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b617 After receiving the State's opposition, the court issued an order denying the motion. It said, \"[H]aving reviewed testimony given [at the hearing] and [the State's] memorandum, the Motion to Suppress is hereby denied.\" Trial Counsel filed a motion to set aside the decision to deny the motion to suppress. He attached a transcript of the evidentiary hearing, and again requested time to file a brief in support of the motion to suppress. The court allowed Trial Counsel an additional week. Trial Counsel again failed to meet the deadline, and the court reinstated its order denying the motion to suppress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b618 Two days before trial, Trial Counsel filed a motion to dismiss in which he renewed the motion to suppress. He asserted that the dash-cam video demonstrated there was \"no basis\" for the stop, but he did not file a supporting memorandum. The court denied the motion. Following a one-day trial, a jury convicted Martinez-Castellanos of two felonies for possession or use of a controlled substance and two related misdemeanors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b619 After trial, the district court appointed conflict counsel to represent Martinez-Castellanos in post-trial proceedings regarding Trial Counsel's failure to file a memorandum in support of the motion to suppress following the evidentiary hearing and whether those actions constituted ineffective assistance of counsel. The court specifically identified Trial Counsel's failure to adequately litigate the issue of whether \"there was reasonable suspicion\" when Officer had Martinez-Castellanos \"step out of the car and ... perform ... field sobriety tests.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b620 About one month later, conflict counsel submitted a memorandum captioned \"Amicus Brief.\" The brief argued that Trial Counsel's failure to file a supporting memorandum did not prejudice Martinez-Castellanos. Specifically, it said that the court's denial of the motion to suppress, \"with or without legal memorandum, is a finding and conclusion of law that the State met its burden in establishing that the evidence was obtained legally.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b621 The court agreed with the position articulated by conflict counsel, withdrew its notice, and re-instated Trial Counsel to represent Martinez-Castellanos in the remaining proceedings. The court noted conflict counsel's opinion that \"it was the Court's duty to make its decision based on the evidence presented\" and said, \"I can understand his position on that.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b622 Martinez-Castellanos was sentenced to zero to five years, but the court suspended that sentence and placed him on probation. Trial Counsel then filed a motion for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict. In the motion, he requested that the court suppress the evidence from the traffic stop. But the motion once again did not include a supporting memorandum and Trial Counsel did not flesh out the constitutional issues raised in the motion. Instead, Trial Counsel attached\n   the transcripts of the preliminary hearing, the suppression hearing, and Officer's trial testimony. He specifically noted \"a substantial change of [Officer's] testimony regarding the reason for the stop and the time and delay in the stop.\" And he asserted that the order denying the motion to suppress \"should be set aside and reconsidered because of the new testimony that was offered at trial.\" Without explanation, the court denied the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b623 Martinez-Castellanos appealed his convictions to this court.\n   <em>\n    State v.

First, he asserts that the evidence \"fails to show support that [his] speech or manners were rapid or unusual.\" And he argues that \"the district court should be given the opportunity in remand proceedings to assess the evidence.\" To support his argument, Martinez-Castellanos claims that Officer's testimony about his observations of Martinez-Castellanos during the stop changed at trial. According to Martinez-Castellanos, at trial, Officer \"stated only that Martinez-Castellanos had rapid speech and\n   movements.\" But Martinez-Castellanos's assertion does not accurately represent Officer's testimony. At trial, Officer said he observed \"rapid speech and rapid movements\" that, \"based on [his] training and experience,\" made him \"believe that [Martinez-Castellanos] might have been under the influence of a controlled substance.\" After reviewing the transcript, we disagree with Martinez-Castellanos's claim that Officer \"changed his testimony\" \"over the course of the proceedings.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b639 Martinez-Castellanos also makes much of the fact that Officer \"admitted he was not familiar with Martinez-Castellanos\" and conceded that his \"manner could have been his 'normal way.' \" He argues that Officer \"qualified his observations about 'rapid mannerisms' \" by saying he \"did not know if rapid manners were [Martinez-Castellanos's] 'personal traits' or 'personal speech.' \" But again, Martinez-Castellanos's description does not put Officer's testimony in context. Officer made these statements while explaining his decision to perform the sobriety tests. He said that \"fast speech and fast movements\" are \"commonly what [he sees] when people are under the influence or have been using a controlled substance.\" And he clarified that the sobriety tests allowed him to quickly confirm or dispel his suspicions and determine \"whether that's his normal way\" or \"it's a controlled substance on board.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b640 Further, \"it is settled law that an officer is not obligated to rule out innocent conduct prior to initiating an investigatory detention.\"\n   <em>\n    Markland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8954040\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/112/507/\">\n    2005 UT 26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 17,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8954040\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/112/507/\">\n    112 P.3d 507\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"Because the balance between the public interest and the individual's right to personal security tilts in favor of a standard less than probable cause in [these] cases, the Fourth Amendment is satisfied if the officer's action is supported by reasonable suspicion to believe that criminal activity may be afoot.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Thus, even if we were to accept as true the assertion that Martinez-Castellanos's behavior was \"at least as consistent with lawful behavior as with the commission of a crime,\" we nonetheless conclude that \"the underlying facts, and reasonable inferences drawn from those facts, justify the conclusion that reasonable suspicion existed\" to support Officer's decision to perform the sobriety tests.\n   <em>\n    Markland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8954040\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/112/507/\">\n    2005 UT 26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 18-19,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8954040\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/112/507/\">\n    112 P.3d 507\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b641 Martinez-Castellanos also argues that the dash-cam video is \"objective evidence\" that \"fails to support that [his] speech or manners were rapid or unusual.\" Specifically, he claims the video shows that Officer \"did most of the talking and had a very brief interaction with Martinez-Castellanos before he took actions to extend the stop,\" and that Martinez-Castellanos was \"polite and cooperative.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b642 We give little weight to this argument because the dash-cam video was before the district court when it denied the motion to suppress. The video was provided to the court as part of the State's opposition, and in denying the motion, the court said it had \"reviewed testimony given and\n   <em>\n    memorandum provided\n   </em>\n   .\" (Emphasis added.) Accordingly, we consider this argument only to the extent that a supporting memorandum's written interpretation of the dash-cam video would have assisted in persuading the district court to grant the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b643 As Martinez-Castellanos notes, the dash-cam video is \"objective evidence.\" It speaks for itself. And based on the parties' arguments, we conclude that a supporting memorandum detailing the video would have been of little assistance to the court. The State disagrees with Martinez-Castellanos's description of the video, arguing that he has failed to show \"the dash-cam video refutes [Officer's] observations.\" According to the State, \"[i]t is difficult, if not impossible, to accurately evaluate [Martinez-Castellanos's] manner and speech\" in the dash-cam video because Martinez-Castellanos's movements are \"mostly indiscernible,\" most of what he says \"is largely unintelligible,\" and \"what is intelligible arguably supports [Officer's] characterization.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b644 On appeal, however, it is not our role to make such factual determinations. Indeed, Martinez-Castellanos acknowledges in his reply brief that this court should not \"make its own interpretations of the evidence.\" He argues instead that the district court \"is in the\n   best position to assess whether [Officer's] testimony ... is unsupported by objective information.\" But as previously discussed, the district court received the video before denying the motion to suppress and seems to have considered it along with the State's memorandum. Thus, even assuming we agree with Martinez-Castellanos that a supporting memorandum that included a favorable interpretation of the dash-cam video \"would have been relevant to the district court under the totality of the circumstances,\" we conclude that he has failed to show a reasonable probability that presenting such an interpretation would have persuaded the district court to grant the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b645 Next, Martinez-Castellanos argues that his \"criminal history is insufficient to support reasonable suspicion even when it is considered with other factors because the history was three years old.\" To support this argument, he cites\n   <em>\n    State v.

But here, Martinez-Castellanos's criminal history included drug-related behavior spread over the previous nine years. The report revealed various charges, a felony conviction, and a probation revocation for possession of a controlled substance. And although the most recent offense-the probation revocation-was three years before the traffic stop, we conclude that, \"when viewed in conjunction with other factors,\" Martinez-Castellanos's criminal history supported Officer's decision to perform the sobriety tests.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Specifically, it asserts that the district court \"entered [the] conviction on Count II (hydrocodone possession) as a third degree felony\" when it \"should have been entered only as a Class B misdemeanor.\" According to the State, this error occurred because an amendment to the original information made at the preliminary hearing was later omitted from the amended information.
