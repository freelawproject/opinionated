For instance, when a police officer enters a schoolhouse and announces that an active shooter is nearby, society desires that those so informed believe the officer and act accordingly. Similarly, when a homeowner is awakened in the night by a police officer at the front door who announces that a wildfire is fast approaching, society desires that the officer be believed and that the homeowner acts accordingly. Indeed, examples of this societal desire seem endless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b62 Nevertheless, case law makes clear that a police officer, in the course of investigating criminality, does not violate either the federal or state constitution by lying to a potential suspect or witness. The need to sometimes do so has been repeatedly accommodated by the courts. But when police officers do choose to lie, they must recognize and accept the logical consequences of that decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b63 One such consequence arises in the context of constitutional seizure analysis. This jurisprudence provides that, in a police-citizen encounter, no seizure of the person occurs unless-objectively viewed and under the totality of the circumstances-a reasonable person would not believe that he or she was free to terminate the encounter or decline the officer's requests. In analyzing the circumstances of such an encounter, a reasonable person is an innocent person. And reasonable innocent persons may be assumed to believe the truth of that which the police tell them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b64 In this case, Louis Johnson Jr. was found to be in unlawful possession of a firearm. Prior to that discovery, however, the police encounter with him had reached the point where-under the totality of the circumstances and objectively viewed-he had been seized. And, at the time of his seizure, the police lacked a lawful basis to seize him. Thus, the trial court properly granted his motion to suppress evidence of the gun found in his possession. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b65 Two Lynnwood police officers, Zach Yates and James George, were engaged in a proactive patrol late at night in an area known to have a high rate of criminal activity. The officers observed a silver vehicle enter a motel parking lot and park in a stall. After the vehicle came to rest, about a minute and a half passed without any person entering or leaving the vehicle. The officers became suspicious that its occupants were using drugs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b66 The officers, both of whom were armed and in uniform, approached the vehicle on foot and stood on opposite sides adjacent to the driver's and passenger's doors. They shined flashlights into the vehicle's interior to enable them to see the vehicle's occupants and ensure that neither was holding anything that could put the officers in danger. Because the vehicle was also flanked on both sides by cars parked in adjoining stalls, the officers had minimal space to move. Officer Yates did not see any drugs or drug paraphernalia when he shined his flashlight inside the passenger compartment. Inside were Johnson and a female passenger.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b67 Officer Yates stood on the passenger side while Officer George stood adjacent to the driver's door. Yates sought to start a conversation with Johnson, who was in the driver's seat, and did so by asking, \"Hey, is this Taylor's vehicle?\" In fact, there was no \"Taylor\"; the ruse was intended to make Johnson feel more comfortable, in the\n   hope that he would talk with the officer. Johnson appeared confused by the question, and Yates asked, again, whether the vehicle was \"Taylor Smith's vehicle.\" In response, Johnson stated that the vehicle was his own and that he had recently purchased it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b68 Yates then asked for Johnson's name, whether Johnson had a driver's license, and if he would mind whether the officer looked\n   at it. When Johnson stated that he had an identification card, both officers became suspicious that his license might be suspended. Officer Yates received the identification card from Johnson and used information from it to request a check of Johnson's warrant history and license status from police dispatch. Meanwhile, Officer George, who was leaning over the driver's side door, noticed a handgun placed between the driver's seat and the door.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b69 George alerted Yates to the presence of the firearm, drew his own handgun, opened the driver's door and removed the weapon from Johnson's vehicle. Subsequently, Johnson was removed from the vehicle. Meanwhile, police dispatch informed the officers that Johnson's driver's license was suspended in the third degree, and that he had an outstanding arrest warrant and a felony conviction. The officers then informed Johnson that he was being detained but not placed under arrest and advised him of his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b610 Eventually, Johnson was charged with unlawful possession of a firearm in the first degree. Before trial, Johnson moved to suppress the evidence of the gun found in his possession, contending that it was found attendant to his unlawful seizure. After an evidentiary hearing, the trial court granted Johnson's motion. However, the judge did not make a determination as to whether Johnson was seized prior to the discovery and removal of the firearm, instead ruling that the encounter was a \"social contact\" and that \"law enforcement had an insufficient basis to initiate a\n   social contact.\" The trial court further acknowledged that granting the motion to suppress essentially terminated the State's case. The State appeals from the order granting Johnson's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b611 The State challenges the trial court's ruling that the police officers had an \"insufficient basis\" to initiate a social contact with Johnson. The State asserts, correctly, that there is no constitutional requirement for police officers to have articulable reasons for simply engaging in conversation with members of the public. Johnson does not dispute this but, rather, insists that the encounter became a seizure commenced without a lawful basis. He asks that we affirm the suppression order on this ground, as we may affirm a trial court decision on any basis supported by the evidence and the record.\n   <em>\n    State v.

For its part, the State asserts that the encounter was a social contact, rather than a seizure, because none of the officers' actions or statements prior to the discovery of the firearm amounted to a show of authority that would cause a reasonable person to feel not free to leave the scene or to disregard the officers' requests. Johnson's analysis of the encounter is well-taken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b612 In a constitutional sense, the term \"social contact\" is meaningless. The term has been adopted by lawyers and judges to describe circumstances that do not amount to a seizure. But it never matters whether an encounter can be called a social contact. In seizure analysis, what matters is whether a person is seized. If not, the inquiry ends regardless of whether the encounter can be said to have been a social contact. If so, the requirements for a lawful seizure apply-again without concern for any claimed \"social\" purpose for the \"contact.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b613 To be sure, \"social contact\" discussions have entered our case law. In such discussions, a social contact is said to rest \"someplace between an officer's saying 'hello' to a stranger on the street and, at the other end of the spectrum, an investigative detention (i.e.,\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   stop).\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

In the substantially full parking lot, with vehicles parked on either side of Johnson's vehicle, there was minimal space for either officer to move. Because the officers were standing adjacent to the vehicle's doors, neither Johnson nor his passenger would have been able to open the doors and walk from the vehicle without the officers moving or giving way. The testimony did not indicate whether any other people were present in the lot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b630 Officer Yates asked Johnson whether the vehicle belonged to \"Taylor.\" When Johnson appeared confused by this question, the officer repeated the question, inquiring whether the vehicle belonged to \"Taylor Smith.\" Johnson then stated that the vehicle was his and that he had recently purchased it. In response Officer Yates asked Johnson for his name. He then asked Johnson to prove his identity, by requesting his driver's license.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b631 Although asking the question, \"Is this Taylor's car?\" was a ruse made for the sake of initiating a conversation, its effect on a reasonable person in these circumstances would\n   be to create the impression that the police were conducting an ongoing investigation concerning the vehicle. Indeed, Johnson manifested confusion as a result of the question, likely because he had no reason to believe that the question was not sincere. The repetition of the question underscored its apparent sincerity. The further inquiries into Johnson's name, whether Johnson had a driver's license, and whether Johnson would prove his identity by presenting his identification document to Officer Yates further advanced the impression that a police investigation was ongoing and that Johnson was a suspect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b632 It is so that the police do not violate either the state or federal constitutions simply by lying to potential suspects or witnesses.\n   <em>\n    Lewis v.

A corollary to this principle is that ordinary citizens are not required to distrust the police, and a reasonable innocent person is entitled to believe that he or she is being dealt with honestly by law enforcement. In the context of constitutional seizure jurisprudence, one consequence of a police lie is plain: whether a person has been seized is a purely objective inquiry; an objective inquiry focuses on the perceptions\n   of a reasonable person; a reasonable person is an innocent person; and reasonable innocent people can be assumed to believe that which the police tell them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b634 Taken in their totality, the circumstances existing at the moment Officer Yates requested possession of Johnson's identification document would have caused a reasonable innocent person to believe that ignoring the officer's requests, terminating the encounter, or leaving the scene were not viable options. The sudden presence of two uniformed officers so soon after the vehicle had parked, the shining of flashlights into the vehicle, the question, repeated, as to whether the vehicle belonged to Taylor Smith, and the request for the driver's name and proof of his identity would lead a reasonable innocent\n   person to believe that the vehicle, and by extension its driver, was the subject of an ongoing criminal investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b635 Johnson was not at that time in the presence of other members of the public-the parking lot, although filled with vehicles, was not a scene of activity at 2:00 in the morning. The presence of two officers flanking the vehicle in a tight spot affording limited movement meant that neither Johnson nor his passenger would have been able to open a vehicle door and walk away from the vehicle without either making physical contact with an officer or requiring the officer to give way. Johnson also could not drive forward due to the berm. Neither could he move his vehicle in reverse without risking his car making contact with one or both of the officers. Indeed, such vehicle movement would likely seem-to a reasonable innocent person under the circumstances-to constitute an aggressive move of a type that would promote an aggressive response from the officers. The shining of flashlights by both officers, while possibly a benign practice by itself, would further a reasonable innocent person's impression that the police were conducting an active investigation centering on the vehicle. Finally, in addition to the ruse, the request for Johnson's name and for proof of his identity would indicate to a\n   reasonable innocent person that the officers were unwilling to take that person at his word-either as to his statement concerning the vehicle's ownership or as to his identity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \u00b636 A totality of the circumstances analysis is a cumulative analysis, not a \"divide-and-conquer\" analysis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.
