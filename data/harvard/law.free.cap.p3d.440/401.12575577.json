For the following reasons, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b62 In August 2002, the State charged Robertson with one count of first-degree murder, a class 1 felony, and two counts of intentional child abuse, class 2 felonies and dangerous crimes against children, based on acts that occurred in November 2001.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ariz. Rev. Stat. (\"A.R.S.\") \u00a7\u00a7 13-604.01 (2001), -1105 (2001), -3623(A)(1) (2001). The court later dismissed the first count of child abuse for lack of probable cause.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ariz. R. Crim. P. 5.4(d).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63 Had Robertson been convicted of the charged count of first-degree murder, she faced a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 13-1105(C), -703(A) (2001). She also faced the potential for a mandatory consecutive sentence of up to 28 years imprisonment for the count of intentional child abuse as a dangerous crime against children.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 13-3623(A)(1), -604.01(D), (K)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b64 Pursuant to a plea agreement, the State reduced the charged counts, and Robertson avoided the potential for life in prison plus a consecutive sentence. She pleaded guilty to one amended count of manslaughter, a class 2 dangerous felony, and one amended count of reckless child abuse, a class 3 felony.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 13-1103 (2001), -3623(A)(2). Robertson faced a sentence of seven to 21 years for manslaughter, and two to 8.75 years for reckless child abuse.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 13-604(I) (2001), -701 (2001), -702 (2001), -702.01 (2001). Pursuant to the plea agreement, however, the parties stipulated to a prison term of eight to 15 years for manslaughter and a consecutive term of probation for reckless child abuse. The court sentenced Robertson to ten years' imprisonment for manslaughter, credited Robertson 602 days of presentence incarceration, and placed Robertson on a lifetime term of probation upon completion of her prison sentence. Robertson completed her prison sentence in August 2010.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b65 Robertson violated her probation in September of 2014 and June of 2016, and the superior court reinstated her probation after both violations. After the September 2014 violation, one of the terms of Robertson's reinstated probation was a six-month term of incarceration in the county jail. Robertson violated her probation again in March 2017, and the court imposed intensive probation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b66 Two months later, in May 2017, the State filed a petition claiming Robertson violated intensive probation and sought to revoke Robertson's probation. Robertson denied the petition's allegations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b67 At the probation-violation hearing, Robertson argued for the first time that the crimes of manslaughter and child abuse constituted a single act involving a single victim, and therefore, consecutive sentencing on the convictions violated the statutory prohibition against double punishment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 13-116. The court denied Robertson's oral motion to dismiss the petition to revoke.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b68 After the hearing, the court revoked Robertson's probation and ordered that Robertson be imprisoned for a presumptive term of 3.5 years pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7 13-701, with 260 days of presentence-incarceration credit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b69 Robertson timely appealed. We have jurisdiction pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 12-120.21(A)(1), 13-4031, and -4033(A)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b610 Robertson argues that the sentence of imprisonment imposed after her probation was revoked was illegal under A.R.S. \u00a7 13-116 because she had already served a prison sentence for the same act involving the same victim. Robertson does not raise any double jeopardy claims under the United States or Arizona Constitutions. For the following reasons, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b611 We review a challenge to the legality of a sentence de novo.\n   <em>\n    State v.

In the usual case, where a defendant pleaded guilty and was placed on probation, the guilty plea does not waive all challenges to a subsequent sentence imposed after a probation violation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Regenold\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5756140\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/226/378/#p379\">\n    226 Ariz. 378\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 379-80, \u00b6\u00b6 8, 12,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5756140\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/226/378/#p379\">\n    249 P.3d 337\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 338-39 (2011) (stating that a defendant has not waived the right to appeal a sentence imposed after a contested probation-violation hearing because it is not \"entered pursuant to a plea agreement\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b613 Nevertheless, Robertson did not merely plead guilty and face various potential sentences provided by law. She affirmatively entered into a plea agreement with the State wherein she avoided the possibility of life in prison plus a consecutive sentence, and she stipulated to a prison sentence on one reduced count and a consecutive term of probation on another reduced count. In this circumstance, Robertson has invited any error and, thus, cannot raise her A.R.S. \u00a7 13-116 challenge to the sentence imposed following probation revocation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.
