The State filed its response and the matter is now ready for decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   \u00b62 In August 2012, the State charged Lawrence in the Twenty-First Judicial District Court, Ravalli County, with two counts of soliciting sexual intercourse without consent. The affidavit in support of the Information alleged that Lawrence offered to give a 14-year-old boy a \"blow job\" in July 2012 and offered to pay a 13-year-old $100 to perform oral sex in September 2007. Following subsequent investigation, the State filed a Second Amended Information adding 243 counts of sexual abuse of children based on Lawrence's possession and production of pornographic images of children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b63 In May 2014, Lawrence signed a plea agreement in which he agreed to enter an \"\n   <em>\n    Alford\n   </em>\n   plea\" to amended charges of sexual assault and solicitation for sexual assault. The agreement allowed Lawrence to reserve his right to appeal any denial of his motion to sever the charges, but the District Court did not rule on the severance motion prior to accepting Lawrence's plea. The District Court sentenced Lawrence to thirty years in prison with twenty years suspended. Lawrence appealed, arguing that his conditional plea was invalid because the District Court did not rule on his motion to sever prior to accepting Lawrence's plea. Based upon the State's concession, we reversed and remanded with instructions to vacate the entry of Lawrence's guilty plea and sentence.\n   <em>\n    State v. Lawrence\n   </em>\n   , DA 14-0720, 2016 MT 209N, 2016 Mont. LEXIS 773.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b64 The District Court, upon receiving this Court's Opinion, reinstated the second Amended Information as the effective charging document\n   and set the matter for trial to begin April 28, 2017. However, a month prior to trial, Lawrence requested the District Court dismiss his counsel and that he be permitted to proceed\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   . The District Court granted Lawrence's request. During a final pretrial conference, the State and Lawrence entered into a plea agreement whereby Lawrence pleaded \"guilty by\n   <em>\n    Alford\n   </em>\n   \" to one count of sexual assault and one count of solicitation for sexual assault and, in exchange, the State dismissed 243 counts of sexual abuse. On June 28, 2017, the District Court imposed a twenty-year sentence with ten years suspended and gave Lawrence credit for 1,103 days of time already served.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b65 In his Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus, Lawrence raises many claims, including a claim that his\n   <em>\n    Alford\n   </em>\n   pleas are invalid because, pursuant to \u00a7 46-12-204(4), MCA, a court may not accept a \"plea of nolo contendere in a case involving a sexual offense[.]\" Lawrence also relies on\n   <em>\n    State v. Hansen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12460212\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/389/299/\">\n    2017 MT 280\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12460212\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/389/299/\">\n    389 Mont. 299\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12460212\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/389/299/\">\n    405 P.3d 625\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , in which this Court determined Hanson's sentence was illegal because the sentence was imposed based on Hanson's no contest plea to a sexual offense. Lawrence's petition requires us to resolve the following dispositive issue:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    In Montana, is an \"Alford plea\" synonymous to a \"nolo contendere plea\" which, under \u00a7 46-12-204(4), MCA, the court may not accept in a case involving a sexual offense?\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b66 In\n   <em>\n    Alford\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court held that Alford's plea of guilty was valid even though Alford protested his innocence and indicated he would not have pleaded guilty except for the opportunity to limit the possible penalty. The Supreme Court noted that \"[s]tate and lower federal courts are divided upon whether a guilty plea can be accepted when it is accompanied by protestations of innocence and hence contains only a waiver of trial but no admission of guilt.\"\n   <em>\n    Alford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12045986\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/400/25/\">\n    400 U.S. at 33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12045986\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/400/25/\">\n    91 S.Ct. at 165\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, the\n   Court concluded that \"the Constitution does not bar imposition of a prison sentence upon an accused who is unwilling expressly to admit his guilt but who, faced with grim alternatives, is willing to waive his right to trial and accept the sentence.\"\n   <em>\n    Alford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12045986\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/400/25/\">\n    400 U.S. at 36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12045986\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/400/25/\">\n    91 S.Ct. at 167\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, the fact that Alford's plea \"was denominated a plea of guilty rather than a plea of\n   <em>\n    nolo contendere\n   </em>\n   is of no constitutional significance with respect to the issue now before us, for the Constitution is concerned with the practical consequences, not the formal categorizations, of state law.\"\n   <em>\n    Alford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12045986\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/400/25/\">\n    400 U.S. at 37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12045986\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/400/25/\">\n    91 S.Ct. at 167\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, while most guilty pleas consist of both a waiver of trial and an admission of guilt, \"the latter element is not a constitutional requisite to the imposition of\n   criminal penalty.\"\n   <em>\n    Alford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12045986\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/400/25/\">\n    400 U.S. at 37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12045986\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/400/25/\">\n    91 S.Ct. at 167\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Significantly, the Supreme Court recognized that a trial judge does not have to accept every constitutionally valid plea merely because a defendant wishes to plead. \"A criminal defendant does not have an absolute right under the Constitution to have his guilty plea accepted by the court, ...\" and \"the States may bar their courts from accepting guilty pleas from any defendants who assert their innocence.\"\n   <em>\n    Alford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12045986\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/400/25/\">\n    400 U.S. at 38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12045986\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/400/25/\">\n    91 S.Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   169 n.11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b67 The Montana Legislature responded to\n   <em>\n    Alford\n   </em>\n   by enacting \u00a7 46-12-212, MCA (1991), which requires courts to determine whether a factual basis exists to support a guilty plea before accepting it. Section 46-12-212, MCA, provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   (1) The court may not accept a guilty plea without determining that there is a factual basis for the plea in charges of felonies or misdemeanors resulting in incarceration.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   (2) A defendant who is unwilling to admit to any element of the offense that would provide a factual basis for a plea of guilty may, with the consent of the court, enter a plea of guilty to the offense if the defendant considers the plea to be in the defendant's best interest and if a factual basis exists for the plea.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b68 The 1991 Commission Comments to \u00a7 46-12-212, MCA, indicate:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Subsection (2) was developed to allow formal recognition of what is commonly called the 'Alford plea.'

Section 46-12-212(2), MCA, permits a defendant to enter a guilty plea without admitting that he committed the offense if a factual basis exists and if the defendant believes the plea is in his best interest. This Court has recognized that \"[a]n\n   <em>\n    Alford\n   </em>\n   plea allows a defendant to plead guilty to an offense without acknowledging his guilt.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Peterson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5716313\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/372/382/\">\n    2013 MT 329\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 8,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5716313\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/372/382/\">\n    372 Mont. 382\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5716313\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/372/382/\">\n    314 P.3d 227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In Montana, when a defendant enters such a \"plea by\n   <em>\n    Alford\n   </em>\n   ,\" as Lawrence did here, he still pleads guilty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b69 The Legislature enacted \u00a7 46-12-212(2), MCA, in 1991 to provide defendants with the option of entering a guilty plea pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Alford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   and then, in 1999, the Legislature added a third plea alternative to \u00a7 46-12-204(1), MCA, by allowing a defendant to plead \"nolo contendere.\" Section 46-12-204(1), MCA, now sets forth a defendant's three plea alternatives in Montana, whereby a defendant may plead: (1) guilty, which includes a \"plea by\n   <em>\n    Alford\n   </em>\n   \" pursuant to \u00a7 46-12-212(2), MCA ; (2) not guilty; or (3) nolo contendere with the consent of the court and prosecutor. In a case involving a sexual offense, however, a court may not accept a plea of nolo contendere. Section 46-12-204(4), MCA ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hansen\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 3. Therefore, a defendant charged with a sexual offense may only plead guilty, which includes an\n   <em>\n    Alford\n   </em>\n   guilty plea pursuant to \u00a7 46-12-212(2), MCA, or not guilty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b610 In this case, Lawrence entered a plea of \"guilty by\n   <em>\n    Alford\n   </em>\n   \" to the sexual offenses pursuant to \u00a7 46-12-212(2), MCA ; he did not enter a plea of nolo contendere. Because an\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Alford\n   </em>\n   plea\" is a guilty plea, courts are not statutorily prohibited from accepting\n   <em>\n    Alford\n   </em>\n   pleas in sexual offenses. Accordingly, we conclude Lawrence's\n   <em>\n    Alford\n   </em>\n   pleas were guilty pleas, not nolo contendere pleas, and that \u00a7 46-12-204(4), MCA, did not prohibit the District Court from accepting the\n   <em>\n    Alford\n   </em>\n   pleas to the sexual offenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b611 Lawrence raises several other issues that are not appropriate for us to address in a petition for habeas corpus relief. \" '[A] defendant waives the right to appeal all nonjurisdictional defects upon voluntarily and knowingly entering a guilty plea, including claims of constitutional violations which may have occurred prior to the plea.' \"\n   <em>\n    State v.
