Introduction and Summary\n </p>\n <opinion id=\"p-6\">\n  \u00b6 1 This lawsuit pits the Arapahoe County Sheriff (the Sheriff) against one of his former deputies, Michael Cummings, whose employment was terminated by the Sheriff. Cummings contends that the written employment policies promulgated by the Sheriff contained in the Sheriff's employee manual (the Manual) constitute an implied contract of employment that the Sheriff breached when he fired Cummings. In denying the Sheriff's summary judgment motion, the district court agreed with Cummings. The Sheriff brings this interlocutory appeal under C.A.R. 4.2, challenging the district court's denial of summary judgment.\n </opinion>\n <opinion id=\"p-7\">\n  \u00b6 2 Resolution of this appeal requires us to construe section 30-10-506, C.R.S. 2017, which governs the employment relationship between Colorado's elected sheriffs and the deputies they appoint. It provides in relevant part as follows:\n </opinion>\n <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-8\">\n  Each sheriff may appoint as many deputies as the sheriff may think proper and may revoke such appointments at will; except\n  that a sheriff shall adopt personnel policies, including policies for the review of revocation of appointments. Before revoking an appointment of a deputy, the sheriff shall notify the deputy of the reason for the proposed revocation and shall give the deputy an opportunity to be heard by the sheriff.\n </blockquote>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   \u00a7 30-10-506.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 3 In\n   <em>\n    Seeley v. Board of County Commissioners\n   </em>\n   , the Colorado Supreme Court authoritatively construed a prior version of this statute, holding that sheriffs' deputies were employees at will and that a sheriff \"did not possess the statutory authority to limit his power to discharge [his deputies] 'at his pleasure.' \"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10384458\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/791/696/#p700\">\n    791 P.2d 696\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 700 (Colo. 1990).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 4 As was its right, the General Assembly legislatively overruled the supreme court's decision by amending the statute in 2006. Hearings on H.B. 1181 before the H. Local Gov. Comm., 65th Gen. Assemb., 1st Sess. (Feb. 7, 2006);\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gallegos v.

Local Gov. Comm., 65th Gen. Assemb., 1st Sess. (Feb. 7, 2006). But we also know from the plain language of the amended statute that in other respects, the General Assembly intended to preserve the doctrine of at-will employment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 6 Considering the plain language of the 2006 amendments, the legislative history, and commonly recognized rules of statutory construction, we conclude that section 30-10-506 does the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   \u2022 It grants two unwaivable rights to the deputies: the right of notification \"of the reason for the proposed revocation\" of their employment, and \"an opportunity to be heard by the sheriff\" before their employment is terminated.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   \u2022 It requires each sheriff to \"adopt personnel policies, including policies for the review of revocation of appointments,\" but except for the two statutory rights noted above, these policies need not be binding and sheriffs may reserve their right to depart from such policies in any particular case or matter. To that extent, the doctrine of at-will employment is preserved.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   \u2022 It permits a sheriff to promulgate binding employment policies, and if the sheriff elects to do so, those policies are enforceable in accordance with their terms.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 7 Applying this construction of section 30-10-506 to the facts presented in the Sheriff's summary judgment motion, but also considering the dispositive legal effect of clear and conspicuous disclaimers of any contractual relationship, we affirm the district court's denial of summary judgment with respect to the specific rights granted by section 30-10-506, but otherwise reverse the court's denial of summary judgment on Cummings' implied contract claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   II. Relevant Facts and Procedural History\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 8 Cummings was a deputy sheriff in Arapahoe County. The Sheriff terminated Cummings' employment, asserting that he violated several of the Manual's policies and was dishonest in the course of the investigation of the original charges against him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 9 After exhausting his remedies within the Sheriff's department, Cummings sued, asserting two claims for relief: wrongful discharge in violation of public policy and breach of an implied contract of employment based on the employment policies contained in the Manual.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 10 Cummings contends that while the Sheriff informed him of the reasons for the initial investigation into his conduct, the\n   Sheriff did not provide him with notice of the charges that eventually led to his termination. He also contends that the Sheriff denied him an adequate opportunity to defend himself by not following the procedural policies of the Manual during the disciplinary process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 11 The Sheriff moved to dismiss the wrongful termination claim under C.R.C.P. 12(b)(1) based on governmental immunity. The district court held a\n   <em>\n    Trinity\n   </em>\n   hearing on the wrongful discharge in violation of public policy claim and dismissed that claim with prejudice.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Trinity Broad. of Denver v. City of Westminster\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10367492\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/848/916/\">\n    848 P.2d 916\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Colo. 1993).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 12 After the district court denied the Sheriff's motion to dismiss the implied contract claim for failure to state a claim, the Sheriff moved for summary judgment. He contended that the at-will language in section 30-10-506 prevented him from promulgating binding personnel policies; that the disclaimers contained both in the Manual itself and in separate, yearly disclaimers signed by Cummings precluded as a matter of law any implied contract claim; and that, in any event, he had not violated any of the Manual's policies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 13 The district court denied the Sheriff's motion, holding that there was an implied contract of employment. The district court reasoned that it was illogical to conclude that the General Assembly would at once require sheriffs to promulgate employment policies, but then authorize sheriffs to wholly ignore them. Thus, the court held that\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   provisions in an employment manual promulgated by a sheriff pursuant to section 30-10-506 were binding and formed an implied employment contract. As to the disclaimers, the court ruled that they were ineffective because they could not countermand the statutory requirement that the policies be binding. And, as to the Sheriff's argument that he did not violate any of the policies, the court concluded that disputed issues of material fact precluded summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 14 Although ordinarily an order denying summary judgment is not a final appealable order, the Sheriff petitioned for an interlocutory review of the order. Recognizing the internal conflicts within the statute, the district court certified its summary judgment order for interlocutory appeal under C.A.R. 4.2. Agreeing with the district court that the Sheriff met the requirements for an interlocutory appeal, and that this is a matter of substantial public concern, we granted the petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   III. The District Court Correctly Denied The Sheriff's Motion for Summary Judgment With Respect To The Specific Rights Granted by Section 30-10-506\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 15 For the same three reasons that he sought summary judgment in the district court, the Sheriff contends that the court erred in denying his motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   A.

Analysis\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   1. Binding Personnel Policies May Be Promulgated by the Sheriff Under Section 30-10-506\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 23 Relying on\n   <em>\n    Seeley\n   </em>\n   , the Sheriff contends (and the special concurrence apparently agrees) that the retention of the at-will employment concept in the statute requires us to hold that\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   policies promulgated by a sheriff relating to the termination of deputy sheriffs' employment are only precatory. To conclude otherwise, according to the Sheriff, would write out of the statute the Sheriff's statutory power to terminate at will the employment of a deputy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 24 For two reasons, we reject the Sheriff's interpretation of section 30-10-506. First, it is inconsistent with the statute's conferral on the deputies of at least two due process rights. Second, based on the amended statutory language, we have no doubt that the General Assembly legislatively partly overruled\n   <em>\n    Seeley\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hearings on H.B. 1181 before the H. Local Gov. Comm., 65th Gen. Assemb., 1st Sess. (Feb. 7, 2006).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 25 When it amended section 30-10-506, the General Assembly combined two contradictory concepts-at-will employment for deputies, on the one hand, and the requirement that sheriffs provide at least some binding employment rights to their deputies, on the other. These inherent contradictions render the statute susceptible to at least two reasonable understandings; thus, it is ambiguous.\n   <em>\n    People v.

We agree with the Sheriff that a construction of the statute that\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   such policies are binding ignores and essentially writes out the at-will employment language. This is what the district court's construction of the statute did, but neither the district court nor this court has that authority.\n   <em>\n    Jefferson Cty.

But the amendments to the statute overruled that holding, at least in part. Hearings on H.B. 1181 before the H. Local Gov. Comm., 65th Gen. Assemb., 1st Sess. (Feb. 7, 2006). While the statute does confer on the deputies two binding due process rights, nothing in the statute expressly requires that\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   policies adopted by the sheriff are binding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b6 31 We reject the district court's reasoning that it is illogical for the General Assembly to require the promulgation of employment policies and then permit the sheriff to ignore at least some of those policies. As a division of this court observed in\n   <em>\n    Jaynes v. Centura Health Corp.\n   </em>\n   , precatory employment policies are not useless; they may serve as \"guidelines\" for the employer, managers, and his employees.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8439685\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/148/241/#p249\">\n    148 P.3d 241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 249 (Colo.

We thus reject the district court's conclusion that only binding employment policies are meaningful and that all employment policies promulgated by the Sheriff must be binding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b6 32 But that does not mean that the Sheriff is prohibited by section 30-10-506 from promulgating binding employment policies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b6 33 To summarize, the amended statute requires a sheriff to promulgate written employment policies. The sheriff must give his deputies the rights of notice and opportunity to be heard. Other employment policies promulgated by the sheriff may be, but are not required to be, binding. And if the sheriff elects to confer binding employment rights on his deputies, those rights are enforceable in accordance with their terms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b6 34 In this way, \"we give effect to every word and render none superfluous because we 'do not presume that the legislature used language idly and with no intent that meaning should be given to its language.' \"\n   <em>\n    Lombard v.

The Manual's Notice of Charges and Opportunity to be Heard Employment Policies\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b6 41 In his response to the Sheriff's summary judgment motion, Cummings specifically contended that the Sheriff violated the Manual's policy (and the statutory mandate) requiring that deputies receive timely notice of the reason for their proposed termination. While Cummings appears to concede that he received timely notice of the\n   <em>\n    initial\n   </em>\n   charges against him, he contends that he did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   receive proper, timely notice of the additional charges that actually led to his termination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \u00b6 42 As we held above, a deputy's right to notice and an opportunity to be heard are explicitly protected by section 30-10-506.

The court in\n   <em>\n    Dickey\n   </em>\n   decided that this language made \"deputy sheriffs employees at will,\" and, as a result, sheriffs had \"no power to alter the employment status of deputy sheriffs through the promulgation of employee manuals.\" 791 P.2d at 692.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   IV. Interpretation of Section 506\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   \u00b6 81 Applying the principles of statutory construction that I described in the Introduction, I conclude that the language in section 506 is plain and clear. I think that it continues the legislatively mandated rule that appeared in the 1877 statute: a sheriff may terminate a deputy's appointment \"at will.\" This means that a sheriff may fire a deputy \"without cause and without notice,\"\n   <em>\n    Crawford Rehab. Servs., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11972725\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/938/540/#p546\">\n    938 P.2d at 546\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and that such a decision \"does not give rise to a cause of action,\"\n   <em>\n    Dickey\n   </em>\n   , 791 P.2d at 691.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   \u00b6 82 Next, the legislature also has the authority to \"create[ ] exceptions to the employer's general right to terminate an employee at-will.\"\n   <em>\n    Crawford Rehab.

I find two of those exceptions in section 506: a sheriff must give a deputy (1) notice of the reason why he or she is firing the deputy; and (2) an opportunity \"to be heard by the sheriff.\" In other words, section 506 limits a sheriff's at-will authority to fire a deputy in these two ways.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Crawford Rehab. Servs., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11972725\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/938/540/#p546\">\n    938 P.2d at 546\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   \u00b6 83 But what is the effect of the language in section 506 that requires sheriffs to adopt policies \"for the review of revocation of appointments\"? Does it set out additional exceptions to \"the employer's general right to terminate an employee at-will\"?\n   <em>\n    Crawford Rehab.

I would answer the second question \"no.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   \u00b6 84 The requirement that a sheriff must adopt policies for reviewing the decision to fire a deputy is not accompanied by language stating that a sheriff is bound by those policies, or that the sheriff must \"follow\" or \"comply with\" them, or that they \"control,\" \"modify,\" or \"limit\" the sheriff's discretion to fire deputies at will. And I cannot add such language to section 506 in the course of interpreting it.\n   <em>\n    Williams v. Dep't of Pub.

I would therefore additionally conclude that, although the legislature amended the 1877 statute in 2006, the continued presence of the legislatively mandated at-will employment rule in section 506 means that the resolution of this case is controlled by\n   <em>\n    Seeley\n   </em>\n   instead of\n   <em>\n    Dickey\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   As the supreme court pointed out in\n   <em>\n    Seeley\n   </em>\n   , the 1877 statute \"explicitly authorize[d] ... sheriffs to discharge deput[ies] ... at their pleasure.\" 791 P.2d at 699. Section 506 does the same thing. So section 506 \"did not authorize [the sheriff] to limit his statutory power to discharge deput[ies] ... at his pleasure.\"\n   <em>\n    Seeley\n   </em>\n   , 791 P.2d at 699-700 ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10428432\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/662/463/#p471\">\n    662 P.2d at 471\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"We conclude ... that the ... personnel rules, even though adopted by the board of health, do not override the explicit statutory authority of the board to discharge a public health officer appointed by the board.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   \u00b6 87 Turning to the statute in\n   <em>\n    Dickey\n   </em>\n   , it did not make an explicit reference to school boards having the power to terminate employment at will, and it did not state that employees served at the pleasure of the school boards. Rather, it gave the school boards discretionary powers \"[t]o discharge or otherwise terminate the employment of any personnel.\"\n   <em>\n    Dickey\n   </em>\n   , 791 P.2d at 691. Section 506 is different: it expressly gives sheriffs the authority to terminate deputies' employment at will by clearly stating that sheriffs \"may revoke\" the appointments of deputies \"at will.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   \u00b6 88 The supreme court observed in\n   <em>\n    Kennedy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10395652\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/776/1159/#p1160\">\n    776 P.2d at 1160\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , that statutory provisions such as section 506 \"have been construed to bar claims for breach of contract based on assurances in an employee handbook under the rationale that such a statute defines the employee as terminable at will and the statute supersedes any county declaration to the contrary.\"\n   <em>\n    Accord\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10428432\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/662/463/#p471\">\n    662 P.2d at 471\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (A county's personnel rules \"do not override the explicit statutory authority of the [official] to discharge [an employee].\").
