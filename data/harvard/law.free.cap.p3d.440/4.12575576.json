Laws, ch. 519, \u00a7 27. Plaintiffs, a Certified Nurse Practitioner (CNP) and Certified Nurse Midwife (CNM), filed this action in 2018, seeking a declaratory judgment that the statute violates Montana's constitutional right of privacy, equal protection, and dignity. They moved for a preliminary injunction. Both parties submitted affidavits, and neither requested an evidentiary hearing. After considering the affidavits and legal arguments presented by all parties, the District Court granted that relief on April 4, 2018. Pursuant to M. R. App. P. 6(3)(e), the State appeals on the alternative grounds that the District Court:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    1. lacked jurisdiction because the Plaintiffs do not have standing to seek relief on their claims; or\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    2. improperly issued an advisory opinion on claims that were not ripe for a preliminary injunction, did not establish irreparable harm, and did not seek to preserve the status quo.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b62 Plaintiff Jane Doe is a CNM and women's health nurse practitioner who practices midwifery in Montana and is proceeding in this matter under a pseudonym by leave of court. Plaintiff Helen Weems is a CNP in Montana who has been board certified in family practice by the American Nurses Credentialing Center since 1999 and re-certified every five years since.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Weems co-owns a primary care clinic in Whitefish that offers comprehensive health services for men and women, including reproductive health care services. The other owner is Susan Cahill, a licensed physician's assistant (PA), who performs early-term abortions as part of her practice. Both Plaintiffs allege that the performance of early-term abortions\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   is within their scope of practice and that they could perform such services but for Montana's statutory restriction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b63 In support of their motion for preliminary injunction, Plaintiffs presented evidence that APRNs routinely perform procedures within their scope of practice that are similar in skill to or more complex than early-term abortions and that carry comparable or greater risk. Plaintiff Weems described her experience with inserting and removing Intra-Uterine Devices (IUDs), dilating the cervix, and performing endometrial biopsy, a procedure that involves inserting instruments into the uterus to remove a tissue sample from the uterine lining. She described these procedures as comparable to those used in an aspiration procedure for abortion. She also attested that she has prescription authority from the Board of Nursing and a U.S. Drug Enforcement Authority (DEA) license, which permits her to prescribe schedules II through V controlled substances. Weems attested to her experience, prior to moving to Montana, with independently dispensing mifepristone and misoprostol for medication abortions-drugs that are\n   not controlled substances and that carry less danger than controlled substances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b64 Plaintiffs also presented evidence to show that early abortion safety, efficacy, and\n   patient acceptability is the same as between physicians and physician assistants, nurse practitioners, and certified nurse midwives. Finally, they offered evidence of the limited access to abortion services in Montana and the impact the restriction on authorized providers has on the availability of those services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b65 The State submitted as its evidence a chart from the Montana Board of Nursing identifying and listing websites for the relevant national organizations that set standards for nurse practitioners and certified nurse midwives. It also submitted a one-page description of the scope of practice for nurse practitioners from the American Association of Nurse Practitioners and a one-page summary definition of midwifery and scope of practice of certified nurse-midwives and certified midwives from the American College of Nurse Midwives. The State pointed out that abortion is not listed within the scope of practice in these documents, nor is it included in the Montana Board of Nursing's administrative rules governing APRN standards and practice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b66 The District Court held that Plaintiffs were entitled to a preliminary injunction under \u00a7 27-19-201(2), MCA, because they had made a showing that enforcement of \u00a7 50-20-109(1)(a), MCA, prior to the conclusion of litigation would cause irreparable injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b67 We review the grant or denial of a preliminary injunction for manifest abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    Davis v.

Irrespective of the statute, the State maintains that \"[a]s of the issuance\" of the District Court's preliminary injunction order, the harm posited by the Plaintiffs was conjectural and hypothetical. The State maintains that the Plaintiffs have not presented an actual case or controversy because their scope of practice-with or without the statute-does not extend to abortion procedures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b611 The State's standing argument is conjoined with its argument that the Plaintiffs' request for a preliminary injunction was not ripe for adjudication. Standing and ripeness are separate but related inquiries within a court's justiciability analysis:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   To meet the constitutional case-or-controversy requirement for standing, the plaintiff must clearly allege a past, present, or threatened injury to a property or civil right, and the injury must be one that would be alleviated by successfully maintaining\n   the action. Note that standing may rest not only on past or present injury, but also on\n   <em>\n    threatened\n   </em>\n   injury. Ripeness and mootness, in turn, can be seen as \"the time dimensions of standing.\" Ripeness asks whether an injury that has not yet happened is sufficiently likely to happen or, instead, is too contingent or remote to support present adjudication, whereas mootness asks whether an injury that has happened is too far beyond a useful remedy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    Reichert\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 55 (internal citations omitted). \"Whether framed as an issue of standing or ripeness, the [constitutional] inquiry is largely the same: whether the issues presented are definite and concrete, not hypothetical or abstract.\"\n   <em>\n    Reichert\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 56 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Wolfson v. Brammer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3768136\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/616/1045/#p1058\">\n    616 F.3d 1045\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1058 (9th Cir. 2010) ) (alteration in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b612 We address below the ripeness argument as it relates to the request for preliminary injunction. We have little trouble concluding,\n   however, that Weems and Doe have standing to bring their complaint. We held in\n   <em>\n    Armstrong\n   </em>\n   that when \"governmental regulation directed at health care providers impacts the constitutional rights of women patients,\" the providers have standing to challenge the alleged infringement of such rights.\n   <em>\n    Armstrong\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 8-13. We concluded that the plaintiff health care providers had standing \"to assert on behalf of their women patients the individual privacy rights under Montana's Constitution of such women to obtain a pre-viability abortion from a health care provider of their choosing.\"\n   <em>\n    Armstrong\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b613 The Plaintiffs' Complaint presents the same issue. The central dispute between the parties, discussed further below, is whether \u00a7 50-20-109(1)(a), MCA, is the regulatory barrier that prevents Weems and Doe from performing aspiration and medication abortion procedures, or whether the Board of Nursing must act first to authorize such procedures within the Plaintiffs' scope of practice before the statute comes into play. That issue presumably will be front and center as the litigation proceeds toward resolution on the merits. For standing purposes, however, the Complaint includes sufficient allegations that, but for the existence of the statutory restriction, Weems and Doe would be able to include medication and aspiration abortion procedures within their competency training and independent practices. Plaintiffs allege that APRNs are independent and autonomous health care practitioners, authorized to provide services within the scope of practice to which they are trained. The Complaint further alleges that the Montana Board of Nursing does not identify specific procedures that APRNs may or may not perform. Rather, the Board's regulations provide that APRNs have \"full practice authority.\" The Complaint alleges that the Board \"charges APRN licensees to know their own role and population focus using the standards of their professional organization.\" The Complaint alleges that \"Montana law does not single out any health service as beyond an APRN's scope of practice, except abortion.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b614 The State's standing argument is circular: it maintains that Plaintiffs cannot challenge the statute unless they are licensed to perform the procedure in question, but acknowledges that the statute prevents them from seeking such licensure. Weems and Doe plainly are impacted by the statute; as it stands, the law precludes the \"appropriate medical examining and licensing authority\" from making a determination that they are competent to perform the medical procedures at issue.\n   <em>\n    Armstrong, \u00b6\n   </em>\n   2, n.1.

The State maintains that the court made speculative assumptions in granting Plaintiffs the preliminary relief they requested. Because women seeking abortions \"do not have a currently existing right\" to have Weems or Doe perform that procedure, which the State argues would require additional action by the Montana Board of Nursing, the injunction will have no practical effect. The court's injunction prevents no harm, the State suggests, because there are no patients who could have abortion services provided by Weems or Doe irrespective of the statute. Finally, because Weems and Doe \"have not been expressly authorized by their licensing authority to perform abortions,\" the State argues that the District Court's action upends the status quo, contrary to the purposes of a preliminary injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b617 Section 27-19-201, MCA, provides for issuance of a preliminary injunction on several enumerated grounds, only one of which need be met for an injunction to issue.\n   <em>\n    BAM Ventures, LLC v.

The record has not been developed regarding the Board of Nursing's position, if any, on the regulatory limits of APRN practice when it comes to aspiration abortion. Materials referenced in the Affidavit of Suzan Goodman, M.D., submitted by Plaintiffs, indicate that \"there is a decades-long history of [APRNs, CNMs, and PAs] providing first trimester aspiration abortions in collaborative settings and training doctors in abortion care in states where physician-only restrictions do not exist.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ,\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   On review of the preliminary injunction record, we conclude that Plaintiffs presented adequate evidence to justify their claim for preliminary relief on the\n   ground that the statute presents a barrier to their ability to develop competencies for and perform the lawful medical procedures of early-term abortion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b624 The State asserts that Plaintiffs nonetheless did not demonstrate irreparable harm because, as the District Court recognized, Weems has not completed her training in abortion care and Doe currently practices in a health care system that does not permit\n   abortions to be performed.

Weems and Doe presented sufficient evidence at this stage of the proceedings to support their claim that the statute bars their ability to perform the lawful medical procedures of medication or aspiration abortion and to complete appropriate training for the aspiration procedure.

According to Dr. Goodman's affidavit, the California law resulted from a six-year project evaluating the safety and efficacy of advanced practice clinicians providing early abortion.

Though largely unhelpful to the analysis, the California example lends support to the ripeness of Plaintiffs' claim that \u00a7 50-20-109(1)(a), MCA, poses a barrier to any such review by this State's Board of Nursing.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"13\">\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    The Dissent does not address this prima facie evidence that, but for the statute, Weems imminently could provide her patients with the medication required for this procedure. It recognizes that whether APRNs safely and competently can provide abortions is \"a question for the Montana Board of Nursing,\" Dissent, \u00b6 32, but overlooks that the Board's rules authorize Weems to dispense medication without restriction.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"dissent\">\n  <author id=\"p-54\">\n   Justice Jim Rice, dissenting.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b628 I would conclude the record is insufficiently developed at this\n   stage of the litigation to support enjoinment of a statute that has been in effect without challenge for over 10 years, and constitutes the status quo in the matter. Indeed, the inadequacy of the record at this point in the proceeding is significant enough to raise the justiciability concern of ripeness. The undeveloped state of the law requires the Court, in order to affirm the injunction, to enter what is essentially a prospective declaratory judgment on the scope of practice of APRNs, without any guidance from the regulatory body qualified and authorized to make such medically-based judgments, which will inevitably taint that question, both before the Board of Nursing and before the District Court in this litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b629 The Court relies upon\n   <em>\n    Armstrong\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 2, 75, but the state of the record there stands in stark contrast to the record here. In that case, brought by a physician's assistant who had been performing abortions in Montana for more than 20 years, this Court enjoined a newly-passed law that restricted non-physicians from performing abortions.\n   <em>\n    Armstrong\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 22, 75. The Court relied on the fact that the Board of Medical Examiners had determined that the physician's assistant was competent to perform certain types of abortions.\n   <em>\n    Armstrong\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 63. In fact, the record showed that the physician assistant had been \"performing abortions with the approval of the Montana Board of Medical Examiners since 1983.\"\n   <em>\n    Armstrong\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 64. The Court's decision was premised upon the fact that the health provider was \"\n   <em>\n    determined by the appropriate medical examining and licensing authority\n   </em>\n   to be competent by reason of education, training or experience,\n   <em>\n    to perform the particular medical procedure\n   </em>\n   or category of procedures at issue[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Armstrong\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 2, n.1 (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wiser\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 15 (the privacy right is \" 'to obtain a\n   <em>\n    particular lawful medical procedure\n   </em>\n   from a health care provider\n   <em>\n    that has been\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    determined by the medical community to be competent\n   </em>\n   to provide that service and who has been licensed to do so' \") (quoting\n   <em>\n    Armstrong\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 62 ) (emphasis added).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b630 Here, the District Court issued its injunction upon hypothetical grounds. It first made an assessment about future regulatory actions, assuming that \"the Board of Nursing\n   <em>\n    will conclude\n   </em>\n   ... APRNs may provide abortion care as within their scope of practice.\" (Emphasis\n   added.) Then, it made assumptions about the Plaintiffs, concluding that, at some future point, they would complete the necessary training \"to be competent to provide abortion services[.]\" The court therefore reasoned there was \"no harm in proactively applying a preliminary injunction to protect Weems from prosecution\n   <em>\n    in the event\n   </em>\n   she satisfies the competency requirements of the Board of Nursing and is operating within her scope of practice.\" (Emphasis added.) Thus, upon the assumptions that (1) the regulatory agency will conclude in the future that abortion services fall within the Plaintiffs' scope of practice, and (2) that Plaintiffs will complete necessary competency training, the statute has been \"proactively\" enjoined so that it will not be an obstacle \"in the event\" these assumptions come to pass. In my view, a more concrete injury must be demonstrated to justify a court's enjoinment of a longstanding statute. At this stage of the proceeding,\n   the alleged injury \"is too contingent or remote to support present adjudication[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Reichert\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 55.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b631 The tentativeness in the District Court's order is a consequence of the weaknesses in the proof offered so far in the proceedings by the Plaintiffs. Although the Court credits the Plaintiffs' \"evidence,\" this consisted of three untested affidavits-one from Weems herself, and two from doctors who perform abortions. No testimony has been tested by the Rules of Evidence and cross examination. None of the affidavits aver that the Montana Board of Nursing has determined that abortions can currently be provided by the Plaintiffs pursuant to their current licensure, or that the Board intends to approve of the procedures under those licenses. Nor did Plaintiffs provide any regulatory statement from the Montana Board of Nursing regarding these issues, which the Court recognizes: \"[t]he record has not been developed regarding the Board of Nursing's position, if any, on the regulatory limits of APRN\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   practice when it comes to aspiration abortion.\" Opinion, \u00b6 23.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Indeed, the ongoing uncertainty of this legal issue is underscored by the District Court's acknowledgement of the possibility that Weems could provide abortion services outside of APRN scope of practice, which would then subject her to \"discipline from the regulatory board charged with overseeing APRNs-the Montana Board of Nursing.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b632 Rather than providing evidence from the Board of Nursing, one of Plaintiffs' main arguments is that APRNs can provide some types of abortions as safely and competently as doctors, and that prohibiting them from doing so violates equal protection and a woman's right to privacy and procreative autonomy in Mont. Const. art. II, \u00a7 10.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, the determination of whether APRNs can safely and competently provide abortions is clearly a question for the Montana Board of Nursing, who govern the practice of APRNs in Montana,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 37-8-102(1); -202(2)(b); -409(1), MCA, and have the requisite medical training and knowledge to make such a determination. In contrast, the court lacks both the authority and the proper medical knowledge and training to decide this issue. As the District Court correctly noted, \"[a]uthority to set and enforce competency requirements for APRNs has been delegated by the legislature to the Board of Nursing.\" Thus, the Board of Nursing is the proper authority to determine whether APRNs may perform abortions in Montana.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \u00b633 The law governing this issue is as follows. The State of Montana has \"police power by which it can regulate for the health and safety of its citizens.\"\n   <em>\n    Wiser\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 19 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Skurdal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2638717\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/235/291/#p293\">\n    235 Mont. 291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 293-94,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2638717\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/235/291/#p293\">\n    767 P.2d 304\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 306 (1988). Accordingly, in order to \"safeguard life and health,\" a person practicing or offering to practice either professional nursing or practical nursing in Montana must \"submit evidence that the person is qualified to practice and is licensed[.]\" Section 37-8-101(1) - (2), MCA. In Montana, the licensing requirements, competency requirements, and scope of practice for nurses is determined by the Montana Board of Nursing. Sections 37-8-102(1); - 202(2)(b); -409(1), MCA. The general scope of practice for APRNs in Montana is governed by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mont.%20Admin.%20R.%2024\">\n    Mont. Admin. R. 24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .159.1406. This regulation provides, in relevant part, that \"[t]he APRN licensed in Montana may only practice in the role and population focus in which the APRN has current national certification[,]\" and also provides a listing of general medical services that APRNs can provide. Whether this listing includes abortion services, and what kinds of abortion services, is clearly debatable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b634 Given that the Legislature has enacted specific legislation regarding abortion services, courts should not have to guess about whether licensure through the Board of Nursing authorizes the services, and it is incumbent upon the Plaintiffs to demonstrate that their practice has been legally restricted. Having yet failed to do so, the Plaintiffs are aided by the Court. Going beyond the District Court's conjecture that the Board of Nursing will conclude in the future that abortion services can be provided pursuant to their licensure, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs have \"just[ified] their claim\" of what the law is, simply on the basis of the \"allegations\" in their Complaint and affidavits. Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 13, 23. Although the Court cites subsection (2) of \u00a7 27-19-201, MCA, as the basis for the preliminary injunction, that provision does not authorize enjoinment of a statute in prevention of \"irreparable injury\" before the parties establish as a matter of law that the challenged statute applies to them, or by merely \"justify[ing] their claim.\" Opinion, \u00b6 23. Preliminary injunctions are to be issued to \"preserve the\n   <em>\n    status quo\n   </em>\n   and to minimize the harm to all parties pending full trial[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Yockey v.
