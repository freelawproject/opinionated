(collectively Generic Defendants) appeal the trial court's denial of their summary judgment motion in a products liability lawsuit filed by Diana Sherman.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b62 The Generic Defendants are manufacturers of metoclopramide, the generic version of the prescription drug Reglan. Sherman developed a movement disorder called tardive dyskinesia after taking metoclopramide for six years as prescribed by Dr. Bruce Silverman. She filed a lawsuit against the Generic Defendants, alleging that they had violated the Washington Product Liability Act (WPLA), chapter 7.72 RCW, by failing to provide adequate warnings about the risk of developing tardive dyskinesia associated with using metoclopramide.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b63 Sherman's duty to warn claim against the Generic Defendants derives from federally\n   approved changes to the Reglan label, also known as the \"package insert,\" that in 2004 and 2009 strengthened the warnings about using metoclopramide. Sherman claims that the Generic Defendants violated their duty to warn in two ways. First, they failed to update their package inserts for generic metoclopramide to reflect the strengthened warnings on the revised Reglan labels. Second, they failed to communicate the strengthened warnings to Dr. Silverman and the physician community in general in other ways besides in their package inserts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b64 We hold that the trial court erred in denying the Generic Defendants' summary judgment motion regarding (1) Sherman's \"failure to update\" claim because Dr. Silverman's testimony that he did not read any package inserts precluded any genuine issue of fact as to whether the Generic Defendants' failure to update their metoclopramide warnings proximately caused her tardive dyskinesia ; and (2) Sherman's \"failure to communicate\" claim because, under the facts of this case, the Generic Defendants\n   had no duty under the WPLA to communicate warnings by means other than the package insert.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b65 Accordingly, we reverse the trial court's order denying the Generic Defendants' summary judgment motion and remand for the trial court to dismiss Sherman's claims against the Generic Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    Prescription for Metoclopramide\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b66 Metoclopramide is a prescription medication that is used for the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux. A known risk of using metoclopramide includes the development of tardive dyskinesia, a neurological disorder characterized by abnormal involuntary movements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b67 Sherman first saw Dr. Silverman in 2003 for severe digestive issues. After other treatments failed to relieve Sherman's symptoms, Dr. Silverman prescribed metoclopramide. While on metoclopramide, Sherman's digestive symptoms improved significantly. She stayed on metoclopramide from September 2004 to December 2010.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b68 Dr. Silverman evaluated Sherman regularly while she was on metoclopramide and before 2010 did not see any indication that she was experiencing involuntary movements. However, in June 2010, Sherman began experiencing involuntary movements. In August 2011, she was diagnosed with tardive dyskinesia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    Package Insert Warnings\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b69 Beginning in 1985, the package insert for Reglan contained a warning stating that tardive dyskinesia may develop in patients treated with metoclopramide. The warning stated that the risk of developing the syndrome was\n   \"believed to increase with the duration of treatment and the total cumulative dose.\" Clerk's Papers (CP) at 715. The warning also stated that \"[e]xtrapyramidal symptoms, manifested primarily as acute dystonic reactions, occur in approximately 1 in 500 patients\" treated with metoclopramide. CP at 715. Under the dosage and administration section, the package insert stated that \"[t]herapy longer than 12 weeks has not been evaluated and cannot be recommended.\" CP at 716.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b610 In 2004, the brand-name manufacturer revised the Reglan package insert. Both the indications and usage section and the dosage and administration section of the revised package insert contained a statement that therapy with metoclopramide\"should not exceed 12 weeks in duration.\" CP at 766. There was no change to the reference to tardive dyskinesia in the warnings section.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b611 In 2009, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required the brand-name manufacturer to add a \"black box warning\" to the Reglan package insert. CP at 84. The warning was placed at the top of the package insert and stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   WARNING\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   TARDIVE DYSKINESIA\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   Treatment with metoclopramide can cause tardive dyskinesia, a serious movement disorder that is often irreversible. The risk of developing tardive dyskinesia increases with duration of treatment and total cumulative dose. Metoclopramide therapy should be discontinued in patients who develop signs or symptoms of tardive dyskinesia. There is no known treatment for tardive dyskinesia. In some patients, symptoms may lessen or resolve after metoclopramide treatment is stopped. Treatment with metoclopramide for longer than 12 weeks should be avoided in all but rare cases where therapeutic benefit is thought to outweigh the risk of developing tardive dyskinesia.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   See WARNINGS.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   CP at 503.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b612 The warnings section of the revised package insert contained additional information about tardive dyskinesia, including that \"one published study reported a TD [tardive dyskinesia ] prevalence of 20% among patients treated for at least 12 weeks.\" CP at 507. The warning concluded, \"Treatment with metoclopramide for longer than 12 weeks should be avoided in all but rare cases where therapeutic benefit is thought to outweigh the risk of developing TD.\" CP at 507.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    Complaint\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b613 In 2013, Sherman filed a complaint against the Generic Defendants and others.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In her amended complaint, she asserted a WPLA claim against the Generic Defendants for failing to provide adequate warnings to doctors regarding the use of metoclopramide. Specifically, Sherman alleged that the Generic Defendants had breached their duty to provide adequate warnings by failing (1) to update their package inserts for metoclopramide to match the strengthened warnings added to the Reglan label in 2004 and 2009, and (2) to communicate the new warning information in the revised Reglan labels to doctors through other means.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b614 In his deposition, Dr. Silverman stated that he was aware when he prescribed metoclopramide for Sherman that one of the potential risks was development of some sort of movement disorder. For any patient on metoclopramide, including Sherman, he would always watch for movement disorders. Dr. Silverman stated that he was not aware of any clinician who had actually observed tardive dyskinesia associated with using metoclopramide, but that at some\n   point \"word got around\" that tardive dyskinesia was something for which doctors should be looking. CP at 192.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b615 However, Dr. Silverman testified that he did not read package inserts and did not recall ever reading a package insert. He did not use package inserts to learn about medications. Specifically, Dr. Silverman testified that he had never read a package insert for Reglan or metoclopramide. He also did not recall ever seeing a \"Dear Doctor\" letter\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   from a drug manufacturer. CP at 178. He said that such letters might have been in a stack of mail he received every day that he never opened. But he generally did not learn new information about medications through the mail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b616 Regarding his treatment of Sherman, Dr. Silverman testified that he did not rely on any package insert for Reglan or for generic metoclopramide when deciding whether to initially prescribe metoclopramide and whether to continue prescribing metoclopramide. Similarly, he stated that any changes to the package inserts for metoclopramide did not impact his prescription decision because he did not look at them. Instead, he relied on his clinical training and experience, the experience of his colleagues\n   and associates, and his mentors and people in the academic world who he respected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b617 The Generic Defendants filed a motion for summary judgment. In support, they relied on Dr. Silverman's deposition testimony to argue that any failure to warn could not be the proximate cause of Sherman's condition as a matter of law. The trial court denied the summary judgment motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b618 The Generic Defendants filed a motion for discretionary review of the trial court's ruling.

Analysis\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   \u00b633 Here, Dr. Silverman testified unequivocally that (1) he did not read package inserts and did not recall ever reading a package insert, (2) he had never read a package insert for Reglan or metoclopramide, and (3) any changes to the package inserts for metoclopramide did not impact his prescription decision because he did not look at them. Sherman presented no evidence that would create a genuine issue of fact regarding whether Dr. Silverman ever read the package inserts for metoclopramide.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   \u00b634 Based on these undisputed facts,\n   <em>\n    Douglas\n   </em>\n   controls. The Generic Defendants' alleged failure to update the package inserts cannot be the proximate cause of Sherman's condition as a matter of law because even if they had updated the package inserts, Dr. Silverman would not have read them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   \u00b635 Because Dr. Silverman did not read package inserts, there is no genuine issue of fact regarding whether the Generic Defendants' alleged failure to update the warnings proximately caused her condition. Accordingly, we hold that the trial court erred in denying the Generic Defendants' summary judgment motion regarding Sherman's failure to update claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   C. DUTY TO COMMUNICATE WARNINGS IN OTHER WAYS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   \u00b636 Sherman alleges that the Generic Defendants breached their duty to warn by failing to communicate the risks of metoclopramide to Dr. Silverman and to the physician community in ways other than in the package insert. The Generic Defendants argue that the trial court erred in denying their summary judgment motion regarding\n   this\n   claim because they had no such \"duty to communicate\" under the WPLA. We agree with the Generic Defendants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   1. Nature of Sherman's Claim\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   \u00b637 The exact nature of Sherman's claimed duty to communicate claim is unclear. Sherman states that \"her claims are about Generic Defendants' failures to communicate to [Dr. Silverman], or to anyone in the physician community whose opinion he deems important, the multiple changes that were made to that label which substantially increased the warnings associated with long-term use.\" Br. of Resp't at 20-21. She further states that \"Dr. Silverman's failure to read the package insert is irrelevant to Mrs. Sherman's claim that Generic Defendants failed to communicate the drug's approved warnings in\n   <em>\n    other\n   </em>\n   ways.\" Br. of Resp't at 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   \u00b638 However, she does not specifically identify in her appellate brief the \"other\" type of communications that she believes the Generic Defendants were required to send. In another context, Sherman discusses Dear Doctor letters. She apparently contends that the Generic Defendants at least were required to send Dear Doctor letters to Dr. Silverman and to other doctors in the physician community.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   \u00b639 In her complaint, Sherman alleged that the Generic Defendants had a duty to (1) communicate to doctors through such means as Dear Doctor letters and advertising in medical periodicals the new warning information in the revised Reglan labels, (2) disseminate information about the risks of metoclopramide throughout the medical community in the form of reprinted publications of peer-reviewed scientific research on metoclopramide use, and (3) sponsor independently produced educational programs for doctors about metoclopramide use. But other than the Dear\n   Doctor letters, Sherman does not mention any of these other means of communication in her brief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   2. Scope of Duty to Warn\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   \u00b640 Regardless of the type of other communication that Sherman claims the Generic Defendants were required to make, the Generic Defendants argue that they had no duty under the WPLA to make\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   communications to doctors regarding warnings other than in the package insert. We agree under the fact of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   \u00b641 As noted above, RCW 7.72.030(1) addresses the liability of a product manufacturer for the failure to provide adequate warnings. That statute states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   A product manufacturer is subject to liability to a claimant if the claimant's harm was proximately caused by the negligence of the manufacturer in that the product was ... not reasonably safe because adequate warnings or instructions were not provided.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   (b) A product is not reasonably safe because adequate warnings or instructions were not\n   <em>\n    provided with the product\n   </em>\n   , if, at the time of manufacture, the likelihood that the product would cause the claimant's harm or similar harms, and the seriousness of those harms, rendered the warnings or instructions of the manufacturer inadequate and the manufacturer could have provided the warnings or instructions which the claimant alleges would have been adequate.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   RCW 7.72.030(1) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   \u00b642 RCW 7.72.030(1)(b) expressly states that adequate warnings must be \"provided with the product.\" The Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   also stated that \"the WPLA requires that warnings be\n   <em>\n    provided with products\n   </em>\n   .\" 187 Wash.2d at 753,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=389%20P.3d%20517\">\n    389 P.3d 517\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).

But she does not explain why the \"provided with the product\" language in RCW 7.72.030(1)(b) should be disregarded.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   And she cites no authority for the proposition that a prescription drug manufacturer has a duty to communicate the risks of the product in any manner other than through package inserts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   \u00b646 Sherman suggests that the Generic Defendants had a duty to communicate by means other than the package inserts under RCW 7.72.030(1)(c). This subsection states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   A product is not reasonably safe because adequate warnings or instructions were not provided after the product was manufactured where a manufacturer learned or where a reasonably prudent manufacturer should have learned about a danger\n   connected with the product after it was manufactured. In such a case, the manufacturer is under a duty to act with regard to issuing warnings or instructions concerning the danger in the manner that a reasonably prudent manufacturer would act in the same or similar circumstances. This duty is satisfied if the manufacturer exercises reasonable care to inform product users.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   RCW 7.72.030(1)(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   \u00b647 However, RCW 7.72.030(1)(c) applies when the product manufacturer learns\n   <em>\n    after the product was manufactured\n   </em>\n   (and presumably after adequate warnings were provided with the product) about a danger connected with the product. Here, Sherman does not argue that the Generic Defendants first learned about the need for strengthened warnings for metoclopramide after their generic metoclopramide was manufactured. Sherman claims that the Generic Defendants knew about the risk of tardive dyskinesia associated with long-term use of metoclopramide when the strengthened warnings were approved in 2004 and 2009 and failed to include those warnings with their product or otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   \u00b648 We conclude that a prescription drug manufacturer's duty under RCW 7.72.030(1)(b) is to provide adequate warnings with the product and that there is no duty under the WPLA to communicate such warnings to doctors in ways other than through package inserts. Further, under the facts of this case, the duty to warn under RCW 7.72.030(1)(c) is inapplicable. Accordingly, we hold that the trial court erred in denying the Generic Defendants' summary judgment motion regarding Sherman's duty to communicate claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   \u00b649 We reverse the trial court's ruling denying the Generic Defendants' summary judgment motion, and we\n   remand for the trial court to dismiss Sherman's claims against the Generic Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   We concur:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   WORSWICK, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   LEE, J.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-104\">\n    The Generic Defendants also argue that federal law preempts any state law claims for failing to provide the strengthened warnings.
