We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I. Background\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b62 The family has been involved with child protective services agencies on two prior occasions. In January 2014, the Adams County Department of Human Services opened a voluntary case with the family after one of the boys suffered a fractured femur while in father's care. The child was then six months old. The injury was not explained. The case was closed in June 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b63 In September 2014, the same child suffered another fractured femur and fractured ribs. At the same time, the other twin was found to have healing fractures to his ribs, skull, and forearm. The Adams County Department of Human Services opened a dependency and neglect case. The case was closed with mother having full custody of the children, supervised visitation for father, and a permanent protection order barring father from contact with the boy who had suffered fractured femurs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b64 In this case, in January 2017, the Jefferson County Division of Children, Youth, and Families filed a petition in dependency and neglect after mother left the three-year-old twins home alone for over six hours. Neighbors reported that the children were screaming and crying. Police arrived to find the children locked in a bedroom with no food or water. The room smelled of urine, and the home was extremely dirty. The Division removed the children and placed them with their maternal grandfather, where they remained throughout the proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b65 The juvenile court adjudicated the children dependent and neglected. In March 2017, the court adopted treatment plans for the parents. On August 28, 2017, the guardian ad litem (GAL) filed a motion to terminate the parent-child relationships. Over three days in December 2017 and January 2018, the court conducted an evidentiary hearing on the motion to terminate. In January 2018, the court terminated both parents' parental rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   II. Analysis\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   A. The Juvenile Court Did Not Violate Mother's Attorney-Client Privilege\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b66 Mother contends that the juvenile court violated her attorney-client privilege when it required disclosure of a report drafted by mother's expert and admitted the report and the expert's testimony at the termination hearing. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   1. Additional Background\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b67 Before the hearing, mother requested appointment of an expert in child psychology to evaluate her parenting time. Due to mother's indigency, the expert was appointed at state expense pursuant to section 19-3-607(1), C.R.S. 2018. The expert conducted a parent-child interactional evaluation, which included a clinical interview of mother and direct observation of mother interacting with each of the four children. Based on the expert's report, mother elected not to call the expert as a witness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b68 Just prior to the hearing, the GAL requested that the expert's report be disclosed to her. Mother objected, asserting that the report was protected by attorney-client privilege. The juvenile court ordered the report disclosed and permitted the GAL to call the expert to testify to the results of his evaluation at the termination hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   2.

State-Paid Experts and the Attorney-Client Privilege\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b610 In 1977, the Colorado legislature enacted the Parent-Child Legal Relationship Termination Act of 1977. Ch. 248,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1977%20Colo.%20Sess.%20Laws%201026\">\n    1977 Colo. Sess. Laws 1026\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -1032. In this Act, the legislature provided that \"[a]n indigent parent has the right to have appointed one expert witness of his own choosing whose reasonable fees and expenses, subject to the court's review and approval, shall be paid by the state of Colorado pursuant to section 19-11-110.\" Sec. 1, \u00a7 19-11-107(1), 1977 Colo. Sess. Laws at 1028. Ten years later, when the legislature repealed and reenacted the Colorado Children's Code, this provision was relocated to section 19-3-607, altering only the section reference to the new section 19-3-610. Ch. 138, sec. 1, \u00a7 19-3-607(1),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1987%20Colo.%20Sess.%20Laws%20790\">\n    1987 Colo. Sess. Laws 790\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The provision has since been substantively amended only once, when the legislature transferred the budgetary review and approval of the expert's fees and costs from the court to the office of the respondent parents' counsel. Ch. 216, sec. 1, \u00a7 19-3-607(1),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20Colo.%20Sess.%20Laws%20830\">\n    2016 Colo. Sess.

In\n   <em>\n    D.A.S.\n   </em>\n   , the supreme court held that the attorney-client privilege did not attach to the testimony and report of an expert who conducted a parent-child interactional assessment.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10350480\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/863/291/#p295\">\n    863 P.2d at 295-96\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In distinguishing\n   <em>\n    B.B.\n   </em>\n   , the court focused on several factors, including that (1) much of the expert's testimony concerned his observations of the children, not the parent's statements; (2) the parent's attorney knew, before the expert's appointment, that the expert would likely conduct the parent-child interactional evaluation; (3) there was no request to forego the evaluation; (4) the children participated in the evaluation of the parent and themselves; (5) the children's participation was not necessary to make the evaluation possible; and (6) the expert's report had been given to opposing counsel before trial.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10350480\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/863/291/#p295\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10350480\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/863/291/#p295\">\n    at 296\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   4. Application\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b614 The facts of this case are far more similar to those in\n   <em>\n    D.A.S.\n   </em>\n   than to those in\n   <em>\n    B.B.\n   </em>\n   Mother hired an expert in child psychology to evaluate her parenting ability through a parent-child interactional evaluation. After reviewing the expert's report, mother decided not to call him as a witness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b615 However, the GAL moved to compel disclosure of the expert's report. The juvenile court found that\n   <em>\n    D.A.S\n   </em>\n   . was dispositive of the issue and granted the motion. At the termination hearing, the juvenile court admitted the expert's report and testimony over mother's objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b616 With regard to the parent-child interactional evaluation, much of the expert's testimony concerned his observations of the children and, thus, did not fall within the\n   scope of the privilege.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10350480\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/863/291/#p295\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10350480\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/863/291/#p295\">\n    at 294\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (attorney-client privilege protects communications between parent and expert, not expert's observations and conclusions regarding children). In addition, the expert testified regarding the clinical interview he conducted with mother. However, he testified that this interview was integral to the parent-child interactional evaluation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b617 Mother's attorney requested the evaluation of mother's parenting skills and asked that the children participate. Thus, mother's attorney knew the expert would conduct the evaluation, desired it to occur, and requested the children's participation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b618 True, the expert's report was not disclosed to opposing counsel until the court granted the GAL's request to do so. This fact is different than\n   <em>\n    D.A.S.\n   </em>\n   , where it appears the expert himself provided a copy of his report to all counsel. However, under the statute in effect at the time, the GAL in\n   <em>\n    D.A.S.\n   </em>\n   was likely entitled to the report without having to request it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b619 Finally, and in our view most significantly, the expert advised mother, both orally and in writing, that the evaluation and interview would not be considered confidential and were being conducted to inform the juvenile court with respect to the dependency and neglect proceeding. Thus, mother had no expectation of privacy in the results of the evaluation or the clinical interview.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lanari\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10358899\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/827/495/#p499\">\n    827 P.2d at 499\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Indeed, even\n   <em>\n    B.B.\n   </em>\n   acknowledged that the privilege only attaches to confidential communications.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10382181\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/785/132/#p138\">\n    785 P.2d at 139\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b620 Mother urges us to follow the reasoning of the dissent in\n   <em>\n    D.A.S.\n   </em>\n   We, of course, cannot do so, as we are bound by the supreme court's majority opinion.\n   <em>\n    In re Estate of Ramstetter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20COA%2081\">\n    2016 COA 81\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 40,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12564909\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/411/1043/\">\n    411 P.3d 1043\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b621 Mother also argues that the law has changed since the decision in\n   <em>\n    D.A.S.\n   </em>\n   But as noted, the only statutory change that has occurred is the shift in responsibility for the approval of experts to the office of the respondent parents' counsel. In other words, a parent is now able to retain an expert without a court order. One (perhaps unintended) result of this change is that fewer expert reports will be court-ordered, and therefore fewer will automatically be subject to disclosure under section 19-3-607(2), C.R.S. 2018. Nevertheless, because the juvenile court did not order disclosure pursuant to section 19-3-607(2), this statutory change does not alter our analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b622 Thus, we conclude that the juvenile court did not violate mother's attorney-client privilege when it required disclosure of the expert's report and admitted the report and the expert's testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   B.

Mother Did Not Successfully Comply with Her Treatment Plan\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b625 As an initial matter, we reject mother's contention that the lack of reasonable efforts by the Division rendered her treatment plan inappropriate. Mother's argument conflates two distinct issues: (1) the\n   appropriateness of the treatment plan and (2) whether the Department made reasonable efforts to rehabilitate the parent. Before a court may terminate a parent-child relationship, it must find that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   (1) the parent has not reasonably complied with an appropriate treatment plan, the plan has been unsuccessful, or the court had previously found that an appropriate plan could not be devised; (2) the parent is unfit; and (3) the parent's conduct or condition is unlikely to change within a reasonable time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <em>\n    People in Interest of L.M.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20CO%2034\">\n    2018 CO 34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 27,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12567099\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/416/875/\">\n    416 P.3d 875\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b626 \"In determining unfitness, conduct, or condition,\" the juvenile court must also consider whether the Division made reasonable efforts to rehabilitate mother. \u00a7 19-3-604(2)(h). But the question of reasonable efforts is not related to the appropriateness of the treatment plan. Instead, the appropriateness of a treatment plan is measured in light of facts existing at the time of the plan's approval.\n   <em>\n    People in Interest of B.C.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8903490\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/122/1067/#p1071\">\n    122 P.3d 1067\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1071 (Colo.

The child psychologist testified that mother struggled to manage the children and they did not see her as having authority. The caseworker testified that mother had not progressed beyond therapeutic visits when she visited all four children together, and still had supervised visitation when she visited with the two boys or the two girls separately. The caseworker was concerned that the children would regress if they returned to mother's care at that time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b632 Thus, the record supports the juvenile court's finding that mother's treatment plan\n   was not successful because she continued to exhibit the same problems addressed in the treatment plan without adequate improvement.

He opined that a parent's history and ability to respond to intervention over time were the best predictors of the parent's future behavior. He observed that, despite considerable intervention, mother still did not recognize her parenting deficits. Thus, the psychologist concluded that it would be very difficult for mother to make substantive changes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b636 The caseworker testified that mother needed at least an additional six months of therapy. In addition, the caseworker saw a significant protection concern in mother's ongoing, covert contact with father despite having completed a treatment plan in a prior dependency and neglect case that required her commitment to keep father away from the children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b637 The juvenile court found that, although mother had made genuine efforts, she did not understand the danger father posed to the children or the effects of domestic violence on the children. The court found that mother would need a lot more therapy before it would be safe to return the children to her.

As we discussed above in relation to mother's preservation, we again need not\n   decide whether father preserved this claim because even if we assume he did, we discern no error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b642 Father asserts that (1) the only component of his treatment plan with which he was not in compliance was visitation; (2) he could not comply with the visitation provisions due to a criminal protection order; (3) the GAL had fought his attempts to modify the protection order; (4) a hearing on the protection order was set for two weeks after the termination hearing; and (5) thus, it was possible he would soon be able to begin visitation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \u00b643 But evidence at the termination hearing contradicted father's assertion that visitation could begin almost immediately and was the only barrier to successful completion of his treatment plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   \u00b644 Father testified that he had no idea how each of the boys had sustained injuries that included fractured bones. He did not believe the children were afraid of him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   \u00b645 In contrast, the boys' therapist testified that the boy who had suffered two fractured femurs reported that father had squeezed his leg and twisted it, which hurt a lot. He said that father hurt him and locked him in his room. The therapist said both boys talked about father spanking them, hurting them, and being mean. She testified that both boys had post-traumatic stress disorder and were hypervigilant and fearful.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   \u00b646 The elder girl's therapist testified that the girl described witnessing ongoing domestic violence between her parents. The girl reported that father hit her and her brothers, and that it was scary when mother and father fought. The therapist had diagnosed the girl with post-traumatic stress disorder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   \u00b647 The caseworker testified that the children's therapists had recommended against beginning visitation with father due to the children's continued disclosure of physical abuse and their fear of him. She also testified that father had completed only four to six sessions of dialectical behavioral therapy out of twenty-six. He had made very little progress on his treatment plan. He had not taken ownership or acceptance of his negative impact on the children when they were in his care. The caseworker opined that it was not in the children's best interests to maintain a relationship with father.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \u00b648 Thus, we conclude that the record supports the juvenile court's decision to terminate father's parental rights without affording him additional time to comply with his treatment plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   D.

The children had no relationship with father, whom they had not seen in over a year. And there was no evidence of a healthy attachment bond between mother and the children, who did not see mother as a caregiver or someone who would keep them safe. The court found that the children needed to know that they were in a permanent home and their father could not get to them. Testimony by the caseworker and the psychologist supports these findings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   \u00b653 Other evidence at the termination hearing supported the juvenile court's finding that mother would likely violate the conditions of an APR by allowing father to have contact with the children. The caseworker testified that mother had been diagnosed with a dependent personality disorder, which led her to stay in unhealthy relationships to avoid being alone. Mother testified that, despite the protection order in place after the prior dependency and neglect proceeding, she had habitually called father to help with the boys when she became frustrated because they behaved better when he was there.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   \u00b654 The grandfather testified he did not trust mother to keep father away from the children.
