To establish adequate cause, the moving party must submit an affidavit with specific facts that establish new or previously unknown facts that a substantial change has occurred in the circumstances of the child or the nonmoving party and evidence sufficient to establish each fact the moving party must prove to modify the parenting plan. The court must also weigh and consider a number of other factors on a case-by-case basis. We reject the argument that the trial court used an improper legal standard in determining adequate cause. But because we conclude the court abused its discretion in finding the\n   affidavits and evidence presented did not establish adequate cause to schedule a hearing on the petition to modify the parenting plan, we reverse and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2 Catherine and Travis MacLaren are the parents of H.M. and O.M.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On May 14, 2012, the court entered a final\n   parenting plan. The parenting plan imposed no restrictions and designated Catherine as the residential parent for four-year-old H.M. and two-year-old O.M. The parenting plan gives Travis residential time with the children the first three weekends of every month. The parents alternate holidays and each have 14 days of vacation with the children each year. The parenting plan states Catherine and Travis shall engage in joint decision-making on major decisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 On November 6, 2017, Travis filed a petition to modify the parenting plan under RCW 26.09.260(1) and (2)(c). \"I ask the court to make a major change in the parenting schedule or to change the person the child lives with most of the time.\" Travis alleged a substantial change in circumstances and the \"current living situation is harmful to [the children's] physical, mental or emotional health. It would be better for the children to change the parenting/custody order.\" Travis states, \"To protect the children, I ask the court to limit the other parent's parenting time and participation\" in decision-making. Travis asked the court to appoint a guardian ad litem to \"investigate, report, and make recommendations\" regarding the best interests of 10-year-old H.M. and 8-year-old O.M.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 Travis submitted a declaration and medical and school records in support of the petition to modify the parenting plan, including an April 2017 report prepared by the International Center for Autism and Neurodevelopment (ICAN) that diagnoses H.M. with autism, Seattle Children's Hospital medical records, and a June 17, 2017 \"Mental Health Evaluation and Safety Plan.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5 In 2009, two-year-old H.M. was diagnosed with \"Developmental Delay (Adaptive Communication-Speech Language).\" In 2017, H.M. was diagnosed with \"Moderate Severity Autism (a 5 on a scale of 1-10), combined with Childhood-Onset Anxiety Disorder, and ADHD.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6 Travis attached school records that show he alleged H.M.'s \"symptoms have worsened\" while in school and \"cause him much suffering.\" The declaration includes the following chronology from school records:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   \u2022 In 2013 (6 years old): worsening perseveration - now disruptive to class; report card shows \"AR\" (at risk for failing) in Reading, Language Arts and Math.

Catherine argued there are \"no substantial changes in circumstances in the children or myself ... to warrant a modification of the existing parenting plan.\" Catherine disputed the allegations but does not dispute that she disagrees with the autism diagnosis. Catherine submitted declarations from friends, colleagues, and family members attesting to her parenting skills; a letter from H.M.'s former counselor Kelsey Ozment; hearing and speech-language assessments of H.M.; and school records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   \u00b6 29 In her declaration, Catherine states she has \"not seen the level of symptomology that Travis describes\" and has \"not seen a worsening of behaviors.\" Catherine states H.M. was diagnosed with \"Expressive and Receptive Language Disorder.\" According to Catherine, the speech and language pathologist said she had no \"other concerns with [H.M.], specifically Autism.\" Catherine asserts she has \"actively addressed [H.M.]'s\n   symptoms and followed up with recommendations of professionals.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   \u00b6 30 Catherine presented an evaluation from Western Washington University for \"Auditory Processing.\" The April 2017 evaluation states hearing loss \"is not likely a factor in [H.M.]'s struggle with comprehending speech or processing auditory information.\" The report states, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   Abnormal and/or borderline results on subtests for the SCAN-C [test for auditory processing disorder ] are not exhaustive in defining the presence of an auditory processing disorder, but rather suggest that an auditory processing disorder may be present and help to guide selections of further testing that will help in diagnosis and remediation of an auditory processing disorder.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   \u00b6 31 Western Washington University evaluated H.M. again seven months later. The December 2017 evaluation reiterates hearing loss is \"not a factor in [H.M.]'s reported difficulty in processing auditory signals.\" The evaluation states H.M.'s \"ability to perform the associated behavioral tasks as directed ... suggest no physiological functional deviations as the basis for his reported auditory difficulties.\"\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   Initial basic comprehensive hearing assessment on 4/28/2017 found the peripheral auditory system, from the outer ear to the inner ear, to be functioning normally with hearing sensitivity established well within normal hearing levels in both ears. Initial hearing evaluation also ruled out the likelihood of a retro-cochlear pathology. Significant and permanent hearing loss is therefore not a factor in [H.M.]'s reported difficulty in processing auditory signals.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   In summary, various behavioral measures suggest the presence of deficits in auditory decoding, auditory short-term memory, temporal processing, as well as binaural integration capabilities. Deficits in these auditory processes may make it difficult for [H.M.] to comprehend auditory stimuli presented in less than ideal listening scenarios, presented by less than ideal speakers, or that which is more complicated and therefore requires more concentrated effort for full comprehension. It is not uncommon for individuals with auditory decoding and tolerance fading memory problems to also have associated reading, writing, receptive language, and expressive language issues, which is demonstrated currently in [H.M.]'s performance in school and outside of school scenarios. APD test results are consistent with speech-language pathologist's diagnosis\n   of expressive and receptive language disorders as well as mother and teacher's observations. However, while the current auditory processing test results support the presence of an auditory processing disorder, the influence of previously diagnosed receptive and expressive language delays must be considered as many behavioral APD tests are heavily reliant on language capabilities.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   \u00b6 32 Catherine submitted an April 2017 \"Notice\" from the school. Catherine alleged the school reviewed the ICAN report and is \"refusing\" to \"initiate\" a \"reevaluation\" of H.M.'s eligibility in special education services because H.M. already \"qualifies\" for several services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   \u00b6 33 The Notice states the school will use the ICAN report to update H.M.'s IEP \"based on new information from this outside evaluation.\"\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   The IEP team determined that changing [H.M.]'s eligibility category would not change his services at this time. [H.M.] qualifies in the areas of communication, reading comprehension, written language, math, and social emotional and it has been determined by the team that his current needs are being met through his IEP. A new IEP will be written by 05/13/2017 and again will meet [H.M.]'s needs in the areas identified. Accommodations in the new IEP were updated based ... on new information from this outside evaluation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   \u00b6 34 Catherine insisted H.M.'s \"reports of 'suicidal ideation' \" reflect statements his half-brother makes. Catherine asserts that before Travis took H.M. to the emergency room (ER) at Children's Hospital, H.M. never expressed an intent to harm himself.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   [H.M.]'s older brother also has sensory issues. [H.M.] looks up to his brother and unfortunately has mirrored some of his behavior. When my eldest son has become overly stimulated, he has stated that he wants to die. In response, [H.M.] started to mirror those comments when he became over stimulated as well. Though [H.M.]'s reports of 'suicidal ideation' w[ ]ere mirrored statements of his brother, I never took [H.M.]'s expressions lightly. I always addressed the situation with a\n   discussion regarding the gravity of what [H.M.] said, discussed whether [H.M.] had an intension to follow through with his statements and whether or not [H.M.] had a plan or access to carry out statements.

Casey is \"professionally trained in the field of Autism through Children's Hospital.\" Casey states Catherine asked her to provide a second opinion of the \"very thorough\" ICAN autism diagnosis. Casey states the ICAN report meets \"all the markers for Autism\" and \"confirmed\" the autism diagnosis. Casey states Catherine's \"denial\" is causing H.M. to experience \"more tension and confusion.\"\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n   [Catherine] ... deni[ed] that [H.M.] has Autism. She stated she wanted a second\n   opinion from me. I explained my qualifications and further explained the model I used as thoroughly as I was able.

The Autism diagnosis was confirmed for [Catherine], with a full explanation of the symptoms and markers present to confirm the diagnosis. ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   [Catherine] continued to argue against the diagnosis, services and treatment recommended for [H.M.]. ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n   .... It is very unfortunate that [H.M.]'s mother would not allow any discussion of Autism, nor allow [H.M.] to continue in treatment. Many of the difficulties [H.M.] has been experiencing are a result of his Autism and can be effectively remediated through treatment. When addressing the bullying and suicide ideation, it was clear that [H.M.] needed tools and insight into understanding and adapting to his Autism. However, with [Catherine] in denial about Autism, this interferes with a healthy approach to supporting [H.M.] in developing these skills, and will cause more tension and confusion for [H.M.] in adapting to his limitations in the future.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   \u00b6 39 The court found Travis did not meet his burden to establish adequate cause to hold a hearing on the petition to modify the parenting plan.

If anything, I find these children are very much enveloped in lots of services and lots of medical professionals and mandatory reporters, and a great deal of, I guess, difference on what's necessary or what the formal diagnosis is, but I don't find any basis from those pleadings to say there aren't two sides to this story ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-140\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-141\">\n   ...

And I have multiple responsive declarations and materials from the responding side saying all of those issues are being addressed and that there is no grave danger,\n   there is no substantial change in circumstances.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-143\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-144\">\n   ...

The uncontroverted record also establishes that in June 2017, Children's Hospital diagnosed H.M. with suicidal ideation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   \u00b6 62 The record does not support the trial court finding that \"the professionals appear to be disagreeing\" about the autism diagnosis.

The ICAN neuropsychological evaluation diagnosed H.M. with autism spectrum disorder. H.M.'s pediatrician Dr. Wijaya stated the ICAN report is \"as thorough as one could get\" and that he has \"no reason to doubt its validity.\" Child mental health specialist Paula Casey also confirmed the autism diagnosis. The ICAN report, Dr. Wijaya, and Casey emphasized the critical importance of ensuring that H.M. receive services and support designed to address autism, including counseling. Dr. Wijaya noted the importance of \"ensur[in]g that [H.M.] receives ... appropriate treatment modalities.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   Casey states, \"It is very unfortunate that [H.M.]'s mother would not allow any discussion of Autism, nor allow [H.M.] to continue in treatment. Many of the difficulties [H.M.] has been experiencing are a result of his Autism and can be effectively remediated through treatment.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   \u00b6 64 Catherine submitted professional evaluations diagnosing H.M. with hearing and speech-language deficits, but these evaluations neither refute nor address the autism diagnosis. Catherine submitted the written Notice from the school district denying Travis' request to re-evaluate H.M.'s IEP eligibility category following the autism diagnosis. But the Notice states the school based the decision not to re-evaluate H.M. on the determination that he was already receiving autism-focused services, and the school agreed to update the IEP for H.M. with the ICAN report recommendations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   \u00b6 65 In addition to establishing facts that support finding a substantial change in circumstances, Travis also presented facts that would support finding the present environment is detrimental to the \"physical, mental, or emotional health\" of the children. RCW 26.09.260(2)(c). The uncontroverted record shows untreated autism and that H.M. expressed suicidal ideation. The record shows that Catherine acknowledges H.M. and his older half-brother require \"special attention\" and the older half-brother also frequently expresses thoughts about committing suicide. Nonetheless, Catherine insists her daughter O.M. does not need any emotional support or counseling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   \u00b6 66 We conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in ruling that Travis did not overcome his threshold burden to show adequate cause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   \u00b6 67 We conclude the trial court did not use an improper legal standard, but the court abused its discretion in finding there is not adequate cause to hold a hearing on the\n   petition to modify the parenting plan.
