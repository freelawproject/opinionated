Bellucci, the plaintiffs in an action for declaratory relief against the respondent Town of Los Altos Hills, an incorporated municipality, and the defendants, along with appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>lant Adobe Creek Properties, Inc., in an action commenced by that city\u2019s complaint for injunction, declaratory relief and abatement of zoning violations, have appealed, with their codefendant, from a judgment and decree made and entered following the stipulated consolidation and the trial of the two actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">In the first action the Belluccis sought (1) a declaration of the proper meaning and construction of the provisions of the defendant city\u2019s zoning ordinance which classified their use of their property as a nonconforming use subject to the prohibitions, limitations and conditions of the zoning ordinance; (2) a declaration that the zoning ordinance is unconstitutional and void in its application to their property (a) in that it has no reasonable relation to the public health, safety, morals, or general welfare, (b) in that it deprives them of their property without due process of law, (c) in that it is discriminatory, arbitrary and unreasonable, and (d) in that the amortization period which requires that all nonconforming uses shall be permanently discontinued not later than January 27, 1976, is arbitrarily and unreasonably short as applied to them; and (3) a permanent injunction restraining the city and the named members of the city council (as to whom the action was dismissed in the pretrial conference order) from enforcing the ordinance against the plaintiffs insofar as it purports to classify their use of their property as a nonconforming use.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">In the second action the city (which also purported to join the State of California as a party plaintiff) sought to enjoin eight designated uses<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of the property on the basis of the allegations of the first two causes of action in its complaint, which respectively alleged (1) that such uses are business operations and uses in violation of the city\u2019s zoning ordinances, the first of which was passed and adopted on January 28, 1956, and all of which zoned the property for single family residential use and prohibited such uses; and (2) that such uses are changes, enlargements, alterations and expansions of acknowledged nonconforming uses extant when the zoning was established, and as such violated the zoning ordinances. In a third cause of action the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>city sought an order and decree to abate the prohibited uses as a nuisance; and, in a fourth cause of action, for declaratory relief, it sought a declaration establishing and delineating the uses which predated and those which postdated the enactment of the provisions of the zoning ordinances.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\">The pretrial order sets forth in detail the contentions of the city, which filed a pretrial statement, and includes, as well as the issues raised by its complaint, its further contention that the. amortization period of 20 years for nonconforming uses is adequate, reasonable and constitutional and that the court should declare that the basic nonconforming use of the property for public picnic grounds which was in effect in 1956 must be discontinued on or before January 27, 1956. The Belluccis' several contentions that the zoning is generally unconstitutional were encompassed by the statement that there was an improper classification between profit and nonprofit recreational activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">Following trial and extensive briefing the court rendered its decision which was served upon the parties. No findings having been requested (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 232(h)) a judgment and decree was signed, filed and entered. The judgment declares: \u201c1. The Zoning Ordinances of the Town of Los Altos Hills, and without limitation but rather by way of more specific reference, the present Ordinance No. 78, in prohibiting the operation of recreational facihties on a profit-making basis while at the same time permitting the operation of recreational facilities on a non-profit basis pursuant to a Use Permit, in a residential zoning district, do not constitute a deprivation of property without due process of law nor do they deny equal protection of the laws, and the same are valid and constitutional as applied to the real property hereafter described and as applied to the defendants. [\u00b6] 2. The comprehensive zoning plan as set forth in the Zoning Ordinances of the Town of Los Altos Hills which eliminates virtually all commercial uses of property within the city does not constitute a denial of equal protection of the laws and the same are neither invalid nor unconstitutional as applied to the real property hereafter described and as applied to the defendants.\u201d A third paragraph upholds the amortization provision of the ordinance. A fourth paragraph lists nine uses being conducted on the property, commercial in nature, which the court found to be nonconforming uses not permitted by the regulations of the zoning ordinances, but permissible as nonconforming uses under the terms of the ordinance.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A fifth paragraph lists commercial uses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>which were not in existence at the effective date of the zoning ordinances.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court found that those uses were a prohibited extension of preexisting nonconforming uses. A sixth paragraph enjoins the appellants from causing, permitting or carrying on the property, the uses set forth in paragraph 5, or any uses, other than those set forth in paragraph 4, which are not permitted by the zoning ordinances. Paragraph seven orders the discontinuance of the uses set forth in paragraph 4 by January 27, 1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">Although appellants appealed from the whole of the judgment their sole contentions on appeal are (1) that the prohibition of the operation of recreational facilities on a profit making basis, while at the same time permitting the operation of similar facilities on a nonprofit basis, denies due process and equal protection of the laws; and (2) that a system of exclusionary zoning which eliminates all, or virtually all, commercial use of property within a particular city constitutes a denial of equal protection of the laws. In the absence of any attack on the other provisions of the judgment, it must be assumed that the court properly determined the scope of the permitted nonconforming uses, and properly upheld the provisions of the ordinance which provided for the discontinuance of such uses on the expiration of the 20-year period. (See <em>National Advertising Co. </em>v. <em>County of Monterey </em>(1970) 1 Cal.3d 875, 879, and 882-883 [83 Cal.Rptr. 577, 464 P.2d 33], Sullivan, J., dissenting on the facts [app. dism. (1970) 398 U.S. 946 (26 L.Ed.2d 286, 90 S.Ct. 1869)]; <em>Bohannan </em>v. <em>City of San Diego </em>(1973) 30 Cal App.3d 416, 425-426 [106 Cal.Rptr. 333]; <em>City of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>Gage </em>(1954) 127 Cal.App.2d 442, 454-461 [274 P.2d 34]; 1 Anderson, American Law of Zoning (1968) \u00a7\u00a7 6.64-6.70, p. 445 et seq.; 8A McQuillin, Municipal Corporations (3d rev. ed. 1965) \u00a7 25.190, pp. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>37-38; and 2 Yokley, Zoning Laws and Practice (3d ed. 1967) \u00a7 16-14, p. 282 et seq.)</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\">It is concluded that the zoning ordinances of the city do not deny equal protection of the laws because they eliminate virtually all commercial use of property within the city, and that they do not deny due process of law or equal protection of the laws because they prohibit use for commercial recreational facilities and permit use for nonprofit recreational facilities. The judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">The property which is the subject of this litigation was at one time a \u2022 family estate, consisting of some 90 acres of grounds on which the owners had constructed the original residence, swimming pools, guest houses, and a tennis court. The property had been converted to a commercial public picnic grounds called Adobe Creek Lodge long prior to the city\u2019s incorporation and first zoning ordinance. It was improved with an open-air dance pavillion, barbecue pits, picnic tables and a snack bar, and occasionally weddings and other private parties were catered there. It may be concluded that the property was devoted to the uses similar to those which the trial court permitted to continue as nonconforming uses existing at the time of the adoption of the zoning ordinances (see fn. 2 above).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">On January 27, 1956 the Town of Los Altos Hills was incorporated as a general law city. It is located in northwest Santa Clara County, southwesterly of the City of Palo Alto and directly west of the Town of Los Altos. The easterly portion is characterized by gently rolling hills. To the west the terrain becomes more precipitous but almost all of it is characterized by natural vegetative cover including many fine oak trees. At the time of incorporation it encompassed 5,325 acres, including on its southerly side the 90 acres owned by plaintiff\u2019s predecessor in title. This property fronts on the north of Moody Road which runs along Adobe Creek, and which in 1959 was designated as a collector road in the general circulation plan for the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">At the time of trial, September 29, 1970, the city\u2019s planning director testified that the city embraced eight and one-half square miles, and had a population of approximately 6,800. It is encircled by Palo Alto on almost three sides, northeast, north and west. On the east it is contiguous with Los Altos, and there is some unincorporated area on the east and to the south. The Cities of Sunnyvale and Mountain View lie east of Los Altos, and Cupertino is accessible to the south. A map indicates that the city is served by the Foothill Expressway which forms part of its northeasterly bound<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>ary, and that it is bisected by the Jun\u00edpero Serra Freeway which runs from northwest to southeast.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">Prior to incorporation the land holding had been in relatively large parcels which had been developed as country estates. With the coming of intensive urbanization to Santa Clara County those holdings were threatened with development patterns similar to those which were taking place in other parts of the area. It was recognized that the result would have been to destroy the pleasant rural character that existed, and the town was incorporated to protect the existing residents from those threats and to preserve its rural character. Accordingly the first ordinance adopted by the city, on January 28, 1956, was an emergency zoning ordinance which prohibited the use of land for other than for the purpose of a one-family dwelling, unless another use was approved by the city council, or such, planning commission as it might establish. The ordinance likewise prohibited, without such approval, any subdivision of land into parcels having less acreage or frontage requirements than was provided under county zoning provisions in effect at the time of incorporation. The ordinance recited in part, \u201c. . . it is . . essential that restrictions and regulation^ of an interim nature be adopted until time is had for a permanent plan to be worked out and to assure the orderly and harmonious development of the Town of Los Altos Hills, preserve its unique and distinctive character, protect the character and stability of all the area within the corporate limits of said City, assure sound, fair land use in general and otherwise to protect the public interest, health, comfort and convenience and effect the immediate preservation of the public peace, health and safety and welfare until the permanent plan is developed and an Ordinance based upon the report of the Planning Commission be prepared and adopted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">On July 6, 1959, effective 30 days'thereafter, the city council adopted a comprehensive zoning ordinance (Ordinance No. 44), which established, regulated and restricted the use of land, the use, location and height and bulk of buildings, and the area and dimensions of building sites, and further provided for the administration and enforcement of its provisions. The purpose of the ordinance was stated as follows: \u201c. . . This Zoning Ordinance is adopted to protect and guide the growth and expansion of the Town of Los Altos Hills in an orderly manner true to the rural residential character of the community; to provide for space deemed necessary to advance the welfare of the public in assuring adequate light, pure air, safety from conflagration and disaster; to promote the smooth flow of traffic, to provide adequate residential off-street parking facilities, and to solve other conditions arising from concentration of the population.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">This ordinance designated the entire city as a \u201cResidential Agricultural <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>District,\u201d and limited the unconditionally permitted uses and structures to \u201cPrimary Dwellings\u201d and \u201cAgriculture.\u201d Six accessory uses and structures were designated as permitted.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Twelve conditional uses and structures were recognized as permitted upon recommendation of the planning commission, and the approval of the city council and the issuance of a permit. These uses included nonprofit recreational facilities.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The ordinance further provided that existing nonconforming uses could not be changed, enlarged or altered except to a use permitted by the ordinance; that property so used would revest to conforming use on certain contingencies, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>for discontinuance of any nonconforming use in the event of actual discontinuance for 180 days, and in any event in 20 years.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">Thereafter, by resolution adopted December 7, 1959, the city adopted a general plan which recites in part with respect to the use of land: \u201c1. Los Altos Hills is a rural-residential community. ... [\u00b6] 4. Private recreation areas are provided for in the plan. This approach to filling the need for such services is to be encouraged.\u201d With regard to population density the plan states in part, \u201cIt is the policy of the Town of Los Altos Hills to limit population density within the Town to a maximum of one family per net acre on those portions of the Town suitable for such development.\u201d At that time plaintiffs\u2019 property was indicated on a map of the ultimate land use plan under the legend \u201cprivate park or club.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">On December 4, 1961, effective 30 days after its passage, the city adopted a new comprehensive zoning ordinance (Ordinance No. 78). The provisions of this ordinance, including its purpose, are substantially the same as those in the 1959 ordinance. It continues the entire city as a \u201cResidential-Agricultural District\u201d with uses restricted to \u201cPrimary Dwellings\u201d and \u201cAgriculture.\u201d The former are defined as follows: \u201cA building designated and/or customarily used as a residence by not more than one family, including all necessary domestic employees of such family needed for operation and maintenance of said dwelling.\u201d The six permitted accessory uses and structures (see fn. 4 above) were revised by the substitution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>of a provision for \u201cPrivate Stables\u201d for \u201cBams or Other Utility Buildings.\u201d The new provision states in part: \u201cIn other than agricultural uses, a maximum of two (2) hoofed animals per acre shall be permitted . . . .\u201d The conditional uses and structures (see fn. 5 above) were revised by the deletion of any reference to \u201cPrivate Stables\u201d and \u201cRecreational Clubs.\u201d An added section related to \u201cHouse Trailers\u201d as a conditional use, reads in part as follows: \u201cTrailers may not be used as primary or secondary dwellings. A temporary permit for use as a dwelling for not more than thirty (30) days in any calendar year may be issued by the City Clerk upon certification that the use pursuant thereto shall be by a bona fide non-paying guest, . . .\u201d With respect to nonconforming uses (see fn. 6 above) the new ordinance reenacted provisions substantially the same as those in the 1959 ordinance, with the exception that the date for discontinuance of all nonconforming uses was advanced from 20 years from the effective date of Ordinance No. 44 (August 5, 1979) to January 27, 1976.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">On November 4, 1963 the city council by resolution adopted amendments to the general plan entitled \u201cGeneral Plan, Revision of 1963.\u201d This, plan indicates that at that time out of 5,382,50 acres within the city, a tdtal of 996.29 were devoted to nonresidential uses, as follows: streets and highways 296.0, freeway 228.00, and \u201cSchools, Churches, etc.\u201d 472.29. With respect to the last category the report comments, \u201c. . . nonresidential uses [other than streets, highways, freeway and educational facilities], with the exception of the Adobe Creek Lodge, occupy relatively small sites and in the aggregate do not make up a significant percentage of this particular type of use.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">The plan reiterates the first three recitals quoted above from the 1959 plan with respect to land use. The recit\u00e1is conclude as follows: \u201c9. Since it is obvious that the 472.29 acres of land in nonresidential use (exclusive of streets and Jun\u00edpero Serra Freeway) within the. Town far exceeds all reasonable relationship to the service needs of the population both now and in the foreseeable future; and since this General Plan will be reviewed at three to five-year intervals; it is the policy of the Town to prohibit any further expansion of nonresidential land uses, except those required by law.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>Plaintiffs\u2019 property is again mapped under the legend for \u201cprivate park or club/\u2019 The plan also designates the unincorporated area lying southerly of the city, which is contiguous to the subject property on its westerly, southerly and part of its easterly boundary, as suitable for potential annexation.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">In 1966 in order to comply with the provisions of section 11546 of the Business and Professions Code which authorizes a governing body of a city or county to require a dedication of land, or the payment of fees for park or recreational purposes as a condition to the approval of a final subdivision map, the city caused to be prepared a recreation element of its general plan. This plan designates substantially all of the northern half of plaintiffs\u2019 property as \u201cPrivate Park.\u201d The plan shows two possible public park sites, neither of which involves plaintiffs\u2019 property, and it also suggests that in order to avoid maintenance and supervisory costs, park arrangements could be made with existing schools or neighboring governmental agencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">On September 3, 1968, the city adopted comprehensive amendments to the 1961 ordinance. The purposes were expanded to tie them in with the \u201cGeneral Plan\u201d and to add, among other purposes \u201cto preserve and enhance the natural beauty of the community.\u201d Two classes of districts were created, \u201c(1) R-A (Residential-Agricultural) [\u00b6] (2) OSR (Open Space Reserve).\u201d (Note, Gov. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 65910-65912, as added by Stats. 1970, ch. 1590, \u00a7 16, p. 3317.) According to a zoning map adopted with the ordinance, the only portion of the city included in the second category was a triangular parcel of five or ten acres adjacent to the Jun\u00edpero Serra Freeway. The following primary uses are permitted in Open Space Reserve Districts: \u201ca. Agricultural uses including horticulture and grazing, but excluding structures, [\u00b6] b. Forest preserves, [\u00b6] c. Other open space uses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">The sections relating to primary uses and accessory uses, and to conditional uses were renumbered without substantial change in text.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">On June 1,1970, the ordinance was amended to permit covenants as well as churches. \u201cConvent\u201d was defined as follows: \u201cA residence facility for participants in a religious order or organization; provided, however, that no money or other consideration is required to be paid by the residents to the proprietor.\u201d The number of residents was limited to 35 times the estimated maximum number of lots which would be permitted on the whole of the property devoted to the convent use.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-9\">The parcel involved was purchased by appellants Bellucci, Bellucci\u2019s brother and the latter\u2019s wife (see fn. 1 above) and two other persons in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>July 1961. Thereafter those appellants acquired the interests of their co-owners, and at the time of trial they were the sole owners of the property. Appellant Adobe Creek Properties, Inc. is a corporation, wholly' owned by the Belluccis. It conducts the business operations on the premises under an oral lease from the owners.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">The major portion of the trial was devoted to the production of evidence bearing upon the uses of the property as they existed in 1956, when the town was incorporated and the first zoning ordinance was adopted, and the uses of the property as operated by appellants from the time of their acquisition of the property up to and including the time of trial. Such latter evidence as bears upon the question of the validity of the alleged discrimination under the zoning ordinance, and other evidence bearing on related existing uses within the city is reviewed below (see part II below).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">The property owners claim that a system of exclusionary zoning which eliminates all, or virtually all, commercial use of property within a particular city constitutes a denial of equal protection of the laws. The question raised has. apparently not been resolved in this state, although there are some decisions which appear to have peripheral relationship to the issue. In <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>Barrett </em>(1938) 12 Cal.2d 244 [83 P.2d 29] the court upheld a judgment ordering the issuance of a building permit for a business structure on a parcel zoned for residential use because it was entirely surrounded by properties used for business, semi-business or public purposes (12 Cal.2d at pp. 250-252). The decision, however, rejected the theory that the zoning ordinance w\u00e1s generally invalid because it created a monopoly of ownership and use in that the existing business district in the area in which the parcel lay was completely occupied, and because the city should have provided a larger area for business purposes. The court stated, \u201cThe record, without conflict, shows that Piedmont is primarily a residential city. Its charter so declares. It is entirely surrounded by the city of Oakland in which are located many business houses which maintain frequent and adequate delivery service to all parts of Piedmont. The Grand Avenue Business District created by the challenged ordinance is not fully built up. The people of the city of Piedmont have shown a determined effort to keep their city a residential city. This they have the legal right, within constitutional limits, to do. The power to declare zoning ordinances unconstitutional only should be exercised where no substantial reason exists to support the determination of the city council. If the reasonableness of the ordinance is reasonably debatable the ordinance must be upheld. [Citation.]\u201d (I<em>d,, </em>at p. 249.) Whatever support the respondent city can find for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>the right to zone for exclusive residential use in that opinion is diluted by its reference to the fact that another business district within the city is not fully built up, and a subsequent statement \u201cThe fact that the Highland Business District is fully occupied does not invalidate the ordinance as long as another business zone not fully occupied exists\u201d <em>(id., </em>pp. 249-250), both of which indicate that some provision must be made for a business district. (See also <em>Willett &amp; Crane </em>v. <em>City of Palos etc. Estates </em>(1950) 96 Cal.App.2d 757, 763 [216 P.2d 85].)</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">Earlier it had been determined that when the municipality creates two districts one of which is to be devoted to residential uses and the other to business uses, it has made a legislative finding that the maintenance of both such districts is necessary to the public welfare, and that it therefore is the duty of the governing body when zoning the city to make adequate provision for both such uses. <em>(In re White </em>(1925) 195 Cal. 516, 520 [234 P. 396]; and see <em>Wickham </em>v. <em>Becker </em>(1929) 96 Cal.App. 443, 446-448 [274 P. 397].) These cases explain the <em>Reynolds\u2019 </em>court reference to the necessity of creating a business district. Here the general plans and zoning ordinances all indicated that a commercial district was unnecessary and unwanted.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">A further suggestion of similar tenor is found in <em>Biscay </em>v. <em>City of Burlingame </em>(1932) 127 Cal.App. 213 [15 P.2d 784]. There the issue was whether a garage erected in 1928 under a building permit for a private garage, but used for a public garage business, was a permitted nonconforming use under an ordinance adopted in 1929 which zoned the property as residential. The city relied upon prior ordinances which classified the property as residential in attempting to show that the business use was illegally created. The court reviewed the earlier ordinances, and, in the course of concluding that none of them operated to make the use of the property for business or trade purposes unlawful because they were neither general nor comprehensive (127 Cal.App. at pp. 216-219), observed: \u201cThe earlier ordinances arbitrarily established a residential district without regard to business which might be necessary in that district\u201d <em>(id., </em>p. 217), and \u201cThere is no indication found in the earlier ordinances of the City of Burlingame, upon which respondents are relying, that the city council, in passing those ordinances, had in mind anything other than an arbitrary setting aside of a very large part of the city for residential purposes without regard to the commercial and industrial needs of the community.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>p. 218.) In this case, however, there have been clear declarations of the uses which the governing body of the city has determined should be permitted within its territorial limits.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">Subsequent cases indicate that there is no necessity to provide a district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>for every type of use. In <em>Snow </em>v. <em>City of Garden Grove </em>(1961) 188 Cal.App.2d 496 [10 Cal.Rptr. 480], the court stated: \u201cIt is therefore well established that a city of the size and limited area of the city of Garden Grove is\" not obligated to make provision for the location and operation within its city limits of any and all known industries regardless of other considerations, provided its actions are not arbitrary, unreasonable or not done fraudulently and are done to insure maximum protection of the several conflicting private interests and minimum detriment to the community and to safeguard public health, safety, comfort and general welfare.\u201d (188 Cal.App.2d at p. 502. See also <em>Wood </em>v. <em>City Planning Commission </em>(1955) 130 Cal.App.2d 356, 364 [279 P.2d 95].)</p>\n<p id=\"b379-3\">The property owners refer to the provisions of the Government Code dealing with local planning. (Tit. 7, ch. 3, \u00a7 65100 et seq.) Section 65302 provides in part, \u201c. . . The plan shall include the following elements: [\u00b6] (a) A land use element which designates the proposed general distribution and general location and extent of the uses of the land for housing, business, industry, open space, including agriculture, natural resources, recreation, and enjoyment of scenic beauty, education, public buildings and grounds, solid and liquid waste disposal facilities, and other categories of public and private uses of land. . . .\u201d It is obvious that this is not a mandate to create sufficient districts so that each use named may be enjoyed within the territory embraced by any municipality. The following chapter (tit. 7, ch. 4, \u00a7 65800 et seq.) which deals with zoning regulations provides in section 65850: \u201cPursuant to the provisions of this chapter, the legislative body of any county or city by ordinance <em>may </em>[\u00b6] (a) Regulate the use of buildings, structures and land as between industry, business, residents, open space, including agriculture, recreation, enjoyment of scenic beauty and use of natural resources, and other purposes.\u201d Section 65851 reads, \u201cFor such purposes the legislative body <em>may </em>divide a county, a city, or portions thereof, into zones of the number, shape and area it deems best suited to carry out the purpose of this chapter.\u201d (Italics added in both sections.)</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">In some jurisdictions it has been held that enabling state legislation of similar tenor requires the local governing body to make provision for more than one basic use of the land under its control. (See <em>Gundersen </em>v. <em>Village of Bingham Farms </em>(1964) 372 Mich. 352, 354-357 [126 N.W.2d 715, 716-717]; <em>City of Moline Acres </em>v. <em>Heidbreder </em>(Mo. 1963) 367 S.W.2d 568, 572-575; and <em>Suburban Ready-Mix Corp. </em>v. <em>Village of Wheeling </em>(1962) 25 Ill.2d 548, 552 [185 N.E.2d 665, 667].) In the Missouri case, on which the Michigan court relied, the court observed: \u201cThe ordinary concept of \u2018zoning\u2019 is to \u2018mark off into zones ... to partition ... by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>ordinance into zones or sections reserved for different purposes . . . .\u2019 Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary.\u201d (367 S.W.2d at p. 572.) After reviewing other definitions it concluded, \u201cIn other words, a <em>\u2018zoning,\u2019 </em>in its ordinary sense, does not mean the creation of <em>one </em>district or zone of a town, an area, or the world in general (as, for instance, we have Torrid, Temperate and Artie Zones).\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 573.)</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">Seven years <em>after </em>its original decision the Missouri court recanted. In <em>McDermott </em>v. <em>Village of Calverton Park </em>(Mo. 1970) 454 S.W.2d 577, 581, the court concluded: \u201cWe have carefully re-examined Moline Acres and have concluded that it is not sound and should therefore no longer be followed.\u201d The court determined, that the statutes did not require multiple-use zoning, and that a one-use zoning ordinance could be upheld when it did, as it did in that case, promote health, safety, morals and the general welfare. The court embraced the views found in <em>Valley View Village </em>v. <em>Proffett </em>(6th Cir. 1955) 221 F.2d 412, 416-417 and <em>Connor </em>v. <em>Township of Chanhassen </em>(1957) 249 Minn. 205, 212-214 [81 N.W.2d 789, 795-796]. (See also <em>Jameson </em>v. <em>St. Tammany Parish Police Jury </em>(La.App. 1969) 225 So.2d 720, 723; <em>Town of Plainfield </em>v. <em>Hood </em>(1968) 108 N.H. 502, 506 [240 A.2d 60, 64]; <em>Duff con Concrete Products </em>v. <em>Borough of Cresskill </em>(1949) 1 <em>N.J. </em>509, 512-514 [64 A.2d 347, 349-350, 9 A.L.R.2d 678, 681]; and <em>Leary </em>v. <em>Adams </em>(1933) 226 Ala. 472, <em>477 </em>[147 So. 391, 395-396].) In <em>Valley View Village </em>v. <em>Proffett, supra, </em>the court found that the Ohio statute, as does the California statute, used the word \u201cmay.\u201d It construed that word as permissive and further noted that it is generally established that the regulation by a municipality of the use within its border is within the powers .of local government, specifically its police power (221 F.2d at p. 416).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">The case also sets forth reasons why an ordinance which places all the areas of a city in a residential district is not unconstitutional as a matter of law. The court stated, \u201cTraditional concepts of zoning envision a municipality as a self-contained community with its own residential, business and industrial areas. It is obvious that Valley View, Ohio, on the periphery of a large metropolitan center, is not such a self-contained community, but only an adventitious fragment of the economic and social whole. We cannot conclude as a matter of law that an ordinance which places all of the area of such a village into a residential district is <em>per se </em>arbitrary and unreasonable, with no substantial relation to the public health, safety, morals or general welfare. It would appear contrary to the very purposes of municipal planning to require a village such as Valley View to designate some of its area for business or industrial purposes without regard to the public need for business or industrial uses. The council of such a village should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>not be required to shut its eyes to the pattern of community life beyond the borders of the village itself. We think that it is not clearly arbitrary and unreasonable for a residential village to pass an ordinance preserving its residential character, so long as the business and industrial needs of its inhabitants are supplied by other accessible areas in the community at large.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-3\">\u201cSituations in which the legislative body of a municipality would even desire to put its entire area into but one use district are no doubt rare. Situations in which such an ordinance would withstand constitutional attack with respect to the impact upon particular property within the municipality are perhaps even rarer. We conclude only that, if otherwise permitted by the Constitution and statutes of the state, a one-use ordinance is not necessarily so arbitrary and unreasonable as in every case to be invalid.\u201d (221 F.2d at p. 418.

In Pennsylvania in <em>Bryan </em>v. <em>City of Chester </em>(1905) 212 Pa. 259 [61 A. 894] it was determined, before there was any statutory authority for zoning (see <em>Norate Corporation </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Adjustment </em>(1965) 417 Pa. 397, 406, fn. 9 [207 A.2d 890, 895, fn. 9], that the power to regulate billboards was limited as follows: \u201c \u2018. . . a secure structure, which is not an infringement upon the public safety, and is not a nuisance, cannot be made one by legislative fiat, and then prohibited. [Citations.]\u2019 \u201d (212 Pa. at p. 262 [61 A. at p. 895, quoting from <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>City of Topeka, </em>51 Kan. 756 [33 P. 476].) Sixty years later the court looked backward and concluded, \u201cGranted that our courts now look with more liberality upon a municipality\u2019s police power as to sign advertising than when <em>Bryan </em>was decided, the rationale of <em>Bryan </em>is apposite in determining the validity of the instant ordinance which places a blanket prohibition on all \u2018off-site\u2019 sign advertising in the entire municipality. Such an ordinance is too general, too broad and unreasonable, [\u00b6] In our view, the instant ordinance does not attempt to regulate but to prohibit and the prohibition, without any regard for the districts set up under the Zoning Ordinance, extends throughout the Township to all \u2018off-site\u2019 sign advertising. Such ordinance is patently unreasonable and invalid.\u201d <em>(Norate Corporation </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Adjustment, supra, </em>417 Pa. at p. 407 [207 A.2d at p. 895], fns. omitted. See also <em>In re Appeal of Ammon R. Smith Auto Co. </em>(1966) 423 Pa. 493, 495-497 [223 A.2d 683, 684-685].)</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">Subsequently in <em>National Land and Investment Company </em>v. <em>Kohn </em>(1965) 419 Pa. 504 [215 A.2d 597], the court struck down a zoning ordinance which purported to create a four-acre minimum building site in about 30 percent of the area of the township. The court brushed aside the legislative body\u2019s contentions respecting pollution of water from sewage by increased density, inadequacy of township roads to accommodate more intense development, problems of fire protection, preservation of the \u201ccharacter\u201d of the area through creation of a greenbelt, provision of a proper setting for historic sites and architecturally and historically interesting old homes and retention of the rural character of the area. In so doing it observed, \u201cZoning is a tool in the hands of governmental bodies which enables them to more effectively meet the demands of evolving and growing communities. It must not and can not be used by those officials as an instrument by which they may shirk their responsibilities. Zoning is a means by which a governmental body can plan for the future\u2014it may not be used as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>a means to deny the future. . . . Zoning provisions may not be used, however, to avoid the increased, responsibilities and economic burdens which time and natural growth invariably bring, [\u00b6] It is not difficult to envision the tremendous hardship, as well as the chaotic conditions, which would result if all the townships in this area decided to deny to a growing population sites for residential development within the means of at least a significant segment of the people.\u201d (419 Pa. at pp. 527-528 [215 A.2d at p. 610], fns. omitted. See also <em>Appeal of Girsh </em>(1970) 437 Pa. 237, 243-244 [263 A.2d 395, 398].)</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">The court concluded, \u201cFour acre zoning represents Easttown\u2019s position that it does not desire to accommodate those who are pressing for admittance to the township unless such admittance will not create any additional burdens upon governmental functions and services. The question posed is whether the township can stand in the way of the natural forces which send our growing population into hitherto undeveloped areas in search of a comfortable place to live. We have concluded not. A zoning ordinance whose primary purpose is to prevent the entrance of newcomers in order to avoid future burdens, economic and otherwise, upon the administration of public services and facilities can not be held valid.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 532 <em>[id., </em>at p. 612], See also <em>Appeal of Girsk, supra, </em>437 Pa. at p. 242 [263 A.2d at p. 397].)</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">In <em>Exton Quarries, Inc. </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Adjustment </em>(1967) 425 Pa. 43 [228 A.2d 169] the same court struck down a township-wide prohibition of quarrying, after similarly substituting its judgment of the evils to be prohibited for that of the body which adopted the zoning ordinance. The court observed, \u201cThe constitutionality of zoning ordinances which totally prohibit legitimate businesses such as quarrying from an entire community should be regarded with particular circumspection; for unlike the constitutionality of most restrictions on property rights imposed by other ordinances, the constitutionality of total prohibitions of legitimate businesses cannot be premised on the fundamental reasonableness of allocating to each type of activity a particular location in the community. We believe this is true despite the possible existence outside the municipality of sites on which the prohibited activity may be conducted, since it is more probable than not that, as the operator of the prohibited business is forced to move further from the property he owns, his economic disadvantage will increase to the point of deprivation. Moreover, if one municipality may, with only moderate justification, totally prohibit an undesired use of land, it is not unlikely that surrounding municipalities will do the same\u2014thus increasing the distance to an alternative site and the concomitant economic disadvantage. Thus the possible availability of alternative sites somewhere out<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>side the municipality on which the totally banned business may be conducted does not make permissible the deprivation within the township of property rights imposed by a municipality-wide ban of a particular kind of business. For these reasons, we believe that a zoning ordinance which totally excludes a particular business from an entire municipality must bear a more substantial relationship to the public health, safety, morals and general welfare than an ordinance which merely confines that business to a certain area in the municipality.\u201d (425 Pa. at pp. 59-60 [228 A.2d at p. 179]. See also <em>Appeal of Girsh, supra, </em>437 Pa. at pp. 242-243 [263 A.2d at pp. 397-398].)</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">In <em>Appeal of Girsh, supra, </em>four justices of a seven-man court applied the quoted principles to strike down the provisions of a zoning ordinance which failed to provide for the construction of apartments except as they might be allowed under a variance procedure. The majority observed, \u201cStatistics indicate that people are attempting to move away from the urban core areas, relieving the grossly over-crowded conditions that exist in most of our major cities. Figures show that most jobs that are being created in urban areas, including the one here in question, are in the suburbs. New York Times, June 29, 1969, p. 39 (City Edition). Thus the suburbs, which at one time were merely \u2018bedrooms\u2019 for those who worked in the urban core, are now becoming active business areas in their own right. It follows then that formerly \u2018outlying,\u2019 somewhat rural communities, are becoming logical areas for development and population growth\u2014in a sense, suburbs to the suburbs. With improvements in regional transportation systems, these areas also are now more accessible to the central city.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">\u201cIn light of this, Nether Providence Township may not permissibly choose to only take as many people as can live in single-family housing, in effect freezing the population at near present levels. Obviously if every municipality took that view, population spread would be completely frustrated. Municipal services must be provided <em>somewhere, </em>and if Nether Providence is a logical place for development to take place, it should not be heard to say that it will not bear its rightful part of the burden.\u201d (437 Pa. at pp. 244-245 [263 A.2d at pp. 398-399].) They concluded, \u201cApartment living is a fact of life that communities like Nether Providence must learn to accept. If Nether Providence is located so that it is a place where apartment living is in demand, it must provide for apartments in its plan for future growth; it cannot be allowed to close its doors to others seeking a \u2018comfortable place to live.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id., </em>p. 246 <em>[id., </em>p. 399].)</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">In <em>Town of Hobart </em>v. <em>Collier </em>(1958) 3 Wis.2d 182 [87 N.W.2d 868] the opinion states: \u201cFrom the evidence in this case only one conclusion may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>drawn. The boundaries of the town are not the proper boundaries for the creation of a residential district; this is admitted by the town itself. Under these circumstances, clearly it was an abuse of discretion to so establish them.\u201d (3 Wis.2d at p. 191 [87 N.W.2d at p. 873].) The dissent, however, points out, \u201cAs we interpret the majority opinion, a zoning ordinance which creates a single use district is only unconstitutional if there are lands situated therein which are unfitted for any of the uses permitted under the ordinance.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 192 <em>[id., </em>at p. 873].)</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">A similar thought has been expressed, but not applied, in <em>Southern Alameda Span. Sp. Org. </em>v. <em>City of Union City, Cal. </em>(9th Cir. 1970) 424 F.2d 291 where the court, in determining a procedural question with reference to an injunction sought to restrain alleged discrimination in proceedings for public housing, observed: \u201cSurely, if the environmental benefits of land use planning are to be enjoyed by a city and the quality of life of its residents is accordingly to be improved, the poor cannot be excluded from enjoyment of the benefits. Given the recognized importance of equal opportunities in housing, it may well be, as matter of law, that it is the responsibility of a city and its planning officials to see that the city\u2019s plan as initiated or as it develops accommodates the needs of its low-income families, who usually\u2014if not always\u2014are members of minority groups.\u201d (424 F.2d at pp. 295-296. See also <em>Oakwood at Madison, Inc. </em>v. <em>Township of Madison </em>(1971) 117 N.J.Super. 11, 20 [283 A.2d 353, 358].)</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">The principles expressed in the foregoing cases may not be lightly set aside. There is increasing concern that exclusionary zoning by proliferating small suburban communities is not in the public welfare. (See Roberts, <em>Demise of Property Law </em>(1971) 57 Cornell L.Rev. 1, 6-29; <em>Symposium Exclusionary Zoning </em>(1971) 22 Syracuse L.Rev., particularly Anderson, <em>Introduction </em>465, at p. 467; Williams &amp; Norman, <em>Exclusionary Land Use Controls </em>475, 498-503; Davidoff &amp; Davidoff, <em>Opening the Suburbs </em>509, 509-512; and Comment, <em>A Survey of the Judicial Responses to Exclusionary Zoning, </em>537, 562-582; Sager, <em>Exclusionary Zoning </em>(1969) 21 Stan.L.Rev. 767, 780-800; and Frieden, <em>Legal Role in Urban Development </em>(1965) 12 U.C.L.A. L.Rev. 856, 861.)</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">Whatever merit there may be for breaking down the exclusionary practices in order to enable the less affluent, including racial minorities, to find a home out of the city, this case does not appear to be the vehicle for pursuing such theories.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The appellants seek to preserve what is a commercial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>place of amusement against the claims of their neighbors for a domestic life free from the distractions'and problems. attendant to a commercial development. There is no evidence to show that the county or regional situation is such that no recreational areas will be available unless Adobe Creek Properties, Inc. is permitted to continue operations. There is no showing as to whether the customers of the picnic grounds are poor or affluent, or whether there are other locations outside of the city where the proprietors may operate a similar enterprise, and its customers may obtain similar amusement.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">Under these circumstances the findings of the city council in its zoning ordinances and adopted plans and established principles of zoning sustain the exclusionary provisions of the ordinance insofar as they prohibit commercial development of recreational areas. \u201cIt is well settled that zoning ordinances, when reasonable in object and not arbitrary in operation, constitute a justifiable exercise of police power, and that the establishment, as part of a comprehensive and systematic plan, of districts devoted to strictly private residences or single family dwellings, from which are excluded business or multiple dwelling structures, is a legitimate exercise of the police power. [Citations.] . . . [\u00b6] Every intendment is in favor of the validity of the exercise of police power, and, even though a court might differ from the determination of the legislative body, if there is a reasonable basis for the belief that the establishment of a strictly residential district has substantial relation to the public health, safety, morals or general welfare, the zoning measure will be deemed to be within the purview of the police power.

The paeans of praise for the single family residence uttered by Mr. Justice Lennon (himself a judge from the rural suburban County of Marin), in <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Board of Public Works, </em>should be required reading for any real estate subdivision salesman. (See 195 Cal. at pp. 492-493.)</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">In the attacks on exclusionary zoning it is pointed out that the greatest evil is that each suburban community is providing for its own public health, safety, morals and welfare, and as a result the general welfare of the community or region as a whole suffers socially, economically and politically. Nevertheless, from all that appears in this case any general, regional or community plan might itself well have determined that the area now embraced in respondent city should have been zoned as it has been zoned, and that the use of appellants\u2019 land for commercial recreational use should have been phased out. A city merely may have embraced zoning which was created prior to its incorporation as part of regional plans. It should not be criticized because it retained the limited uses permitted by that zoning to the exclusion of others.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">It is therefore concluded that on this record the exclusive features of the city\u2019s zoning ordinance do not render it subject to successful attack by the appellants who seek to perpetuate their commercial recreational use.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">The owners and operators of the picnic area contend that the enforce-ment of the ordinances against them denies them equal protection of the law because uses similar to those engaged in on their property are permitted on a nonprofit basis. The'original interim ordinance (1956) did not expressly permit any use other than for agriculture or for a one-family dwelling. The first comprehensive ordinance (1959) expressly permitted private swimming pools, bams and stables (fn. 4 above), and it also authorized the issuance of a use permit for \u201cRecreational Facilities. Recreational or community center buildings, ground for sports, except those customarily carried on for profit,\u201d and recognized the existence of recreational membership clubs operated by a nonprofit organization (fn. 5 above). The 1961 ordinance continued the provision for \u201cRecreational Facilities\u201d and the definition of \u201cClubs, Recreational,\u201d but deleted the reference to the parking limitation at \u201cRecreational Clubs.\u201d Similar provisions were continued in the 1970 revision.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">At the trial it was brought out that neither the Los Altos Hills Country Club nor its predecessor, the Adobe Creek Lodge and Country Club (see fn. 2 above) was a member-owned club, that the members acquired no proprietary interest but merely a license to use the facilities. Although an advisory board was created in 1962, it was discontinued in 1967. The club, started in late 1961, had a membership of about 250 families at the end of 1962. The membership remained at about 250 for several years. The sale of memberships has been promoted by newspaper, radio and television advertising, by telephone solicitation, and by salesmen, as many as six at one time, out selling memberships on a commission basis. About 1967 a membership director was hired, and about 800 or 1,000 memberships were sold in 1968. At the time of trial, October 1970, the club had about 800 members. Special initiation fee rates have been offered to those living at a great distance from the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">Testimony indicated that when the grounds were used for a company picnic, or for some widely advertised supper party, there was very heavy traffic on the roads leading to the premises. On a busy Saturday as many as 4,000 people have been on the property in various groups using different facilities of, what the oper\u00e1tor described as, \u201ca complete operational recreational park\u201d (see fns. 2 and 3 above). As many as 5,000 or 6,000 can be accommodated if the whole facility is rented.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">The evidence concerning other uses within the city limits indicate that there were some parcels on which there were more than one dwelling unit. (Apparently two dwellings are permitted on parcels of 1.99 acres or more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>or, if an established nonconforming use, on a smaller parcel.) It was not determined whether <em>or </em>not such extra dwellings were customarily used for commercial rentals. It was established that there were several private schools in the city, one of which was an established nonconforming use. Although there is no \u201cnonprofit\u201d restriction on such an enterprise it was not determined whether the existing schools were operated for profit, or, as is usually the case, nonprofit. The \u201cTown Planner\u201d acknowledged that the commercial boarding of horses was being carried out on land within the city and that it was permitted by the city as an agricultural use. (See fn. 4 and cf. <em>Wint </em>v. <em>Fidelity &amp; Casualty Co. </em>(1973) 9 Cal.3d 257, 262-263 [107 Cal.Rptr. 175, 507 P.2d 1383].) Attempts to show that there were established rental stables failed for lack of knowledge of the witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">Reference to the Fremont Hills Country Club, a private tennis and swim club, revealed that it was operating under a use permit issued in 1958 as a private nonprofit recreation club, that it had a restaurant for its members, conducted dances and social events, and maintained stables on the property. The Town Planner was unable to testify as to whether the public at large attended social events at that club or whether the facilities were ever rented out, nor could he testify as to whether the club sponsored commercial tennis tournaments or horse shows at which admissions were charged and liquor and beverages were sold to those attending.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">It was established that a riding academy had been in existence for five or ten years; that it was operated as a commercial venture for profit; and that it was operating under a use permit as a private school.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">Appellants seek to apply the following. rules to the classifications of use of property adopted and practiced by respondent city. In <em>Purdy &amp; Fitzpatrick </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1969) 71 Cal.2d 566 [79 Cal.Rptr. 77, 456 P.2d 645, 38 A.L.R.3d 1194], the court struck down .the provisions of Labor Code section 1850 which prohibited the employment of aliens on public works. The court stated: \u201cThe concept of the equal protection of the laws compels recognition of the proposition that persons similarly situated with respect to the legitimate purpose of the law receive like treatment. In cases involving \u2018suspect classifications\u2019 or \u2018fundamental interests\u2019 of those suffering discriminatidn, the United States Supreme Court prescribes a strict standard for reviewing the particular enactment under the equal protection clause. Not only must the classification reasonably relate to the purposes of the law, but also the state must bear the burden of establishing that the classification constitutes a necessary means of accomplishing a legitimate state interest, and that the law serves to promote a compelling state interest.\u201d (71 Cal.2d at pp. 578-579, fns. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>In subjecting the alien\u2019s right to employment to the strict standard of review the court further observed, . . the state may not arbitrarily foreclose to any person the right to pursue an otherwise lawful occupation. Any limitation on the opportunity for employment impedes the achievement of economic security, which is essential for the pursuit of life, liberty and happiness; courts sustain such limitations only after careful scrutiny.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>p. 579. See also <em>Morey </em>v. <em>Doud </em>(1957) 354 U.S. 457, 469 [1 L.Ed.2d 1485, 1493-1494, 77 S.Ct. 1344]; <em>Takahashi </em>v. <em>Fish Comm\u2019n. </em>(1948) 334 U.S. 410, 418-420 [92 L.Ed. 1478, 1486-1488, 68 S.Ct. 1138]; and <em>Yick Wo </em>v. <em>Hopkins </em>(1886) 118 U.S. 356, 373-374 [30 L.Ed. 220, 227-228, 6 S.Ct. 1064].) Other cases relied upon by appellants to show that the right to operate a commercial recreational facility \u00f3n their property involves a \u201csuspect classification\u201d or \u201cfundamental interest\u201d are, not in point.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">The sanctity that may attach to the right to make a living or pursue a lawful occupation is not involved here. Appellants confuse the right to engage in the business of conducting a commercial recreational facility, which is open to all of the persons who may reside in, or own property in, respondent city, with the right to engage in that occupation on property within the city limits. All such persons are equally denied that privilege. In order to establish that the provisions of the zoning ordinance are invalid as to them, the appellants must show that they are being deprived of their property without due process of law because the restrictions on its use do not bear a substantial relation to the public health, safety, morals or general welfare. (See <em>Nectow </em>v. <em>Cambridge </em>(1928) 277 U.S. 183, 188-189 [72 L.Ed. 842, 844-845, 48 S.Ct. 447]; <em>McKay Jewelers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bowron </em>(1942) 19 Cal.2d 595, 601 [122 P.2d 543, 139 A.L.R. 1188]; <em>Skalko </em>v. <em>City of Sunnyvale </em>(1939) 14 Cal.2d 213, 215-216 [93 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>P.2d 93]; <em>Hurst </em>v. <em>City of Burlingame </em>(1929) 207 Cal. 134, 143 [277 P. 308]; and <em>Neary </em>v. <em>Town of Los Altos Hills </em>(1959) 172 Cal.App.2d 721, 726-728 [343 P.2d 155].) In order to defeat the regulation the property owner must show that there is no \u201creasonable basis for the belief that the establishment of a strictly residential district has substantial relation to the public health, safety, morals or general welfare, . . .\u201d <em>(Wilkins </em>v. <em>City of San Bernardino, supra, </em>29 Cal.2d 332, 339. See also other cases following quotations from <em>Wilkins </em>in part I.) Appellants have not undertaken to show that their property is valueless, or of less value than other property in the city if devoted to uses permitted by the ordinance. \u201cIt is not sufficient for [appellants] to show that it will be more profitable to [them] to make other use of [their] property, . . .\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 338.)</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">The question is purely economic, and under the equal protection clauses of the state and federal Constitutions any alleged discrimination must be evaluated in accordance with the following principle: \u201c. . . the United States Supreme Court has tended to employ a two-level test in reviewing legislative classifications under the equal protection clause. In the area of economic regulation, the high court has exercised restraint, investing legislation with a presumption of constitutionality and requiring merely that distinctions drawn by a challenged statute bear some rational relationship to a conceivable legitimate state purpose. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Westbrook </em>v. <em>Mihaly </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 765, 784 [87 Cal.Rptr. 839, 471 P.2d 487] [vacated on other grounds (1971) 403 U.S. 915 (29 L.Ed.2d 692, 91 S.Ct. 2224)].

In determining whether there has been any discrimination as claimed by appellants, the rational relationship test should be used.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">Appellants rely upon <em>Roman Cath. etc. Corp. </em>v. <em>City of Piedmont, supra, </em>45 Cal.2d 325 in which it was concluded that the ordinance involved was unconstitutional and void because of its arbitrary and unreasonable discrimination against private schools. The case does not throw light on the question of whether, a distinction may be drawn between commercially motivated private schools and nonprofit and parochial private schools. Although the opinion gives lip service to the rule quoted above from <em>Wilkins </em>v. <em>City of San Bernardino </em>(see 45 Cal.2d at p. 326), it points out \u201cthat parents, have the basic constitutional right to have their children educated in schools of their own choice, subject to reasonable regulations as to subjects required to be taught, manner of instruction, etc.\u201d <em>(id., </em>at p. 329), and, \u201cParents have the right to send their children to private schools, rather than public ones, which are located <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>in their immediate locality or general neighborhood.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 330.) Therefore, it appears that the court was in fact recognizing that education is a fundamental interest. (See <em>Serrano </em>v. <em>Priest, supra, </em>5 Cal.3d at pp. 604-610.) In fact the court concluded, \u201cCareful examination of the arguments in support of the legislation in question reveals that there is absent the <em>compelling justification </em>which would be needed to sustain discrimination of the nature here involved.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 334, italics added. Cf. <em>Tustin Heights Assn. </em>v. <em>Bd. of Supervisors </em>(1959) 170 Cal.App.2d 619, 631-633 [339 P.2d 914].) There is no such fundamental interest involved in the uses which appellants seek to establish for their property. (See fns. 2 and 3 above.)</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">That there is a distinction between recreational uses for profit and recreational uses by a private membership club has been recognized in numerous decisions. In <em>Arents </em>v. <em>Squires </em>(1960) 7 N.Y.2d 1009 [200 N.Y.S.2d 52, 166 N.E.2d 848]; and 8 N.Y.2d 863 [203 N.Y.S.2d 910, 168 N.E.2d 712] the court affirmed a grant of a building permit to an existing use because the use was embraced in the prior permitted use of \u201cclubhouse.\u201d (See 8 App.Div.2d 952 [190 N.Y.S.2d 594].) A dissent, seeking to reverse to determine whether the use was \u201cconducted for gain\u201d as prohibited by the ordinance, observed: \u201cThere is nothing sinister in the profit motive nor in the conduct of such a venture for gain. It just did not conform to the zoning ordinance if that was the fact. The large rental, the management and operation of the club by the promoters of the enterprise who owned the equity, and the circumstance that the club facilities were open to the use of the public patronizing the inns, restaurants and boarding houses in Southampton and vicinity\u2014all of which are alleged as facts in the petition\u2014created a question of fact requiring a trial in court concerning whether this was a clubhouse conducted or not conducted for gain.\u201d (7 N.Y.2d at p. 1014 [200 N.Y.S.2d at p. 55, 166 N.E.2d at p. 850].

The court stated, \u201cOur basic inquiry is whether Catalina is a bona fide club with limited membership controlled by the members, into which admission cannot be obtained by any person at his pleasure, and in which the property is actually owned in common or held for the common benefit of the members, . . .\u201d (352 Mass, at p. 56 [223 N.E.2d at p. 681].) The court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>ruled that since the members other than the promoters had neither a common interest in the underlying assets of the \u201cclub\u201d nor an effective method of participating in its management, the organization was not a club within the meaning of the ordinance. The court remarked, \u201cWe in no way decide that bona fide swimming clubs do not enjoy the same standing as other. private clubs in residential districts under zoning bylaws similar to that adopted by the town of Framingham.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 58 <em>[id., </em>at p. 682].) On a second issue the court concluded that the zoning law did not contemplate the operation of a commercial venture in a residential zone. The court stated, \u201cRecent decisions of this court have distinguished between commercial and noncommercial uses in determining whether a particular use was properly permitted in a residence district.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 60 <em>[id., </em>at p. 683.].

The court stated, \u201cThe Board [of Zoning Appeals] has confused the <em>use </em>of property with <em>compensaiton for use </em>of property. These are two entirely separate and distinct things. [Citation.] [\u00b6] . . . the General Assembly has authorized local governing bodies by ordinance to control the use and development of lands within their respective jurisdictions. There is no legislation, however, which enables these .governing bodies to control the compensation of land or the improvements thereon.\u201d (213 Va. at p. 438 [192 S.E.2d at p. 779].)</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">In an earlier case the Virginia court held that an ordinance permitting \u201c \u2018 \u201cPublic and private parks, recreational areas and resorts, including golf courses, swimming pools, and boating facilities, together with structures accessory thereto\u201d \u2019 \u201d expressly authorized the use of 97.75 acres for commercial recreation purposes, and that a further provision which required a special use permit for \u201cclubs and grounds for games and sports, provided only such use is not primarily for gain\u201d only applied to spectator sports and not to the proposed development. <em>(Mooreland </em>v. <em>Young </em>(1956) 197 Va. 771 [91 S.E.2d 438].)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">The facts in this case demonstrate that there is a rational relationship in excluding commercial recreational areas, while permitting clubs or recreational facilities operated by a nonprofit organization. Appellants propose to operate a commercial venture which, if their major advertising campaigns are successful, will bring persons in numbers almost equal to the population of the city into the city for recreation. On the other hand, although a nonprofit organization over the long run must secure sufficient clientele to support its activities, it is not under compulsion to attract increasing numbers to fill its coffers. When the nonprofit activities are conducted by a membership club there is a check on the number <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>to be served, and the type of activities to be conducted because the members will themselves not wish to be discommoded by overtaxing the facilities. On balance the most that can be said is that whether the determination to exclude commercial, recreational facilities as distinguished from similar nonprofit facilities was \u201c \u2018an unreasonable, arbitrary or unequal exercise of power is fairly debatable. In such circumstances, the settled rule of [the United States Supreme Court] is that it will not substitute its judgment for that of the legislative body charged 'with the primary duty and responsibility of determining the question.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Wilkins </em>v. <em>City of San Bernardino, supra, </em>29 Cal.2d at p. 339, quoting from <em>Zahn </em>v. <em>Board of Public Works </em>(1927) 274 U.S. 325, at p. 328 [71 L.Ed. 1074, at p. 1076, 47 S.Ct. 594].)</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">The mere fact that some uses of the property may prove to be similar does not render the ordinance unduly discriminatory. In <em>City of Long Beach </em>v. <em>California Lambda etc. Fraternity </em>(1967) 255 Cal.App.2d 789 [63 Cal.Rptr. 419], it was contended that the attributes of use as a fraternity house were identical to those of a boarding house or lodging house. The court, with an apparent low regard for the conduct of students living in a fraternity house, pointed out that many attributes of the life style in a fraternity house were absent in a permitted boarding house, lodging house or apartment. (255 Cal.App.2d at pp. 796-797.) So here there are attributes of the commercial venture which render it more offensive and burdensome to a residential neighborhood than the nonprofit club. It may also be pointed out that there was no showing here that there was discrimination in the city\u2019s manner of enforcing the ordinance. (See <em>id., </em>at p. 797; and <em>City etc. of San Francisco </em>v. <em>Burton </em>(1962) 201 Cal.App.2d 749,755-756 [20 Cal.Rptr. 378].)</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">Appellants point out that even nonprofit corporations may make a profit. Corporations Code section 9200 provides in part; \u201c. . . Carrying on business at a profit as an incident to the main purposes of the corporation and the distribution of assets to members on dissolution are not forbidden to nonprofit corporations, but no corporation formed or existing under this part shall distribute any gains, profits, or dividends to any of its members as such except upon dissolution or winding up.\u201d (See also <em>Laurel H. Cemetery Assn. </em>v. <em>San Francisco </em>(1947) 81 Cal.App. 2d 371, 378 [184 P.2d 160].) <em>Cuzner </em>v. <em>The California Club </em>(1909) 155 Cal. 303 [100 P. 868] upon which appellants rely demonstrates that there is a valid distinction between a social club and a commercial venture insofar as the licensing of the sale of alcoholic beverages is concerned. In any event, the mere fact that there may be a profit on dissolution does not lessen the distinction between the day-to-day opera-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>lions of the two types of recreational facilities. (155 Cal. at pp. 310-312.)</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">Finally they assert that <em>John Tennant Memorial Homes, Inc. </em>v. <em>City of Pacific Grove </em>(1972) 27 Cal.App.3d 372 [103 Cal.Rptr. 215] demonstrates that no lawful distinction can be drawn between nonprofit and commercial activities. There the court struck down a tax which purported to tax the occupants of nonprofit rest homes, and excluded the occupants of profit-motivated rest homes. The court found that there was no rational basis for the classification, on grounds, among others, that each type of occupant received the same services from the city (27 Cal.App.3d at p. 379). The court, however, pointed out, \u201cThe instant ordinance taxes not the owners for the privilege of doing business, but the retirees for the privilege of occupancy ... an occupancy tax cannot distinguish between groups of occupants without a clear, reasonable and constitutional base.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>p. 381.)</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">Here the ordinance under the zoning powers properly distinguishes between business uses and nonprofit uses. (See <em>Cuzner </em>v. <em>The California Club, supra, </em>155 Cal. 303, 310-312.) The purpose of the ordinance is not for revenue but to provide for the public health, safety, morals and general welfare of the community. As has been noted above there is a rational distinction between the' attributes of commerci\u00e1l and noncommercial recreational uses, and the burdens each imposes on the municipality and the residents within the city limits. The application of the provisions of the ordinance to appellants\u2019 property was properly adjudicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">Molinari, P.

Although the latter two Belluccis answered and- appeared in the action they were not enjoined by the judgment and have not appealed. The city also named as a defendant Los Altos Hills Country Club and Does 1 through 1,500 who were allegedly members of that club.

The court found that Congress had left the question of development under the National Housing Act to local option; that the ordinance did not violate due process because its provisions were not arbitrary or unreasonable; and that although the ordinance admittedly made it impossible for persons of low income to obtain housing within the city it did not discriminate on the grounds of race because all with adequate means, regardless of ancestry could acquire housing in the city, and that constitutional decisions which prohibited discrimination on the basis of wealth were inapplicable because the facts failed to show a duty to furnish housing to the less affluent from outside the city.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b390-6\">Restraints on the right of interstate migration. <em>(Shapiro </em>v. <em>Thompson </em>(1969) 394 U.S. 618, 634 [22 L.Ed.2d 600, 615, 89 S.Ct. 1322]; and <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>California </em>(1941) 314 U.S. 160, at p. 178 [86 L.Ed. 119, 127-128, 62 S.Ct. 164], Douglas, J., concurring.)
