(\u201cG4S\u201d or \u201cWSI\u201d),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> on his claims that, in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (\u201cTitle VII\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(1) and \u00a7 2000e-3(a), and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981, G4S discriminated against him in the workplace, denied him promotions and then terminated his employment on account of his age, race and national origin and that G4S retaliated against him for complaining about such discrimination. We affirm, in part, and vacate and remand, in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b1334-19\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1334-20\">The operative pleadings before the District Court when it ruled on G4SV motion for summary judgment were the plaintiffs First Amended Complaint (the \u201ccom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1311\">*1311</page-number>plaint\u201d) [ECF No. 9], and the defendant\u2019s Answer and Affirmative Defenses to Amended Complaint (the \u201canswer\u201d) [ECF No. 10].</p>\n<p id=\"b1335-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1335-6\">Barthelus\u2019s complaint, which was filed on September 21, 2012, contains 69 paragraphs and four counts.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Counts I and III allege claims of unlawful discrimination in the workplace and in the termination of his employment. Count I alleges that G4S discriminated against Barthelus based on his national origin, in violation of Title VII; Count III alleges that G4S discriminated against Barthelus because of his race, in violation of \u00a7 1981. Counts II and IV, brought under Title VII<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and \u00a7 1981, respectively, allege that G4S terminated Barthelus\u2019s employment because he filed a complaint of discrimination with its Human Resources Department. We do not consider Barthelus\u2019s appeal of the judgment on those counts because his brief presents no argument that the District Court erred in granting summary judgment on the claims asserted in those counts.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We focus, instead, on Counts I and III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1335-7\">The first 18 paragraphs of Barthelus\u2019s complaint trace his employment from December 29,1997, when he came to work for G4S\u2019s predecessor, The Wackenhut Corporation, as an electrical engineer in its I.T. Department, to February 10, 2011, when G4S terminated his employment. Paragraphs 11 through 18 describe incidents of discriminatory treatment he allegedly received based on his race or national origin that took place during that time frame. Those paragraphs describe the treatment thusly:</p>\n<p id=\"b1335-12\">\u201c[A]bout October 5, 2005, Defendant began discriminating against Plaintiff because Plaintiff is Haitain and/or because of his race.\u201d \u00b6 11. \u201cIn ... October, 2005, Plaintiff was denied a promotion because he had a Haitian accent.\u201d \u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b1335-13\">\u201cAfter ten (10) years of service, Mr. Galusha, the chief technology officer, who was also Plaintiffs supervisor, provided Plaintiff with a very bad performance review.\u201d \u00b6 12. \u201cAfter discussion between Plaintiff and Mr. Galusha, Mr. Galusha decided that the performance review was inaccurate and sought to amend the evaluation, but his ... supervisor, Mrs. Laura Thomas, a non-Black, non-Haitian, objected to the amendment.\u201d \u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b1335-14\">\u201cPlaintiff, the only Black, Haitian employee in [the I.T.] department, did not receive a pay increase whereas all other non-Black, non-Haitian employees did.\u201d \u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b1335-15\">\u201cOn ... December 16, 2009, Mrs. [Deborah] Bria [the I.T. Manager, who is non-Haitian and non-Black] denied Plaintiff extra days off ... because Plaintiff was on vacation during a holiday period, but ... granted [extra] days off to a non-Black, non-Haitian employee who was also on vacation during a holiday period.\u201d \u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b1335-16\">\u201cOn ... April 1, 2010, Mrs.... Bria ... began discriminating against Plaintiff. For example, Mrs. Bria, on many occasions, required Plaintiff to cut his lunch <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1312\">*1312</page-number>break short and return to work (where there was no emergency that required such), but Mrs. Bria did not treat other similarly situated employees not in the same protected class in such a manner.\u201d \u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b1336-4\">\u201cOn ... December 10, 2010, Mrs. Bria repeated her discriminatory actions by granting Plaintiffs white, non-Haitian counterparts leave while denying Plaintiff the same privileges.\u201d \u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b1336-5\">\u201cAll senior title employees, such as Plaintiff, had an office, but Plaintiff, being the only Black, Haitian employee in his department, did not.\u201d \u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b1336-6\">Count I, \u201cViolation of Title VII of the Civil Right[s] Act of 1964: Discrimination Based on National Origin\u201d incorporates the first 18 paragraphs of the complaint and adds an additional 13 paragraphs, quotes from Title VII the text of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and alleges that \u201cPlaintiff was discriminated against by his supervisors because he was Haitian,\u201d \u00b6 25; \u201cDefendant, through its practices and policies as an employer, ... discriminated against Plaintiff on account of his national origin ... with respect to its decision to treat Plaintiff different from other similarly situated employees who are not in the same protected class as Plaintiff,\u201d \u00b6 28; and \u201cPlaintiff was fired by Defendant and Plaintiffs termination from employment was directly and proximately caused by the Defendant\u2019s unjustified discrimination against Plaintiff because ... he was Haitian,\u201d \u00b6 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b1336-10\">Count III, \u201cDiscrimination Based on Race in Violation of \u00a7 1981,\u201d incorporates paragraphs 1 through 18 of the complaint and alleges that \u201cDefendant has engaged in a pattern of continuous discrimination against Plaintiff based on his race.\u201d \u00b6 46. \u201cDuring the course of his employment ... Plaintiff was continually and repeatedly subjected to severe and pervasive racial discrimination by Defendant\u2019s agents because of racial animus towards Plaintiff.\u201d \u00b6 47. \u201cDefendant crafted and implemented a plan to eventually terminate Plaintiff based upon his race.\u201d \u00b6 48. \u201cPlaintiff was singled out for treatment in a discriminatory manner by Defendant because of his race.\u201d \u00b6 49. \u201cDefendant, and its supervisory personnel, was aware that discrimination on the basis of race was unlawful but acted in reckless disregard of the law. Plaintiff complained to Defendant\u2019s Human Resources Department on ... December 28, 2010.\u201d \u00b6 50. \u201cThe actions and language of the Defendant were so severe and pervasive as to alter the terms, conditions, and/or privileges of his employment with the Defendant.\u201d \u00b651. \u201cDefendant\u2019s actions were based upon Plaintiff being a Black individual. The Defendant subjected Plaintiff to race-based animosity.\u201d \u00b6 52. \u201cAt all times material hereto, the employees exhibiting discriminatory conduct towards Plaintiff were all in a position that possesses the authority to affect the terms, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1313\">*1313</page-number>conditions, and privileges of the Plaintiffs employment with Defendant.\u201d \u00b6 57.</p>\n<p id=\"b1337-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1337-6\">G4S apparently concluded that the \u201cwell-pleaded facts\u201d of Barthelus\u2019s complaint were sufficient, under <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>\u201cto permit the [district] court to infer more than the mere possibility of misconduct,\u201d 556 U.S. 662, 679, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1950, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009), and therefore bypassed filing a motion to dismiss or a motion for a more definite statement under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) or 12(e),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> respectively, and answered the complaint, on October 3, 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b1337-7\">G4S\u2019s answer responds to the complaint paragraph-by-paragraph, denies the allegations of discrimination and retaliation, and asserts that \u201cPlaintiff received a number of poor performance reviews, including by Mr. Galusha,\u201d \u00b6 12; that \u201cPlaintiff [was informed] that his employment would be terminated if he did not improve,\u201d \u00b6 36; and that, \u201cafter receiving a variety of poor performance evaluations and warnings, Plaintiff complained to human resources,\u201d \u00b6 50.</p>\n<p id=\"b1337-8\">After responding to the complaint\u2019s paragraphs, the answer asserts six affirmative defenses, including that \u201cPlaintiff cannot establish a prima facie case of discrimination\u201d; \u201cDefendant terminated Plaintiff for legitimate nondiscriminatory reasons\u201d; and that \u201cPlaintiffs claims are barred by the applicable statute of limitations.\u201d Answer at 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b1337-11\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b1337-12\">Three days after G4S filed its answer, the District Court set the case down for trial on July 29, 2013, and ordered the parties\u2019 discovery monitored by the Magistrate Judge. After discovery concluded, the parties filed a pretrial stipulation [ECF No. 64]. Among other things, they described their respective contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1337-13\">According to Barthelus, he</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1337-14\">filed a Complaint against Defendants alleging: 1) Discrimination Based On Race and National Origin in Violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964; 2) Retaliation in Violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964; 3) Discrimination Based On Race in Violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981; 4) Retaliation in Violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1337-16\">Defendant hired Plaintiff to work as a Senior Network Administrator. Plaintiff worked for Defendant from December 29, 1997 through February 10, 2011. Plaintiff claims that several of Defendant\u2019s agents discriminated against Plaintiff based on the fact that he is a Black Haitian. These instances of discrimination include, but are not limited to, the following: Plaintiff was subject to a very negative, though highly inaccurate, performance review and when Plaintiffs immediate supervisor sought to amend the review, the amendment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1314\">*1314</page-number>was rejected by a non-Black, non-Haitian supervisor; Plaintiff was unjustifiably asked to cut his lunch break short by a non-Black, non-Haitian supervisor on numerous occasions; Plaintiff was denied a promotion because he had a Haitian accent; Plaintiff was denied vacation days at times when other similarly-situated, though non-Black, non-Haitian employees were not; and Plaintiff was not given an office whereas other similarly-situated, though non-Black, non-Haitian employees were.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1338-4\">Plaintiff complained about this discrimination to Defendant\u2019s Human Resources Department. One such complaint was made on or about December 28, 2010, less than two months before Plaintiff was terminated. Plaintiff claims his termination was in retaliation for complaining about repeated incidents of discrimination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1338-5\">Pretrial Stipulation at 1-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b1338-6\">According to G4S, Barthelus\u2019s complaint \u201casserts only a claim for national origin discrimination under Title VII. No claim for race discrimination is asserted.\u201d With that said, G4S explained Barthelus\u2019s claims and its view of the facts not in dispute as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1338-7\">Plaintiff was hired by [G4S] in August 2002---- He worked for [G4S] until February 10, 2011, when he was terminated for performance deficiencies. As the Senior Network Administrator, Plaintiff was responsible for not only the operation of the company\u2019s computer system and administration of e-mail and system servers, certain software solutions, and back-up systems, but also for the proactive monitoring of vulnerabilities in the systems and implementation of proactive solutions in the ever growing field of information technology. As [G4S] grew, Plaintiff could not keep up with the tasks assigned to him and resisted learning newer solutions such as virtualization of systems. After numerous warnings and attempts at helping Plaintiff understand his performance deficiencies, all of which were met with resistance, Plaintiff was terminated. The same person who hired Plaintiff, Paul Donahue, also made the decision to fire him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1338-11\">In addition to the basic facts of this case, [G4S] takes issue with the factual allegations asserted by Plaintiff in his summary ... as several issues were not raised in the [complaint], or are barred by the applicable statute of limitations. By way of example, Plaintiff asserts that he was passed over for promotion in 2005, which is barred by the limitations period. For the first time in response to Defendant\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment, Plaintiff claimed that he was passed over for promotion when Deborah Bria was promoted in mid-2010, which claim was raised neither in Plaintiffs EEOC charge or his [complaint]. Thus, that claim is not at issue in this litigation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1338-12\">The only issue properly raised in the pleadings in this case is whether Plaintiff was terminated due to his race, national origin, or because in December 2010 he complained about alleged discrimination. [G4S] will present evidence at trial, if summary judgment is not entered in its favor, that Plaintiff was terminated for one reason and one reason only: his continued failure to perform his job responsibilities to [G4S\u2019s] standards.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1338-13\">Pretrial Stipulation at 2-3.</p>\n<p id=\"b1338-14\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1338-15\">\u201cDuring Barthelus\u2019s entire tenure at [G4S], he was the only Senior Network <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1315\">*1315</page-number>Administrator and the only engineer within the [I.T.] department.\u201d Order [ECF No. 71] at 5. In presenting its case for summary judgment, and as the District Court noted in its dispositive order, \u201cG4S concede[d] [that] Barthelus has satisfied the elements of a <em>prima facie </em>case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 22-23. Given that concession and its impression that the only issue Counts I and III presented was whether G4S terminated Barthelus\u2019s employment for a legitimate non-discriminatory reason,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the court moved straight to that solitary issue \u2014 beginning with a statement of G4S\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b1339-5\">\u201cG4S asserts Barthelus was terminated for \u2018performance deficiencies\u2019 evidenced by \u2018consistent criticism\u2019 from multiple supervisors. In support, G4S provides employee evaluations from 1999 to 2002, and 2007 through his termination on February 10, 2011.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 23. The court concluded that \u201c[t]hese evaluations sufficiently satisfied] G4S\u2019s burden of production to provide a legitimate non-discriminatory reason for Barthelus\u2019s termination,\u201d <em>id., </em>and turned to whether Barthelus had demonstrated that the reason was a pretext for discrimination. The court held that he had not.</p>\n<p id=\"b1339-6\">The court based this holding on the fact that Barthelus was unable to point to a replacement who was not protected, <em>id. </em>at 24-25; that the statistical evidence he proffered was not probative, <em>id. </em>at 25-27; that although Galusha\u2019s comment that Barthelus had \u201ca communication issue with his accent\u201d \u201cmay have contributed to a circumstantial case for pretext, it [was] unaccompanied by any other evidence and cannot singularly support a finding of pretext,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 28, 29; that the evidence of G4S\u2019s failure to promote Barthelus was irrelevant because \u201c[n]either the [complaint] nor Barthelus\u2019s EEOC Charge of Discrimination[<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>] alleges a failure to promote claim,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 31; and that \u201cBarthe-lus\u2019s extensive history of negative performance reviews followed by his own self-serving disagreements are not evidence of pretext,\u201d <em>id. </em>36. In sum, the District Court granted G4S summary judgment on Counts I and III solely on the ground that the evidence failed to create a genuine issue of fact on the issue of pretext.</p>\n<p id=\"b1339-11\">The court overlooked the fact that Counts I and III alleged that Barthelus had been subjected to a pattern of workplace discrimination based on race and national origin. The allegations included that Barthelus \u201cdid not receive a pay increase whereas all other non-Black, non-Haitian employees did\u201d; that whites were provided \u201can office\u201d but he was not; that Mrs. Bria denied him \u201cextra days off\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1316\">*1316</page-number>during the holiday season but granted them to whites; and that Mrs. Bria granted whites \u201cleave while denying Plaintiff the same privileges.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1340-4\">Moreover, in stating that \u201cBarthelus\u2019s extensive history of negative performance reviews followed by his own self-serving disagreements are not evidence of pretext,\u201d the court cited, but apparently discounted, the following facts: After G4S downsized in 2002,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Barthelus\u2019s \u201cperformance reviews ... were consistently positive.\u201d Order at 5. Galusha\u2019s evaluation was that Barthelus \u201chad become a \u2018valuable addition to [G4S].\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cBarthelus\u2019s December 2003 and December 2004 reviews were similarly positive.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In 2004, Galusha told Donahue, G4S\u2019s president and chief executive officer, that \u201cBarthelus was underpaid.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 6. In December 2005, Barthelus \u201creceived and increase in his salary, effective January 2006, which included a six percent \u2018[m]erit\u2019 increase and a three percent \u2018[ajdjustment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 8. In 2007, Galusha emailed Laura Thomas, G4S\u2019s chief financial officer, that Barthelus \u201c\u2018feels he is being treated wrongly by those in the I.T. department because ... [he is] black and ... ha[s] an accent.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>At the end of the year, Galusha gave Barthelus an unfavorable performance review. <em>Id. </em>at 9. On reconsideration, Galusha emailed Thomas that he \u201c \u2018came to the conclusion that most of the comments I gave in the review could be redacted and regarded as misunderstanding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 10. ' Barthe-lus\u2019s December 2008 performance review \u201cincluded several examples indicating the manner in which Barthelus\u2019s performance needed to improve to avoid future system failures.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 11. \u201cDonahue advised him that \u2018it was not necessary for [Bar-thelus] to write a rebuttal because [G4S] put the reviews \u2014 whether good or bad \u2014 in the drawer and never pull[s] out the reviews again.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1340-6\">At some point prior to January 2009, Tech Search America (\u201cTSA\u201d), an independent information technology company, began an annual audit of G4S\u2019s I.T. Department. The January 26, 2009, audit report, which the District Court did not mention in its order, contains this \u201cResults of the Assessment\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1340-7\">Our analysis process revealed some detailed information about [G4S]\u2019s Internet point-of-presence network and internal network. This data was reviewed, and it was determined that [G4S] needs some <em>moderate </em>improvement to its overall security posture.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1340-8\">TSA rates the overall [G4S] network security at 94.88%. This combined score is a result of receiving a score of 98.33% for the external audit and 91.43% for the internal audit. These relatively high security ratings indicate that the network security staff of [G4S] has taken almost all of the appropriate steps to ensure a solid security posture for both the internal and external networks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1340-9\">This slight reduction is primarily due to the added weaknesses that were discovered during the internal assessment. These weaknesses can be attributed to the fact that [G4S] HQ network has evolved to a greater and more complex network environment to suit the business needs of the [G4S] user community. Note that TSA feels that the overall security posture of [G4S] is still quite good. In addition, compared to assessments of companies and organizations of equal size, TSA finds that [G4S] is above par and secure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1341-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1317\">*1317</page-number>PLEx. V [ECF No. 52-26] at 5. Since Barthelus was the Senior Network Administrator and only engineer in the I.T. Department and the Department\u2019s security posture was \u201cabove par and secure,\u201d it can be inferred from TSA\u2019s audit that Barthe-lus\u2019s performance may not have been as uniformly negative as the District Court concluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-5\">The ultimate question this appeal presents is whether the evidence in the record before the District Court, considered in the light most favorable to Barthelus, creates material issues of fact. <em>See Ellis v. England, </em>432 F.3d 1321, 1325 (11th Cir.2005). We are unable to answer this question with respect to Barthelus\u2019s claim that G4S, through its supervisors, discriminated against him in the workplace due to his race and national origin as alleged in Counts I and III because the District Court did not consider those claims. We have considered the court\u2019s decision that the evidence failed to establish a genuine issue of fact as to whether G4S\u2019s decision to terminate Barthelus\u2019s employment was a pretext for unlawful discrimination. We conclude that material issues of fact are present regarding pretext \u2014 especially when Barthelus\u2019s performance reviews are considered in light of the TSA audits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment on Counts II and IV but vacate its judgment on Counts I and III and remand the case for further proceedings on those counts. In considering whether Counts I and III present claims sufficient to withstand summary judgment, the District Court should bear in mind that those counts assert the \u201cstatus-based\u201d category of discrimination prohibited by Title VII. <em>See Univ. of Tex. Sw. Med. Ctr. v. Nassar, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2517, 2522-23, 186 L.Ed.2d 503 (2013).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1341-10\">An employee who alleges status-based discrimination under Title VII need not show that the causal link between injury and wrong is so close that the injury would not have occurred but for the act. So-called but-for causation is not the test. It suffices instead to show that the motive to discriminate was one of the employer\u2019s motives, even if the employer also had other, lawful motives that were causative in the employer\u2019s decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1341-11\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-12\">AFFIRMED, in part, VACATED and REMANDED, in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1334-10\">.

In <em>Bell Atlantic Corp. </em>v. <em>Twombly, </em>Justice Stevens stated, in dissent, that \"[t]he remedy for an allegation lacking sufficient specificity to provide adequate notice is ... a Rule 12(e) motion for a more definite statement.\u201d 550 U.S. 544, 590 n. 9, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1985 n. 9, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007) (Stevens, J., dissenting). When one considers the differences in the positions Barthelus and G4S took in their joint pretrial stipulation, as indicating in sub-part C, <em>infra, </em>it becomes obvious that a more definite statement would have reduced the amount of discovery the parties engaged in and assisted the District Court in getting to the root of the parties' controversy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1339-7\">. The court apparently agreed with the statement G4S made in the pretrial stipulation\u2014 that \"the only issue properly raised in the pleadings in this case is whether Plaintiff was terminated due to his race, national origin, or because in December 2010 he complained about alleged discrimination.\u201d <em>See </em>part I, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1339-8\">. In the EEOC charging document [ECF No. 53-1], Barthelus alleged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1339-9\">Deborah H. Bria, Director I.T., created a very hostile working environment. I was singled out and treated differently from my White and younger co-workers. When Deborah H. Bria was my Manager, she harassed me and tried to force me to quit my job. When she became Director, she had the authority to get rid of me and that she did by using false accusations regarding my performance. Therefore, I believe I have been discriminated against because of my Age/55, my race/Black, my national origin, Haitian, and retaliated against because I reported her discriminatory conduct to Human Resources. I am not aware of any younger White employees being treated in the same manner.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1340-5\">.
