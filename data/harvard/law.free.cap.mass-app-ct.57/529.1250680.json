We reverse the defendant\u2019s convictions because the error in admission of the officer\u2019s opinion cannot be deemed nonprejudicial when viewed together with the improper questions pertaining to the defendant\u2019s silence. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Borodine, </em>371 Mass. 1, 11-12 (1976), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 1049 (1977); <em>Com</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number><em>monwealth </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>373 Mass. 569, 577 (1977). Moreover, the prosecutor\u2019s questions on redirect examination intruded upon the defendant\u2019s right to remain silent, and gave rise to a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\"><em>Background. </em>In the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, we recite facts that the jury could have found. On September 30, 2000, at about 8:15 p.m., Holyoke police Officer Paul Barkyoumb, who possessed considerable experience in narcotics investigations, was conducting drug surveillance at Suffolk and Beach Streets, an area of high narcotics activity. Within a ten-minute period, Barkyoumb observed four different instances in which an individual approached the defendant and engaged in brief conversation, following which the defendant reached into the branches of a nearby tree and removed an object. The defendant handed the object to the individual in exchange for cash that the defendant placed in his right front pants pocket.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">At approximately 8:30 p.m., Barkyoumb observed a fifth such transaction with an individual, later identified as Thomas Rodriguez. Barkyoumb radioed Officer Sustache, who was nearby, and instructed him to locate and stop Rodriguez. In short order, Sustache stopped and arrested Rodriguez,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> retrieving an object from Rodriguez\u2019s right front pocket that appeared to be (and upon analysis proved to be) cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">After Rodriguez\u2019s arrest, Barkyoumb left his surveillance location and returned to the police station. There, he quickly enlisted the assistance of other officers in locating and arresting the defendant. Prior to arresting the defendant, Barkyoumb returned to the comer of Beach and Suffolk Streets and searched the tree for the suspected stash of drugs. None was found. Nor were any drugs, drug paraphernalia, or other accouterments of the drug trade found upon the defendant at his arrest. Barkyoumb did find $375, in denominations of five, ten, and twenty dollar bills, in the defendant\u2019s right front pants pocket.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">1. <em>The expert opinion. </em>Notwithstanding the clear admonition of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Woods, </em>419 Mass. 366, 374-375 (1995), and its progeny, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zavala, </em>52 Mass. App. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>Ct. 770, 775-776 (2001), on direct examination, the prosecutor impermissibly asked, and the judge improperly admitted, over objection, testimony that Barkyoumb believed the four interactions that preceded the transaction with Rodriguez to be street level narcotics transactions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 3Common sense suggests that it would have been obvious to the jury that Barkyoumb believed this to be the case, otherwise the defendant would not have been arrested, indicted, and put to trial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>425 Mass. 633, 646 n.13 (1997) (drug sales unfortunately so common in present society that almost any witness could draw inference that drug sales were occurring in described activities); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tanner, </em>45 Mass. App. Ct. 576, 580 (1998) (\u201cEven without such testimony, the jury would have known that [the officer] believed that. . . the defendant had been involved in drug sales\u201d). Nevertheless, as the Commonwealth concedes, the case law has placed beyond disputation that testimony of the kind received from Barkyoumb is an opinion as to the defendant\u2019s guilt that intrudes impermissibly upon the jury\u2019s fact-finding function. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Woods, </em>419 Mass. at 375. If addressed at all, such inquiries should be couched in the approved \u201cconsistent with\u201d locution. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>410 Mass. 199, 202 (1991) (expert properly allowed to testify amount of cocaine found on defendant consistent with intent to distribute); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gollman, </em>436 Mass. 111, 116 (2002) (judge appropriately confined witness\u2019s opinion testimony to whether circumstances were consistent with personal use or intention to distribute); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>55 Mass. App. Ct. 741, 746 <em>(2002).</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">Because the defendant\u2019s objection preserved the point for ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>peal, we consider the error under the prejudicial error standard of review. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flebotte, </em>417 Mass. 348, 353 (1994). Standing alone, the erroneous admission of Barkyoumb\u2019s testimony might well fall within the ambit of cases where such an error was deemed harmless or nonprejudicial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Woods, </em>429 Mass. at 375-376; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>425 Mass. at 645; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tanner, </em>45 Mass. App. Ct. at 580. After all, Barkyoumb described five separate and distinctive transactions that involved brief conversation, the defendant\u2019s reaching into a tree for an object, and exchange of the object for cash that the defendant placed in his right pants pocket. Apprehension of Rodriguez a short time after the last transaction led to the discovery of cocaine in the very location where Rodriguez had placed the object received from the defendant, and upon his arrest, the defendant was found to have $375 in small denominations in the very pocket where Barkyoumb had observed him place the money received in each transaction. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kennedy, </em>426 Mass. 703, 708 (1998) (experienced narcotics investigator could believe probable cause existed based upon \u201cwhole silent movie\u201d in observed drug transaction).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">The error, however, must be viewed together with the prosecutor\u2019s redirect examination, discussed below, that inquired as to the defendant\u2019s failure to offer an explanation for the large amount of cash found in his pocket upon his arrest. No drugs, paraphernalia, or accouterments of the drug trade were found on the defendant. Nor did police locate the supposed stash of drugs. Rodriguez\u2019s whereabouts prior to, and for a brief period after, the transaction were unknown. The area was one of high drug activity, and Rodriguez may have brought the drugs to his interaction with the defendant or purchased them unobserved afterwards.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">In sum, the defendant\u2019s convictions were based entirely upon inference from Barkyoumb\u2019s observations, coupled with the discovery of drugs in Rodriguez\u2019s pocket and cash in the defendant\u2019s. We cannot say with fair assurance that the buttressing provided by the impermissible expert opinion had no effect, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>or but slight effect, upon the jury. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Griffith, </em>45 Mass. App. Ct. 784, 786 &amp; n.3 (1998) (unobjected-to errors may be cumulated and weighed with those claims of error that have been adequately preserved). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Demars, </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 788, 794 (1997), <em>S.C., </em>426 Mass. 1008 (1998). Indeed, the improper admission of Barkyoumb\u2019s opinion appears synergistically toxic when viewed in conjunction with the prosecutor\u2019s questions that suggested the defendant had an obligation to tell the police at the time of his arrest the sources and intended uses for the money in his pocket.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">2. <em>Comment on the defendant\u2019s silence. </em>The defendant maintains that his convictions should be reversed because the prosecutor\u2019s redirect examination commented impermissibly on the defendant\u2019s right to remain silent. We place the problem in context.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\"><em>The defense cross-examination of Barkyoumb. </em>Defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination of Barkyoumb sought to create the innuendo that the money found on the defendant might have been intended for rent and had its source in a social security check rather than drug sales. Addressing the $375 found in the defendant\u2019s pocket upon his arrest, defense counsel inquired:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-7\">Defense Counsel: \u201cAnd would it be fair to say that you have no personal knowledge of [the defendant\u2019s] financial resources?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-8\">Barkyoumb: \u201cI have none, no.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-9\">Defense Counsel: \u201cYou don\u2019t know whether he\u2019s employed or not, correct?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-10\">Barkyoumb: \u201cNo.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-11\">Defense Counsel: \u201cAnd September 30, the next day was October 1, correct?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-12\">Barkyoumb: \u201cYep.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-13\">Defense Counsel: \u201cAnd that\u2019s the first of the month, correct?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-14\">Barkyoumb: \u201cRight.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>Defense Counsel: \u201cAnd normally when somebody rents an apartment, that\u2019s when rent\u2019s due, correct?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-5\">Barkyoumb: \u201cI guess, yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-6\">Defense Counsel: \u201cSo there\u2019s many reasons why a person would have money on his possession, correct?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-7\">[Here the prosecutor objected.]<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-8\">Barkyoumb: \u201cRight.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-9\">Defense Counsel: \u201cRight, so there\u2019s many different reasons.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-10\">Barkyoumb: \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-11\">Defense Counsel: \u201cAnd a lot of, and ninety-nine point nine percent of those reasons would not be associated with drugs, correct?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-12\">Barkyoumb: \u201cYes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-13\"><em>The prosecutor\u2019s redirect examination. </em>.Without objection, the prosecutor\u2019s redirect examination of Barkyoumb took the following tack:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-14\">Prosecutor: \u201c[When you found the money on the defendant,] did he offer you any explanation why he had so much cash on him?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-15\">Barkyoumb: \u201cNo.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-16\">Prosecutor: \u201c[D]id he say his rent was due?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-17\">Barkyoumb: \u201cNo.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-18\">Prosecutor: \u201cDid he say that he just got a social security check from somewhere?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-19\">Barkyoumb: \u201cNo.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>Prosecutor: \u201cDid he offer you an explanation to tell you why? Did he say he just cashed a paycheck?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-4\">Barkyoumb: \u201cNo.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-5\">Prosecutor: \u201cHe told you nothing at all about why he had so much cash on him in numerous denominations?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-6\">Barkyoumb: \u201cNothing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">Such an inquiry should not have been undertaken by the prosecutor or allowed by the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">We begin by emphasizing that this is not a situation involving when, or in what circumstances, a defendant\u2019s prearrest, pre-Miranda silence or equivocal admissions constitute implied or adoptive admissions or constitute permissible subjects for cross-examination. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nickerson, </em>386 Mass. 54, 62 (1982) (impeachment of defendant with fact of his prearrest silence should be approached with caution); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Peixoto, </em>430 Mass. 654, 660 (2000); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>431 Mass. 108, 116-117, cert. denied, 531 U.S. 864 (2000). The defendant was under arrest at the time referenced in the prosecutor\u2019s inquiry.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Any questioning at that juncture would have required Miranda warnings, as once in custody, a defendant cannot be interrogated without Miranda compliance. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>434 Mass. 805, 811 (2001).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b565-9\">Here, the defendant made no statements when the police discovered the cash in his pockets at his arrest.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The prosecutor\u2019s redirect examination impermissibly suggested that the defendant had an obligation to make an explanatory statement. Such a suggestion implicates directly the defendant\u2019s core constitutional right to remain silent. The defendant had no obligation to offer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>police an explanation for the money on his person. A defendant\u2019s silence while under arrest and prior to receiving Miranda warnings cannot be used against him. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cobb, </em>374 Mass. 514, 520 (1978) (\u201cevery post-arrest silence is insolubly ambiguous because of what the State is required to advise the person arrested\u201d). Nor can a prosecutor comment on a defendant\u2019s failure to \u201cspontaneously volunteer\u201d that he is innocent. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Haas, </em>373 Mass. 545, 558-559 (1977). A defendant, when in the hands of police, should be able to invoke core constitutional rights, such as the right to remain silent, without fear of making implied or adoptive admissions. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Peixoto, </em>430 Mass. at 659-660, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sazama, </em>339 Mass. 154, 157-158 (1959). The prosecutor\u2019s questions \u201cimplicated concerns similar to those protected by the rule preventing adverse comment on a defendant\u2019s actual exercise of his rights.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Peixoto, </em>430 Mass. at 658.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">That the prosecutor\u2019s questioning occurred on redirect examination is of no consequence. Use of the defendant\u2019s post-arrest silence to impeach an exculpatory explanation offered by defense counsel on cross-examination is prohibited. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>434 Mass. at 811 (\u201cEvidence of postarrest silence used for the substantive purpose of permitting an inference of guilt or to impeach an exculpatory story violates the due process clause\u201d). Even when confronted with defense questioning that is argumentative or otherwise improper, the prosecutor may not imply that the defendant has an obligation to explain. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thurber, </em>383 Mass. 328, 334 (1981) (improper cross-examination does not open door to use evidence of defendant\u2019s silence by way of impeachment).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">We are mindful that the situation arose in the rough and tumble of trial. However, the prosecutor had options other than eliciting a prohibited comment upon defendant\u2019s silence. Upon the judge\u2019s overruling his objection during cross-examination, the prosecutor might have requested a sidebar conference to inquire whether there existed a good faith basis for defense counsel\u2019s questions. Further, the prosecutor might have requested a contemporaneous limiting instruction that the witness\u2019s negative answer was not to be taken as evidence of the substantive truth of the proposition advanced. More obvi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>ously, redirect examination might have emphasized that the defendant placed the money received during each exchange in the same right front pocket in which the cash was found.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">Although defense counsel lodged no objection, the impermissible questioning posed particularly grave risk. Impermissible comment upon a defendant\u2019s right to remain silent is \u201cso egregious that reversal is the norm, not the exception.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. 466, 469 (1993), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mahdi, </em>388 Mass. 679, 698 (1983). As noted earlier, taken together with the erroneous admission of Barkyoumb\u2019s opinion that he had observed street level drug transactions, we are satisfied that the probable impact upon the jury was considerable. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mahdi, supra. </em>Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>434 Mass. at 811-815 (use of defendant\u2019s postarrest, post-Miranda silence as evidence of sanity not reversible error where initially introduced by defendant as part of trial strategy).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">\n<em>Judgments reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b560-9\">Rodriguez was out of sight of police for a short period following his interaction with the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b561-6\">Prosecutor: \u201cAnd based on your training and experience, what did you believe was occurring?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">Barkyoumb: \u201cBased upon my training and experience, I believe they were street narcotic transactions taking place.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b561-8\">Barkyoumb\u2019s reference to a \u201cstash\u201d appears to suffer from a similar deficiency. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zavala, </em>52 Mass. App. Ct. at 775-776. The reference was not descriptive of the general manner in which street level drug transactions occur but rather expressed a belief as to what the defendant was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>engaging in and amounts to a prohibited expression of opinion as to the defendant\u2019s guilt.
