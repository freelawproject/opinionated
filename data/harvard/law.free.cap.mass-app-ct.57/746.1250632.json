She claims that the judge erred, as matter of law, by refusing to consider the option of a permanent order at a renewal hearing conducted pursuant to G. L. c. 209A, \u00a7 3.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We agree and remand the case for further hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-13\">The plaintiff was divorced from the defendant in 1998. She first obtained a temporary abuse prevention order against him on October 5, 1999, in the District Court. After a short extension and at a hearing at which the defendant did not appear, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>order was further extended to October 5, 2000.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On that date, the plaintiff and her counsel attended and asked for a permanent order. The defendant again was not present.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">Upon the court clerk\u2019s announcement of the plaintiff\u2019s request, the judge, who had not been previously involved in this case, immediately stated: \u201cI\u2019ll give you a year ... I think due process requires annual review dates. I don\u2019t want to do an indefinite.\u201d In brief exchanges with plaintiff\u2019s counsel, the judge stated: \u201cThere\u2019s a big dispute among judges. Some judges are doing it and some aren\u2019t.\u201d At that point plaintiff\u2019s counsel, apparently referring to <em>Crenshaw </em>v. <em>Macklin, </em>430 Mass. 633 (2000), stated, \u201c[t]he [Supreme Judicial Court] just decided this issue . . . and made clear that a District Court judge has the discretion to issue a permanent order.\u201d The judge replied, \u201cYeah, I know some, some are doing it. ... I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any great harm to due process to come in at least once a year to review what\u2019s going on.\u201d Counsel attempted to persuade the judge that it was difficult for the plaintiff to \u201crelive this year after year,\u201d but the judge said, \u201cI don\u2019t think we as judges make it real difficult for litigants .... I just have a philosophical difference with you. I don\u2019t see the great harm that you do in reviewing these once a year.\u201d Without taking or alluding to any evidence, the judge then denied the request for a permanent order and approved a one-year extension, telling the plaintiff: \u201cMy guess is that maybe half the judges do grant these indefinitely, so next year, you may have a good opportunity to have that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>Following a listing of remedial orders available to \u201c[a] person suffering abuse,\u201d G. L. c. 209A, \u00a7 3, provides: \u201cAny relief granted by the court shall be for a fixed period of time not to exceed one year.\u201d Section 3 further provides that, if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>the plaintiff appears at the time established for the expiration of an initial protective order, \u201cthe court shall determine whether or not to extend the order for any additional time reasonably necessary to protect the plaintiff or to enter a permanent order.\u201d The text and history of those provisions,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> *trial court guidelines,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and dicta in <em>Champagne </em>v. <em>Champagne, </em>429 Mass. 324 (1999),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> may have engendered the type of uncertainty as to the permitted duration of a c. 209A renewal order reflected in the judge\u2019s remarks. Any such confusion was addressed and resolved, however, by <em>Crenshaw </em>v. <em>Macklin, supra, </em>decided about ten months before the renewal hearing in this case. There, the court held that \u201cG. L. c. 209A, \u00a7 3, empowers a judge ... to issue a permanent protective order at a renewal hearing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 633. The court also emphasized that \u201cat a renewal hearing, a judge\u2019s discretion is broad: [a judge] may permit the existing order to expire without renewal; [a judge] may issue a permanent order; or [a judge] may issue an order of shorter duration of \u2018any time reasonably necessary\u2019 to protect the abused person.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 635.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">The judge, as conceded by the plaintiff, clearly recognized that he had discretion to enter a permanent order. This case, therefore, does not fall within the principle that a judge who rules, or demonstrates a belief, that he is without power to grant a permitted order commits error. <em>Crenshaw </em>v. <em>Macklin, supra </em>at 636. See <em>Tazziz </em>v. <em>Tazziz, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 809, 814 &amp; n.5 (1988). It does, however, present the troubling picture of a judge who does not even purport to exercise permitted discretion and instead idiosyncratically applies a self-imposed limitation upon his remedial jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">The proper exercise of judicial discretion involves making a circumstantially fair and reasonable choice within a range of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>permitted options.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Discretion \u201cimplies the absence of a hard- and-fast rule\u201d and may, in some settings, encompass taking no action. <em>Long </em>v. <em>George, 296 </em>Mass. 574, 578 (1937), quoting from <em>Paquette </em>v. <em>Fall River, </em>278 Mass. 172, 174 (1932). Proper exercise of judicial discretion requires more than avoiding \u201carbitrary determination, capricious disposition, or whimsical thinking.\u201d <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Boston Elev. Ry. Co., </em>235 Mass. 482, 496 (1920). It imports a willingness, upon proper request, to consider all of the lawfully available judicial options. \u201cWhere discretion to grant relief exists, a uniform policy of denying relief is error.\u201d <em>Berryman </em>v. <em>United States, </em>378 A.2d 1317, 1320 (D.C. 1977).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \u201cIt is one thing to consider [a] right [to exclude evidence] and exercise it either way, but having been given that right, analogous to discretion, it is the duty of the judge to exercise it, and it is error as a matter of law to refuse to exercise it.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Edgerly, </em>13 Mass. App. Ct. 562, 571 (1982). Similarly, it is error to refuse, on the basis of personal preference or philosophy, a request to give consideration to a permanent order permitted by G. L. c. 209A. We do not intimate that such consideration be extensive or formal, see <em>Zullo </em>v. <em>Goguen, </em>423 Mass. 679, 681 (1996), only that it be conscientious.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b779-7\">We note in passing that the judge\u2019s due process concerns <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>were misplaced. The due process rights of a defendant in a G. L. c. 209A proceeding are amply protected. See <em>Frizado </em>v. <em>Frizado, </em>420 Mass. 592, 596-598 (1995); Guidelines for Judicial Practice: Abuse Protection Proceedings \u00a7 1:02, Due Process Considerations, and \u00a7 6:08, Further Extending a Protective Order (rev. 2000). Also, the \u201cpermanency\u201d of an order is only theoretical, for it always is subject to modification under G. L. c. 209A, \u00a7 3, which provides that \u201c[t]he court may modify its order at any subsequent time upon motion by either party.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">The denial of the plaintiff\u2019s request for a permanent order is vacated, and the matter is remanded to the District Court for further hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b776-14\">In pertinent part, G. L. c. 209A, \u00a7 3, as amended by St. 1990, c. 403, \u00a7 3, states: \u201cIf the plaintiff appears at the court at the date and time the order is to expire, the court shall determine whether or not to extend the order for any additional time reasonably necessary to protect the plaintiff or to enter a permanent order.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b777-7\">At this time the order was modified to require the defendant not to contact the couple\u2019s two minor children and to stay at least one hundred yards away from them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b777-8\">The record indicates that the defendant had a Kansas address. A docket entry on November 6, 2000, states that a return of service was filed indicating the defendant had been served in hand with a copy of the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-9\">The defendant has not filed a brief in this appeal. The certificate of service filed by plaintiffs appellate counsel states that the defendant was served with copies of her brief by first class mail at his Kansas address.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b778-7\">Until 1990, \u00a7 3 did not expressly authorize permanent orders. In that year, an amended version of \u00a7 3 (St. 1990, c. 403, \u00a7 3) explicitly permitted the entry of such an order at a renewal hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b778-9\">As late as December, 2000, Massachusetts Trial Court, Guidelines for Judicial Practice: Abuse Prevention Proceedings \u00a7 6:08 (rev. 1997) stated that an order \u201cmay be extended for up to another year.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b778-10\">In a case addressing whether G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 18, empowered a Probate and Family Court to issue permanent orders, the court in <em>Champagne </em>v. <em>Champagne, supra </em>at 327, stated that \u201c[although parties may receive c. 209A protective orders to supplement a divorce decree, they must renew these protective orders annually.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b779-8\">Most attempts at defining judicial discretion focus on choice. A leading scholar in the field stated: \u201cIf the word discretion conveys to legal minds any solid core of meaning, one central idea above all others, it is the idea of <em>choice\u201d </em>(emphasis original). Rosenberg, Judicial Discretion of the Trial Court, Viewed from Above, 22 Syracuse L. Rev. 635, 636 (1971). See <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>398 A.2d 354, 361 (D.C. 1979) (\u201cDiscretion signifies choice\u201d). For a collection of articles and cases on the subject, see Smithbum, Judicial Discretion (National Judicial College, American Bar Association 1991).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b779-12\">Other jurisdictions have held the application of fixed, mechanical or blanket policies in areas left to judicial discretion to be error. See, e.g., <em>Alamance Indus., Inc. </em>v. <em>Filene\u2019s, </em>291 F.2d 142, 146-147 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 368 U.S. 831 (1961); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hudson, </em>970 F.2d 948, 956 &amp; n.2 (1st Cir. 1992); <em>Olney </em>v. <em>Municipal Ct. for the El Cajon Judicial Dist. of San Diego, </em>133 Cal. App. 3d 455, 462 (1982); <em>In re Marriage of Dillman, </em>478 N.E.2d 86, 89 (Ind. App. 1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>11 N.W.2d 407, 411-412 (Iowa 1943); <em>State </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>124 Ohio App. 3d 423, 428-429 (1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b779-17\">Given the foreclosing nature of the judge\u2019s remarks and the fact that \u201c[a]t a hearing on the plaintiff\u2019s request for an extension ... the plaintiff is not required to re-establish facts sufficient to support that initial grant of an abuse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>prevention order,\u201d <em>Rauseo </em>v. <em>Rauseo, </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. 911, 913 (2001), counsel may be excused from making a formal offer of proof supplementing the information set out in the plaintiff\u2019s affidavit. It is also noteworthy in this regard that the judge extended the initial order without hearing any evidence. Compare <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Gallagher, </em>54 Mass. App. Ct. 883, 890 (2002) (\u201cThe mere fact that a c. 209A order issued in the past, standing alone, is not enough for a judge to conclude, on a request for renewal, that \u2018additional time [is] reasonably necessary to protect the plaintiff.\u2019 G. L. c. 209A, \u00a7 3\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
