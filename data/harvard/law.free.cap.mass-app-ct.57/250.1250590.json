The source of the information was the clerk of the package store, later identified as Joanne LaRochelle, who witnessed the events and called the police right after the vehicle drove away. Based upon that information, the police quickly determined that the car was registered to an owner residing at 127C Auburn Street. Snay drove a short distance to that address and spotted the same vehicle parked in the driveway with the brake lights illuminated, the front facing toward the house. He parked his police cruiser behind the car and approached the vehicle on foot. The defendant was seated behind the steering wheel. At that moment, the defendant opened the driver\u2019s door, and Snay observed that he had a cut on his hand and that there was blood on his trousers and on the inside of the door panel. The defendant admitted that he was injured due to a fall. As a result, Snay called for an ambulance. While awaiting the ambulance, Snay spoke to die defendant and observed \u201cthat his eyes were very watery and bloodshot.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">Based upon these uncontested facts, a criminal complaint issued from District Court charging the defendant with a second offense of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor. The defendant moved to suppress Snay\u2019s observations and any statements that the defendant made to Snay during the entire encounter. The defendant argued that the stop, detention, and search were not justified upon either reasonable suspicion or probable cause. The defendant\u2019s motion succeeded, and the Commonwealth brought an interlocutory appeal pursuant to Mass.R.Crim.P. 15, as appearing in 422 Mass. 1501 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">Before Snay had finished his testimony at the motion hearing, the judge terminated the hearing. It is apparent from the judge\u2019s findings that he viewed Snay\u2019s actions as a pursuit under <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stoute, </em>422 Mass. 782 (1996), and a stop \u201cin the <em>Terry </em>sense.\u201d See <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 21 (1968). Concentrating on the <em>Terry </em>aspect of the case, the judge found that the information related to Snay by the police dispatcher lacked the requisite indicia of reliability and that, therefore, everything that followed could not be justified as a <em>Terry-type </em>stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>Had the judge not terminated the hearing when he did, his skepticism about the stop and subsequent encounter might have lost its edge. When an officer\u2019s conduct is based on a police radio broadcast, the additional layer of hearsay does affect the reliability determination. The cases on this point speak in terms of the need for eliciting the basis of the call. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cheek, </em>413 Mass. 492, 494-495 (1992); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>White, </em>422 Mass. 487, 495-498 (1996); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Medeiros, </em>45 Mass. App. Ct. 240, 242 (1998). Here, however, it is apparent from the record that LaRochelle, who was present in the courtroom in order to testify, would have provided firsthand observations of the event that precipitated her call to the police dispatcher. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Alvarado, </em>423 Mass. 266, 271 (1996); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barbosa, </em>49 Mass. App. Ct. 344, 346 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">The judge, in his findings, questioned whether the telephone call from the package store \u201cactually came from an identified clerk other than [the woman] Snay testified to at the hearing.\u201d The dichotomy the judge constructs is too rigid. As the Supreme Court has many times held, there are situations in which anonymous tips, suitably corroborated, exhibit \u201csufficient indicia of reliability to provide reasonable suspicion to make the investigatory stop.\u201d <em>Alabama </em>v. <em>White, </em>496 U.S. 325, 327 (1990). For example, police observation may corroborate specific, nonobvious facts, showing the tipster is familiar with the suspect\u2019s behavior. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Alvarado, </em>423 Mass. at 271; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Va Meng Joe, </em>425 Mass. 99, 104-105 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">It is also apparent from the judge\u2019s analysis that he overlooked the principle of proportionality. Once the investigative circumstances for a stop are established, the pertinent inquiry is whether \u201cthe degree of intrusion is reasonable in the circumstances.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moses, </em>408 Mass. 136, 141 (1990). What \u201cis permitted is that which is \u2018proportional to the degree of suspicion that prompted the intrusion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid., </em>quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Borges, </em>395 Mass. 788, 794 (1985). As Snay approached the defendant\u2019s vehicle, which had been described by the caller, the defendant opened the door. Keeping in mind that this was a dynamic, not static, endeavor and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>Snay did not order the defendant to exit the vehicle, the defendant\u2019s actions led \u201cto heightened suspicion (justifying further inquiry).\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ciaramitaro, </em>51 Mass. App. Ct. 638, 642 (2001). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>433 Mass. 669, 674 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">The correctness of the ruling on the motion to suppress aside, the larger problem here is that the judge halted Snay\u2019s testimony before the Commonwealth completed its case. So far as appears, LaRochelle was the store clerk who initiated the call, and since she was available as a witness, she could easily have connected the dots because she was more than a \u201cfaceless informer.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Atchue, </em>393 Mass. 343, 347 (1984). The judge could have relaxed the strict requirements of the <em>Aguilar-Spinelli</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>test, which he found were not met at the time he granted the suppression motion. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Atchue, </em>393 Mass. at 347; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burt, </em>393 Mass. 703, 710 (1985); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Love, </em>56 Mass. App. Ct. 229, 232 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">We have observed that a judge may curtail direct or cross-examination if the questions are not relevant or if the relevance is greatly attenuated. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chasson, </em>383 Mass. 183, 187 (1981); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>16 Mass. App. Ct. 935, 936-937 (1983). Appellate courts grant great deference to the trial judge\u2019s resolution of questions of relevance unless there has been \u201cpalpable error.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Young, </em>382 Mass. 448, 463 (1981). Should the line of questions do nothing more than permit the examiner to elicit speculative facts or prolong the interrogation by covering the same ground, then the judge may cut off the questioning. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chretien, </em>383 Mass. 123, 138 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">Here, we conclude that the motion judge wrongly terminated the hearing. In effect, he ruled on the basis of what he had heard from Snay, without giving the prosecutor an opportunity to conduct a redirect examination. LaRochelle could have established the reliability of the radio transmission because she was an identified caller. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Va Meng Joe, </em>425 Mass. at 102-105; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Love, </em>56 Mass. App. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>Ct. at 232.
