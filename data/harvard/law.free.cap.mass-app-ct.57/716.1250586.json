G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13B. He appeals from a conviction based on two incidents encompassed by the indictment. Concluding that the improper use of fresh complaint testimony and other errors deprived the defendant of a fair trial, we reverse the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">1. <em>Facts and procedural history. </em>At the time relevant to prosecution of this case, the defendant worked as a counselor at the Hayden-McFadden Elementary School in New Bedford. The complainant, John,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was referred to the defendant at the end of his fifth grade school year, in late spring of 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">Then ten years old, John lived with his mother, her boyfriend, and John\u2019s younger half-brother. John witnessed drug and alcohol abuse as well as domestic violence in the home. At the time he was referred for counseling, John, although a good student, had been showing increasingly aggressive and defiant behavior at home and at school. The defendant met with John approximately six times during the summer of 1991. The incidents of abuse alleged by John occurred during that spring and summer.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-8\">The defendant continued to meet with John on a weekly basis during the 1991-1992 school year. The sessions focused on John\u2019s emotional responses to his home life and, in particular, his defiance of authority figures. In a session on April 2, 1992, the defendant confronted John about another student\u2019s report that John was involved with, or selling, drugs. John denied the allegation, swore at the defendant, and left his office. Thereafter, John refused to resume counseling. The defendant met once or twice with John following that incident but \u201cgot absolutely nowhere\u201d due to John\u2019s hostility. John completed sixth grade and did not meet with the defendant again.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-9\">That fall (1992), John entered the seventh grade at a local junior high school, where he began to get into trouble for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>number of instances of misbehavior. In December, John received a three-day suspension for fighting and was sent home. At his grandmother\u2019s house, John\u2019s mother and grandmother questioned him for a lengthy period of time about his behavior and the suspension. Both women were angry and upset; the discussion included yelling and screaming. According to John, his mother and grandmother told him that they were going to \u201cput [him] back in counseling.\u201d John responded that he would not go back. He first refused to explain but, after continued questioning, told his mother and grandmother that the defendant had touched him. He would not elaborate, except to name locations where the incidents had taken place.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">The focus of the discussion then turned from John\u2019s behavior and suspension to his allegations against the defendant. Shortly thereafter, John and his mother\u2019s boyfriend drove together to the Bristol County district attorney\u2019s office, where they met with investigator Sherrie Nobre. John and his mother\u2019s boyfriend did most of the talking; John told Nobre that the defendant had touched him, but provided no details other than the location of at least one of the incidents. Nobre arranged for John to return one week later for a \u201cSAIN\u201d (Sexual Abuse Intervention Network) interview.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On December 16, 1992, the SAIN director interviewed John while Nobre and a Department of Social Services agent observed from behind a one-way mirror. Following the SAIN interview, Nobre arranged for John to return the next day for a videotaped interview. In these interviews, as well as in his trial testimony, John made a number of allegations against the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">The defendant was charged with the commission of the crime \u201con divers dates and at divers times.\u201d The verdict slip specified three different incidents for the jury\u2019s consideration. The first allegedly occurred in the defendant\u2019s office at the end of John\u2019s fifth grade year. The second allegedly occurred during the summer, following John\u2019s fifth grade year, in a motel pool. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>third allegedly occurred that same summer in a cemetery near John\u2019s house. In addition to these three incidents for which the defendant was tried, John described other alleged incidents in his SAIN interview, in the videotaped interview, and during his trial testimony. These additional allegations included skinny-dipping at a State park on Cape Cod, another motel pool incident, the defendant\u2019s alleged request that John shower with another young male, and another incident in the defendant\u2019s office at the school.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">The defendant was tried twice in December of 1996; a mistrial was declared in each instance due to the inability of the jury to reach a verdict. A third trial was held between March 20, 1997, and April 2, 1997. At the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s case, the defendant moved for a required finding of not guilty, which was denied. The jury found the defendant guilty on the basis of the swimming pool and cemetery incidents.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">On appeal, the defendant argues that 1) the testimony of investigator Nobre concerning the SAIN interview and the videotape of John\u2019s interview, to which objections were timely made, were erroneously admitted as fresh complaint testimony; 2) although no specific request was made, the trial court improperly failed to give contemporaneous fresh complaint instructions to the jury regarding the testimony of John\u2019s mother and grandmother; 3) the prosecutor impermissibly vouched for the credibility of one of its witnesses, Nobre, during closing argument; 4) defense counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the absence of fresh complaint instructions with respect to John\u2019s mother and grandmother, and to the prosecutor\u2019s improper vouching; and 5) double jeopardy barred the third trial of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">2. <em>Fresh complaint: timeliness. </em>Fresh complaint evidence is admissible for the limited purpose of corroborating the complainant\u2019s testimony and is \u201ccorroborative only if it shows that the complainant seasonably complained of the attack.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fleury, </em>417 Mass. 810, 813 (1994), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Licata, </em>412 Mass. 654, 660 (1992). There is no absolute rule as to the time within which a sexual assault complainant must complain of the assault for that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>complaint to be admissible. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Montanino, </em>409 Mass. 500, 508 (1991). The applicable test is \u201cwhether the [complainant\u2019s] actions were reasonable in the particular circumstances.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Swain, </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. 433, 439 (1994), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McDonough, </em>400 Mass. 639, 652 (1987). In cases involving children, great promptness has not been required; our courts have acknowledged that analysis in such cases should be flexible, with due consideration of factors that reasonably might cause a child to refrain from disclosing abuse to third parties. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Amirault, </em>404 Mass. 221, 229 (1989). Factors relevant to the determination whether a child\u2019s report of sexual abuse was reasonably prompt include (in addition to the length of delay itself): the child\u2019s age; the relationship between the child and the defendant; whether the defendant held a position of trust in the child\u2019s life; whether the defendant threatened or coerced the child; and, \u201cwhere the defendant played some supervisory role in the complainant\u2019s life, the length of time that the complainant was out from under the defendant\u2019s control.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fleury, </em>417 Mass. at 814-815 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">The incidents alleged by John took place in the spring and summer, 1991, when John was ten years old. John\u2019s reporting of the incidents occurred in December, 1992, at age twelve. This disclosure was fifteen months after the last incident alleged<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and eight months after the end of the counseling relationship in April, 1992. While this time span falls within the outer limits of decided cases, we conclude that John\u2019s complaints were \u201con the borderline of admissibility.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Swain, </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. at 441.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">First, with respect to age, although not yet an adolescent, John was an intelligent preteen of considerable self-assurance (sufficient, in fact, unilaterally to terminate counseling with the defendant at age eleven). Second, there was no evidence that the defendant ever threatened, coerced, or intimidated John. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Comtois, </em>399 Mass. 668, 674 (1987); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Amirault, </em>404 Mass. at 229. Third, the defendant\u2019s control over John was minimal at best, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>evidenced by John\u2019s tennination of counseling and resistance to the defendant\u2019s efforts to resume it. Even assuming the defendant\u2019s position as a school counselor is considered supervisory, John was out from under such \u201ccontrol\u201d for eight months prior to reporting the incidents, a considerable period of time. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, </em>387 Mass. 464, 473 (1982) (child victim reported abuse one month after living apart from defendant); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dockham, </em>405 Mass. 618, 626 (1989) (eleven days after child victim out of defendant\u2019s control). Finally, John\u2019s complaint was not spontaneous, but rather occurred during the course of a grilling administered to him by his mother and grandmother on the subject of his own misbehavior. This is not a case in which the disclosure \u201cis triggered by an event, or a change in circumstances, that invests the disclosure with spontaneity and plausibility.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Traynor, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 527, 532 (1996). Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dockham, </em>405 Mass. at 626 (victim\u2019s disclosure of abuse precipitated by his departure from home of abuser); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fleury, </em>417 Mass. at 815 (disclosure triggered by abuser\u2019s return to victim\u2019s home); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hyatt, </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. 488, 490 (1991) (victim\u2019s disclosure triggered by boyfriend\u2019s attempt to kiss her); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McKinnon, </em>35 Mass. App. Ct. 398, 404 (1993) (disclosure triggered by onset of menstruation). The circumstances of John\u2019s revelation, by comparison, \u201cmake it seem less spontaneous and more in the nature of the calculated use of the complaint as a weapon in the course of a vitriolic quarrel.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Traynor, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. at 532.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">Viewed separately, these factors do not render the fresh complaint testimony to have been impermissibly admitted. They must be taken together, however, and considered with the other infirmities of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">3. <em>Fresh complaint: witnesses and instructions. </em>\u201c[RJepetitive testimony from several witnesses regarding the details of the complaint may lend undue credibility to the complainant\u2019s testimony.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Aspen, </em>53 Mass. App. Ct. 259, 268 (2001), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lorenzetti, </em>48 Mass. App. Ct. 37, 42 (1999). While there is no per se rule regarding how many fresh complaint witnesses may testify, <em>ibid., </em>\u201cit is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>plain that the greater the number of fresh complaint witnesses, the greater the risk that fresh complaint testimony will be taken by the jury as substantive evidence that the alleged crimes were actually committed.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brouillard, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 448, 456-457 (1996). To counter this risk, judges have been advised, although not required, to instruct the jury as fresh complaint testimony is admitted, and again during the final charge, that such testimony may not be used as substantive evidence. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Trowbridge, </em>419 Mass. 750, 761 (1995). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lorenzetti, </em>48 Mass. App. Ct. at 39-40. Accordingly, analysis of a \u201cpiling on\u201d claim turns not so much on the number of fresh complaint witnesses, but rather on whether the risk of prejudice to the defendant by repetitive testimony was alleviated by sufficient limiting instructions. Compare, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lamontagne, </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 213, 219-220 (1997) (affirmance where there were five fresh complaint witnesses; judge gave proper limiting instructions before each witness and in final charge), with <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Trowbridge, </em>419 Mass. at 760-762 (reversal where four fresh complaint witnesses testified and there were no contemporaneous instructions).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">In this case, four fresh complaint witnesses testified: John\u2019s mother, his grandmother, investigator Nobre, and, in effect, the videotaped interview of John. The prejudice to the defendant accrued not from the number of witnesses, but rather from the lack of sufficient instruction to the jury regarding their fresh complaint testimony. No fresh complaint instruction preceded the testimony of either John\u2019s mother or his grandmother.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Moreover, no fresh complaint instruction was given before Nobre\u2019s detailed testimony about John\u2019s unrecorded SAIN interview, which included recitation of incidents at the office, the cemetery, and the pool, as well as the additional incidents at the State park (skinny-dipping), and another separate pool incident. An instruction was given <em>after </em>Nobre\u2019s testimony was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>completed for the day,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> prior to showing the videotape to the jury. This instruction purported to apply to both Nobre\u2019s testimony and the videotape.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> However, the judge\u2019s brief and contextually unclear reference to Nobre\u2019s testimony was inadequate to the task of instructing the jury on the limited use of Nobre\u2019s fresh complaint testimony.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Given the lengthy and detailed nature of Nobre\u2019s testimony, this deficiency was significant.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">The judge\u2019s final instructions to the jury regarding fresh complaint were substantively complete. However, they referenced only \u201c[Johnj\u2019s out-of-court statements to Ms. Nobre, either in person to her or recorded on a videotape recording with her.\u201d Assuming this was an adequate reference to Nobre\u2019s testimony, this instruction was still incomplete because it did not reference the earlier fresh complaint testimony of John\u2019s mother and grandmother. Although the testimony of the mother and the grandmother regarding John\u2019s complaint was not detailed, it nevertheless added to the drumbeat of accusation against the defendant. As the jury had not been given contemporaneous fresh complaint instructions regarding the testimony of the mother and grandmother, this omission was also significant.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">\u201cLimiting instructions at the time testimony is offered and again at the end of trial are the primary antidotes to the possibility of improper use\u201d of fresh complaint testimony. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>56 Mass. App. Ct. 337, 345 (2002). In this case, the risk of prejudice arising from the multiple fresh complaint witnesses was not alleviated by adequate limiting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>instructions. Although the number of fresh complaint witnesses was not excessive per se, the combined defects in instruction allowed their testimony to lend undue credibility to John\u2019s testimony, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Licata, </em>412 Mass. at 659-660, and contributed to the risk that the jury would \u201cuse the details of the fresh complaints as substantive evidence that the crime actually occurred.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lavalley, </em>410 Mass. 641, 646 (1991). Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lamontagne, </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. at 220 (proper limiting instruction given before each fresh complaint witness and reiterated in final instructions) with <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lorenzetti, </em>48 Mass. App. Ct. at 40-41 (although contemporaneous instructions were deficient, judge\u2019s final charge properly informed jury of limited use of fresh complaint evidence and witnesses to whom that instruction applied).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">As we noted in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lorenzetti, </em>reversals in fresh complaint cases tend not to rest on a simple lack of contemporaneous instruction, or on improper \u201cpiling on\u201d of witnesses alone. See <em>id. </em>at 41-42. Rather, they involve multiple prejudicial factors or infirmities. See <em>ibid., </em>and cases discussed therein. This is a case of multiple infirmities, as it involves 1) evidence of borderline freshness; 2) multiple fresh complaint witnesses with little other evidence; 3) lack of contemporaneous or final instruction with regard to two witnesses; 4) lack of adequate contemporaneous instruction regarding a third; and 5) as discussed <em>infra, </em>error in allowing self-corroboration by the complainant through the showing of a videotaped interview. While none of these factors alone might serve as the basis for reversal, their cumulative effect must be evaluated to determine whether reversal is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">4. <em>Self-corroboration. </em>\u201c[A] fresh complaint witness may testify both to the fact of the complaint and the details of the complaint as expressed by the complainant.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Peters, </em>429 Mass. 22, 27 (1999). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Washburn, </em>55 Mass. App. Ct. 493, 497 (2002). The <em>complainant, </em>however, \u201cmay testify <em>only </em>to the fact that a fresh complaint was made and to whom it was made\u201d; he or she \u201cshould not be allowed to testify about the details of the complaint\u201d (emphasis original). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Peters, </em>429 Mass. at 30. That is, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>the complainant may not self-corroborate. See <em>id. </em>at 28; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Quincy Q., </em>434 Mass. 859, 869 (2001); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Washburn, </em>55 Mass. App. Ct. at 497.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Quincy Q., supra </em>at 867-869 (decided after trial in this case), a videotape of the complainant describing the details of the sexual assault was held inadmissible as evidence of fresh complaint because it improperly allowed the complainant to self-corroborate. Improper admission of such self-corroborating testimony may not constitute prejudicial error if it is merely cumulative or reiterative of other evidence properly admitted as fresh complaint, or if there are \u201cother reasons as well that establish lack of any prejudice.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Peters, </em>429 Mass. at 30-31.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">In this case, however, the improper admission of John\u2019s self-corroborating testimony was not accompanied by any mitigating factors. To the contrary, this error, combined with the borderline admissibility of John\u2019s complaints to his mother, grandmother, and Nobre; the multiple fresh complaint witnesses; and inadequate instructions on fresh complaint testimony augments the concern created by the erroneous admission of the videotaped testimony. Not only was the videotape introduced, a transcript of it was distributed to the jurors. The jurors asked to see the videotape during their deliberations. The erroneously admitted videotape was, apparently, significant to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">The errors created a particular threat of prejudice because the nature of the evidence against the defendant was \u201cfar from overwhelming.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Trowbridge, </em>419 Mass. at 762. The Commonwealth\u2019s case consisted of John\u2019s description of the events alleged and repetition of these accusations by several other witnesses. See <em>ibid. </em>(Commonwealth\u2019s case, lacking physical evidence and containing evidence that raised questions as to complainant\u2019s veracity, relied \u201con a significant amount of fresh complaint testimony.\u201d) See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mazzone, </em>55 Mass. App. Ct. 345, 353 (2002). The case, in other words, depended entirely on the credibility of the complainant improperly bolstered by self-corroboration and \u201cborderline\u201d fresh complaint testimony given with inadequate limiting instructions. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brouillard, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. at 457. The combination of errors requires reversal. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mazzone, supra </em>at 353. Additionally, when \u201c[w]e examine [the erroneously admitted evidence] in the context of the entire case against the defendant to determine whether its admission prejudiced the defendant in some significant way,\u201d we conclude that it did. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Estoves, </em>429 Mass. 636, 639 (1999), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cyr, </em>425 Mass. 89, 95 (1997). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cruz, </em>53 Mass. App. Ct. 393, 407 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">5. <em>Double jeopardy and other claims. </em>The defendant contends that his third trial was barred on double jeopardy grounds, because, inter alla, 1) there was no \u201cmanifest necessity\u201d for declaration of the first two mistrials, and he opposed such declarations; 2) the two deadlocked juries raise a presumption that the Commonwealth failed to produce sufficient evidence of his guilt; and 3) he would have been acquitted in the first two trials but for Nobre\u2019s reckless and distorted testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">These arguments are without merit. First, a deadlocked jury is \u201cthe \u2018prototypical example\u2019 of a manifest necessity for a judge to declare a mistrial.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>432 Mass. 746, 751 (2000), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Andrews, </em>403 Mass. 441, 448-449 (1988). Contrary to his assertion, the defendant assented to the declaration of a mistrial after jury deadlock in the first trial (as did the Commonwealth), and moved for a mistrial after jury deadlock in the second trial. No principle of double jeopardy bars retrial under such circumstances. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Andrews, </em>403 Mass. at 447-448, quoting from <em>Oregon </em>v. <em>Kennedy, </em>456 U.S. 667, 683 (1982) (Stevens, J. concurring) (\u201cdefendant\u2019s motion for, or consent to, a mistrial removes any double jeopardy bar to reprosecution,\u201d absent prosecutorial overreaching or harassment).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">The defendant moved for a required finding of not guilty in both the first and second trials. The motions were denied. Prior to the third trial, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss the indictment in light of insufficient evidence of guilt. The motion was denied after hearing by the trial judge, and the defendant filed a petition in the Supreme Judicial Court, in accordance with the provisions set forth in G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, appealing from the denial of the motion. A single justice of that court concluded that the evidence was \u201cclearly sufficient to warrant a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>finding by the jury under the <em>[Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 676-678 (1979),] standard of the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d and denied the relief requested in the petition. Commonwealth vs. Howell, SJ-97-0156 (Mar. 19, 1997). The defendant does not now argue or make any showing that there was insufficient evidence at the second trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">The defendant\u2019s remaining claims as to double jeopardy are without merit. The defendant has failed to demonstrate that Nobre\u2019s testimony was either distorted or reckless in the first two trials.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">Because we conclude that the conviction must be reversed, we need not address the issues of ineffective assistance of counsel and prosecutorial vouching in the closing argument. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Trowbridge, </em>419 Mass. at 762 n.7.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b757-8\">\n<em>Verdict set aside.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b747-10\">A pseudonym.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b748-7\">A SAIN interview, observed by representatives from several authorities (i.e., Department of Social Services, police department, etc.) behind a one-way mirror, spares a child complainant from undergoing repeated questioning regarding sensitive matters related to ascertaining whether sexual abuse has occurred.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b750-7\">This assumes that the last event occurred in August, 1991.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b752-6\">While there was no specific request from defense counsel that such instructions be given as to these two witnesses, we are not persuaded by the Commonwealth\u2019s argument that defense counsel\u2019s failure to request them was a tactical decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b753-7\">Nobre\u2019s testimony continued on the next day of trial. No fresh complaint instruction was given that day prior to the resumption of her testimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b753-8\">The instruction included the following statement: \u201c[Johnj\u2019s out-of-court statements to this witness Ms. Nobre both on the 16th of December, 1992, as to which the witness has given testimony, and to this witness on the 17th of December with respect to the videotape recording, those out-of-court statements by [John] to this witness reporting that [John] was sexually assaulted cannot he considered by you the jury unless you first determine that [John\u2019s] statements were reasonably prompt in light of all the circumstances.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b753-9\">Moreover, the record suggests that the jurors\u2019 attention was not given over to the judge at the time he gave these instructions. The transcript of the videotape had been distributed and the jurors had begun to read it. Consequently, the judge had to ask for their attention twice during his instruction.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
