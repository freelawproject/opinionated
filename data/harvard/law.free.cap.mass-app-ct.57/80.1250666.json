Probation had been imposed on November 16, 1999, in Brighton District Court, after the defendant admitted to sufficient facts to warrant a finding of guilty on a charge of operating a motor vehicle under a suspended license. The judge continued the case without a finding and placed the defendant under the supervision of a probation officer on terms that, among others, required that he \u201cobey all court orders and local, [Sjtate and [Fjederal laws\u201d until May 19, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">On January 2, 2000, the defendant was stopped by the Mash-pee police on his way home from a football game. The stop resulted in new charges being lodged against the defendant in Falmouth District Court for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol and operating a motor vehicle under a suspended license. The new offense triggered the issuance of a written notice of a probation violation from the Brighton District Court, stating the defendant was not in compliance with the terms of his probation because of the new complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">After a hearing on March 3, 2000, the judge found that the defendant had violated the terms of his probation on the basis of his admission to the Mashpee police during his arrest that he had driven his car earlier in the day. The judge entered a guilty finding,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and modified the terms of probation by extending the probationary period to one year from the date of the hearing and imposing a suspended, ten-day house of correction sentence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">On appeal, the defendant argues that the entry of a guilty finding and the order modifying the terms of his probation should be reversed because (1) the grounds stated as the reason for revoking his probation were different from those for which he had received written notification; (2) the defendant\u2019s admis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>sion was unreliable, because the police officer who testified was unsure of the exact statement, and because it was contradicted by other information contained in the police reports; (3) the admission was insufficient, as a matter of law, to support a finding that he had violated the law, because it was uncorroborated; and (4) his admission was not the product of voluntary actions, because at the time of the admission he was intoxicated, and prior to his admission he had not been given his Miranda warnings. We affirm the revocation decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">We summarize the relevant facts as presented at the revocation hearing. On January 2, 2000, Officer Jon Read of the Mash-pee police department was traveling northbound on Route 130. He was forced to steer his police cruiser to the right in order to avoid being hit by a green sport utility vehicle that had crossed the center fine. Read testified at the hearing that he was unable to see who was driving or how many people were in the vehicle. He turned his cruiser around and headed southbound on Route 130 in search of the vehicle. Read found it parked at the side of the road. Read observed the defendant standing toward the back of the vehicle, on the driver\u2019s side.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">Read stopped, got out, and walked toward the defendant. As Read approached, the defendant walked to the passenger side of the vehicle, sat in the passenger seat, and began to look through the glove box. Read asked the defendant where the driver was; the defendant did not respond.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At about that time, another individual, Kevin Crosby, the defendant\u2019s son-in-law, emerged from the woods by the side of the road, where he apparently had been urinating. Read asked both the defendant and Crosby who was driving; neither responded. Read observed food and a cooler with numerous beers in it in the rear of the vehicle. Read determined that the defendant was the owner of the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">Read determined that both the defendant and Crosby were under the influence of alcohol, and placed both in protective custody. Officer Paul Coronel\u00eda was called and arrived at the scene. The defendant was placed in the rear of Coronel\u00eda\u2019s police car and Crosby was placed in the rear of Read\u2019s police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>car, both for transportation to the police station. En route to the station, Crosby had a conversation with Read in which Crosby stated that the defendant was the driver. When Read arrived at the station with Crosby, he informed Coronel\u00eda that Crosby had implicated the defendant as the driver. Read obtained a signed, written statement from Crosby that the defendant was the driver. After conducting sobriety tests, which he said the defendant failed, Coronel\u00eda placed the defendant under arrest for operating the motor vehicle on Route 130 while under the influence of intoxicating liquor. A breathalyzer test revealed the defendant to have a blood alcohol reading of .16. Officer Sean Sullivan, who had been called to inventory the contents of the defendant\u2019s vehicle at the scene, stated in his report that, at the station, he noticed that both the defendant and Crosby \u201cexhibited extreme symptoms of intoxication.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">Coronel\u00eda\u2019s report of the booking procedure stated that the defendant was read and understood his Miranda rights. Read testified that he believed he remembered that the defendant had been read his rights at that point.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">According to both Coronel\u00eda\u2019s and Read\u2019s reports, after the booking procedure, the defendant was again asked how he had arrived at the football game that day. Both Coronel\u00eda\u2019s and Read\u2019s reports explain that the defendant answered that he drove from his house in Brockton to his son-in-law\u2019s, Crosby\u2019s, home in East Bridgewater. Crosby then drove the defendant\u2019s vehicle to the game. When pressed on this point during cross-examination, Read testified that he had no memory of the defendant telling him that his sister had given him a ride to Crosby\u2019s house, but acknowledged that it was \u201cpossible\u201d the defendant had made such a comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">The judge did not credit Crosby\u2019s statement, as related by Officer Read, that the defendant had been driving the vehicle at the time it was stopped. Rather, the judge credited the defendant\u2019s admission, as reported by Coronel\u00eda and Read, that he had driven from his house to Crosby\u2019s house, the first leg of the trip to the football game.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b112-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>On these facts, the defendant raises several issues implicating due process; we find no merit to his contentions and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\"><em>Written Notification. </em>The defendant first argues that the written notice of surrender referenced only the two charges for which he was arrested by the Mashpee police, and contained no reference to the uncharged misconduct that occurred earlier in the day, when he drove from his home to Crosby\u2019s home under a suspended license. The issue was first raised in the defendant\u2019s second motion for reconsideration, which was denied by the judge who had found a probation violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-13\">We agree with the defendant that the written notice was limited on its face to the two charges filed in connection with the incident that occurred on Route 130, and that the notice of violation of probation did not include mention of his operating the motor vehicle on a public way earlier in the day.* ***<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Commonwealth appears to concede that, because of lack of notice, the earlier operation cannot form the basis of the instant revocation. We disagree.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b112-21\">While there can be no doubt that written notice of the claimed violations are included among the \u201cminimum requirements of due process,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Darling, </em>407 Mass. 108, 112-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>113 (1990),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> due process is not an inflexible concept. <em>Ibid. </em>Flexibility is important both to insure the offender the opportunity inherent in the grant of conditional liberty that probation affords, and to insure the Commonwealth the ability to deal expeditiously with a violation of that opportunity. See <em>id. </em>at 113-116. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sheridan, </em>51 Mass. App. Ct. 74, 76-77 (2001). A probation revocation is not a criminal prosecution. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Durling, </em>407 Mass. at 112.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">In this case, the written notice did not specifically state the basis upon which the judge based the revocation. The defendant\u2019s admission, however, of having driven the vehicle earlier in the day was included in the police reports that were generated in relation to the charges listed on the notice of probation violation. In any event, assuming that the failure to specifically enumerate the misconduct on the face of the notice constitutes error, the issue remains whether the defendant was afforded due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">We conclude that the actions of defense counsel in introducing the issue at the inception of the hearing, and in vigorously cross-examining the officer on the issue, amply support the conclusion that any error here was harmless. For example, at the opening of the hearing, counsel indicated that the defendant\u2019s principal concern was with the then-pending operating under the influence charge. With respect to the remaining issue, operating after suspension of Acense, she indicated a willingness to admit if the court were to accept a recommended disposition on the probation violation. After discussion about a possible disposition, counsel told the judge the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-7\">\u201cThere is a second matter of operating after a suspended license. <em>And there are two incidents of operation, one of which I understand my client is accused of admitting that he did. </em>I\u2019m not saying that is his position, but in the police report it indicates something to that effect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-8\">\u201cIf we could just go forward with regard to that issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>and not stipulate to the OUI, it would still be a technical violation.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">At a later stage in the proceeding, counsel engaged in vigor-pus cross-examination of the officer with regard to the defendant\u2019s statement that he had driven the car earlier in the day, and went so far as to elicit a statement from the officer that the defendant might also have told him that a family member, rather than the defendant, drove the car to Crosby\u2019s house. Counsel was amply prepared at the start of the hearing to consider the issue of the defendant\u2019s admitting to the first occasion of driving after suspension of his license. On the facts of this case, the defendant is unable to demonstrate prejudice resulting from any lack of notice, and this failure to show prejudice is fatal to his claim of error. See <em>Delisle </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>416 Mass. 359, 362 (1993). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Odoardi, </em>397 Mass. 28, 31-32 (1986). Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Streeter, </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. 128, 131-132 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-20\"><em>Exclusion of the evidence. </em>The defendant next contends that his admission to police that he had been driving earlier in the day should have been excluded because (a) the statement was made either prior to his being given his Miranda warnings or, if made after the warnings, his waiver was not knowing, voluntary, or intelligent due to his state of intoxication; (b) again due to his state of intoxication, the statement was not made voluntarily for the purposes of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights and therefore should not have been considered; and (c) the alleged admission was unreliable and insufficient to form the basis of the probation surrender, since it lacked corroborative evidence and was contradicted by informatian contained in the police reports. We disagree with all three contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-35\">(a) <em>Miranda issue. </em>Contrary to the defendant\u2019s contention, the evidence adduced at the hearing amply demonstrates that he was afforded his Miranda rights before he made the statement that formed the basis of the violation. The record shows that the conversation reported by Coronel\u00eda, in which the defendant admitted to driving the vehicle that morning, took place after</p>\n<p id=\"AzB\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>the defendant had been given his warnings; Read\u2019s testimony at the hearing supports this version of events.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AV3\">Moreover, even were we to agree that the defendant\u2019s admission was obtained prior to his being given his Miranda rights, the statements were admissible. Following the rationale established in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Calandra, </em>414 U.S. 338 (1974), and in certain other Federal cases dealing with the use of evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment, the Supreme Judicial Court, in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vincente, </em>405 Mass. 278, 279-281 (1989), ruled that, even though certain statements made by a defendant were properly suppressed at trial as having been obtained in violation of the defendant\u2019s Miranda rights, those same inculpatory statements, perhaps subject to certain considerations not present here, might properly provide the basis for a probation surrender. Where, as here, the primary focus of the police inquiry, including the arrest of the defendant and Crosby for reasons of protective custody, and the ensuing questioning, sobriety tests, and ultimate charge were to prosecute the incident of driving under the influence, the exclusion at a probation revocation hearing of the defendant\u2019s statement would be unlikely to serve any deterrent purpose. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Olsen, </em>405 Mass. 491, 493-494 (1989). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vincente, supra </em>at 280.</p>\n<p id=\"ANi\">(b) <em>Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment voluntariness. </em>Simon next argues that the statement he made at the police station should have been inadmissible at the probation revocation hearing, on the basis that it was not made voluntarily due to his intoxication, and therefore was taken in violation of his Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment due process rights. The defendant\u2019s claim of intoxication, standing alone, is insufficient to establish <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>that his statement was involuntary. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Griffin, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 174, 183 &amp; n.8 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">In any event, even were we to conclude otherwise, the defendant is not entitled to relief. In the context of a criminal trial, where evidence of intoxication has been presented, and the voluntariness of statements is in issue, even where there is no question that Miranda warnings were given before a defendant made admissions, a trial judge is obliged to make an affirmative finding on the voluntariness of those admissions under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments before a jury is allowed to consider them. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Van Melkebeke, </em>48 Mass. App. Ct. 364, 366 (1997). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mello, </em>420 Mass. 375, 383 (1995) (\u201cspecial care is taken to review the issue of voluntariness where the defendant claims to have been under the influence of drugs or alcohol\u201d). Such special care with regard to intoxication is necessary; the United States Supreme Court has noted, \u201cas interrogators have turned to more subtle forms of psychological persuasion, courts have found the mental condition of the defendant a more significant factor in the \u2018voluntariness\u2019 calculus.\u201d <em>Colorado </em>v. <em>Connelly, </em>479 U.S. 157, 164 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-24\">Although we have found no case in Massachusetts that resolves whether a similarly careful inquiry to determine admissibility need take place on the bases of Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment due process at a probation revocation hearing, we find instructive the reasoning in the decisional law related to Fourth Amendment violations. In such circumstances, most Federal courts refuse to apply the exclusionary rule to probation revocation proceedings absent evidence of police harassment, or at least police knowledge of the petitioner\u2019s probationary status. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gravina, </em>906 F. Supp. 50, 53-54 (D. Mass. 1995).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Nothing in the evidence here points to police harassment when the defendant was interviewed or when he made the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>statement after being read his Miranda rights. Compare <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gravina, supra </em>at 54, quoting from <em>United States </em>v. <em>James, </em>893 F. Supp. 649, 650-651 (E.D. Tex. 1995) (\u201can element of constancy should be present in the type of harassment necessary to invoke the exclusionary rule .... [W]here harassment may be a singular act, at least some irregularity in the conduct of the police officials must be present\u201d). While the police officers were aware of Simon\u2019s probationary status, only two Federal jurisdictions exclude statements for this reason alone.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gravina, supra </em>at 53-54. See also note 9, <em>supra. </em>Further, the police had already placed the defendant under arrest for driving under the influence, and the record shows that their inquiry was targeted to elicit evidence in support of a conviction on that offense, rather than for the purpose of eliciting information by which probation could be revoked. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vincente, </em>405 Mass. at 280, and cases cited (\u201cThe Federal courts have concluded that, in most instances, a police officer is primarily interested in obtaining evidence with which to convict a defendant. Revocation of probation is generally only a minor consideration, and therefore the risk that illegally obtained evidence might be excluded from such proceedings is likely to have only a marginal additional deterrent effect on illegal police misconduct\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">In addition, we note that the United States Supreme Court has drawn no distinction in its analysis of the \u201cvoluntary\u201d waiver of the personal right against self-incrimination protected by the Miranda warnings on the one hand, and the due process-based \u201cvoluntariness\u201d of a statement protected by the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments on the other hand. See <em>Colorado </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number><em>Connelly, </em>479 U.S. at 169-170. Similarly, the Supreme Court \u201ccautioned against expanding \u2018currently applicable exclusionary rules,\u2019 \u201d into an area where they could serve little purpose in the protection of constitutional guarantees against police overreaching. See <em>id, </em>at 166, quoting from <em>Lego </em>v. <em>Twomey, </em>404 U.S. 477, 488-489 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-9\">We see no reason that the exclusionary rule be applied in these circumstances. \u201cIn Federal law and in most jurisdictions, the exclusionary rule does not apply as a matter of course to probation revocation proceedings because the \u2018application of the exclusionary rule is restricted to those areas where its remedial objectives are thought most efficaciously served.\u2019 See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vincente, supra </em>at 280, quoting [from] <em>United States </em>v. <em>Calandra, </em>414 U.S. 338, 348 (1974).\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Olsen, </em>405 Mass. at 493. \u201c \u2018Evidence that a probationer is not complying with the conditions of probation may indicate that he or she has not been rehabilitated and continues to pose a threat to the public.\u2019 <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vincente, supra </em>at 280. Accordingly, \u2018the State has an overwhelming interest in being able to return an individual to imprisonment without the burden of a new adversary criminal trial if in fact [the probationer] has failed to abide by the conditions of his [or her probation].\u2019 <em>Morrissey </em>[v. <em>Brewer, </em>408 U.S. 471,] 483 [(1972)]. We weigh this overwhelming State interest in admitting all reliable evidence against the deterrent purpose of the exclusionary rule.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Olsen, supra </em>at 493-494.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-29\">Thus, we conclude that the exclusionary rule does not render the defendant\u2019s statement inadmissible, even were we to determine that the statement had been given involuntarily, when, as here, there is no evidence that the statement was the product of police harassment or the result of a police focus to obtain evidence specifically for a probation revocation hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-35\">(c) <em>Reliability of the admission. </em>Simon finally argues that the statement, that he operated the vehicle from his home to Crosby\u2019s home that morning, is insufficiently rehable, first because it is unsubstantiated by other corroborating evidence, and, second, because it is hearsay, reported by one officer, and contradicted by other evidence in the hearing. Although a probation revocatian hearing is not a criminal trial, and the defendant need not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>be given the \u201cfull panoply of constitutional protections,\u201d due process requires that probationers be afforded some protections upon an attempt to revoke their probation, as liberty interests are at stake. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Durling, </em>407 Mass. at 112. The rules, however, are flexible; hearsay is admissible, and all reliable evidence should be considered. See <em>id. </em>at 113-117. Even the right of confrontation may be denied if the \u201chearing officer specifically finds good cause for not allowing confrontation.\u201d <em>Gagnon </em>v. <em>Scarpelli, </em>411 U.S. 778, 786 (1973). See <em>Durling, supra </em>at 115. At a revocation hearing, due process has the ultimate goal of providing an accurate determination as to whether revocation is proper. See <em>Durling, supra </em>at 116.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">Here, there was ample evidence to corroborate the defendant\u2019s statement. It is undisputed that the two went to the football game in the defendant\u2019s car. The defendant lived a distance from Crosby\u2019s home, and the two were returning there when they were stopped by the police. No other explanation was offered of how the defendant and his vehicle got from his home to Crosby\u2019s.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The cases cited by the defendant in his brief, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Forde, </em>392 Mass. 453, 457 (1984), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Leonard, </em>401 Mass. 470, 473 (1988), are inapposite; in neither case was there anything at all to corroborate the admission. As there was corroboration in this instance, we need not reach the issue whether corroboration is in fact necessary for an admission in the context of a hearing on surrender.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">As to the claim that the hearsay was unreliable, we note only that Read testified that he was present when the defendant admitted to driving earlier in the day, and that he had made a note of it in his police report. Read was present at the hearing and subject to cross-examination. The statement was an admission against interest made by the defendant to police officers at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>a time when the officers were investigating him for another alleged crime, operating under the influence. The defendant, though present in court, chose to remain silent. Declarations against penal interest are admissible for the truth of the matters asserted. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cruz, </em>53 Mass. App. Ct. 393, 401 (2001); Liacos, Brodin &amp; Avery, Massachusetts Evidence \u00a7 8.10, at 516 (7th ed. 1999).

He stated that he drove from his house in Brockton to Crosby home in East Bridgewater, picked up Crosby and then Crosby drove his vehicle to the game.\u201d Read verified during his testimony at the hearing that the statements were made after Miranda warnings were read at the station.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b116-36\">The United States District Court for Massachusetts explained: (1) the Third, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, Ninth, and Tenth Circuits have refused to apply the exclusionary rule to evidence seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment when determining probation, parole, or supervised release revocatian; (2) most of these jurisdictions provide an exception that such evidence is inadmissible where the defendant suffered harassment; (3) the Second Circuit applies the exclusionary rule where the probation officer is aware of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>target\u2019s probationary status, but not where a police officer is unaware of that status; and (4) the Fourth Circuit \u201cstands alone\u201d in excluding all evidence obtained by unconstitutional searches from probation revocation hearings. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gravina, supra, </em>and cases cited. See also Annot., Admissibility, in Federal Probation Revocation Proceeding, of Evidence Obtained Through Unreasonable Search and Seizure or in Absence of Miranda Warnings, 30 A.L.R. Fed. 824, 829-835 (1976 &amp; Supp. 2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b117-7\">The Supreme Judicial Court, in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Olsen, </em>405 Mass. 491, 496 (1989), expressly left open the question whether a police officer\u2019s knowledge of a probationer\u2019s status would compel exclusion of evidence obtained.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b119-7\">Defense counsel makes much of the fact that on cross-examination, Read admitted that it was possible that he had been told that a family member had driven the defendant from his home to Crosby\u2019s home. This statement came after vigorous cross-examination in which Read stated that he did not recall any statement that the defendant had made to the effect that a family member had driven to Crosby\u2019s. Any determination of the weight and credibility of Read\u2019s testimony was for the judge, and the contradiction was not so egregious as to cause us to conclude that the judge committed plain error.
