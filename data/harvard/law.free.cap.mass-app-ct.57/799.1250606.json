Cicatelli, appeals a judgment of the Land Court affirming a decision of the board of appeals of Wakefield (board). The board had upheld the Wakefield building inspector\u2019s denial of the plaintiff\u2019s applications for permits to build houses on two lots. The building inspector had based his denials on his determination that the proposed construction would contravene a recent zoning by-law amendment. The plaintiff asserts that the amendment cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>lawfully be applied to Ms lots, because they were protected by the three-year zomng \u201cfreeze\u201d of G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6, sixth par.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On the undisputed facts, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">On September 10, 1996, Joseph and Mary Nigro, the plaintiff\u2019s predecessors in title, submitted a plan to the planmng board for endorsement, pursuant to G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81P, that \u201capproval under the subdivision control law [was] not required\u201d (ANR plan). The planning board properly endorsed the plan (wMch created four lots, numbered 1-4, out of a single parcel, all of wMch lots had frontage on a public way, see G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81L) on September 30, 1996. (See Appendix.) At the time of the endorsement, a house stood on what became lot 2. The other three lots were undeveloped.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">On November 12, 1996, a zoning by-law amendment, referred to as the \u201cfront-to-back\u201d amendment (now codified as \u00a7 190-35 of the town zoning by-laws), was adopted by town meeting. It provided, in pertinent part, that \u201c[n]o lot on wMch any building is located shall be divided or subdivided in such a way that the original front yard of such existing building shall face the rear yard ... of any proposed lot or lots.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b830-7\">The Nigros subsequently applied for and were issued a building permit to construct a house on lot 1. On August 17, 1997, however, the board demed their request for a variance from the front-to-back amendment wMch would have allowed the Nigros to build houses on lots 3 and 4. The Nigros sold lots 3 and 4 to the plaintiff in 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-8\">On April 26, 1999, well witMn three years of the submission of the ANR plan, the plaintiff filed applications for building permits to construct houses on lots 3 and 4, asserting that such uses were protected by the three-year zoning \u201cfreeze\u201d of G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6, sixth par. The building inspector denied the applications as contrary to the front-to-back amendment. On June <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>29, 1999, following a hearing on the plaintiff\u2019s appeal, the board upheld the building inspector\u2019s denials. It concluded that the front-to-back amendment was a dimensional and not a use regulation and was therefore applicable to the land shown on the ANR plan even within the three-year freeze period.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">On the plaintiff\u2019s appeal pursuant to G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17, a judge of the Land Court affirmed the board\u2019s decision. The judge agreed that the front-to-back amendment was a dimensional regulation, the application of which to the locus did not result in a de facto use regulation violative of the statutory zoning freeze. Her conclusion rested on the premise that the impact of the amendment was to be gouged with respect to the subdivided parcel as a whole and not the individual lots. Such an analysis revealed that application of the amendment did not unreasonably impair the plaintiff\u2019s right to develop his land or negate the protection afforded by G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6, sixth par. The judge buttressed her holding by reference to the language of the statute, its legislative history, and Supreme Judicial Court precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">Having carefully considered the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we conclude there is no basis to disturb the Land Court judge\u2019s thoughtful decision, the reasoning of which, summarized below, we adopt.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-7\">\u201cThe statutory zoning freeze provides landowners with protection from amendments to zoning laws that would unpredictably and unfairly burden the development of their land.\u201d <em>Heritage Park Dev. Corp. </em>v. <em>Southbridge, </em>424 Mass. 71, 76 (1997). On its face, the front-to-back amendment is a dimensional regulation and not a regulation of the \u201cuse of the land,\u201d so that it is prima facie applicable to lots 3 and 4 notwithstanding the statutory freeze.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-8\">The plaintiff argues, however, that the amendment is a de facto use regulation. A dimensional regulation amounts to a de facto use regulation if its impact as a practical matter eliminates or virtually nullifies a protected use (here residential <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>development). See <em>Bellows Farms, Inc. </em>v. <em>Building Inspector of Acton, </em>364 Mass. 253, 260-261 (1973); <em>Cape Ann Land Dev. Corp. </em>v. <em>Gloucester, </em>371 Mass. 19, 22, 24 (1976), <em>S.C., </em>374 Mass. 825 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\">The scope of this principle is, however, narrow, as demonstrated by the <em>Bellows Farms </em>case. There, the plaintiffs submitted an ANR plan at a time when applicable zoning laws allowed them to construct a maximum of 435 residential apartments. Soon thereafter, the town passed dimensional zoning amendments relating to off-street parking, intensity of use standards, and site plan approvals. The amendments effectively reduced the number of buildable apartments to 203. <em>Bellows Farms, Inc. </em>v. <em>Building Inspector of Acton, </em>364 Mass. at 260. Despite the amendments\u2019 effecting a substantial reduction in the number of buildable units, the court concluded that the zoning amendments were not de facto use regulations, because they \u201cdid not constitute or otherwise amount to a total or virtual prohibition of the use of the locus for apartment units,\u201d a significant number of which could still be constructed. <em>Ibid.</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>That a dimensional regulation results in a reduction in the scope or extent of a plan\u2019s protected use \u2014 even a great reduction, as in <em>Bellows Farms </em>\u2014 does not, therefore, warrant its characterization as a de facto use regulation undermining the protection of the G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6, sixth par., zoning freeze.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">The judge rejected the plaintiff\u2019s contention that the board\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>application of the front-to-back amendment revealed its true nature as a de facto use regulation because it imposed a \u201cvirtual or total prohibition\u201d of the protected residential use of lots 3 and 4. The judge reasoned that the phrase \u201cuse of the land shown on [the] plan\u201d in G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6, sixth par. (see note 2, <em>supra), </em>meant that the zoning freeze attached to the original undivided parcel of land as a whole, rather than providing use protection for the individual subdivided lots. Consequently, the amendment precluded residential development on only half, not all, of that parcel. While acknowledging that the issue of the meaning of the words \u201cuse of the land\u201d in \u00a7 6, sixth par., had not been expressly addressed in any appellate decision, the judge appropriately looked for support for her construction to the Supreme Judicial Court\u2019s interpretation of essentially identical language used in G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6, fifth par.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">In <em>Massachusetts Broken Stone Co. </em>v. <em>Weston, </em>430 Mass. 637, 640-641 (2000), the court held that the eight-year zoning freeze for definitive subdivision plans under G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6, fifth par.,* ****<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> applies to the entirety of the land subject to the approved plan, not to the particular lots shown thereon, even if the original subdivision is significantly altered after its approval. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>The court declared that the statutory language, the \u201cland shown on such plan,\u201d was \u201cclear and unambiguous\u201d in that respect. <em>Id. </em>at 640.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">The Land Court judge correctly saw the holding in <em>Massachusetts Broken Stone Co. </em>as supporting the same conclusion here. The use of the phrase \u201cthe land shown on such plan\u201d in G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6, sixth par., must be deemed to reflect a similar intention that the use freeze be applicable to the parcel of land shown on the ANR plan in its entirety, rather than providing protection for the individual subdivided lots. See <em>Plymouth County Nuclear Information Comm., Inc. </em>v. <em>Energy Facilities Siting Council, </em>374 Mass. 236, 240 (1978); <em>Beeler </em>v. <em>Downey, </em>387 Mass. 609, 617 (1982); <em>Green </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Provincetown, </em>404 Mass. 571, 573 (1989); <em>Clark Equip. Co. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Insurers Insolvency Fund, </em>423 Mass. 165, 168 (1996) (all holding that the same words used in different sections of a statute, including G. L. c. 40A, should be given the same meaning).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">The judge\u2019s construction was reinforced by her examination of the legislative history of G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6, sixth par., as discussed in <em>Bellows Farms. </em>There, the court noted that G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 7A (the statutory predecessor to G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6, sixth par.), had provided that \u201c[n]o amendment to any zoning ordinance or by-law shall apply to or affect <em>any lot </em>shown on [an ANR plan]\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Bellows Farms, Inc. </em>v. <em>Building Inspector of Acton, </em>364 Mass. at 258. Specifically addressing the linguistic change from \u201cany lot\u201d in the version of \u00a7 7A enacted in 1960 to the \u201cuse of the land\u201d in a later amendment to \u00a7 7A, the court discerned a legislative intent in amending \u00a7 7A to narrow the freeze protection afforded landowners against subsequent zoning amendments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-7\">\u201cThe use of the different language in the current statute indicates a legislative intent to grant a more limited survival of pre-amendment rights under amended zoning ordinances and by-laws. We cannot ignore the fact that although the earlier statute protected without restriction \u2018any lot\u2019 shown on a plan from being affected by a zoning amendment, the later statute purports to protect only \u2018the use of the land\u2019 shown on a plan from the effect of such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>an amendment. None of the words of the present statute should be treated as superfluous.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">\n<em>Ibid.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">The judge accurately noted that the board\u2019s application of the front-to-back amendment, while preventing the plaintiff\u2019s desired construction on lots 3 and 4, did not impermissibly curtail the reasonable \u201cuse\u201d of the plaintiff\u2019s predecessor\u2019s original parcel of \u201cland\u201d for the freeze-protected purpose of home construction. Far from imposing a \u201ctotal or virtual prohibition\u201d on such a use, the amendment left the plaintiff\u2019s predecessor with a parcel, half of which could be residentially developed.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Compare <em>Bellows Farms, Inc. </em>v. <em>Building Inspector of Acton, </em>364 Mass. at 254-255, 261 (postplan dimensional zoning amendment, leaving the plaintiffs with the ability to develop fewer than half the desired apartment units, was nonetheless applicable to the locus).</p>\n<p id=\"b835-7\">In short, we agree entirely with the Land Court judge\u2019s determination that the Wakefield front-to-back amendment was a dimensional regulation, the application of which to the plaintiff\u2019s lots 3 and 4 did not impermissibly deprive him of the protection to which he was entitled under G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6, sixth par.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"pA6_\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b830-9\">This statute pertinently provides: \u201cWhen a plan referred to in [G.
