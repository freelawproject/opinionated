He held the document folded over in such a fashion as to conceal its text and any other identifying information. Although initially resistant to their father\u2019s demands, each son eventually signed his name, after the father harshly persisted and told each that the document was \u201cfor the bank,\u201d which was false. Upon the father\u2019s death approximately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>ten years later, the three sons learned that the document they had signed that Easter Sunday was a deed conveying each son\u2019s one-quarter remainder interest in the family home to their father and their sister, jointly with right of survivorship. The sons sought declaratory relief, alleging that their signatures on the deed were obtained by the father\u2019s fraud. After a three-day bench trial, a judge of the Superior Court ruled that the plaintiffs had failed to establish reasonable reliance on their father\u2019s misrepresentations when they signed the deed without reading it and that there was no fiduciary relationship or relationship of confidence and trust between the father and the plaintiffs. The judge, therefore, declared the deed valid.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">We conclude that the judge\u2019s critical finding regarding the absence of reasonable reliance was not clearly erroneous, given the suspicious, even alarming, nature of the father\u2019s behavior that day, according to the plaintiffs\u2019 own testimony at trial. Similarly, the judge\u2019s finding of no fiduciary or like relationship between the father and the plaintiffs is supported by the plaintiffs\u2019 age, experience, and independence from the father in business and financial matters. Also, the plaintiffs do not argue that the defendant, the beneficiary of the father\u2019s actions, participated in the misrepresentation and misconduct that resulted in their signing the deed without reading it. We therefore affirm, despite the father\u2019s troubling conduct that has left a legacy, which the law cannot remedy, of a family divided.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\"><em>Facts. </em>The following facts were found by the judge and are undisputed by the parties except as noted. Our review of the record provided by the plaintiffs does not disclose any of the findings on which the judge\u2019s decision depends to be clearly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>erroneous.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Simon </em>v. <em>Weymouth Agric. &amp; Indus. Soc., </em>389 Mass. 146, 148 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">The Collins family purchased a house on Walcott Road in Brookline in 1962, and the plaintiffs \u2014 John J. (Jack), Robert J., and Thomas C. Collins \u2014 and their sister \u2014 Margaret A. Huculak, the defendant in this case \u2014 lived there with their parents until they moved out to start their own families. On October 26, 1987, five months after the death of his wife (and the parties\u2019 mother), the father conveyed the property to his children for nominal consideration, reserving a life estate to himself, and giving each of the plaintiffs and the defendant a one-quarter remainder interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">The father still lived there on April 3, 1988. He was seventy-five years old at the time. The plaintiffs were forty-five, forty-two, and thirty-four years of age, respectively. That day, the father, the plaintiffs, and the defendant, along with their own spouses and children, agreed to meet at the house for brunch following an Easter Mass at a nearby church.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">Shortly after they arrived at the house, the father called Jack, the oldest son, into the kitchen and told him to sign the document that he presented. Jack observed his father holding his hand over certain parts of the folded-over document. Jack asked two times what the paper was. His father replied, \u201cIt\u2019s for the bank, just sign the goddamn paper.\u201d The judge found that Jack \u201cplaced no reliance whatsoever on his father\u2019s representations.[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>] He simply signed because his father wanted him to do [so].\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">After obtaining Jack\u2019s signature, the father called Robert into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>the kitchen and told him to sign the same document. Robert questioned his father to a greater extent than had his older brother and tried twice to take the document from his father in order to read it. This caused his father to get \u201cvery upset and loud.\u201d After stating that \u201c[i]t\u2019s for the goddamn bank,\u201d he ordered Robert to \u201c[s]ign the paper.\u201d Robert signed, although the judge found he \u201cdid not understand what his father meant by \u2018for the bank.\u2019 \u201d The judge found that \u201c[bjecause his father was so upset and hostile, and because Robert, at least on this morning, did not want to argue the point, he bowed to his father\u2019s wishes and signed the document.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">The father next summoned Thomas, the youngest son, and the scene was repeated. Thomas, known \u201caffectionately\u201d in the family as \u201cMeathead,\u201d referred to his father as \u201ctough\u201d and \u201cthe rule.\u201d (According to the judge, Thomas regarded his father as \u201cthe ruler.\u201d) Thomas, an \u201cagreeable sort,\u201d in the judge\u2019s words, asked his father only once what the document was for, but then signed it \u201cwithout fuss,\u201d after his father informed him it was \u201cfor the bank.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">On April 28, 1988, the father and the defendant appeared before a notary public with whom the father had a close relationship, having worked for him from time to time following the father\u2019s retirement. The father and the defendant signed their names to the document, affirming that as their \u201cfree act and deed.\u201d The notary then witnessed their signatures, along with those of the plaintiffs, who did not appear before him.* ***<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">For most of his adult life, the father had worked at an oil company on the 4:00 p.m. to midnight shift. He earned extra money by washing windows, painting, and cleaning gutters. Jack was an experienced businessman who had earned a degree in business administration from Northeastern University in 1967 and owned several pieces of real estate including investment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>properties. Robert worked as a mechanic until his disability retirement in 1991; by the time he signed the deed, Robert had owned at least three houses. Thomas had earned a certificate from Franklin Institute in 1975 and in April, 1988, was working as an equipment maintenance division supervisor for the town of Natick. The judge found, and the plaintiffs do not dispute, that none of the plaintiffs relied on their father for advice in business or financial matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">The judge found that the father \u201cdid intentionally misrepresent the nature of the document which he asked (or more accurately, demanded) his sons to sign on April 3, 1988.\u201d The judge determined, however, that the plaintiffs\u2019 case for fraud failed on the element of reliance on their father\u2019s statement that the document was for the bank, which the judge found was not reasonable in the circumstances. He also determined that no fiduciary or similar relationship of trust and confidence between the father and the plaintiffs sons existed. He reasoned: \u201cThe plaintiffs no doubt trusted their father, but they were not dependent upon him in business or property matters.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">The plaintiffs contend that they acted reasonably as \u201ctrusting sons, . . . not imagining that they were . . . being cheated by their father on the first Easter after their mother\u2019s death, in the presence of their wives and children.\u201d They argue that the deed should, therefore, be set aside because of the father\u2019s fraudulent misrepresentation, upon which they claim they reasonably relied, that the document was \u201cfor the bank.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\"><em>Discussion. A </em>deed procured by fraud may be voided by the court. <em>Long </em>v. <em>Giraudo, </em>311 Mass. 132, 138 (1942). <em>Wojtkonski </em>v. <em>Wojtkonski, </em>331 Mass. 760, 760 (1954). A plaintiff alleging fraud must, however, prove that \u201cthe defendant made a false representation of a material fact with knowledge of its falsity for the purpose of inducing the plaintiff to act thereon, and that the plaintiff relied upon the representation as true and acted upon it to his damage.\u201d <em>Danca </em>v. <em>Taunton Sav. Bank, </em>385 Mass. 1, 8 (1982), quoting from <em>Barrett Assocs. </em>v. <em>Aronson, </em>346 Mass. 150, 152 (1963). See <em>Rood </em>v. <em>Newberg, </em>48 Mass. App. Ct. 185, 192 (1999). The plaintiff\u2019s reliance on the defendant\u2019s false statement must be reasonable and justifiable under the circumstances. See <em>Shaw </em>v. <em>Victoria Coach Line, Inc., </em>314 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>262, 266, 267 (1943); <em>Hogan </em>v. <em>Riemer, </em>35 Mass. App. Ct. 360, 365 (1993); Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 537 (1977) (\u201cThe recipient of a fraudulent misrepresentation can recover against its maker for pecuniary loss resulting from it if, but only if, [a] he relies on the misrepresentation in acting or refraining from action, and [b] his reliance is justifiable\u201d). The person claiming justifiable reliance is \u201crequired to use his senses, and cannot recover if he blindly relies upon a misrepresentation the falsity of which would be patent to him if he utilized his opportunity to make a cursory examination or investigation.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Torts, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 541 comment a. See <em>Kuwaiti Danish Computer Co. </em>v. <em>Digital Equip. Corp., </em>438 Mass. 459, 468 (2003). Finally, \u201cthe question, whether the plaintiff exercised due diligence and was justified in placing confidence in the statement of the defendant or should have known from the beginning that [the statement was false],\u201d is one of fact. <em>Jekshewitz </em>v. <em>Groswald, </em>265 Mass. 413, 417 (1929). See <em>Sheffer </em>v. <em>Rudnick, </em>291 Mass. 205, 210-211 (1935).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">It is undisputed that the father lied about the true nature of the document that he demanded the plaintiffs sign. The question then becomes whether the plaintiffs relied on that misrepresentation when signing and, if so, whether their reliance was reasonable or justifiable. The trial judge explicitly found that Jack \u201cplaced no reliance whatsoever on his father\u2019s misrepresentation,\u201d but, rather, signed because his father \u201cwanted him to do so.\u201d He found that Robert \u201cdid not understand what his father meant by \u2018for the bank\u2019 \u201d but signed anyway because of his father\u2019s hostility and his desire to avoid a confrontation at a family gathering on Easter, thereby suggesting no reliance on the statement by him either. The judge did not, however, make any express finding of no reliance in regard to Robert. For the third son, Thomas, the judge made no finding, implicit or explicit, suggesting the absence (or presence) of reliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">Even if we accept the plaintiffs\u2019 argument that each of them relied upon the father\u2019s misrepresentation, we must consider whether such reliance was reasonable. The plaintiffs were summoned individually to meet with, their father. He demanded they sign a document folded over to avoid their review. Their signatures were required for the document to be valid; hence, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>the father\u2019s demands. The plaintiffs could see their names appearing in type below the signature lines. At a minimum, the circumstances were suspicious. The father pulled the document away from Robert when he grasped it, and he responded harshly to any questioning. All three plaintiffs should have been on notice that the document was of significance and legal import. See and compare <em>Farrell </em>v. <em>Chandler, Gardner &amp; Williams, Inc., </em>252 Mass. 341, 345 (1925); <em>Markell </em>v. <em>Sidney B. Pfeifer Foundation, Inc., </em>9 Mass. App. Ct. 412, 440 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\">Moreover, even the most cursory examination of the document would have revealed (a) that it was not \u201cfor the bank\u201d as the father had represented, and (b) that it was in fact a deed conveying away the plaintiffs\u2019 interests in the Brookline property. See, e.g., <em>Kuwaiti Danish Computer Co. </em>v. <em>Digital Equip. Corp., supra </em>at 468 (\u201ccursory review of. . . language . . . would have alerted [plaintiffs] that they could not rely on. . . statements\u201d). We conclude that the record supports the judge\u2019s finding that it was not reasonable or justifiable in these circumstances for the plaintiffs to sign the document without reading it.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">The judge was right to point out that if this were a \u201cbusiness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>transaction at arm\u2019s length, the plaintiffs would have little basis for a claim.\u201d He also correctly observed that a \u201cfamily relationship between father and sons casts a somewhat different light on the transaction, but it does not alter the result\u201d of the lack of reasonable reliance here. We too recognize that there are subtle, and not so subtle, familial considerations involved in such a transaction that may affect the reasonableness of a family member\u2019s reliance. Nevertheless, the circumstances here were suspicious enough to support the judge\u2019s finding that three adult, independent sons could not reasonably have relied on their father\u2019s misrepresentation to excuse them from that most fundamental legal responsibility to review a legal document before signing it.* *<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">The judge recognized that \u201c[sjome family relationships may involve a heightened duty to disclose\u201d and that the case would stand on a different footing were there a \u201cfiduciary or other similar relationship of trust and confidence\u201d between the father and the plaintiffs. See Restatement (Second) of Torts, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 551(2)(a). Nevertheless, \u201ca confidential relationship does not arise merely by reason of family ties.\u201d <em>Rood </em>v. <em>Newberg, </em>48 Mass. App. Ct. at 193. \u201cWhether a relationship of trust and confidence exists is a question of fact ...\u201d <em>Markell </em>v. <em>Sidney </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number><em>B. Pfeifer Foundation, Inc., 9 </em>Mass. App. Ct. at 444.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The relationship \u201cmay be found on evidence indicating that one person is in fact dependent on another\u2019s judgment in business affairs or property matters.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>See <em>Ranicar </em>v. <em>Goodwin, </em>326 Mass. 710, 713 (1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">The judge determined that \u201c[t]he plaintiffs no doubt trusted their father, but they were not dependent upon him in business and property matters.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> No fiduciary or confidential relationship existed in these circumstances, he concluded. This conclusion is supported by the judge\u2019s subsidiary findings, including that the plaintiffs were all independent adults in their thirties or forties who did not depend on their father\u2019s advice in real estate, financial, or business matters. The judge correctly focused, as the cases require, upon the importance of showing a dependency in business, property, or financial matters in order to establish a confidential relationship.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>Finally, we recognize that the sister, not the father, is the defendant here. The plaintiffs did not allege that the defendant was involved in the conduct that led to their signing the deed. Nor does the record give any indication of the defendant\u2019s knowledge of the circumstances under which each plaintiff had signed the deed. See <em>White </em>v. <em>Graves, </em>107 Mass. 325, 328 (1871) (\u201ca person who voluntarily executed a deed, although induced to do so by fraud, [can] avoid it only as against the party who exercised the unlawful influence, or against one who took title under the deed with participation in or notice of the fraud, and not against one who took a title apparently good from those having capacity to convey\u201d). In the absence of any record support for the defendant\u2019s knowledge of, complicity in, or participation in the father\u2019s misrepresentation, we decline to consider her a wrongdoer seeking to benefit from her own misconduct. See <em>Capen </em>v. <em>Capen, </em>234 Mass. 355, 364-365 (1920).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b418-7\">As originally filed, the complaint appeared to concern title to registered land, over which the Land Court has exclusive jurisdiction.

However, while the matter was pending in the Superior Court, the defendant, with the plaintiffs\u2019 agreement, sold the property, converting the parties\u2019 dispute to one over their respective entitlement to the proceeds of the sale. Accordingly, we treat the complaint as having been amended by the implied consent of the parties and, as so amended, within the jurisdiction of the Superior Court. See Mass.R.Civ.P. 15(b), 365 Mass. 761 (1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b419-9\">The defendant objects to the incompleteness of the record provided by the plaintiffs, but has not moved to supplement the record or otherwise directed our attention to any omitted portions of the record that support her position.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b419-10\">The plaintiffs contest this finding, but the record supports it.
