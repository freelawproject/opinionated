The plaintiff has filed an appeal from that judgment which is not the subject matter of this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b320-15\">Smith, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ayx\">The plaintiff, Mark A. MacDonald, filed a complaint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>in the Superior Court alleging libel and intentional infliction of emotional distress by four defendants: the Athol Daily News; its publisher, Richard Chase, Jr.; its editor, Barney Cummings; and the appellant, Elsa Pat\u00f3n.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">Pat\u00f3n filed a special motion to dismiss the plaintiff\u2019s complaint pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H, popularly known as the \u201canti-SLAPP\u201d statute.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> She also filed a motion to dismiss the plaintiff\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim, the arguments of which were incorporated into the special motion to dismiss filed under \u00a7 59H. The plaintiff opposed both motions. After a hearing, a Superior Court judge denied Pat\u00f3n\u2019s special motion, and another Superior Court judge denied Pat\u00f3n\u2019s motion for reconsideration. There was no ruling on Pat\u00f3n\u2019s motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">Pat\u00f3n sought interlocutory review of the lower court rulings from the single justice of this court. The single justice granted the petition for interlocutory review of the Superior Court orders. After the single justice granted the petition in this matter, the Supreme Judicial Court in <em>Fabre </em>v. <em>Walton, </em>436 Mass. 517, 520-522 (2002), ruled that there is a right to interlocutory review in the Appeals Court when a trial judge has denied a special motion to dismiss pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\"><em>Special motions to dismiss under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H. </em>\u201cSLAPP suits have been characterized as \u2018generally meritless suits brought by large private interests to deter common citizens from exercising their political or legal rights or to punish them for doing so.\u2019 \u201d <em>Duracraft Corp. </em>v. <em>Holmes Prods. Corp., </em>427 Mass. 156, 161 (1998), quoting from <em>Wilcox </em>v. <em>Superior Ct., </em>27 Cal. App. 4th 809, 816-817 (1994). \u201cThe legislative history in Massachusetts demonstrates that in response to the problem of SLAPP suits the Legislature intended to enact very broad protection for petitioning activities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 162. \u201cIn [enacting G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H], the Legislature . . . did not address concerns over its breadth and reach, and ignored its potential uses in litigation far different from the typical SLAPP suit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 163.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">Since its enactment, several decisions have discussed the breadth of G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H. It applies to private parties of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>limited means. See <em>McLarnon </em>v. <em>Jokisch, </em>431 Mass. 343, 344-345 (2000) (dispute between former spouses); <em>Vittands </em>v. <em>Sudduth, </em>49 Mass. App. Ct. 401, 413-415 (2000) (property dispute between private parties); <em>Donovan </em>v. <em>Gardner, </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. 595, 597-602 (2000) (private dispute between neighboring parties).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">In <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Parsons, </em>434 Mass. 543, 551 (2001), the court ruled that G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H, applies to defamation actions (\u201cdefamation most popular SLAPP cause of action\u201d). Furthermore, the court held that the anti-SLAPP statute applies regardless of the timing of the plaintiff\u2019s suit. <em>Id. </em>at 549 n.11.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">An important feature of the anti-SLAPP statute is the availability of a unique procedural tool \u2014 the special motion to dismiss. In order to assert protection for her petitioning activities, the special movant under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H, must \u201cmake a threshold showing through the pleadings and affidavits that the claims against [her] are \u2018based on\u2019 the petitioning activities alone and have no substantial basis other than or in addition to the petitioning activities.\u201d <em>Duracraft Corp. </em>v. <em>Holmes Prods. Corp., 427 </em>Mass. at 167-168. As used in the statute, the exercise of the right to \u201cpetition\u201d refers to, inter alla, \u201cany written or oral statement made in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a legislative, executive, or judicial body, or any other governmental proceeding; any statement reasonably likely to encourage consideration or review of an issue by a legislative, executive, or judicial body or any other governmental proceeding; [or] any statement reasonably likely to enlist public participation in an effort to effect such consideration.\u201d G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H, as inserted by St. 1994, c. 283, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">Once the special movant makes this initial showing, the burden shifts to the nonmoving party to show, by a preponderance of the evidence, that \u201c(1) the moving party\u2019s exercise of its right to petition was devoid of any reasonable factual support or any arguable basis in law and (2) the moving party\u2019s acts caused actual injury to the responding party.\u201d G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H. See <em>McLarnon </em>v. <em>Jokisch, </em>431 Mass. at 349; <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Parsons, </em>434 Mass. at 553-554. We review a judge\u2019s decision regarding a special motion to dismiss to determine whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>there was an abuse of discretion or error of law. <em>McLarnon </em>v. <em>Jokisch, supra. Baker </em>v. <em>Parsons, supra </em>at 550. <em>Office One, Inc. </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>437 Mass. 113, 121 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\"><em>Factual background. </em>We summarize the undisputed background facts that led up to the filing of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint, with emphasis on the plaintiff\u2019s claims against Pat\u00f3n. The plaintiff, a retired State police officer, lived in Athol and was one of Athol\u2019s five elected selectmen from 1995 to 1997. In 1996, as a selectman, the plaintiff became involved in certain politically controversial decisions regarding a new police station and an ambulance service in Athol. In April of 1996, the selectmen, including the plaintiff, withdrew their approval of one site for the police station and favored another site. The plaintiff and the town\u2019s police chief, who both served on the police station site committee, defended the decision. After the decision, the Athol Daily News referred to the plaintiff as a \u201cGestapo agent\u201d and also printed that he may have accepted a bribe for his vote regarding the town\u2019s ambulance service.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">At that time, the defendant Pat\u00f3n, a resident of Athol, operated an Internet web site that reported on local affairs in Athol and the surrounding community. After publication of the article in the Athol Daily News referring to the plaintiff as a \u201cGestapo agent,\u201d Pat\u00f3n, while the plaintiff was a selectman, ran the following definition on her web site:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-7\">\u201cnazi \u2014 not see 1. A political affiliation whose platform espouses military dictatorship, racial cleansing, eugenics and intolerance. 2. In Athol, a term sometimes used to describe certain selectmen who wish to ignore most issues except for those which place them firmly in bed with chiefs of police, (see Old Macdonald had a gun, E-I-E-I-Oh shit).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">After publication of the statements in the Athol Daily News and the definition on Pat\u00f3n\u2019s web site, the plaintiff sought to be reelected as a selectman, but lost the election. He then brought this complaint against Pat\u00f3n and the other defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-9\">In her special motion to dismiss the plaintiff\u2019s complaint, Pa-ton argued that the plaintiff\u2019s claims against her had to be dismissed against her pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H, because (1) the claims were based on her right to petition the govern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>ment; (2) the plaintiff could not demonstrate that Baton\u2019s exercise of this right was \u201cdevoid of reasonable factual or legal support\u201d; and (3) the plaintiff had not suffered actual injury as a result of Baton\u2019s petitioning activities. Baton submitted an affidavit and eleven exhibits with her motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">We summarize the contents of Baton\u2019s special motion and affidavit. Baton works as a technology aide in the public schools. From 1997 to 1999, she maintained an Internet web site that she called the \u201cAthonics Home Bage.\u201d The web site was an interactive public forum on issues relating to Athol town governance, including education funding and municipal use of tax dollars. The web site included information on education reform, a citizen letters section, cartoons, quotes, a link inviting public participation by electronic mail (e-mail), and satirical articles.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">One portion of the web site was called \u201cThe First Dictionary of Athonics.\u201d It was an interactive feature of the web site and Athol citizens contributed by e-mail many of the proposed dictionary entries. After the decision in regard to the police building was made and while the plaintiff was still a selectman, one citizen sent by e-mail to the web site the definition of \u201cnazi\u201d which is the subject of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint against Baton.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">The plaintiff filed his opposition to Baton\u2019s special motion to dismiss and his memorandum supporting his opposition. The plaintiff did not submit any affidavit in opposition to Baton\u2019s affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\"><em>Discussion. </em>In denying Baton\u2019s special motion, the Superior Court judge ruled that G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H, did not apply to the plaintiff because he was a private party of modest means as is Baton.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The judge also ruled that, even if the statute applied to the plaintiff, the special motion was denied because the plaintiff \u201cmay be able to show that Baton\u2019s petition is devoid of any reasonable facts.\u201d Finally, the judge held that the statute does not apply to a libel claim, because the statute does not create an absolute privilege and the plaintiff may prove that \u201cBaton published her remarks with actual malice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>Pat\u00f3n claims that the Superior Court judge erred in holding that the anti-SLAPP statute does not apply to private parties of modest means; by applying the incorrect standard of review; and by holding that libel claims are not subject to the antiSLAPP statute. Pat\u00f3n also argues that this court should grant her special motion to dismiss and award her attorney\u2019s fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">At the time he made his decision, the Superior Court judge did not have the benefit of several of the decisions that we cited earlier in this opinion. Those decisions demonstrate that the judge\u2019s decision was in error. It has been firmly established that the anti-SLAPP statute can be invoked where both parties are persons of modest means and that it is applicable to defamation actions. The judge also misconstrued the allocation of the burden of proof on special motions to dismiss by applying the standard used under a motion to dismiss pursuant to Mass.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), 365 Mass. 754 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">We agree with the judge, however, that the claims against Pa-ton were, in fact, based entirely on her petitioning activities. In her affidavit in support of her special motion to dismiss, Pat\u00f3n described her web site as follows: \u201cI conceived of the Web site as a forum for speech by citizens about issues of public and political concern in Athol. Although I wrote some of the content, much of the content was contributed by others who provided submissions to me by e-mail. In that sense, the Web site served as a technological version of a meeting of citizens on the Town Green, a space where concerned individuals could come together to share information, express political opinions, and rally on town issues of concern to the community.\u201d Paton\u2019s affidavit, which was accompanied by eleven exhibits and which described her web site, met her threshold burden of establishing that the plaintiff\u2019s claims were based on Paton\u2019s petitioning activities. See <em>Duracraft Corp. </em>v. <em>Holmes Prods. Corp., </em>427 Mass. at 167-168. See also <em>Office One, Inc. </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>437 Mass. at 122. Contrast <em>Ayasli </em>v. <em>Armstrong, </em>56 Mass. App. Ct. 740, 748-749 (2002) (threshold burden of demonstrating that claims were based solely on petitioning activities was not met).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">The plaintiff, in turn, did not provide any affidavits or other evidentiary materials to show, \u201cby a preponderance of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>evidence, that (1) [Baton\u2019s] petitioning activity [was] devoid of any reasonable factual support or any arguable basis in law, and that (2) the activity caused [the plaintiff] actual harm.\u201d <em>Office One, Inc. </em>v. <em>Lopez, supra </em>at 123. Therefore, we hold that it was error for the judge to deny Pat\u00f3n\u2019s special motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">Under the an\u00fc-SLAPP statute, once a court grants a special motion to dismiss, the moving party is awarded costs and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees. G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H. A court has no discretion whether to grant costs and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees; under the statute the grant of both is mandatory. <em>McLarnon </em>v. <em>Jokisch, </em>431 Mass. at 349-350. <em>Office One, Inc. </em>v. <em>Lopez, supra </em>at 126. Such a grant also includes appellate fees and costs. <em>McLarnon </em>v. <em>Jokisch, supra </em>at 350. <em>Fabre </em>v. <em>Walton, </em>436 Mass. at 525.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">The order of the Superior Court is reversed, and the case is remanded for the entry of a new order consistent with this opinion and including an award of costs and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees as required by G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H. In addition, Pat\u00f3n may apply to the single justice of this court for an award of appropriate attorney\u2019s fees and costs in connection with the appeal. See <em>McLarnon </em>v. <em>Jokisch, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b321-9\"> \u201cThe acronym \u2018SLAPP\u2019 stands for \u2018Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ayasli </em>v. <em>Armstrong, </em>56 Mass.
