T. Tobias on account of whom it may concern, in case of loss to be paid to Andrew Simonds. The subjects of insurance were the same as in the case of The Merchants\u2019 S. S. Co. <em>v. </em>The Commercial Mutual Ins. Co. <em>(ante, </em>p. 444).

Stockholders in a corporation cannot insure the property of the corporation in their own names as belonging to them (Phillips <em>v. </em>Knox, &amp;c. Co., 20 <em>Ohio, </em>174). This is fatal <em>to </em>a recovery by any of these parties, because whatever interest any of them have is merely a claim upon the stock of Tobias.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b484-14\">Burrill, <em>Zabriskie &amp; Burrill, </em>attorneys, <em>John E.

Rep. </em>250).</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b485-4\">Pee Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"AFJ\">This was an action to recover for the same loss that was the subject of the case of The Merchants\u2019 S. S. Co. <em>v. </em>The Commercial Mutual Ins. Co. In the present case, the plaintiff is assignee of one Tobias, whose interest, if any, was insured. The defendants claim that Tobias had no insurable interest. The only ground of claim that he had an interest was his owning thirty-six shares of the capital stock of the plaintiff in the above mentioned case, the .owner of the vessel. It is not perceived that he had any interest in the vessel. He was not legal or equitable owner of any part, nor of its earnings, nor any lien in respect of either.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">For this reason the judgment should be reversed and a new trial ordered, with costs to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
