Y. &amp;c. R. R. Oo. (50 <em>Super. Ct. </em>403), in which case the denial was of \u2018 each and every allegation in the complaint, except as herein admitted, qualified or explained,\u2019 and the answer did not contain a general, or specific denial of any of the allegations of the complaint. The denial in this action is \u2018upon information and belief,\u2019 which is a form of denial permitted by section 526 of the Code of Civil Procedure and is not inconsistent with section 500 (Brotherton <em>v. </em>Downey, 21 <em>Hun, </em>436). I can, however, see no objection to the pleading using the exact words of section 500, and deny \u2018any knowledge or information of the allegations of the complaint sufficient to form a belief.\u2019 No facts were shown on the trial that would warrant the jury in coming to the conclusion that the defendant had been negligent in allowing the ice to remain on the sidewalk. The complaint was rightly dismissed, for the reasons stated by the court on the trial. \u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b546-10\"><em>Benjamin Yates, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b546-11\"><em>D.
