Upon the trial of the issues, the jury rendered a verdict for the defendant. The plaintiff moved for a new trial on the minutes on all the grounds mentioned in section 999 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>motion was denied. Plaintiff excepted to the denial, but no order was entered upon said motion. Subsequently a case and exceptions were made and settled, and upon them, as well as upon affidavits, the plaintiff moved at special term for a new trial. The motion was made on tire ground of surprise and newly discovered evidence, as well as upon the case and exceptions. The defendant interposed an affidavit in opposition to the -motion. An order was made and entered denying the motion, and the present appeal is <em>from the </em>last named order.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b532-5\">The court at General Term said :\u2014\u201cPassing over the objections of the respondent which are of a somewhat \u25a0technical character, I think the motion was properly denied upon the merits. The exceptions were all untenable. The evidence claimed to have surprised the plaintiff was principally brought out by defendant\u2019s counsel on the cross-examination of the plaintiff and of plaintiff\u2019s witness. Towards the close of the case, plaintiff\u2019s counsel introduced evidence in rebuttal, but in doing so, he did not in any way indicate that he was taken by surprise, nor did he move for the withdrawal of a juror, or the postponement of the trial for such reason. As to the alleged newly discovered evidence, it clearly appeared that it was cumulative, and that, with due diligence, it could have been readily procured for the trial.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b532-6\"><em>Hyland &amp; Zabriskie, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b532-7\"><em>H.
