The package, as appeared by the evidence, was not delivered to the consignee and the non-delivery was unexplained by the carrier. There was some evidence tending to show a misdelivery. Defendant requested the court to charge that in no event could the recovery exceed fifty dollars and interest, but no distinct point based on plaintiff\u2019s failure to state true value was made, nor was there a distinct attempt to limit defendant\u2019s liability to cases of misdelivery or other misfeasance. The questions of negligence and the value of the goods, were submitted to the jury; there was no exception to the submission of the question of negligence, but the defendant excepted to the submission of the value on the ground that the contract between the parties fixed the same. <em>Held, </em>that this exception was unavailing, in case of a loss through the negligence of the carrier, as was <em>prima </em>facie, established by the non-delivery in this case, and found by the jury. <em>Further </em>held, that if the defendant\u2019s counsel intended to raise the question of the carrier\u2019s liability for any degree of negligence under the receipt, or that the omission to state the true value, limited the recovery to fifty dollars, the points should have been dis- \u25a0 tinctly presented at the trial.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b215-5\">The contract or receipt in question, provided that the shipper should present a written claim for the loss, within thirty days from its date, and this not having been done, it was urged on the trial against any recovery.

H. Brinton, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>Eo. 1423 Spruce street, in the city of Philadelphia ; that said package was so delivered, by a person giving to the Adams Express Company the name of Ghormley but that the value of said package was not known to the Adams Express Company. The articles contained in said package are admitted to be the same as mentioned in the complaint. The answer further alleges a special contract or bill of lading, received and accepted by the plaintiff, limiting the liability of the express company for any cause whatever, excepting the fraud or gross negligence of the company, to the sum of $50; and exempting it altogether from any loss or damage, unless the claim should be presented within thirty days from the date of such contract or domestic bill of lading; and further alleging, that claim of the plaintiff in this action was not presented within such time.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b216-5\">The two defenses were based, respectively, on the following clauses of the receipt and contract: \u201c Eor, in any event, shall the holder hereof demand beyond the sum of fifty dollars, at which the article forwarded is hereby valued, unless otherwise herein expressed, or unless specially insured by them, and so specified in this receipt, which insurance shall constitute the limit of the liability of the Adams Express Company.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b216-6\">\u201cIn no event shall the Adams Express Company be liable for any loss or damage unless the claim therefor shall be presented to them, in writing, at this office, within thirty days after this date, in a statement to which this receipt shall be annexed.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b216-7\">After a trial of the issues before a jury, a verdict was rendered in favor of the plaintiff, and his damages assessed at the sum of $215.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b216-8\">Further facts appear in the opinion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b216-9\"><em>Charles M.

The receipt in evidence was a valid contract limiting the defendant\u2019s liability. Eeceipts similar in every particular\u2014indeed, identical in language\u2014to .that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>delivered to the plaintiff in this case, have repeatedly been held valid by the highest court of this state, and to contain a binding contract of affreightment. At most, the plaintiff can only claim that the package in suit was lost and not delivered. There is no proof of conversion\u2014 no proof of any wrongful act (Magnin <em>v. </em>Dinsmore, 56 <em>N. Y. </em>168 ; 62 <em>Ib. </em>35). Plaintiff could not recover the actual value of the contents of the package\u2014in other words, could not recover more than the $50, by reason of his failure to disclose the actual value of the package (Magnin <em>v. </em>Dinsmore, 62 <em>N. Y. </em>35, 70 <em>Ib. </em>410). In Belger <em>v. </em>Dinsmore (51 <em>Ib. </em>166), the court, in speaking to a receipt similar in all respects to the one at bar, said : \u201cA party accepting such an instrument, as has been already shown, declares his assent by such acceptance, to those terms and conditions, they thereby become obligatory on both parties, and prescribe their mutual rights and obligations.\u201d And the recovery was limited to the sum of fifty dollars, the agreed valuation (See also Wetzell <em>v. </em>Dinsmore, 54 <em>Ib. </em>496; Kirkland <em>v. </em>Dinsmore, 62 <em>Ib. </em>171; Collender <em>v. </em>Dinsmore, 55 <em>Ib. </em>200; United States Court in this Circuit, Berry <em>v. </em>Dinsmore, unreported [1876]; Dinsmore <em>v. </em>Neresheimer, 32 <em>Hun, </em>204).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b217-5\">The above authorities, and others too numerous to cite, have thus established the validity of these receipts and contracts. The question resolves itself to this: Is the shipper bound by the valuation of the package shipped, as fixed by himself in his contract with the carrier ? The plaintiff knew the terms of the contract; it was filled out by one of his clerks, and so tendered to the Express Company for signature. It does not purport to absolve the carrier from liability for his negligence: Had the plaintiff in the receipt stated what he now claims to be the real value, his right to recover that amount in this action would have been unquestioned. But, after a loss has occurred, he cannot be heard to assert that his representation in the receipt as to the value of the package, was false. Particularly is this so when it is recollected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>that the charges of the Adams Express Company for carriage vary with the value of the packages to be carried. An additional charge of ten cents for every $100 or fraction thereof is demanded when the package is over $50 in value. By withholding the real value, the plaintiff deliberately deprived the Express Company of this additional freight. No principle of law or public policy can be mentioned' which has ever sanctioned any rule preventing the shipper and carrier from agreeing on the value of the article carried, or enabling such shipper to repudiate the contract after a loss, and recover the real value if it exceed the agreed valuation. The defendant, therefore, insists that the court below erred in admitting evidence as to the value of the contents of the package forwarded, and likewise erred in refusing to charge the jury that the plaintiff\u2019s recovery could in no event exceed the sum of fifty dollars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b218-5\">II. The failure to present a written claim within thirty days was fatal to the plaintiff\u2019s recovery (Smith <em>v. </em>Dinsmore, 9 Daly, 188 ; Hirschberg <em>v. </em>Dinsmore, 67 <em>How. Pr. </em>103; Express Company <em>v. </em>Caldwell, 21 <em>Wall. </em>264; Weir <em>v. </em>Adams Express Co., 5 <em>Phila. </em>355 ; Southern Express Co. <em>v. </em>Hunnicutt, 54 <em>Miss. </em>566 ; Lewis <em>v. </em>Great Western Railway Co., 5 <em>Hurlstone &amp; N. </em>867). So, also, in this state, stipulations of the same nature in insurance policies and telegraph blanks have been held valid and binding (Matter of Att\u2019y Gen\u2019l <em>v. </em>Continental Life Ins. Co., 93 <em>N. Y. </em>70 ; Blossom <em>v. </em>Lycoming Ins. Co., 64 <em>N. Y. </em>162 ; Young <em>v. </em>W. U. Tel. Co., 34 <em>Super. Ct. </em>390 ; 65 <em>N. Y. </em>163 ; Heimami <em>v. </em>W. U. Tel. Co., 57 <em>Wisc. </em>562).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b218-6\">III. There was no waiver or extension by the Adams Express Company of the thirty days\u2019 clause. The contract required the presentation of the claim in writing within thirty days from the 12th of November, 1883. Inquiry as to the package made at the office of the Adams Express Company was certainly not a compliance with this thirty days\u2019 clause. It was of the essence that a claim in writing should be presented within the thirty days <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>(Young <em>v. </em>Western Union Tel. Co., 34 <em>Super. Ct. </em>390). But, as a matter of fact, no notice of any kind was given. The only evidence is that inquiry was made as to the package, and that the company\u2019s agents promised to look for and trace the package. The contract does not call for <em>notice </em>of loss or damages, but for a <em>claim </em>for loss or damage. A claim is, in just judicial sense, a demand of some matter, as of right, made by one person of another, to do or forbear to do some act or thing, as a matter of duty (Costen <em>v. </em>Mayor, &amp;c., 43 <em>N.Y. </em>399). The only evidence in the case is of inquiries as to the non-delivery of the package. Such inquiries were undoubtedly made within thirty days after the date of the receipt. But it appears that the first oral demand or claim for the $275 was made in March, four months after the shipment. There was no proof that the presentation of the claim was deferred to enable the company to find the package, or that reliance was placed on anything said. Even could such an inference be drawn from the proof of the inquiries that were made, at the office of the Express Company, it does not appear that there was any authority whatsoever in the employees to waive or extend any condition. Such power could not be presumed (First Nat. Bank <em>v. </em>Ocean Nat. Bank, 60 <em>N. Y. </em>278 ; Young <em>v. </em>Western Union Tel. Co., 65 <em>N. Y. </em>163). See Matter of Att\u2019y-Gen\u2019l <em>v. </em>Cont. Life Ins. Co. (93 N. Y. 74).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b219-5\">IV. There was no proof of the non-delivery of the package by the carrier. Nor was there any proof of a conversion or misfeasance on the part of the carrier. But conceding a non-delivery, and conceding further that such non-delivery was unexplained, nevertheless these facts could not establish a wrongful act, such as conversion (Magnin\u2019s Case, <em>70 N.Y. </em>417).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b219-6\">The is not a scintilla of evidence to prove misdelivery. It appeared that in answer to written inquiry, the plaintiff received a communication to this effect: \u201cDelivered at 755 Corinthian Ave. Nov. 13, \u201983, Signed, Mrs. J. B. Brinton.\u201d Whether or not this was the consignee of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>the package, was not shown. It certainly could not be inferred from difference in the middle letter. The rule is too well settled now to be questioned, that in legal proceedings the law does not recognize a middle letter, and knows but the initial of one surname (Clute <em>v. </em>Emmerich, 32 <em>Hun, </em>10). But aside from any such technical reasoning, the plaintiff\u2019s evidence shows beyond doubt that the package .delivered at loo Corinthian Avenue was not the package which the plaintiff had shipped.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b220-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s cause of action, as stated in the complaint, was plainly grounded on breach of the contract to carry. It was alleged an agreement to carry for a valuable consideration and the breach or non-fulfillment of it (Catlin <em>v. </em>Adirondack Co., 11 <em>Abb. N. C. </em>311, 380). Although the plaintiff alleged a consideration in his complaint, he wholly failed to prove one on the trial (Bristol <em>v. </em>Rensselaer &amp; Saratoga Railroad Co., 9 <em>Barb. </em>158). But the plaintiff will not be permitted on this appeal to claim that his action is not on contract, for non-delivery, but in tort for conversion. The whole drift of the plaintiff\u2019s case was toward proof of loss and non-delivery. No issue of conversion was tendered or tried. The court will not now allow the plaintiff to change front after the trial and thus mend his hold. Misdelivery was not claimed below. The court charged only on the question of non-delivery ; the motion to dismiss was on that assumption (See Salisbury <em>v. </em>Howe, 87 <em>N. Y. </em>128).</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b220-6\"><em>Peter Mitchell, </em>for respondent.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b220-7\">By the Court.</p>\n<author id=\"AkT\">Van Vorst, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AvW\">Receipts, like the one before us, given by a carrier, on the delivery to him of goods for carriage, and by which the liability of the carrier was limited to a specific sum, in case of the failure by him to deliver the goods to the consignee, have been frequently under consideration in the courts of this state. In several of these cases, the question has been more or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>less discussed, as to whether the limitation of liability, in the instruments under consideration, embraced the case of a failure to deliver, or a loss occasioned, by the negligence of the carrier.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">Under the decisions in this state, a common carrier may stipulate for exemption from liability for losses occurring through his own negligence, or that of his servants (Steers <em>v. </em>Liverpool, New York &amp; Phil. S. S. Co., 57 <em>N.Y. </em>1; Poucher <em>v. </em>New York Central R. R. Co., 49 <em>lb. </em>263 ; Magnin <em>v. </em>Dinsmore, 56 <em>Ib. </em>168). The result of the decisions is, however, that the contract of the carrier, exempting him for loss or injury in the carriage of goods, should not be deemed to include negligence, by any general words, nor unless the contract in clear and explicit form, embraces negligence (Westcott <em>v. </em>Fargo, <em>61 N. Y. </em>542). The language and terms <em>of the </em>receipt, issued by the defendant, in this action, on the delivery of goods for carriage, have already had careful consideration, and have had judicial construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">In Magnin <em>v. </em>Dinsmore (56 <em>N. Y. </em>168), it was held, that the contract did not include immunity from loss occasioned by the carrier\u2019s negligence. That construction has been at least twice adopted, by the court of appeals, in subsequent decisions. In the same case (62 NY. 39), Folgee, J., says:\u2014\u201cThis contract did not, <em>per se, </em>excuse the defendant from liability for a loss arising from its own negligence. Thus <em>we have heretofore held in this </em>case.\u201d And in Mynard <em>v. </em>Syracuse, &amp;c. R. R. Co. (71 <em>N. Y. </em>180, 185), Church, Oh. J., referred to Magnin\u2019s case (56 <em>N. Y. </em>168), says: \u201cIt was held that the stipulation did not cover a loss accruing through negligence, Johnson, J., <em>in </em>the opinion saying, 1 But the contract will not be deemed to except losses occasioned by the carrier\u2019s negligence unless that be expressly stipulated.\u2019 In each of these cases, the language of the contract was sufficiently broad to include losses occasioned by ordinary or gross negligence, but the doctrine is repeated, that, if the carrier asks for immunity for his wrongful acts, it must be expressed, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>that general words will not be deemed to have been intended to reheve him from the consequence of such acts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">If Belger <em>v. </em>Dinsmore <em>(51 N. Y. </em>166), in the commission of appeals, cannot be reconciled with the above conclusion, it must be considered as overruled by the later cases in the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">After the decision in Magnin <em>v. </em>Dinsmore (56 <em>N. Y. </em>168), and upon a subsequent trial of that cause, a new element was introduced in the case. The point was taken by the defendant, that the plaintiff had failed, at the time' of the shipment, to state the just and true value of the merchandise. This was held in the end to have been \u201csuch an imposition upon the defendant, as would reheve it from habihty for the total value of the goods, unless something <em>more is shown than negligence to carry safely </em>and to deliver promptly \u201d (Magnin\u2019s case, 62 <em>N. Y. </em>35, 44). And this view was sustained in the same case (70 <em>N. Y. </em>410), Allen, J., saying:\u2014\u201cThe disclosure of the value of the goods was a condition precedent to the attaching of any habihty of the carrier, for merely ordinary neglect, unaccompanied with <em>any misfeasance or willful act.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">The instrument dehvered by the defendant to the plaintiff in this case, is in substance the same, as that before the court of appeals in Magnin <em>v. </em>Dinsmore. By. the terms of the receipt, the goods, dehvered to be carried, were valued at fifty dollars. The property was not dehvered to the consignee. Upon the trial the plaintiff was allowed to prove the real value, which was considerably in excess of the sum stated in the receipt, and he obtained a verdict for the full amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">The package was directed to Mrs. J. <em>H. </em>Brinton, 1423 Spruce Street, Philadelphia, Pa.\u201d It was never dehvered to her. The defendant, -upon the plaintiff\u2019s application, after the non-dehvery was brought to its attention, attempted to trace the missing package. The return first made to the plaintiff, was, that the package, or one answering its description, in every particular, had been dehvered at 155 Corinthian Avenue, to Mrs. J. <em>B. </em>Brinton.. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>Afterwards, however, the defendant\u2019s agent, stated to the plaintiff, that the package delivered at Corinthian Avenue, was not the one shipped by plaintiff, but was a package containing books. The defendant\u2019s agent informed the plaintiff, that they had sent a tracer in every direction, and could not find out when or where the package was delivered. Unless delivered at Corinthian Avenue, the package has not been accounted for. The defendant\u2019s counsel, at the close of the plaintiff\u2019s case, moved to dismiss the complaint upon several grounds, amongst which was, that the failure to perform the contract was not established.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">There was sufficient evidence of the non-delivery, at least, to take the case to the jury. That seemed to be the principal question litigated upon the trial. But upon the argument of this appeal, the learned counsel for the defendant admitted that there was a non-delivery. That point, therefore, is out of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">At the close of the case, the defendant\u2019s counsel asked the court to charge the jury, that in no event can the recovery of the plaintiff in this action exceed the sum of fifty dollars, and interest from the date of shipment. This motion was properly denied by the judge. The case was in no such condition, that the trial judge could say, that the defendant was free from negligence. That was a question of fact, if, as the defendant\u2019s counsel contended at that time, no non-delivery had been shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">The court then charged the jury, \u2018 \u2018 that the failure of the defendants to deliver the goods, unexplained, is evidence of negligence.\u201d \u2022 To which the defendant\u2019s counsel then and there excepted, <em>\u201c </em>on the ground that there was no evidence of a failure to deliver. \u201d There was certainly evidence that the package had not been delivered to the consignee, In fact, it is now a part of the case, that it was not delivered. That a non-delivery unexplained is evidence of negligence, has been too often held to need authority to support it. It was so held in Canfield <em>v. </em>Balt. &amp; O. R. R. Co. (93 <em>N. Y. 532).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>No exception was taken to the submission to the jury of the question of negligence, as affecting the defendant\u2019s liability under the receipt. If the defendant\u2019s counsel intended to raise the question of the carrier\u2019s liability for any degree of negligence, under the receipt, he should have distinctly raised it at the trial, and while the judge was charging the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">Nothing was said as to any positive misfeasance, or misdelivery of the package. If it was in the mind of the defendant\u2019s counsel, that the defendant\u2019s liability could only be established by proof of an actual conversion of the merchandise, through a wrong delivery, or other misfeasance, he should have distinctly raised that question at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">The trial judge further stated, \u201cI leave to the jury,to determine what the value of the goods is.\u201d The defendant's comisel excepted, on,the ground, \u201cthat the contract between the parties fixes the value of the goods.\u201d But that objection is unavailing, if the conclusion reached above, that the carrier is hable for the full value, in case of a loss through his negligence, is correct. The authorities above cited show that the defendant is hable, notwithstanding the limitation in his receipt, for the full value, when the goods committed to him for carriage are lost through his negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">No distinct point appears to have been raised on the trial, arising from the fact that the real value of the goods had not been stated by the plaintiff, at the time of the delivery of the goods for carriage, so as to bring the case within Magnin <em>v. </em>Dinsmore (70 <em>N. Y. </em>410). Had tho defendant claimed, and urged in an effective way, that the omission to state such value, should limit the recovery to fifty dollars, unless an actual conversion had been proven, then the question could have been submitted to the jury, as to whether or not there had been a misdelivery, or other misfeasance. But an examination of the case does not show that any such ground was distinctly taken below. This subject is alluded to for the reason <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>that the defendant\u2019s counsel, in his brief used on this argument, incidentally alludes to the fact that the defendant carrier was deprived of additional freight by the withholding of the real value. A point of that character should have been plainly presented at the trial, and before the case was submitted to the jury, and a ruling thereon had.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">The failure of the plaintiff to present a written claim to the defendant, within thirty days of the date of the receipt, is, however, urged as a reason why he should not recover in this action. That point was urged on the trial. But it cannot prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">The provision in the contract upon that subject cannot apply to this case. As soon as he was apprised of the loss, the plaintiff called upon the defendant for an explanation. Time was taken by the defendant in searching for, and tracing the package. They supposed that it had been delivered, but in the end stated that it could not be found. When informed of that fact, the plaintiff presented his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">Time taken by the defendant in searching for the goods, under the circumstances of this case, in the expectation of finding them, excused the earlier presentation of the plaintiff\u2019s demands (Smith <em>v. </em>Dinsmore, 9 <em>Daly, </em>188). The judgment and order are affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">Sedgwick, Ch. J., and Freedman, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
