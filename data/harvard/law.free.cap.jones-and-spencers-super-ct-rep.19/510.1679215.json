Our construction of the agreement between the plaintiff and defendant is in harmony with that given to it, by the learned judge upon the trial. Such construction is that the sole right, to the exclusion of others, was granted to the plaintiff to sell and vend wine and beer upon the premises known as the Polo Grounds, but that the exercise of the right to vend was limited to the bar under _the grand stand, and to the structure or bar to be erected upon the western bank of the grounds. Such construction, we apprehend, does not violate, but is in accord with the rules of construction which the counsel for the appellant has carefully cited. In this view the prohibition from selling liquor on the grand stand, the breach complained of, was not a violation of the agreement, and gave the plaintiff no ground of complaint. The parties themselves seem to have understood the agreement. For, notwithstanding the prohibition to sell upon the grand stand, the plaintiff paid his rent monthly without objection, except the rent of the last month, whereas had he supposed that he had any ground of complaint, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>could have insisted under the agreement, upon a deduction of rent from time to time.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b530-5\"><em>Robert Jackson, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b530-6\"><em>George F.
