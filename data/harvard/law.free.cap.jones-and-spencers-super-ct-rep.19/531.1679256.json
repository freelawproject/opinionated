If there should be, the opinion of the court being that there is not anything in a rule of the kind which might be intended to direct what the court at special, term should do in each particular litigation, such a rule would contravene the statute which intends that each application shall be passed upon on its own merits after hearing both sides.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-9\">The application should be denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
