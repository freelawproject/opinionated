The complaint alleged that defendants carelessly . . caused and permitted a rope <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>attached to a derrick at certain buildings, to be left hanging across the southerly sidewalk of a certain street, at such an elevation as to be a nuisance and dangerous to the life and limbs of passers-by. These allegations were denied by the answer. Upon an affidavit setting forth the substance of the pleadings and continuing, \u201c Deponent further says that it is material and necessary for the plaintiff to know and to show what the defendants were doing at said building at the time of said accident, who owned, and who then used the said derrick, and under whose orders the work done with the derrick was carried on, and what relation such person or persons so using or controlling said derrick sustained to said defendants, and it is the intention of deponent to use the deposition on the trial of this action, and that without such information and proof said plaintiff cannot safely proceed to trial. That no other or previous application has been made for this order \u201d\u2014plaintiff\u2019s attorney obtained an order for the. examination of defendants before trial. A motion was made to vacate the order, which was denied. From the order entered on the denial this appeal is taken.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b551-5\"><em>Samuel Greenbaum, </em>attorney, and of counsel for appellant,</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AO3\">argued :\u2014I. \u25a0 The affidavit upon which the order is based is insufficient to warrant the granting of the order, for the following reasons : First. It does not show that the testimony of the defendants is \u201cmaterial and necessary,\u201d as required by section 872 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The affidavit states that it is \u201cmaterial and necessary for the plaintiff to <em>know </em>and to show what the defendants were doing at said building, etc.\u201d It is not sufficient to merely allege that the examination is \u201cmaterial and necessary for the plaintiff to <em>know, </em>etc.\u201d Facts must be alleged showing to the court the \u201cmateriality and necessity\u201d of the desired examination (Beach <em>v. </em>Mayor, 14 <em>Hun, </em>79; Chapin <em>v. </em>Thompson, 16 <em>Ib. </em>53; Crooke <em>v. </em>Corbin, 23 Ib. 176). The object of these examinations is not to enable a plaintiff to find out whether or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>not he has a cause of action against the defendant. This principle has been repeatedly upheld by this court (Juillard <em>v. </em>Hamlin, 2 <em>Civ. Pro. </em>321; Kirkland <em>v. </em>Moss, <em>Ib.). </em>Secondly. The affidavit does not state that the facts desired of defendants are not within plaintiff\u2019s knowledge or are not obtainable by him irrespective of the defendants. It thus clearly appears that the object of the examination is in the nature of a \u201cfishing\u201d expedition, which will not be tolerated (Schepmoes <em>v. </em>Bowsson, 52 <em>How. </em>401). Thirdly. It appears that the allegation is not made in good faith.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b552-5\">II. But the testimony sought by plaintiff is of such a nature that it would tend to criminate defendants. Defendants cannot and should not be made to criminate themselves. It has been repeatedly held that a party in an examination before trial cannot be compelled to disclose any matter which may subject him to a criminal proceeding (Corbett <em>v. </em>De Comeau, 44 <em>Super. Ct. </em>306 ; Yomato Trading Co. <em>v. </em>Brown, 63 <em>How. </em>283 ; Kinney <em>v. </em>Roberts, 26 <em>Hun, </em>166 ; Phoenix <em>v. </em>Dupuy, 2 <em>Abb. N. C. </em>146 ; Beebe <em>v. </em>Richardson, 2 <em>Civ. Pro. </em>320).</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b552-6\"><em>S. B.

If, in the course of the examination of defendants, any questions be put to them, as to which they may be by law entitled to refuse to answer, their right so to refuse is in no way impaired, and 'will be protected by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">The order appealed from is affirmed, with $10 costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-9\">Sedgwick, Ch.
