Ct. </em>358). And in so far as it is based upon the allegation that the note in suit was transferred to the plaintiff by the administrators of an insolvent estate after the maturity thereof, it was also properly denied, for that fact constitutes no ground. Upon the other bx-anch of the motion, viz., that the plaintiff be compelled to verify his complaint, the defendant has mistaken his remedy. If the verification which appears to have been annexed is really defective as claimed, the defendant may treat it as a nullity (\u00a7 528).</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b533-10\"><em>Denis </em>McMahon, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b533-11\"><em>Abram </em>Kling, for respondent.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b533-12\">Opinion by Freedman, J. ; Sedgwick, Ch.
