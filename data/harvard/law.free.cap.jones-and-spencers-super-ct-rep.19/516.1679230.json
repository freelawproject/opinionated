MILLER, Appellant.</parties>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b534-8\"><em>Decided December </em>1, 1884.</decisiondate>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b534-6\">\n<em>Wegligence case\u2014hall mat.</em>\n</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b534-7\">Before Sedgwick, Ch. J., and Freedman, J.</p>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b534-9\">Appeal from judgment in favor of plaintiff, entered upon the verdict of a jury, and from order denying defendant\u2019s motion upon the judge\u2019s minutes for a new trial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b534-10\">This action was brought to recover damages for an injury to plaintiff, occasioned by the negligence of defendant, or his servants. The plaintiff was an occupant of one of the apartments in an apartment house situated in Seventh street, New York, owned and managed by defendant. She was a member of the family of her son-in-law, a tenant in the building. Upon the entrance hallway, used in common by all the tenants of the building, was a hempen mat, extending nearly the whole length of such hallway, about twenty-six feet. This was suffered to become dangerous, and a large hole, near the stairway in the rear of the hall, was allowed to remain unrepaired for many weeks, and after repeated notices given to the janitor in charge of the building. The plaintiff, in passing along this mat, caught her foot in the hole and fell. She struck her forehead, and by the blow lost the sight permanently of one eye.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b534-11\">The action was tried before Mr. Justice Ingraham and a jury, May 23, 1884. A verdict was rendered in favor of plaintiff for $2,500.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b534-12\">The court at General Term, said : \u201cThe exceptions taken by the defendant are all untenable. The questions relating to defendant\u2019s negligence and plaintiff\u2019s contributory negligence were, under the peculiar circumstances of the case, questions of fact for the jury, and they were fairly left to the jury under a charge which fully guarded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>all the rights the defendant had, and to which no exception was taken. Upon a careful review of tho whole case, no reason appears why the verdict should be disturbed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b535-5\"><em>Martin &amp; Smith, </em>and <em>A. P. Whitehead, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b535-6\"><em>Matthews, Rapallo &amp; Smith, </em>for respondent.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b535-7\">Opinion by Freedman, J. ; Sedgwick, Ch. J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">Judgment and order affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
