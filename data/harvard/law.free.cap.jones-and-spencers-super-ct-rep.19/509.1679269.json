The referee had not made such a direction. The appellant, before entering the judgment that was afterwards vacated, made a motion that the defendant be allowed the costs against the plaintiff personally. This was denied, and upon ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>pellant\u2019s appeal from it, the general term affirmed the order of denial. This was an adjudication in the action that the defendant was not entitled to the provision in question. He was bound by it, and could not enter a judgment to the contrary of it. This would be correct if the referee had directed judgment for the defendant, as to costs against the plaintiff personally. For, he voluntarily would have submitted the question for re-adjudication and this would control his action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b528-5\">If. the special term, in denying the motion, acted upon an imperfect state of facts, the remedy would be to ask the special term to grant, in its discretion, a re-argument upon the facts fully stated.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b528-6\"><em>J.
