It is not the office of a bill of particulars to furnish evidence (Drake <em>v. </em>Thayer, 5 <em>Robt. 694 </em>; Fullerton <em>v. </em>Gaylord, 7 <em>Ib. </em>551). But defendant would not have any greater knowledge of what damaged goods were in the hands of tailors after service of a bill of particulars than before. He states that there were such goods, and therefore must have better knowledge of them than the plaintiff. If so, he is not entitled to a bill.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b386-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number><em>William H. Sage, </em>attorney and of counsel for defendant,</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AvK\">argued :\u2014A bill of particulars of the plaintiffs\u2019 account is made necessary by the order which they obtained that the defendant serve a bill of the particulars of <em>his </em>defense. The affidavits submitted made a case for the exercise of the discretion of the court below, irrespective of the defendant\u2019s <em>right </em>to demand the items of said account, and such discretion was correctly exercised (Dwight <em>v. </em>Germania Insurance Co., 84 <em>N. Y. </em>507 ; Witkowski <em>v. </em>Paramore, 93 <em>Ib. </em>470 ; Morss <em>v. </em>Hasbrook, 13 <em>Week. Dig. </em>393; Bryon <em>v. </em>Durrie, 6 <em>Abb. </em>N. <em>C. </em>139). An itemized account of plaintiffs\u2019 claim is necessary to enable defendant on the trial to prove that the damaged goods were part of those sued for in this action. Defendant has only part of plaintiff\u2019s invoices, and he is entitled to copies of all,of them, so as to identify the goods.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b386-5\">By the Court.</p>\n<author id=\"As3\">Sedgwick, Ch. J.</author>\n<p id=\"A9v\">The action was not upon an account, and' the complaint did not allege any account <em>(Code Civ. Pro. </em>\u00a7 531). The plaintiffs were not bound, therefore, by the section, to give particulars upon the mere demand of defendant\u2019s attorney. They did, however, yield to a demand made that they serve <em>\u201c </em>a copy of the account or claim for goods sold and delivered, set forth in the complaint herein,\u201d and served upon defendant\u2019s attorney something that has the appearance of a bill given by a merchant to a customer, but containing only charges of money, as due at specified dates. There is nothing to show whether or not this is a copy of anything. On receiving it, the defendant\u2019s attorney took an order to show cause why plaintiff should not give a further bill of particulars, <em>\u201c </em>specifying thereon, the number of each piece of goods sold to the firm of Lowry &amp; Brown.\u201d The court ordered that such a bill be given, and from this order this appeal is taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">If the validity of the order depended upon whether, if the first bill served was one that could not properly be demanded, there could be a further bill ordered on the ground of defendant\u2019s absolute right to it, there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>might be ground for doubt. Substantially, however, after the plaintiffs had voluntarily furnished what 'they did furnish, it was a question for the discretion of the court, whether further particulars should be given ; for under the last sentence of the section specified, the court may in any case direct a bill of the particulars of the claim of either party to be delivered to the adverse party. The matter that shows that the court exercised discretion properly, is, that it appearing that the plaintiff had procured an order for the particulars of the defendant\u2019s claim for a recoupment on account of the bad condition of some of the goods averred by the complaint to have been sold, the present order was a facility for the defendant\u2019s making his bill of particulars that the plaintiffs should give.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">Order affirmed, with $10 costs, and disbursements to. be taxed.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">O\u2019Gorman, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
