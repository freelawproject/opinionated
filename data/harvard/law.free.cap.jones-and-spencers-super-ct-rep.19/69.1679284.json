Such a construction would be manifestly unjust. Section 2435 expressly says, within ten years after the return of an execution\u2014any execution\u2014properly and regularly issued. If the legislature meant \u201cthe first execution,\u201d it would have so enacted. Its language is, \u201cof an execution,\u201d and it clearly intends \u201c of an execution.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b87-13\"><em>Edward M. Felt, </em>for respondent.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ABY\">The order appealed from was properly granted. This proceeding was instituted under the provisions of section 2435 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which provides that: \u201cAt anytime within ten years after the return, wholly\" or partly unsatisfied, of an execution against property issued upon a judgment, etc., the creditor is entitled to an order requiring the judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>debtor to appear and be examined, etc.\u201d This judgment was obtained in August, 1870, and an execution was issued on the same day, and returned unsatisfied, and it is submitted that the ten years allowed by the statute within which the examination could be had, commenced running at the return of the execution issued August 13, 1870, and expired some four years ago. As the former statute, <em>Code of Procedure, </em>\u00a7 292, provided that the proceeding could be instituted at <em>any time </em>after the return of <em>an execution </em>wholly or partly unsatisfied, and the present statute provides that it can only be instituted within ten years after such return, it seems clear that the legislature intended to limit the time. We must assume that the legislature intended to limit the right to institute these proceedings within ten years after the return of the first execution, otherwise the amendment by the legislature accomplishes nothing. If the ten years commences to run after the return of any execution, then the creditor, by issuing executions seriatim, can - practically keep his remedy alive for more than ten years and thereby frustrate the plain intention of the statutes.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b88-5\">By the Court.</p>\n<author id=\"Ay8\">Van Vorst, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Avfz\">The affidavit upon which the order <em>for </em>the examination <em>of </em>the defendant was founded stated in substance the recovery of the judgment on August 13, 1870 ; that an execution upon the judgment was issued on the same day and returned wholly unsatisfied ; and that fourteen years afterward, and on June 11, 1884, another execution was issued upon the judgment and returned unsatisfied. In August, 1884, the order for the examination of the defendant was made. This order was vacated by the court, upon the ground that it was not obtained within the time provided by section 2435 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The second execution was regularly issued (\u00a7 1337), and its return unsatisfied, justified the order for the examination of the defendants. Section 2435 provides that at any time within ten years after the return of an execution unsatisfied the creditor is entitled to an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>order requiring the judgment debtor to attend and be examined. I find nothing in the statute which justifies the conclusion that the creditor was limited to the term of ten years from the return of the first execution, in which to assert his right to examine the judgment debtor. As he was right in issuing the second execution, so he was entitled to proceed under it for the examination of the defendant, at the time he instituted the proceedings. There is no hardship in the case. It is suggested by the respondent\u2019s counsel that the plaintiff\u2019s remedy was by a creditor\u2019s bill after the return of the second execution. That could not have been the intention of the framers of the law. The summary proceedings are a substitute for the proceeding by suit in equity. The order appealed from is reversed, with costs and disbursements.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">Freedman, J,, concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
