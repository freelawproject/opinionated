Because it did not, they filed a com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>plaint, in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County, for declaratory and injunctive relief. But that action was dismissed without prejudice by the circuit court for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">Each claimant then filed a separate claim with the City\u2019s Director of Human Resources. When the Director denied their claims, they appealed to the City\u2019s Civil Service Board, which dismissed, for procedural reasons, 61 of the 62 claims, leaving only the claim of appellee Edgar A. Bowen, Jr. for consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">When the Board denied that claim as well, appellee Bowen, together with those whose claims had been previously dismissed, filed a second complaint in the circuit court, requesting the same relief as before. Ultimately, the circuit court reviewed and reversed the decision of the Board, prompting the City to note this appeal. Because we agree with the decision reached by the Civil Service Board, we shall reverse the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">To reflect the changing responsibilities of the police and fire departments, as well as other civil service departments, and to \u201cmake the City of Annapolis a more attractive option for qualified police and fire personnel,\u201d the City sought an independent review of City job classifications, first in 1993 and then again in 2001. To perform these two separate reviews, the City hired Yarger and Associates, Inc. in 1993 and then Hendricks and Associates, Inc. in 2001. They were to review compensation levels and, if appropriate, to recommend reclassification of City jobs, including those in the police and fire departments. At that time, as it is now, the pay scale for City employees was divided into a hierarchy of grades and, within each grade, a hierarchy of steps. Both firms issued reports recommending ways to make the departments more competitive with the departments of other localities.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-9\">After the 1993 Yarger Study, the City, in 1995, adopted Resolution No. R-26-95 (\u201cYarger Resolution\u201d), which moved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>civil service employees, including employees of the police and fire departments, to higher grades on the City\u2019s pay scale so that they would, in the City\u2019s words, \u201cenjoy increased future opportunities to earn merit raises.\u201d Six years later, after the 2001 Hendricks Study was complete, the City adopted Resolution No. R-12-01 (\u201cHendricks Resolution\u201d), which, as the City explained, \u201cassigned each civil service position to a new pay grade and step within a revised pay scale.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">Before the Yarger Resolution, the salaries within each grade were about 5% higher than those in the preceding grade, and the salary for each step within a grade was about 5% higher than the preceding step. The 1993 Yarger Study recommended that the City increase its pay levels by 10%, the equivalent of a two grade increase. Although the Yarger Resolution did move all active-duty employees up two grades, it simultaneously moved them down two steps on the pay scale. Thus, the 10% increase associated with the higher-paid grades was \u201cimmediately offset,\u201d according to the City, by a 10% decrease associated with the lower-paid steps.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">The result was that, although active-duty employees did not receive pay increases on the date the resolution took effect, they were now able to receive, according to the City, \u201cadditional in-grade increases, through the merit system, by progressing through the newly-available steps within\u201d the new grade.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> But their progression under the new system was not automatic. The resolution stated that \u201cin-grade increases shall proceed according to City Code Section 3.12.070____\u201d That section states that active-duty employees could not receive an in-grade pay increase \u201cwithout the favorable recommendation of [a] supervisorial authority\u201d required by ACC \u00a7 3.12.070C1. It further states that, \u201c[i]n no case shall an in-grade increase be awarded without regard to an employee\u2019s performance.\u201d ACC \u00a7 3.12.070C2. If an employee progressed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>to the next step, he or she received about a 5% increase in pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">Six years later, in 2001, the Hendricks Resolution assigned each \u201ccivil service and exempt service position[ ]\u201d to a new pay grade and step within a revised pay scale. It compressed the number of pay grades from 40 to 20 and the number of steps within each grade from 11 to 10. The increments between steps in each grade increased from 5% to 5.36%, and the \u201cupper limits on compensation\u201d were raised. The resolution placed present employees in a new grade and step, resulting in a new salary, which was 102% of their current salary. But any further pay raise depended upon a progression to the next step in the pay grade. That would occur, if at all, on the anniversary date of their employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">Appellees claim that, because the Yarger and Hendricks Resolutions ultimately resulted in pay raises for active-duty employees, they were also entitled to commensurate increases in their pension payments under ACC \u00a7 3.36.150A1. That section, entitled \u201cCost-of-living adjustment,\u201d states that \u201c[e]ach retired member\u2019s pension shall be increased by the same percentage as any increase in the pay scale for members of the same rank and years of service who are on active duty.\u201d ACC \u00a7 3.36.150A1. The City did not increase pension payments, however, because it claimed that ACC \u00a7 3.36.150A1 only applies to cost-of-living increases. Instead, it granted, under ACC \u00a7 3.36.150A1, a 2% cost-of-living adjustment in 1993, 1995, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, and 2002 and a 3% cost-of-living adjustment in 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">Convinced they had been denied what the Code promised, appellees filed a complaint in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County requesting \u201cdeclaratory and injunctive relief and retroactive and prospective increases\u201d in their pension payments. The City responded by filing a motion to dismiss, citing the failure of appellees to exhaust their administrative remedies. The circuit court agreed with the City and dismissed their complaint without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>Each appellee then filed a separate claim with the City\u2019s Director of Human Resources, insisting that his or her pension payments should have been increased in tandem with the wage increases received by active-duty personnel. When their claims were denied, they appealed to the City\u2019s Civil Service Board. After a hearing, the Board dismissed 61 of the 62 appellees, declaring that it was inappropriate to hear the ease as a class action. That ruling left only the claim of appellee, Edgar A. Bowen, Jr., for consideration, and Bowen\u2019s claim was denied by the Board after it concluded that ACC \u00a7 3.36.150A1 only applied to \u201ccost-of-living\u201d adjustments and that the wage increases resulting from the Yarger and Hendricks Resolutions were not related to \u201ccost-of-living.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">Together with the 61 appellees whose claims had been earlier dismissed by the Board, Bowen then filed a second complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County. Both sides stipulated to the issues they wanted reviewed. Cross-motions for summary judgment followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">Declaring that the City Code permitted appellees to petition the circuit court for judicial review of the Civil Service Board\u2019s decision, the circuit court treated the complaint as such a petition and held that the Board\u2019s interpretation of ACC \u00a7 3.36.150A1 was \u201cerroneous.\u201d That section of the City Code, the court opined, required that appellees receive pension increases commensurate with wage increases received by active-duty personnel, pursuant to the Yarger and Hendricks Resolutions. Consequently, it reversed the Board\u2019s decision and remanded the case to the Board for it to enter a judgment in favor of appellees. From that decision, the City noted this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">MOTION TO DISMISS APPEAL</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">Demanding dismissal of the City\u2019s appeal, appellees maintain that Maryland Code (1974, 2006 RepLVol.) \u00a7 12-302 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (\u201cCJP\u201d) bars the City from appealing the circuit court\u2019s decision to this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>Court. While acknowledging that the preceding section of the Code, CJP \u00a7 12-301, provides that a \u201cright of appeal exists from a final judgment entered by a court in the exercise of original, special, limited, statutory jurisdiction, unless in a particular case the right of appeal is expressly denied by law,\u201d CJP \u00a7 12-302(a), they point out, limits that right when the appeal is from a circuit court\u2019s review of an administrative decision. That subsection provides, appellees remind us, that, \u201c[ujnless a right to appeal is expressly granted by law, \u00a7 12-301 of this subtitle does not permit an appeal from a final judgment of a court entered or made in the exercise of appellate jurisdiction in reviewing the decision of ... an administrative agency____\u201d CJP \u00a7 12-302(a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Then, pointing out that ACC \u00a7 3.16.150F grants a right of appeal to the circuit court from decisions made by the Civil Service Board, under ACC \u00a7 3.16.150, but is silent as to whether there is thereafter a right of appeal from the circuit court\u2019s decision to this Court, appellees insist that this omission precludes this Court from hearing this appeal. But that is hardly the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">Neither ACC \u00a7 3.16.150F nor the section that houses it, ACC \u00a7 3.16.150, has anything to do with City retirees or pension claims. Section 3.16.150 of the Annapolis City Code states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-8\">A. A permanent status civil service employee may appeal to the Civil Service Board a disciplinary action consisting of a suspension without pay of any length, demotion or dismissal. Intolerable working conditions, administrative leave without pay ... and other complaints enumerated in the civil service rules may also be appealed to the Civil Service Board by permanent status employees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-10\">B. An aggrieved employee shall file an appeal with the Civil Service Board not later than five working days after the date of notice of the disciplinary action....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>C. The Civil Service Board shall schedule a hearing within reasonable time not exceeding forty-five days following the date the appeal was filed____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-6\">D. The Civil Service Board shall issue a written decision within forty-five days after the conclusion of the hearing____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-8\">F. A party aggrieved by a decision of the Civil Service Board made pursuant to this section may appeal that decision to the circuit court for Anne Arundel County pursuant to Maryland Rule Title 7, Chapter 200 or its successor. For purposes of this subsection, an employee shall be considered \u201caggrieved by a decision of the Civil Service Board\u201d if and only if the decision is to suspend the employee for thirty or more consecutive days, to demote or to dismiss the employee____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-9\">ACC \u00a7 3.16.150 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-10\">As the foregoing language plainly and unambiguously discloses, ACC \u00a7 3.16.150 relates only to \u201cpermanent status employees\u201d and their right to contest adverse disciplinary actions first before the City\u2019s Civil Service Board and then before the Anne Arundel County circuit court. Indeed, neither ACC \u00a7 3.16.150 nor any of its subsections, including ACC \u00a7 3.16.150F, have any bearing whatsoever on police or fire retirees or their pension benefit claims. And those sections of the Code that do, notably ACC \u00a7\u00a7 3.36.010-3.36.300, do not authorize the circuit court to review a decision of the Civil Service Board as to pension matters pertaining to these former employees. Thus, appellees\u2019 contention that the Code expressly provided circuit court review of the Board\u2019s decision, but precluded, by its silence, an appeal from the circuit court to this Court, is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-11\">Though, as we have observed, no provision of the Annapolis City Code expressly authorizes circuit court review of a decision of the Civil Service Board pertaining to retirees\u2019 pension claims, the circuit court has the authority to review the Board\u2019s decision pursuant to a complaint for a writ of manda<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>mus, which, as we shall explain, was in essence the gravamen of appellees\u2019 complaint. But, before we do, a brief review of Maryland law governing mandamus may prove helpful.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\">Maryland common law recognizes three types of mandamus actions: traditional mandamus, mandamus in aid of appellate jurisdiction, and administrative mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">Traditional mandamus is governed by Rule 15-701, which applies to \u201cactions for writs of mandamus other than administrative mandamus ... or mandamus in aid of appellate jurisdiction.\u201d Rule 15-701(a). The purpose of traditional mandamus is to \u201ccompel inferior tribunals, public officials or administrative agencies to perform their function, or perform some particular duty imposed upon them which in its nature is imperative and to the performance of which duty the party applying for the writ has a clear legal right.\u201d <em>Criminal Injuries Comp. Bd. v. Gould, </em>273 Md. 486, 514, 331 A.2d 55 (1975) (citation omitted). \u201cThe writ ordinarily does not lie where the action to be reviewed is discretionary or depends on personal judgment.\u201d <em>Goodwich v. Nolan, </em>343 Md. 130, 145, 680 A.2d 1040 (1996) (citations omitted). Indeed, one seeking such relief must show a clear right to the relief requested and a clear obligation on the part of the respondent to perform the particular duty. <em>Harvey v. Marshall, </em>158 Md.App. 355, 381, 857 A.2d 529 (2004), <em>aff'd, </em>389 Md. 243, 884 A.2d 1171 (2005) <em>(citing Gould, </em>273 Md. at 514, 331 A.2d 55).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">Traditional mandamus is a cause of action over which a court of law has jurisdiction. CJP \u00a7 3-8B-01. \u201c[0]n request of either party\u201d a traditional mandamus action \u201cshall be tried by a jury\u201d on questions of fact. CJP \u00a7 3-8B-02; <em>see Cicala v. Disability Review Bd. for Prince George\u2019s Co., </em>288 Md. 254, 418 A.2d 205 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">The second type of mandamus is mandamus in aid of appellate jurisdiction. The Court of Appeals has inherent power to issue such a writ in aid of its jurisdiction. <em>State v. Manck, </em>385 Md. 581, 587-88, 870 A.2d 196 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>The third type of mandamus is administrative mandamus. Administrative mandamus is used to secure a circuit court\u2019s review of an administrative agency\u2019s adjudicatory decision where no agency code or other law provides for such review. Courts \u201chave the inherent power, through the writ of mandamus, by injunction, or otherwise, to correct abuses of discretion and arbitrary, illegal, capricious or unreasonable acts [of an administrative agency].\u201d <em>Heaps v. Cobb, </em>185 Md. 372, 379, 45 A.2d 73 <em>(1945)(quoting Hecht v. Crook, </em>184 Md. 271, 280, 40 A.2d 673 (1945)). Its origins can be \u201ctrace[d] ... to our duty to ensure that neither the Legislature nor the Executive branch of State government deprives the Judiciary of the ability to correct decisions premised on unreasonable findings of fact or flawed conclusions of law.\u201d <em>Harvey, </em>389 Md. at 280, 884 A.2d 1171. There is no right to a jury trial on questions of fact in an administrative mandamus action because the circuit court\u2019s role is confined to deciding whether the agency\u2019s fact-finding is supported by substantial evidence on the record. <em>Cicala, </em>288 Md. at 260-61, 418 A.2d 205.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">Administrative mandamus is now governed by the Maryland Rules, specifically: Rules 7-401, 7-402 and 7-403.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> These rules \u201cgovern actions for judicial review of a quasi-judicial order or action of an administrative agency where review is not expressly authorized by law.\u201d Rule 7-401(a). \u201cAdministrative agency,\u201d as the term is used in the rules, covers \u201cany agency, board, department, district, commission, authority, Commissioner, official, or other unit of the State or of a political subdivision of the State.\u201d Rule 7-401 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">Although appellees styled their action as a \u201cComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief and Retroactive and Prospective Increases in Annuity Payments,\u201d it was in substance an action for a writ of mandamus. <em>See Murrell v. Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore, </em>376 Md. 170, 829 A.2d 548 (2003). It specifically requested that the court direct appellant to pay them all prospective and retroactive increases in their pension <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>payments that they believed were due them pursuant to ACC \u00a7 3.36.150A1. In other words, it sought \u201cto enforce administrative compliance with procedural ... duties\u201d by either administrative or traditional mandamus.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Maryland Transportation Authority v. King, </em>369 Md. 274, 287, 799 A.2d 1246 (2002) (citations omitted). Accordingly, the decision of the circuit court was appealable to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">The fulcrum of this dispute is Annapolis City Code \u00a7 3.36.150A1, which is a subsection of Chapter 3.36, the \u201cPolice and Fire Retirement\u201d chapter of the Code. Captioned \u201cCost-of-living adjustment,\u201d it states in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-7\">Each retired member\u2019s pension shall be increased by the same percentage as any increase in the pay scale for members of the same rank and years of service who are on active duty. If no increase in the pay scale for members of the same rank and years of service who are on active duty is provided in the annual budget, then the member\u2019s pension shall be increased, effective July 1st of that year, by such cost of living adjustment as the City Council, in its discretion, shall provide by resolution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AOe\">ACC \u00a7 3.36.150A1.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">The City contends that pension increases under \u00a7 3.36.150A1 are, as its heading indicates, limited to cost-of-living adjustments. It is intended to ensure that retired employees of the police and fire departments will share in any cost-of-living increase received by their active-duty counterparts. Since the Yarger and Hendricks Resolutions had little, if anything, to do with cost-of-living adjustments, but principally addressed salary enhancements to attract and retain fire and police personnel, they did not trigger, the City claims, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>pension increases under that section of the Code as appellees maintain.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">As we stated earlier, the court below had the authority to review the Civil Service Board\u2019s decision via an action for a writ of mandamus. Since \u201c[t]here is little, if any, difference in the standard of review between statutory judicial review of an administrative action and a non-statutory review [via an action for a writ of mandamus,]\u201d <em>Armstrong v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>169 Md.App. 655, 667, 906 A.2d 415 (2006), we \u201creview only the decision of the administrative agency itself.\u201d <em>B &amp; S Marketing Enterprises, LLC. v. Consumer Protection Div., </em>153 Md.App. 130, 150, 835 A.2d 215 (2003) <em>(citing Ahalt v. Montgomery Co., </em>113 Md.App. 14, 20, 686 A.2d 683 (1996)). That is because our role is \u201cprecisely the same as that of the circuit court.\u201d <em>Id. (quoting Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Mental Hygiene v. Shrieves, </em>100 Md.App. 283, 303-04, 641 A.2d 899 (1994)).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">In doing so, we defer to the agency\u2019s \u201cfact-findhig[ ],\u201d to the inferences the agency draws from those facts, and to the agency\u2019s application of the law to those facts, \u201cif reasonably supported by the administrative record, viewed as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 151, 835 A.2d 215 (citations omitted). Indeed, \u201c[e]ven with regard to some legal issues,\u201d .we accord \u201ca degree of deference\u201d to the \u201cposition of the administrative agency\u201d and therefore \u201can administrative agency\u2019s interpretation and application of the statute which the agency administers should ordinarily be given considerable weight by reviewing courts.\u201d <em>Board of Physician Quality Assur. v. Banks, </em>354 Md. 59, 69, 729 A.2d 376 (1999) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">When we interpret a code provision, as we are required to do here, we first look at the provision\u2019s language; if the language, \u201cboth on its face and in context, is clear and unambiguous, we need go no further.\u201d <em>Swinson v. Lords Landing Village Condo., </em>360 Md. 462, 478, 758 A.2d 1008 (2000). But \u201c[w]here the language is ambiguous, ... we look beyond the language of the [provision] to discern the legislative intent.\u201d <em>Moore v. Miley, </em>372 Md. 663, 677, 814 A.2d 557 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>(2003) <em>(citing In re Mark M., </em>365 Md. 687, 711, 782 A.2d 332 (2001)). In discerning that intent, we may \u201clook to the legislative history and other relevant evidence external to the [provision] that may manifest intent or general purpose, such as \u2018a bill\u2019s title and function paragraphs----\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. (quoting In re Anthony R, </em>362 Md. 51, 58, 763 A.2d 136 (2000)).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">As we noted earlier, ACC \u00a7 3.36.150A1 states that \u201c[e]ach retired member\u2019s pension shall be increased by the same percentage as any increase in the pay scale for members of the same rank and years of service who are on active duty.\u201d ACC \u00a7 3.36.150A1. Although the phrase \u201cincrease in the pay scale\u201d could have been more precisely defined within ACC \u00a7 3.36.150A1, its lexical ambiguity is dispelled once it is viewed in its codal context. It appears in a section of Chapter 3.36 unambiguously captioned, \u201cCost-of-living adjustment,\u201d and therefore presumably applies only to such adjustments in the pay scale.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">Moreover, ACC \u00a7 3.12.070C1 of the Code prohibits employees from receiving in-grade pay increases, as the Yarger and Hendricks Resolutions provide, \u201cwithout the favorable recommendation\u201d of a supervisor. ACC \u00a7 3.12.070C1. Obviously, retired employees cannot satisfy this requirement and it therefore follows that they are ineligible for the wage increases bestowed by these resolutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">Next, we turn to the legislative history of ACC \u00a7 3.36.150A1. In 2001, the same year the Hendricks Resolution was adopted, the City Council amended ACC \u00a7 3.36.150A1 by adding the underscored language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-9\">Each retired member\u2019s pension shall be increased by the same percentage as any increase in the pay scale for members of the same rank and years of service who are on active duty. If no increase in the pay scale for members of the same rank and years of service who are on active duty is provided in the annual budget, then the member\u2019s pension shall be increased, effective July 1st of that year, by such cost of living adjustment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>as the City Council, in its discretion, shall provide by resolution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">ACC \u00a7 3.36.150A1 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">Pursuant to that amendment, appellees received a discretionary 2% cost-of-living increase in 2001 but that only occurred, as the City points out, because the Hendricks Resolution did not constitute an \u201cincrease in the pay scale,\u201d as appellees contend, and therefore did not precipitate a cost-of-living increase for retirees. Otherwise, that cost-of-living increase would have been, in the words of the City, \u201cillegal and unauthorized,\u201d as it would have violated ACC \u00a7 3.36.150A1.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">Moreover, it is significant that over a period of 25 years, from 1978 to 2003, counsel for the City, both governmental and private, have consistently advised the City that neither ACC \u00a7 3.36.150A1 nor its legislative predecessors apply to in-grade pay increases and that the City has apparently accepted this interpretation as a reliable statement of its intentions as it has not at anytime sought to amend ACC \u00a7 3.36.150A1 to provide otherwise. <em>See Jackson Marine Sales, Inc. v. State Dept. of Assessments &amp; Taxation, </em>32 Md.App. 213, 217, 359 A.2d 228 (1976)(stating, \u201c[I]n the fifteen years since the Attorney General\u2019s opinion [confirming the State Department of Assessments and Taxation\u2019s interpretation of a statute,] the Department ... continued to enforce its interpretation without an[ ] indication by the General Assembly that the interpretation was in error,\u201d and that \u201c[t]his acquiescence by the Legislature is indicative that its intent is being carried out.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">In 1978, former City Attorney Eugene M. Lerner wrote a letter to the then mayor of Annapolis interpreting \u00a7 27 of the Charter of the City of Annapolis, a legislative predecessor to ACC \u00a7 3.36.150A1. In the letter, Lerner stated that \u201cin-grade pay increases do not apply\u201d to \u201cretired officer[s].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b560-9\">Nineteen years later, in 1997, former City attorney Paul Garvey Goetzke wrote a letter to the Director of the City\u2019s Personnel Department, stating that the employees\u2019 retirement plan was based on the employee\u2019s \u201cfinal earnings,\u201d and that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>while \u201c[c]ost-of-living adjustments [were] based on \u2018increases to the pay scale' of the member\u2019s former position,\u201d the Yarger Resolution did not result in pay scale increases. Rather, \u201cit resulted in additional steps being added to those pay scales,\u201d and any advancement in steps depended on an \u201cannual evaluation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">In 1999, at the City\u2019s request, outside counsel to the City also analyzed the legislative history of ACC \u00a7 3.36.150A1 and the City\u2019s past practices under the City\u2019s retirement plan. He concluded that \u201cretirees under the Police and Fire Retirement Plan [were] not entitled to\u201d an increase under the Yarger Resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">In 2001, at the request of the City\u2019s Human Resources Director, outside counsel to the City examined the relationship between ACC \u00a7 3.36.150A1 and the Hendricks Resolution based on a claim of Charles H. Steele, a retired fire chief, that he was entitled to an increase in his pension payments. Counsel concluded that the Hendricks Resolution provided for in-grade pay increases based on satisfactory evaluations and that it was \u201cwell-settled that the City has never included merit increases when determining cost-of-living adjustments for retirees.\u201d And finally, in 2003, the Civil Service Board heard Chief Steele\u2019s claim and determined that the \u201cstructural reclassification\u201d of the Hendricks Resolution was \u201cnot a cost of living adjustment\u201d within the meaning of ACC \u00a7 3.36.150A1.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">Finally, \u201can administrative agency\u2019s interpretation and application of the statute which the agency administers should ordinarily be given,\u201d the Court of Appeals instructs, \u201cconsiderable weight by reviewing courts.\u201d <em>Banks, </em>354 Md. at 69, 729 A.2d 376 (citations omitted). Here the weight we are to give the Board\u2019s interpretation of ACC \u00a7 3.36.150A1 is well deserved, that is, that ACC \u00a7 3.36.150A1 applies only to \u201ccost of living adjustments.\u201d The Board stated that, pursuant to its duties under ACC \u00a7 3.12.050, it was \u201cresponsible for the structural reclassifications brought about by the Yarger and Hendricks studies under review....\u201d In fact, according to the Board, it \u201cparticipated in the selection process to determine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>the consultant to be commissioned to do these studies,\u201d helped \u201cdefinte] the scope of the study,\u201d monitored the study\u2019s progress, evaluated the finished project, \u201cformally accepted the consultants\u2019 report,\u201d and \u201curged\u201d the City Council to adopt the recommendations. Rarely has an agency possessed such firsthand knowledge of the purpose, reach and scope of legislation it is being asked to interpret.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">Nonetheless, appellees argue that we can gain \u201cinsight\u201d into ACC \u00a7 3.36.150A1 based on \u201csimilar legislation\u201d enacted by the District of Columbia that deals with the retirement of police officers and firefighters in Washington, DC. Specifically, appellees refer to District of Columbia Code \u00a7 5-745 (2001), captioned \u201cPension relief allowance or retirement compensation increase.\u201d D.C.Code \u00a7 5-745. That statute states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-6\">Each individual retired from active service and entitled to receive a pension relief allowance or retirement compensation under subchapter I of this chapter shall be entitled to receive, without making application therefor, with respect to each increase in salary, granted by any law which takes effect after the effective date of the District of Columbia Police and Firemen\u2019s Salary Act Amendments of 1972, to which he would be entitled if he were in active service, an increase in his pension relief allowance or retirement compensation computed as follows: His pension relief allowance or retirement compensation shall be increased by an amount equal to the product of such allowance or compensation and the per centum increase made by such law in the scheduled rate of compensation to which he would be entitled if he were in active service on the effective date of such increase in salary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">D.C.Code \u00a7 5-745(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">This statute has, appellees point out, an \u201cequalization provision\u201d that grants retired police officers and firefighters increases in their pension when active-duty counterparts receive increases in their wages. Appellees claim that ACC \u00a7 3.36.150A1 is an \u201cequalization provision\u201d comparable to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>District of Columbia\u2019s. To buttress their interpretation of D.C.Code \u00a7 5-745, they cite four District of Columbia cases: <em>Lanier v. District of Columbia, </em>871 F.Supp. 20 (D.D.C.1994); <em>District of Columbia v. Tarlosky, </em>675 A.2d 77 (D.C.1996); <em>Floyd v. District of Columbia, </em>941 F.Supp. 164 (D.D.C.1996), vacated, <em>Floyd v. District of Columbia, </em>129 F.3d 152 (D.C.Cir. 1997); and <em>Floyd v. Rubin, </em>46 F.Supp.2d 8 (D.D.C.1999). In these cases, retirees were held to be entitled to increases in their pension payments equal in percentage to active-duty pay increases, pursuant to D.C.Code \u00a7 5~745\u2019s predecessor, D.C.Code \u00a7 4-605 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">But this D.C.Code provision bears no relevance to ACC \u00a7 3.36.150A1. It is not a cost-of-living provision as ACC \u00a7 3.36.150A1 is. In fact, it is intended to compensate for the lack of such a provision in the D.C.Code for police officers. As noted by the <em>Tarlosky </em>court, \u201c[Rjetired District of Columbia officers, unlike civil service retirees, do not receive periodic cost of living adjustments. The increases which they receive through the equalization provision are thus their only protection against a rise in the cost of living.\u201d <em>Tarlosky, </em>675 A.2d at 80 n. 4 <em>(citing Lanier, </em>871 F.Supp. at 22).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">MOTION TO DISMISS DENIED. JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR ANNE ARUNDEL COUNTY REVERSED. CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO AFFIRM THE DECISION OF THE CITY OF ANNAPOLIS CIVIL SERVICE BOARD. COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLEES.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b550-9\">. According to a 1999 opinion letter from outside counsel to then-City Attorney Paul G. Goetzke, \"Effective July 1, 1995[,] [the date the Yarger Resolution became effective,] the Council also granted a 2% [cost-of-living] increase to all active employees.

The phrase \u201cappellate jurisdiction\u201d is of course a misnomer because the request for circuit court review of administrative decisions is not an appeal.

The rules became effective January 1, 2006.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b557-9\">. Because there was no dispute about the underlying facts or any inferences that reasonably could be drawn from them, and the sole issue before the Civil Service Board and the court was a legal matter of statutory interpretation, the differences between traditional and administrative mandamus are not of any consequence here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
