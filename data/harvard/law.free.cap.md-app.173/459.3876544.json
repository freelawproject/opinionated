We do so in the context of a claim that appellants and crossappellees Erin and Norma Brown trespassed on property owned by Grace and Viola Smith, appellees and cross-appellants, by traveling over a farm lane to access a public road from the Browns\u2019 property. The Browns appeal from the circuit court\u2019s decision that they had no right to use the farm lane, and from its award of $8,350 in \u201cnominal damages\u201d against the Browns.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">The Browns raise five issues, which we reorder and restate as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-7\">I. Is there a final appealable judgment, even though no judgment was entered on the third party complaint against neighbor and appellee Patricia Wolfe?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-8\">II. Did the trial court err in failing to find that the common grantor intended to create mutually reciprocal rights of way appurtenant to the Smith and Brown properties, via three 1875 deeds to the three parcels abutting the right of way?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-9\">III. Did the trial court err in failing to find the three deeds ambiguous?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-10\">IV. Did the trial cotut err in awarding \u201cnominal damages\u201d of $8,350 on the Smiths\u2019 trespass claim? <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>V. Did the trial court err in admitting expert opinion testimony?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-4\">In their cross-appeal, the Smiths raise a single issue:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-5\">VI. Did the trial court err in failing to enjoin the Browns from further trespass?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">We conclude that there is a final judgment, and that the trial court did not err in admitting expert testimony, in interpreting the deeds, or in denying injunctive relief. We also conclude that the $8,350 damage award on the trespass count is too high to be a \u201cnominal damages\u201d award, and remand for reconsideration of that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">FACTS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"AXO\">The Properties And Dispute</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">On April 1, 1875, the Estate of John Harshman (the Estate) <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> divided Harshman\u2019s farm in the Myersville area of Frederick County, by issuing the three deeds that lie at the heart of this dispute. The three resulting parcels abut each other at a common corner. Title to the affected properties is now held by the following persons, all of whom are parties in this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-9\">\u2022 Sisters Grace and Viola Smith, appellees and cross-appellants, trace their title back through five generations, when their ancestor Josiah Smith received one of the three deeds in question from the Estate of John Harshman.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>The Smiths were born on this property, where they still live and farm dairy cows, sheep, and heifers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-4\">\u2022 Spouses Erin and Norma Brown, appellants and crossappellees, purchased the parcel adjacent to the Smith parcel on August 17, 2000. Their title traces back to a deed from the Estate to Ezra Harshman. This parcel is a subdivided portion of the property originally conveyed to Ezra Harshman. The Browns view it as an ideal location to raise quarter horses and to train them for the sport of \u201ccutting,\u201d in which a horse separates a marked heifer from the rest of the herd.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-5\">\u2022 Patricia Wolfe, appellee, owns the parcel east of the Browns, which abuts Harp Hill Road. She derives her title from a third deed issued by the Estate, this one to Jacob L. Moser. Wolfe was brought into the dispute between the Browns and Smiths as a necessary third party defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">The Browns\u2019 parcel does not have direct access to a public road, but does have a right of way north to Pleasant Walk Road, across an adjacent property that is not involved in this litigation. Although the Browns have this northern access route, they contend that they also have a second right of way to use a farm road built and maintained by the Smiths. This lane passes along a portion of the southern boundary between the Brown and Smith parcels, then continues past the eastern boundary between the Brown and Wolfe properties, across land owned by the Smiths and out to Woodland Way Road, which lies along the eastern boundary of the Wolfe parcel. This lane is the Smiths\u2019 sole route from their home and farm to a public road.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">Citing representations made by their seller, real estate agents, and surveyors that their property has the use of a deeded right of way to the public road east of the property, the Browns claim the right to use this farm lane. They have two reasons to prefer this route to the longer one across their own property leading to Pleasant Walk Road. First, the home they built during this dispute is situated near the southern boundary of their property, close to where the farm lane <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>passes, making this route their most convenient to a public road. Second, by using the farm lane to Woodland Way Road, rather than crossing the full length of their own property to reach the right of way to Pleasant Walk Road, the Browns can pasture their horses without exposing them to the ingress and egress traffic generated by the Browns, their contractors, and business-related visitors.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">The Smiths deny that the Browns have a right of way over any part of their property, asserting that the Smith family has had exclusive and peaceful use of the farm lane for more than one hundred years. The Smiths have used this lane for at least sixty years, traveling it several times each day during their dairy operations and to reach their residence. A fence erected long ago between the lane and what is now the Brown property has a system of gates, so that the Smiths\u2019 farm animals can be pastured safely. The fence and gates have been there in one version or another since 81 year old Grace Smith was in high school.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">The debate between neighbors over the use of this farm lane escalated beyond words. Shortly after the Browns moved in, Erin Brown confronted the Smith sisters on the disputed lane. After introducing himself, he advised them that he intended to build a house and to use their farm lane to access Woodland Way Road. Over the Smiths\u2019 objections, the Browns removed a tree and cut a hole in the fence in order to use the lane. The Browns and their contractors continued to use the lane while they constructed a new residence, up until trial. The Smiths complain that the Browns\u2019 construction and business traffic has caused damage to their road and property. The Browns concede that there was some damage to the Smith property associated with their construction traffic.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">At various times, one or the other party has put up or pulled down fences, gates, chains, roadblocks, and locks along the farm lane. The Smiths attempted to stop the Browns from using the lane by locking their gates, but the Browns removed those locks and replaced them with their own, thereby denying the Smiths access to their own property. Moreover, as a result of the Browns having cut a breach in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>fence, replacing locks, and using the lane to access their property, the Smiths could not use portions of their own property to pasture their animals.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">The Deeds In Question</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">For clarity, we shall identify the three deeds conveyed in 1875 by their modern-day recipients.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">\u2022 A deed to the Smiths\u2019 predecessor, Josiah Smith (the Smith Deed), conveys a portion of the \u201cHome Farm,\u201d as the original property of John Harshman was known. A right of way is created and described in the Smith Deed as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-8\">Also the right of way or privilege of making and using conjointly with John T. Harshman and Jacob L. Moser a road as follows a space 5 foot wide along the 3rd line of John T. Harshman part and 8th line of J.L. Moser\u2019s part then beginning in the middle of said road at the end of 5 feet on the 8th line of said Jacob L. Moser\u2019s part and running through said land (20 foot wide) S. 86E., 34 ps to a stone planted N. 32\u00b0 E. 10-3/4 ps to the end of the 20th line of said \u201cHome Farm\u201d then 15 feet wide on the 19th and 20th line of said Home Farm to the public road. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-9\">\u2022 The deed to the Browns\u2019 predecessor, Ezra Harshman (the Brown Deed), conveys an adjacent portion of the Home Farm, immediately to the north of the Smith parcel, with the following exception referencing the right of way created in the Smith Deed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-10\">excepting a piece 5 feet wide along the 3rd line of the 2nd part for use of J. Smith\u2019s part and 2nd pt. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-11\">\u2022 A deed to Wolfe\u2019s predecessor, Jacob L. Moser (the Wolfe deed), conveys a third portion of the Home Farm, located directly east of the Brown property and north of the Smith property, with a differently worded exception referring to the right of way created in the Smith Deed: excepting a road or right of way as described [in] Josiah Smith\u2019s deed for part of said land[.] (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>Litigation</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">After the Browns locked the Smiths out of their property, the Smiths filed suit in the Circuit Court for Frederick County. Their claims, as amended, include ejectment, trespass, and quiet title, and the relief sought includes money damages and injunction. The Browns moved to dismiss the Smiths\u2019 complaint on the ground that Wolfe was a necessary but unnamed party. The Browns also counterclaimed, asserting disparagement of title, destruction of property, and trespass claims. The motion court then permitted Wolfe to be named as a third party defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">After a bench trial, the court issued a written opinion and judgment, concluding <em>inter alia </em>that a right of way to use a specified lane over the plotted course was explicitly created in the Smiths\u2019 chain of title, but that there was no right of way granted to the Browns over the Smiths\u2019 property that would entitle the Browns to use the lane.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It awarded the Smiths \u201cnominal damages of Five (5) Dollars ... on the Ejectment Count,\u201d plus \u201cnominal damages of five (5) Dollars per day (from August 2000 through March 11, 2005 \u2014 approximately 1,670 days) for a total of ... $8,350 ... on the Trespass Count[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AVTz\">Rights Of Way</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-8\">\u201cAn easement is broadly defined as a nonpossessory interest in the real property of another, and arises through <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>express grant or implication.\u201d In general, the terms \u201ceasement\u201d and \u201cright-of-way\u201d are regarded as synonymous----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-5\">\u201cIn every instance of a private easement-that is, an easement not enjoyed by the public-there exists the characteristic feature of two distinct tenements-one dominant and the other servient.\u201d ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-6\">The owner of the dominant tenement is entitled to use the easement only in such manner as is fairly contemplated by his grant, whether expressly or implied, and the owner of the servient tenement is entitled to use and enjoy his property to the fullest extent consistent with the reasonably necessary use thereof by his neighbor in accordance with the terms and conditions of the grant.... \u201c[I]t is axiomatic that the owner of a servient tenement cannot close or obstruct the easement against those who are entitled to its use in such manner as to prevent or interfere with their reasonable enjoyment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b493-7\"><em>Miller v. Kirkpatrick, </em>377 Md. 335, 349-50, 833 A.2d 536 (2003) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-10\">Final Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b493-11\">The Browns complain that the trial court failed to enter judgment on their third party complaint against Wolfe, and they \u201care entitled\u201d to such a ruling in order to make the trial court\u2019s judgment final and appealable. In support, they cite the well-established rule that a decision adjudicating fewer than all of the claims in an action is not a final judgment. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 2-602(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-12\">A judgment may be final for appeal purposes, even when it does not substantively adjudicate the merits of all claims and all parties, if it concludes litigation in the circuit court.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-13\">[A] trial court\u2019s order sometimes may constitute a final appealable judgment even though the order fails to settle the underlying dispute between the parties. Where a trial court\u2019s order has \u201cthe effect of putting the parties out of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>court, [it] is a final appealable order.\u201d <em>Houghton v. County Comm\u2019rs. of Kent Co., </em>305 Md. 407, 412, 504 A.2d 1145 (1986) , and cases there cited. <em>See, e.g., Wilde v. Swanson, </em>314 Md. 80, 85, 548 A.2d 837 (1988) (\u2018An order of a circuit court [may be] a final judgment without any adjudication by the circuit court on the merits\u2019); <em>Doehring v.

Horsey, </em>329 Md. 392, 401-02, 620 A.2d 305 (1993). \u201cThus, an order entered on the docket pursuant to Rule 2-601, and having the effect of terminating the case in the circuit court, is a final judgment.\u201d <em>Montgomery County v. Revere Nat\u2019l Corp., </em>341 Md. 366, 378, 671 A.2d 1 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">Here, the trial court\u2019s \u201copinion and order\u201d recognized that the Browns \u201cfiled also a Third Party Complaint against Patricia Wolfe ... requesting ... a Declaratory Judgment setting forth the rights of all of the parties[.]\u201d In essence, the Browns sought a declaration that they had a right to travel over the portion of the farm lane running adjacent to Wolfe\u2019s property. The third party complaint was tried at the same time as the complaint and counterclaim. The court ruled that \u201cthe language is clear in both the Brown and Wolfe deeds as to what is excepted from the fee simple conveyances in both chains of title.\u201d It ultimately held that the right of way granted in the Smith Deed is \u201cnot for the use of Brown.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b494-9\">After this decision was issued, judgment was entered in favor of the Smiths on both counts in the Smiths\u2019 complaint. As we discuss more fully in later sections, the court\u2019s decision rested upon its conclusion that no deed in the Browns\u2019 chain of title included the conveyance of any easement over or about the farm lane leading to the public road. Thereafter, the trial court was specifically asked to enter judgment on the Browns\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>third party complaint against Wolfe, via post-trial motions to alter or amend the judgment. Judgment in favor of Wolfe on this counterclaim is the only result consistent with the court\u2019s determination on the Smiths\u2019 claim against the Browns. The trial court denied such relief without stating its reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">We interpret the court\u2019s denial to rest on its belief that its existing opinion and order covered the third party complaint. In any event, the Browns had no means to pursue their contentions. The judgment is therefore final. <em>See, e.g., Rohrbeck v. Rohrbeck, </em>318 Md. 28, 41, 566 A.2d 767 (1989)(\u201cTo have the attribute of finality, the ruling must be so final as ... to deny the appellant the means of further prosecuting or defending his or her rights\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">II. and III.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">Grantor\u2019s Intent And Ambiguity</p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">There is no dispute that the Smith Deed created an easement in favor of the Smiths, along the southern boundaries of what are now the Brown and Wolfe parcels, leading to Woodland Way Road. The contested issue is whether there is a reciprocal easement in favor of the Browns, so that they can travel eastward from their property, along the right of way located between the Smith and Wolfe properties, to reach Woodland Way Road. Randall Rolls gave his expert opinion that none of the three 1875 deeds from the Estate gave the Browns a right of way to Woodland Way Road over the Smith property. The trial court agreed, ruling that \u201cthe five foot right of way that traverses the Smith fee simple property is for the use of John T. Harshman and the Smiths,\u201d so that \u201cthere was no right of way granted\u201d to Ezra Harshman, the Browns\u2019 predecessor in title.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-9\">The Browns argue that the trial court erred \u201cin failing to give meaning to the intent of the original grantor of all three tracts of land[.]\u201d In their view, \u201cthe grantor\u2019s intent was to provide all three parcels with access to Woodland Way Road[,]\u201d and \u201cany interpretation to the contrary would, quite; simply, make no sense.\u201d The Browns rely on language in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>Smith Deed, which establishes the right of way and states that it must be used \u201cconjointly with John T. Harshman and Jacob L. Moser,\u201d as well as references to the Smith right of way in the Brown and Wolfe Deeds. According to the Browns, these cross-references demonstrate the Estate\u2019s intent to ensure mutual use of the entire length of the road by all three of the Estate\u2019s grantees. Thus, they have not only the right to travel any portion of the right of way that crosses over their southern boundary with the Smiths, but also the right to use the portion of the right of way beyond the eastern border of their property as it crosses the Wolfe and Smith parcels before reaching Woodland Way Road. Alternatively, the Browns contend, the trial court erred in failing to find the three deeds ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">Deeds granting an easement are to be strictly construed, using \u201cthe basic principles of contract interpretation[.]\u201d <em>See Miller v. Kirkpatrick, </em>377 Md. 335, 351, 833 A.2d 536 (2003). Courts review the objective meaning of the language in a deed to ascertain and enforce the grantor\u2019s intent at the time the deed was delivered. <em>See id. </em>\u201cIn determining the intent of the parties we must begin with the actual language used in the deed[.]\u201d <em>Miller v. Bay City Prop. Owners Ass\u2019n, Inc., </em>393 Md. 620, 637, 903 A.2d 938 (2006). Thus, \u201cthe extent of an easement created by an express grant depends upon a proper construction of the conveyance by which the easement was created.\u201d <em>See Kirkpatrick, </em>377 Md. at 350, 833 A.2d 536.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-6\">Language is ambiguous \u201cif, when read by a reasonably prudent person, it is susceptible of more than one meaning.\u201d The determination of ambiguity is a question of law, subject to de novo review. When the words in a deed \u201c \u2018are susceptible of more than one construction,\u2019 \u201d the deed is \u201c \u2018construed against the grantor and in favor of the grantee[.]\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b496-7\"><em>Gregg Neck Yacht Club, Inc. v. County Comm\u2019rs of Kent County, </em>137 Md.App. 732, 760, 769 A.2d 982 (2001) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>We begin our analysis with the Brown Deed, which does not contain language granting an easement. Instead, the Brown Deed contains only an exception from that fee simple conveyance. This exception is described as \u201ca piece 5 feet wide along the 3rd line of the 2nd part for use of J. Smith\u2019s part and said 2nd pt.\u201d Similarly, the Wolfe Deed does not contain language granting an easement, but only an exception for \u201ca road or right of way as described Josiah Smith\u2019s deed for part of said land[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">We agree with the trial court that \u201cthe language is clear in both the Brown and Wolfe deeds as to what is excepted from the fee simple conveyance in both chains of title.\u201d The Brown Deed recognizes that those in Josiah Smith\u2019s chain of title have a right of way that crosses the Brown property. Similarly, the Wolfe Deed recognizes an analogous easement appurtenant to the Smith property. By excepting the Smith easement from both conveyances, the Brown and Wolfe Deeds acknowledge that the right of way granted in the Smith Deed burdens portions of both the Brown and Wolfe parcels.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">Conceding that there is no express grant of a right of way in either the Brown or Wolfe Deeds, the Browns point instead to language in the Smith Deed granting \u201cthe right of way or privilege of making and using <em>conjointly </em>with John T. Harsh-man and Jacob L. Moser a road ... to the public road.\u201d (Emphasis added.) First, they contend, the term \u201cconjointly\u201d must be construed as evidence that the Estate intended to grant an easement to someone other than Josiah Smith. Second, they argue that the term \u201cconjointly\u201d creates an ambiguity that must be resolved in their favor given such intent by the grantor.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">To be sure, the cross-references contained in the Brown and Wolfe Deeds to the right of way granted to Josiah Smith require us to examine the Smith Deed for evidence of the Estate\u2019s intent regarding the easement. We do not agree, however, that the Smith Deed supports the Browns\u2019 cause, either as evidence of intent to create mutually reciprocal easements in favor of all three parcels, or as an ambiguous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>instrument that might be so construed as a matter of fact rather than a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">As a threshold matter, we find it significant that, even though the Smith, Brown, and Wolfe parcels were deeded by the same grantor on the same day, only the Smith Deed contains language granting an easement, but that language does not refer to the Browns\u2019 predecessor, Ezra Harshman. As the careful serivening in all three deeds demonstrates, this common grantor knew how to create a right of way in a deed to a dominant estate \u2014 and did so quite plainly in the Smith Deed \u2014 as well as how to carve out a corresponding exception in deeds to the servient estate \u2014 as it did in the Brown and Wolfe Deeds. If the Estate intended to give Ezra Harshman the same easement it conveyed to Josiah Smith, it easily could have used similar \u201cgranting\u201d language in the Brown Deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">Consequently, to interpret these three deeds as the Browns advocate would effectively be to judicially revise them by creating property rights that this grantor did not create. In the Brown Deed, we would have to add language granting an easement; in the Smith Deed, we would have to add an exception corresponding to such an easement. Such wholesale amendment of the precise language set forth in these simultaneously executed deeds from a common grantor is not permitted, whether under the guise of construing these deeds or divining the grantor\u2019s intent. In our view, the absence of reciprocal granting and excepting clauses in favor of the Browns\u2019 predecessor in title evidences the grantor\u2019s intent NOT to create a right of way allowing the Browns to travel beyond their property eastward over the Smith property to Woodland Way Road.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">We are not persuaded that the term \u201cconjointly\u201d in the Smith Deed mandates a different result, or that it creates an ambiguity. The word \u201cconjoint\u201d means \u201cjoined together; combined\u201d or \u201cconsisting of, or involving two or more associated entities; joint.\u201d <em>Am. Heritage College Dictionary </em>(4th ed. 2000). It is clear law that owners of a dominant tenement (here, the Smiths) must use the burdened portion of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>servient estate (the portion of the right of way that lies on the Brown property) jointly with the owners of the servient parcel (the Browns). <em>See Kirkpatrick, </em>377 Md. at 350, 833 A.2d 536. As we read the term \u201cconjointly\u201d in context, consistent with its commonly understood meaning, and <em>in pari materia </em>with the Brown and Wolfe Deeds, the Estate merely required Josiah Smith to share the five foot wide right of way as it passes along the boundary between the Smith and Brown parcels.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Contrary to the Browns\u2019 contention, the Estate\u2019s use of the word \u201cconjointly\u201d in the Smith Deed does not mean that the Smiths also must let the Browns travel the entire length of the right of way as it travels past their eastern boundary with the Wolfe parcel. Rather, the deeds collectively instruct that, to the extent the Smiths\u2019 five foot wide right of way along the Brown-Smith boundary includes property deeded to the Browns, the Smiths must use that portion of the lane \u201ctogether with\u201d the Browns. We therefore reject the Browns\u2019 argument that, instead of granting Ezra Harshman an easement in his own deed, the Estate granted him one by placing the word \u201cconjointly\u201d into Josiah Smith\u2019s deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\">Moreover, we cannot agree that this interpretation is so illogical that it could not be what the Estate intended. Construing the deeds in this manner, i.e., to mean that the Estate did not give the Browns the right to cross the Smiths\u2019 property as it continues beyond the eastern boundary of the Brown parcel, makes common sense given the Estate\u2019s stated desire to guarantee the Smith parcel a route to the public road. Although the record before us does not conclusively establish the boundary lines created by the original 1875 conveyance, the maps admitted into evidence show that the Brown property has long enjoyed an alternate access route to Pleasant Walk Road,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> while the Wolfe property has frontage directly on Harp Hill Road.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>The Smith property, in contrast, has always been \u201clandlocked\u201d by other parcels. The Smith Deed documents the Estate\u2019s explicit concern that the Smith parcel have a protected route \u201cto the public road.\u201d If the tracts conveyed to Ezra Harshman and Jacob Moser in 1875 each had their own access route to a public road, whereas the tract conveyed to Josiah Smith did not, then only Smith needed a right of way over the full course described in the Smith Deed. To the extent that the properties conveyed to Ezra Harshman (now owned by the Browns) and Jacob Moser (now owned by Wolfe) have enjoyed access to another public road, it is not illogical for the Estate to decline to give Ezra Harshman a <em>second </em>access to an <em>alternate </em>public road, especially when doing so would burden the already landlocked Smith property.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">For these reasons, we find no error in the trial court\u2019s interpretation of the three deeds. We affirm the declaration that neither the Smith Deed nor the Brown Deed grants the Browns a right of way to travel east from their property over the Smith property (or the Wolfe property) to reach Woodland Way Road.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">Damages</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">The Browns do not dispute that they traveled onto the Smith property when they used the farm lane as their ingress/egress route to Woodland Way Road.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In closing argument, counsel for the Smiths stated that he was \u201cnot gonna try to argue to the [cjourt there is any basis for any damages <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>other than nominal damages if the [e]ourt finds trespassing[.]\u201d Nevertheless, counsel pointed out that \u201cit\u2019s been a continuous trespass for over four and a half years,\u201d which \u201c[ejven at a dollar a day that would be over $1,600[.]\u201d The trial court awarded the Smiths \u201cnominal damages of five (5) dollars per day (from August 2000 through March 11, 2005 \u2014 approximately 1,670 days) for a total of ... $8,350\u201d on the trespass count.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">The Browns complain this was error, <em>inter alia, </em>because the total amount of damages exceeds the usual one cent, one dollar, or even one hundred dollars typically awarded for \u201ctechnical trespass\u201d or other civil wrongs \u201cunaccompanied by evidence of actual loss or injury.\u201d <em>See, e.g., McAllister v. Moore, </em>247 Md. 528, 529, 233 A.2d 471 (1967) (nominal damages of one cent were awarded for encroachment upon and interference with the use of a 50 foot strip of land between parcels of the parties); <em>Wolf v. Levitt &amp; Sons, Inc., </em>267 Md. 623, 625, 298 A.2d 374 (1973) (one cent in nominal damages awarded for single trespass by defendant). <em>See also Mollis v. Faraclas, </em>235 Md. 109, 116, 200 A.2d 676 (1964) (partner\u2019s use of partnership money without authorization was a \u201cwrong without attendant harm\u201d that was compensable only in nominal damages); <em>Shell Oil v.

In support, they point to undisputed testimony and documentary evidence that the Browns and their contractors trespassed on the Smiths\u2019 property as much as several times each day after August 2000, causing physical damage to the Smiths\u2019 land and restricting their use of it for residential and farming purposes. Citing <em>Tyler v. Cedar Island Club, Inc., </em>143 Md. 214,122 A. 38 (1923), they contend that the award of $5.00 per day for such trespassing \u201cis entirely appropriate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>The Court of Appeals has held that affirmative proof of the amount of damages caused by a trespass is not necessary to obtain a plaintiffs verdict, because \u201c[e]very unauthorized entry upon the land of another is a trespass, and whether the owner suffers substantial injury or not, [the owner] at least sustains a legal injury, which entitles [the owner] to a verdict for some damages; though they may, under some circumstances, be so small as to be merely nominal.\u201d <em>B &amp; O R.R. Co. v. Boyd, </em>67 Md. 32, 40, 10 A. 315 (1887). As the Court explained, in cases where \u201cthere is nothing to show that any special damages has been suffered, the principle seems to be established by many respectable authorities that the plaintiff is entitled to recover such compensation as the use of the ground was worth, during the time and for the purpose it was occupied.\u201d <em>Id. See Bittner v. Huth, </em>162 Md.App. 745, 752, 876 A.2d 157, <em>cert. denied, </em>389 Md. 125, 883 A.2d 915 (2005); <em>See also Tyler, </em>143 Md. at 219, 122 A. 38 (\u201cthe jury were directed to award at least nominal damages, if they found in favor of the plaintiff, even though the defendant\u2019s entry resulted in no substantial injury. There was no error in this instruction\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">But Maryland has no statute, rule, or case law precedent establishing a ceiling on what may be awarded as nominal damages.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Although each trespass is a separate legal injury that could theoretically merit a \u201cper trespass\u201d measure of damages, we have not been directed to any Maryland ease that permitted such an award as nominal damages. Nor have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>we found a reported Maryland case of nominal damages that significantly exceed the one cent to one dollar amounts commonly awarded as \u201cnominal\u201d damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">Most courts that have addressed an excessiveness challenge to a nominal damage award recognize, however, that \u201c[n]ominal damages, as the term implies, are in name only and customarily are defined as a mere token or \u2018trifling.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cummings v. Connell, </em>402 F.3d 936, 943 (9th Cir.2005). Thus, \u201c[rjeeovery of nominal damages is important not for the amount of the award, but for the fact of the award.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 945. \u201cNominal damages are not compensation for loss or injury, but rather recognition of a violation of rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In the absence of authority limiting an award of nominal damages, the prevailing view appears to be that, although the amount of nominal damages \u201cis not limited to one dollar, the nature of the award compels that the amount be minimal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 943. <em>See also Romano v.

For-Shor Co., </em>757 P.2d 465, 472 (Utah Ct.App.1988) (defining nominal damages \u201cas \u2018a trivial sum ... awarded to a plaintiff whose legal right has been invaded but who has failed to prove any compensatory damages\u2019 \u201d) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">To affirm a substantial damage award that is categorized by the trial court as \u201cnominal damages\u201d would invite uncertainty for trial judges and juries regarding what are \u201cnominal damages\u201d and how they differ from compensatory damages. When a court or jury makes an actual damages award, it must focus on the nature and extent of the injury to the plaintiff, applying well defined legal principles about how that injury may translate into a dollar amount. <em>See, e.g., Md. Civ. Pattern Jury Instr. </em>10:21 (4th ed. 2006) (for property damages, jury \u201cshall consider\u201d cost of repair, loss of market value, and loss of use). When a court or jury makes a nominal damages award, however, it need not focus on the injury to the plaintiff, but merely on recognition of the right. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>at 10:10 (nominal damages are due to a \u201cperson who has been ... the victim of a trespass, ... but who has not suffered any actual injury\u201d). If we were to allow a judge or jury to award a substantial sum as so-called \u201cnominal damages,\u201d which are neither based on the injury nor subject to the legal principles governing damage awards, we would be creating a new class of damages that are neither compensatory nor punitive. With such an uncertain foundation, any award of this nature poses an intolerable risk of an arbitrary result.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">Although a plaintiff in a trespass case, unlike in most cases, need not prove the exact amount of injury in order to secure compensatory damages, <em>see Boyd, </em>67 Md. at 40, 10 A. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>315,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> a nominal damages award should not substitute for or be confused with a compensatory damage award. A court or jury well might give a different award when focusing on the injury (compensatory damages) than when focusing on the violation (nominal damages). We believe it necessary that the two categories of awards remain separate and distinct, even in a trespass case.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">The $8,350 damage award in this case simply cannot be justified as nominal. But a case in which a substantial award is inappropriately identified as nominal may be remanded to the trial court on the ground that it might be compensatory rather than nominal. <em>See, e.g., Flanagan v. Prudhomme, </em>138 N.H. 561, 644 A.2d 51, 62 (N.H.1994) ($1,000 \u201cnominal damages\u201d award to owners of property on which the neighbors\u2019 garage encroached \u201cremand[ed] to the trial court to determine whether the $1,000 was intended to be compensatory, or, if not, for a determination of proper nominal damages\u201d). We conclude that vacating the existing award, and remanding to the trial court to determine what compensatory damages can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>be supported by the evidence in the record, if any, is the proper remedy in this case. In doing so, we do not opine on whether the record would support an award of compensatory damages.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">y.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">Expert Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">At trial, the Smiths presented expert testimony by attorney and licensed title insurance underwriter Randall Rolls, who has given title opinions on properties in Frederick County for more than 27 years. Rolls recounted his special experience in examining and giving title opinions regarding Frederick County properties that were conveyed prior to 1900. Rolls was permitted to testify as \u201can expert in title examinations, which would include the analysis and plotting of rights-of-way.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">Rolls observed that the deed scrivener\u2019s detailed metes and bounds description of the right of way demonstrated a \u201cfairly high degree of sophistication,\u201d indicating that the deeds should be strictly construed because they were created by a professional. Rolls testified that \u201cit was apparent that there was an attempt to create the joint use among all three properties of the rights-of-way that were created.\u201d But he did not agree that the Brown Deed created a right of way over the Smith <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>property, so that the Browns could travel east past their property, over the Smith property to Woodland Way Road.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">According to Rolls, the Brown Deed merely created \u201ca legal access ... on the <em>Moser </em>[now Wolfe] property ... from this corner [where the three properties abut] ... five feet wide, five feet long from this corner, and then it would open up into 20 feet wide and ... the last two bearings calls for going out a 15 foot wide right-of-way to the public road.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Rolls explained that, unlike the right of way granted to the Smiths \u2014 which crosses property owned by the Browns, the Smiths, and Wolfe \u2014 any right of way that the Browns might claim under the deeds extends only for a distance of \u201cfive feet going in an easterly direction from the common corner between the old Harshman property and the older Moser property. That right of way was granted only over those particular properties. For that distance.\u201d Based on his review of the three deeds, Rolls concluded that the Browns did not have a right of way to travel the segment of the farm lane that lies east of the their parcel, and continues over the Smith property to Woodland Way Road. When the court asked questions to clarify Rolls\u2019s expert opinion, he stated simply that the Browns \u201cwould not have a right of way over the Smith property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">The Browns complain that, although Rolls is unquestionably an expert, the trial court erred in permitting Rolls \u201cto testify as to the original grantor\u2019s intent.\u201d In their view, this testimony constituted a \u201cguess\u201d as to \u201cwhat the parties\u2019 original intent was[,]\u201d which should have been excluded as impermissible conjecture. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">First, even if Rolls did offer an opinion on the ultimate issue of the grantor\u2019s intent, it was not error or an abuse of discretion to admit it. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 5-704(a) (\u201ctestimony in the form of an opinion or inference otherwise admissible is not objectionable merely because it embraces an ultimate issue to be decided by the trier of fact\u201d). Second, the trial court ultimately rested its decision on the language of the deeds themselves, reaching a legal, not a factual, conclusion. <em>See, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number><em>e.g., Calvert Joint Venture </em># <em>[\u00b6] v. Snider, </em>373 Md. 18, 38, 816 A.2d 854 (2003) (\u201cthe construction of a deed is a legal question for the court, and on appeal, it is subject to de novo review\u201d). Although the court may have been aided in reaching this legal conclusion by Mr. Rolls\u2019 explanations, it was the deeds themselves that were the basis for both Rolls\u2019 opinion and the court\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">Smiths\u2019 Cross-Appeal: Injunction Against Trespass</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">In their cross-appeal, the Smiths complain that \u201cthe trial court should have entered an injunction to prohibit continuing trespasses in the future.\u201d Without an injunction, they assert, they \u201care left with the unenviable task of routinely bringing lawsuit to collect their $5.00 daily payment for [the Browns\u2019] use of their property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">We find no error. Such an injunction is not necessary because there was no evidence that the Browns continue to trespass over the Smith property following judicial determination that they do not have a right of way over the farm lane. <em>See, e.g., Scott v. Seek Lane Venture, Inc., </em>91 Md.App. 668, 605 A.2d 942, <em>cert. denied, </em>327 Md. 626, 612 A.2d 257 (1992) (party seeking injunction must show likelihood of future irreparable injury if the injunction is not granted). If the Browns continue to trespass, they do so at their financial risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-9\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED IN PART AND VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR RECONSIDERATION OF DAMAGES.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-10\">COSTS TO BE DIVIDED EQUALLY BETWEEN APPELLANTS/CROSS-APPELLEES AND APPELLEES.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b487-11\">.

The court also recognized that the Smiths had occupied a five foot strip along the boundary of the Browns\u2019 property under circumstances that might establish adverse possession. The court concluded that, \"[a]lthough the Smiths could claim adverse possession to the five foot strip going along their property by the evidence,\u201d this strip of land was not conveyed by any of the three 1875 deeds, and was therefore reserved by the Estate. The trial court declined to issue a declaration with respect to this property, because \"neither the heirs of John Harshman, the father, or the heirs of John T.

Alcovy Props., Inc., </em>273 Ga.App. 830, 616 S.E.2d 166, 169 (2005) (jury award of $625,000 in nominal damages in wrongful lis pendens action was not excessive as a matter of law). <em>See also Wright v. Wilcox, </em>262 Ga.App. 659, 586 S.E.2d 364, 367 (2003) (jury award of $22,000 in nominal damages for trespass was not excessive).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b506-5\">. <em>See also Lanier v. Burnette, </em>245 Ga.App. 566, 538 S.E.2d 476, 480-81 (2000) (\u201c \u2018no precise rule for ascertaining damage can be given\u2019 \u201d in some trespass cases, such that jury should be left to decide how much \" 'defendant ought to pay, in view of the discomfort or annoyance to which the plaintiff and his family have subjected by the [trespass]' \u201d) (citation omitted); <em>Kaufman v. Adrians Tree Serv., Inc., </em>800 So.2d 1102, 1105 (La.Ct.App.2001) (when \"[n]either party sought to establish a monetary value for the cut trees\u201d taken by trespasser, decision regarding appropriate value was within fact-finder\u2019s discretion; award of $500 per tree was appropriate in light of nature of trees and their aesthetic value to the property).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b506-6\">. One court construed an award identified as nominal damages to be a compensatory award, without remanding, when the amount was tied to the plaintiff's loss or the defendant\u2019s gain. <em>See, e.g., Romano, </em>233 F.3d at 671 (affirming jury award of $15,000 in \"nominal damages\u201d as a compensatory damage award). For the reasons explained above, we think it unwise to do so without remand to the trial court. <em>Cf. Pierson, </em>768 P.2d at 800 (construing award of $2,500 as \"designed to provide a measure of compensation\u201d and remanding \"for entry of a more appropriate figure\u201d); <em>Thomas v. Harrah\u2019s Vicksburg Corp., </em>734 So.2d 312, 319-20 (Miss.Ct.App.1999) ($3,000 award to tenant reversed and remanded because it was not nominal and plaintiff was entitled to actual commercial damages for trespass).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b507-9\">. Maryland cases addressing compensatory damages include: <em>B &amp; O R.R. Co. v. Boyd, </em>67 Md. 32, 10 A. 315, 317-18 (1887) (Court of Appeals held that rental value of a strip of vacant land on which the defendant trespassed was a proper measure of actual damages); <em>Abromatis v.
