The City\u2019s \u201cAdult Businesses Ordinance,\u201d it claimed, violated appellant\u2019s right to free speech under the First Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article 40 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. The Ordinance required, among other things, that \u201ccertain adult-oriented businesses\u201d in the City apply for and obtain licenses, limit their hours of operation, and ensure that their booths, cubicles and other enclosed areas for viewing adult videos were not completely closed. The complaint also included a claim against P.L. Smith, a Hagerstown police officer who had, it alleged, \u201cthreatened and intimidated\u201d appellant\u2019s employees for failing to comply with the terms of the Ordinance. But this claim was later dropped, leaving the City as the only defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-9\">The City responded with a motion for summary judgment. The circuit court granted that motion in part, declaring that the Ordinance was \u201cconstitutional in every other respect\u201d except for its failure to provide a time limit for issuing or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>rejecting an adult business\u2019s application for a license. The City promptly amended the Ordinance so that it included a time limit for issuing or denying an adult business license and renewed its motion for summary judgment. That motion was granted in full, triggering this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">Appellant presents three issues for our review. As set forth in its brief, they are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-5\">I. Whether the circuit court erred in declaring the Ordinance constitutional, given the absence of any evidence in the legislative record, according to appellant, showing that the restrictions placed upon communication serve a significant state interest and that the Ordinance is narrowly drawn so as to render any incidental restriction upon freedom of speech no greater than necessary;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-6\">II. Whether the circuit court erred in considering documents that the City provided in support of its motion for summary judgment because these documents, according to appellant, did not meet the affidavit requirements under the Maryland Rules;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-7\">III. Whether the circuit court erred in finding that the Ordinance was not an unconstitutional prior restraint of speech, despite its failure, according to appellant, to provide for appellate-level judicial review of the City\u2019s decision to deny, revoke, or suspend an adult business license.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b580-8\">For the reasons that follow, we affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-9\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b580-10\">There is no dispute as to the facts of this case. Appellant owns and operates a business at 23 E. Washington Street in Hagerstown that sells books, magazines, video, lingerie and novelties that are \u201cadult\u201d in nature. At the back of its store, appellant provides booths for customers to view adult videos. The store has been Hagerstown\u2019s only adult business since 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>Prior to September 2002 <footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em>, </em>Hagerstown Chief of Police Arthur Smith reportedly received complaints of illegal drug activity occurring at appellant\u2019s place of business during the early morning hours before 6:00 a.m. The complaints were made by employees of WHAG, a local television station that occupied a building adjacent to appellant\u2019s business, and by tenants of two nearby apartment complexes. According to Chief Smith, the employees and the tenants expressed considerable concern as to their personal safety. Chief Smith conveyed their concerns to the Hagerstown Police Department\u2019s Street Crimes Division for further investigation and passed them along to other city officials as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\">During this time, Chief Smith met with a man who claimed he had contracted Autoimmune Deficiency Syndrome (\u201cAIDS\u201d) after engaging in \u201chundreds\u201d of homosexual encounters at appellant\u2019s place of business. \u201cHeterosexual men,\u201d he informed Smith, were performing homosexual acts at appellant\u2019s business in exchange for money to support their drug habits. The acts took place by means of \u201cglory holes\u201d in the partitions that separated the video-display booths at the back of appellant\u2019s store. He feared that the heterosexuals, who had contracted sexually transmitted diseases by engaging in homosexual acts at appellant\u2019s business, might retaliate against the City\u2019s gay community. Chief Smith notified City officials of the man\u2019s concerns.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">Some time later, Chief Smith, accompanied by Hagerstown City Attorney Mark Boyer and City Administrator Bruce Zimmerman, conducted an on-site inspection of appellant\u2019s business. At that time, Chief Smith stated, he \u201cpersonally observed the \u2018glory holes\u2019 which had been described to [him] by the man who [had] contracted AIDS.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">On May 30, 2002, the Washington County Health Department issued an order requiring appellants to \u201ccease and desist all structural activities [glory holes] that enable sexual contact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>[to] tak[e] place\u201d because \u201csaid structural activity constitutes a dangerous condition and/or nuisance that could facilitate the spread of Sexually Transmitted Diseases and must be abated immediately.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">The Ordinance</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">On September 5, 2002, City Interim Planning Director Deborah Everhart sent City Administrator Bruce Zimmerman a memorandum proposing an Adult Business Ordinance. The ordinance, according to Everhart, would regulate the \u201ctime, place, and manner\u201d in which the City\u2019s adult businesses operated. Copies of Everhart\u2019s memorandum were sent to the Mayor and City Council members, as well as to the City Clerk, City Attorney, and City Finance Director.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">On October 22, 2002, \u201cthe Mayor and City Council,\u201d as noted in the minutes of the Council\u2019s 22nd Session, \u201cunanimously agreed by voice vote to adopt [the] Ordinance,\u201d which was incorporated into Chapter 46 of the Hagerstown City Code as \u00a7\u00a7 46-1, 46-2, 46-3, 46-4, 46-5 and 46-6:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-7\">\u00a7 46-1. Purpose. The purpose of this Ordinance is to protect the health, welfare, safety, morals and general welfare of the citizens of the City by addressing the deleterious secondary effects of certain adult oriented businesses operating within the City; to prevent the impairment of, or detriment to neighboring properties; to promote safe, sanitary conditions and combat the spread of sexually transmitted disease; and to protect children who may be attracted to such establishments. This chapter does not have, and is not intended to have the purpose or effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative material, or to infringe upon the reasonable exercise of a legitimate business.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-8\">\u00a7 46-2. Definitions. For purposes of this chapter the following terms shall have the following meanings:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-9\">A. Adult business.

The address at which the adult business will be operated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-9\">B. The name, street address and telephone number of all owners of the adult business.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-10\">C. If the owner of the adult business is not an individual, the applicant shall provide the name, street address, resident agent, resident agent address and telephone number of the owner. Applicant shall further provide the names, addresses and telephone numbers of all individuals or entities who own or have any interest in the entity which owns the adult business.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-11\">D.

A non-refundable annual license fee of $250.00.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AnR\">\u00a7 46-5. Adult business regulations. The following regulations shall apply to all adult businesses in the City:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-5\">A. No adult business shall operate or be open to the public between the hours of 1:00 a.m. and 6:00 a.m.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-6\">B. No adult business shall be located within 500 feet of another legally operating and licensed adult business. Adult businesses existing and actually operating on the effective date of this chapter shall be exempt from this regulation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-7\">C. No adult business shall permit anyone under the age of 18 years of age to be on the premises of the adult business for any purpose.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-8\">D. No booth, cubicle or area used for viewing motion pictures, films, movies, videos or other similar images by the general public shall be capable of being completely closed. Any such booth, cubicle or area shall be and remain open at all times.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-9\">E. No booth or cubicle used for viewing motion pictures, films, movies, videos or other similar images by the general public shall have any holes or openings, nor shall any booth or cubicle be accessible by any adjacent booth or cubicle, except for the primary opening for ingress and egress to said booth or cubicle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-10\">\u00a7 46.6. Denial; revocation or suspension. An adult business license may be denied, revoked or suspended at any time by the Department if after receipt of written notice, the owner fails to immediately eliminate any violations of the regulations contained herein. Denial, revocation or suspension of an adult business license shall be in addition to, and in substitution of the penalties provided for in \u00a7 46-8 of this chapter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b584-11\">Of particular relevance to the issue that gave rise to this action were \u00a7 46-4(C), \u00a7 46-5(E) and \u00a7 46. 6. Section 46-4(C) required each adult business license applicant to disclose the names, addresses and telephone numbers of all individuals or entities having an ownership interest in the business. Section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>46-5(E) prohibited licensed adult businesses from \u201ccomplete[ly] closing\u201d any \u201cbooth, cubicle or area used for viewing motion pictures, films, movies, videos or other similar images by the general public.\u201d And \u00a7 46.6 set forth the requirements for denying an adult business license and revoking or suspending a license that had already been issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-4\">Appellant\u2019s Complaint</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">On March 6, 2003, appellant filed a complaint in the Circuit Court for Washington County against the City and Hagerstown Officer P.L. Smith. The complaint alleged that, on March 3, 2003, Officer Smith and an unnamed city attorney went to appellant\u2019s place of business and threatened to arrest its employees unless they complied with the terms of the Ordinance<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which required them to shut down the store between 1 a.m. and 6 a.m. and ensure that none of the video booths located on the premises were, at any time, completely closed.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">Count one of appellant\u2019s complaint sought a declaration that the Ordinance violated Article 40 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights because it was \u201cnot narrowly drawn ... [did] not provide for alternative avenues of communication ... lack[ed] effective limitations of the time for an administrative decision ... fail[ed] to provide for prompt judicial review\u201d and \u201cconstitute[d] an unreviewable prior restraint on free speech.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">Count two requested that Officer Smith be enjoined \u201cfrom further acts of intimidation and acts of reprisal against [appellant],\u201d which \u201cconstitute^] a chilling effect upon [appellant\u2019s] free speech\u201d and \u201ccaused [appellant] economic harm.\u201d And appellant requested that the circuit court \u201center judgment ... in the amount of One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100, 000)\u201d against the officer and the City.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>Proceedings Below</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">At the City\u2019s request, the case was removed to the United States District Court for the District of Maryland because appellant, in the City\u2019s words, \u201c[wa]s alleging that [the City] violated its rights of free speech, presumably under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.\u201d But the federal court ultimately sent the case back to the circuit court after appellant abandoned that claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">Then, in September 2003, the Court of Appeals, in <em>Pack Shack v. Howard Co., </em>377 Md. 55, 832 A.2d 170 (2003), declared a Howard County ordinance unconstitutional because it conditioned the grant of licenses to operate adult businesses on certain mandatory disclosures: specifically, that each adult business license applicant state the name and address of all natural persons having a financial interest in the business. Relying solely on that decision, appellant moved for partial summary judgment, asserting that \u201c[t]he requirements for licensure set forth\u201d under the Hagerstown Adult Business Law were \u201cunconstitutional and in violation of the Maryland Declaration of Rights Article.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">Filed on June 24, 2004, appellant\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment was still pending before the circuit court one month later when the City Council repealed \u00a7 46^4(C), as it required the same type of information requested by Howard County in <em>Pack Shack. </em>Following that amendment, the City filed a cross motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">To its summary judgment motion, the City attached copies of the Health Department order requiring appellants to \u201ccease and desist all structural activities that enable sexual contact,\u201d the agenda and minutes for the September 10th, September 24th and October 22nd Mayor and City Council meetings; appellant\u2019s adult business license application; and answers to interrogatories propounded by both sides.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-8\">On August 2, 2004, appellant filed a motion to strike the City\u2019s exhibits, principally the City\u2019s answers to interrogatories. Appellant argued that the answers were hearsay and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>inadmissible under Rule 2-501(c) as \u201can affidavit supporting or opposing a motion for summary judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\">In response, the City supplemented its motion with the following exhibits: an affidavit signed by Chief Smith, a copy of the September 5th memorandum from City Interim Planning Director Deborah Everhart to Administrator Bruce Zimmerman containing the proposed Adult Businesses Ordinance, and a copy of the amended Ordinance. Thereafter, the circuit court denied appellant\u2019s motion to strike on the grounds that the City had \u201csupplied the appropriate affidavit,\u201d apparently referring to Chief Smith\u2019s sworn statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">A hearing on the City\u2019s motion for summary judgment ensued. Following that hearing, on November 3, 2004, the court issued a memorandum opinion denying the City\u2019s request for summary judgment as to count one of appellant\u2019s complaint, while noting that the Ordinance was, in fact, \u201cenforceable, except for the deficiency found due to there being no time standard to decide to issue or reject a business license.\u201d But it granted the City summary judgment as to count two of appellant\u2019s complaint, pointing out that the police officer, whom appellant claimed had threatened and intimidated its employees, was no longer a party to the suit, and that appellant \u201chad admitted in its answer to interrogatories that ... [count two] applie[d] to the police officer and not to the [City].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">On February 25, 2005, the City amended the Ordinance again. It inserted \u00a7 46-4(F), mandating that adult business licenses be issued or denied within 30 days of application. It also added a sentence to \u00a7 46-6, stating that \u201c[a]ny applicant or licensee who has a license denied, revoked or suspended shall have the right to appeal such action of the Department to the Circuit Court for Washington County, Maryland, within (30) days of receipt of the notice of said action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">On March 15, 2005, the City again moved for summary judgment based on the re-amended Ordinance. Two weeks later, appellant modified its complaint to include the contention that \u201c[t]he disclosure requirements in the Hagerstown <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>Adult Bookstore Law, as provided in \u00a7 46.4 thereof, constitute an unconstitutional prior restraint on free speech.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">On June 30th, the court issued an order granting the City\u2019s motion for summary judgment. It held that the Ordinance, as amended, was \u201cconstitutional and violate[d] nether [sic] Maryland Declaration of Rights, the Maryland Constitution, nor The Constitution of the United States.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">Appellant contends that the circuit court erred in holding that the Ordinance was constitutional. It claims that there is nothing in the legislative record to indicate that the City Council had information or evidence before it, prior to the enactment of the Ordinance, sufficient to establish that the law would serve a significant state interest and would be narrowly tailored so as to render any incidental restriction upon freedom of speech no greater than necessary. Consequently, the Ordinance, appellant claims, violates both Article 40 of the Maryland Declaration of Right<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and the First Amendment of the United States Constitution.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">In alleging that the Ordinance is unconstitutional under the First Amendment, appellant has revived a claim that it previously abandoned when its complaint was before the United States District Court for the District of Maryland. In fact, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>was appellant\u2019s abandonment of that claim that prompted the federal district court to send appellant\u2019s case back to the circuit court for resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-4\">In any event, because there is no dispute that appellant\u2019s Article 40 claim was properly before the circuit court and because Article 40 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights is <em>\u201cin pari materia </em>with the First Amendment\u201d and, thus, the \u201clegal effect\u201d of both provisions \u201cis substantially the same,\u201d <em>Sigma Delta Chi v. Speaker, </em>270 Md. 1, 4, 310 A.2d 156 (1973) we shall consider appellant\u2019s two contentions \u2014 that the Ordinance violates Article 40 and the First Amendment \u2014 as a single claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">To survive constitutional scrutiny, an ordinance regulating speech must be a \u201c \u2018content-neutral time, place and manner [speech] restriction\u2019 \u201d which is \u201c \u2018narrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest\u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018leave[s] open ample alternative channels for communication.\u2019\u201d <em>Pack Shack, </em>377 Md. at 67, 832 A.2d 170 <em>(quoting State v. Sheldon, </em>332 Md. 45, 54, 629 A.2d 753, 758 (1993)) (citations omitted). The circuit court held, and we agree, that the Ordinance satisfies those requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">In fact, appellant does not dispute the circuit court\u2019s ruling that the Ordinance is a \u201ccontent-neutral time, place and manner restriction,\u201d or that it \u201cleaves open ample alternative channels for communication.\u201d <em>Id. </em>But it does insist that the circuit court had no basis for finding that the Ordinance was \u201c \u2018narrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>To meet this requirement, appellant argues, the City was required to demonstrate, by means of \u201cpre-enactment evidence\u201d contained in the Ordinance\u2019s legislative record, that this regulation was intended to address specific \u201cnegative secondary effects\u201d and was narrowly drawn to render any incidental restriction upon speech no greater than necessary. There was none, appellant claims. The legislative record underlying the Ordinance, it maintains, is devoid of any preenactment evidence of the specific \u201cnegative secondary effects\u201d associated with businesses that sell adult books and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>videos. And, absent such pre-enactment evidence, \u201c[t]he supplemental materials submitted by the City to the Circuit Court,\u201d appellant claims, \u201ccannot sustain [the] regulation[ ]\u201d at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">To buttress its position, appellant cites <em>City of Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., </em>475 U.S. 41, 106 S.Ct. 925, 89 L.Ed.2d 29 (1986), and one of its offspring, <em>11126 Baltimore Boulevard v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>886 F.2d 1415 (4th Cir.1989). But these cases, as we shall see, subvert more than they support appellant\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">In <em>Renton, </em>Playtime Theatres filed an action in federal district court against the City of Renton, Washington, seeking a determination by that court that the municipality\u2019s zoning ordinance, prohibiting adult motion picture theaters from locating within 1,000 feet of any residential zone, church, park, or school. Granting summary judgment in Renton\u2019s favor, the district court held that the ordinance did not violate the First Amendment. But the Ninth Circuit disagreed, and reversed that decision. The ordinance, it ruled, violated Playtime Theatres\u2019 \u201cfirst amendment interests\u201d because it posed a \u201csubstantial restriction on speech,\u201d and because Renton \u201chad little empirical evidence before it to demonstrate the alleged deleterious effects of adult theaters\u201d that the ordinance was purported to regulate. <em>Playtime Theaters, Inc., v. City of Renton, </em>748 F.2d 527, 537 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">But the Ninth Circuit\u2019s ruling was, in turn, reversed by the Supreme Court. It upheld the zoning ordinance, declaring that \u201cthe First Amendment does not require a city, <em>before </em>enacting such an [adult theater zoning] ordinance, to conduct new studies or produce evidence independent of that already generated by other cities.\u201d Rather, the First Amendment only requires, the Supreme Court stated, that \u201c \u2018whatever evidence the city relies upon [be] reasonably believed to be relevant to the problem that the city addresses.\u2019 \u201d 475 U.S. at 51-52,106 S.Ct. 925.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">The <em>\u201cRenton </em>test,\u201d as it has become known, was invoked by the Fourth Circuit in <em>11126 Baltimore Blvd. </em>In that case, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>federal district court struck down as unconstitutional a county ordinance, which, among other things, limited the location of adult bookstores \u201c[c]ounty [c]ouncil did not have before it at the time it took action____\u2018substantial evidence\u2019 which provided a factual basis for the Council\u2019s conclusion that the regulated businesses actually produced negative secondary effects and the restrictions would advance the stated governmental interests.\u201d 886 F.2d at 1422. In so holding, the district court applied the same standard appellant relies on in arguing that the Ordinance at issue is invalid, namely, the requirement that the legislative record surrounding the Ordinance contain preenactment evidence demonstrating the \u201cnegative secondary effects\u201d of the particular adult businesses that the law was intended to regulate.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">But this requirement, the Fourth Circuit declared, \u201c \u2018imposed ... an unnecessarily rigid burden of proof \u201d on the county council. <em>Id. (quoting Renton, </em>475 U.S. at 50, 106 S.Ct. 925). The <em>Renton </em>test does not require, it avowed, extensive pre-enactment evidence in the legislative record. On the contrary, the Fourth Circuit observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-6\">[LJittle more than general, nonscientific and conclusory statements about sexually oriented businesses and their negative secondary effects met [Renton\u2019s] burden of proof. 886 F.2d at 1422.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">In applying the <em>Renton </em>test to the county ordinance, the Fourth Circuit \u201creview[ed] the reasonableness of [the ordinance] not solely on the basis of the legislative record before [the county council], but of what it reasonably foresaw.\u201d 886 F.2d at 1423. In so doing, it noted that \u201c[i]t defies common sense to suppose that community leaders in [the county] were not aware of comparable conditions in other localities. Consequently, we must,\u201d the federal appellate court continued, \u201cassume that a proper factor in this local legislative determination of governmental interests was what was demonstratively deemed generally experienced in similarly situated communities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>It then concluded that the county council had relied upon \u201cwhat was demonstratively deemed generally experienced in similarly situated communities,\u201d that this evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>dence was reasonably related to the ordinance the council enacted, and, hence, the ordinance met the <em>Renton </em>test.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">The <em>Renton </em>test was applied by this Court in <em>Landover Books v. Prince George\u2019s Co., </em>81 Md.App. 54, 566 A.2d 792 (1989). We observed that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-5\">[t]he test set forth in <em>Renton </em>does not require specific data in the record. Instead, the test is whether the Council, when enacting the ordinance, had evidence which it reasonably believed was relevant to the problems the County sought to address. <em>Id. </em>at 73, 566 A.2d 792 <em>(quoting Renton, </em>475 U.S. at 51-52,106 S.Ct. 925).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">In determining that the Prince George\u2019s County ordinance at issue satisfied the <em>Renton </em>test, we further noted that statutes similar to the subject ordinance have been upheld on legislative records containing less evidence than in the instant case. In <em>Hart Book Stores, </em>the North Carolina Legislature had little more than the results of an inspection conducted by a county health officer whose report was read by a sponsoring senator to a legislative committee. <em>Hart Book Stores, </em>612 F.2d at 828-29 n. 9. Furthermore, in <em>Wall Distributors[, Inc. v. City of Newport News, </em>782 F.2d 1165, 1169 n. 6 (4th Cir.1986)], the only evidence presented prior to the enactment of the regulation was an arrest record and one affidavit averring that illegal sexual activity occurred in video booths. Accordingly, we conclude that the County\u2019s reliance upon the record evidence before it was not unreasonable. <em>Landover Books, </em>81 Md.App. at 75, 566 A.2d 792.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">As did their counterparts in <em>Landover Books, </em>local officials in the instant case received correspondence about the alleged \u201cnegative secondary effects\u201d of appellant\u2019s adult business from concerned citizens in the community, namely, from employees and tenants in the vicinity of appellant\u2019s store, as well as from the man who claimed to have contracted AIDS as a result of his sexual activities at the store.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">Moreover, prior to the enactment of the Ordinance, the City Health Department inspected and documented the \u201cdangerous condition[s]\u201d existing at appellant\u2019s store, and Police Chief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>Smith, City Administrator Zimmerman and City Attorney Boyer also visited the premises and observed the health and sanitation hazards there. Chief Smith averred in his affidavit that he passed along his observations, and the complaints he received from members of the community, to City officials. And Chief Smith, Administrator Zimmerman and Attorney Boyer were all present at the September 10, 2002 City Council work session when the Ordinance was discussed and considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-4\">The City officials\u2019 inspections and observations constituted evidence which the City Council, in the words of <em>Renton, </em>\u201creasonably believed was relevant to the problems [it] sought to address\u201d in enacting the Ordinance. 475 U.S. at 51-52, 106 S.Ct. 925 <em>(quoted in handover Books, </em>81 Md.App. at 73, 566 A.2d 792), and that was reflected in the preamble of the Ordinance, which stated that its purpose was to \u201caddress[ ] the deleterious secondary effects of certain adult oriented businesses operating within the City\u201d by \u201cpreventing] the impairment of, or detriment to neighboring properties ... promoting] safe, sanitary conditions and combating] the spread of sexually transmitted disease ...\u201d And these \u201cdeleterious secondary effects,\u201d we conclude, were reasonably related to the evidence on which the City purportedly relied in enacting the Ordinance, namely, reports from citizens in the community regarding unsafe conditions and the increased risk of sexually transmitted diseases, as well as the observations of Chief Smith and other City officials concerning the dangerous conditions on the premises. Moreover, we may also assume, as the Fourth Circuit did in <em>11126 Baltimore Blvd., </em>that \u201ccommunity leaders\u201d were \u201c[ ]aware of comparable conditions in other localities and of the varied responses being attempted by other governments to similar conditions\u2019 \u201d 886 F.2d at 1423.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">Still, appellant asserts in its brief that \u201c[t]here is absolutely no indication that this information was before the City Council\u201d at the time the Ordinance was enacted. But that, according to <em>Renton, </em>is beside the point. Under <em>Renton, </em>a municipality need not demonstrate a definite time, prior to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>enactment, that it considered the evidence it purportedly relied upon in enacting the ordinance. Rather, it must only show that \u201cwhatever evidence [it] relie[d] upon [was] <em>reasonably believed </em>to be relevant to the problem that [it] addressed\u201d 475 U.S. at 51-52, 106 S.Ct. 925. The City has done so in this case. Thus, we hold that the circuit court did not err in ruling that the City\u2019s Ordinance passed constitutional muster.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">In an attempt to bolster its flagging position, appellant further argues that \u201c[t]here was no evidence that enforcement of existing laws would not address any real or perceived problems\u201d addressed by the regulation. But that argument has little bearing on the constitutionality of the Ordinance. The City has no constitutional obligation to limit itself to the least restrictive means of addressing the secondary effects targeted by the Ordinance. <em>Bigg Wolf Discount Video Movie Sales, Inc. v, Montgomery County, </em>256 F.Supp.2d 385, 394 (D.Md.2003) (holding that content-neutral time, place and manner-based \u201cordinance need not adopt the least restrictive alternative by focusing on the precise adverse effects cited in the studies in order to pass constitutional muster\u201d). On the contrary, city officials must have \u201c \u2018a reasonable opportunity to experiment with solutions to admittedly serious problems,\u2019 \u201d such as the deleterious effects that the Ordinance was intended to address. <em>Id. (citing Young v. American Mini Theatres, </em>427 U.S. 50, 71, 96 S.Ct. 2440, 49 L.Ed.2d 310 (1976)) (plurality opinion).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">Appellant further argues that the circuit court erred in considering the following documents in support of the City\u2019s motion for summary judgment: 1) the City\u2019s interrogatory answers signed by City Administrator Zimmerman and Chief Smith\u2019s affidavit in support of the City\u2019s motion for summary judgment; 2) the Washington County Health Department abatement order; and 3) the September 5, 2002, memorandum from City Interim Planning Director Deborah A. Everhart to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>Administrator Zimmerman. Those documents, according to appellant, did not comply with the affidavit requirements of the Maryland Rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\">Rule 2-501(a) requires that a motion for summary judgment be supported by an affidavit if it is \u201cfiled before the day on which the adverse party\u2019s initial pleading or motion is filed\u201d or is \u201cbased on facts not contained in the record.\u201d Rule 2-501(c) states that affidavits filed in support or opposition to motions for summary judgment \u201cshall be made upon personal knowledge, shall set forth such facts as would be admissible in evidence, and shall show affirmatively that the affiant is competent to testify to the matters stated in the affidavit.\u201d And Rule 2-311(d) states that \u201c[a] motion or a response to a motion that is based on facts not contained in the record shall be supported by affidavit and accompanied by any papers on which it is based.\u201d Because a court has \u201cno right\u201d to consider any \u201cfact\u201d set forth by a party in violation of Rule 2 \u2014 311(d), <em>Scully v. Tauber, </em>138 Md.App. 423, 431, 771 A.2d 550 (2001), appellant claims that the circuit court erred in relying on the aforementioned documents in granting the City\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">The interrogatory answers, signed by Administrator Zimmerman and offered in support of the City\u2019s motion for summary judgment, were insufficient in form under Rule 2-501(c), appellant claims, because they were made \u201cto the best of [Zimmerman\u2019s] information, knowledge and belief,\u201d rather than on the basis of his personal knowledge. We agree that, without more, these interrogatory answers would not have complied with that Rule. <em>Fletcher v. Flournoy, </em>198 Md. 53, 58, 81 A.2d 232, (1951) (holding that an affidavit stating that it was \u201c \u2018to the best of his knowledge, information and belief \u201d must be disregarded.), <em>cert. denied, </em>343 U.S. 917, 72 S.Ct. 649, 96 L.Ed. 1331 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">But, as we noted above, the circuit court denied appellant\u2019s motion to strike only after Chief Smith filed a supplementary affidavit which, the City asserts, attested to the same facts set forth in its interrogatory answers. We agree that all of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>evidentiary facts contained in the City\u2019s interrogatory answers supporting its summary judgment motion \u2014 that is, the complaints from residents and business owners concerning alleged illicit activities in the back of appellant\u2019s store in the early hours of the morning before 6:00 a.m. and the concerns raised by the man who claimed to have contracted AIDS at the store \u2014 were supported by Chief Smith\u2019s affidavit. Therefore, the City\u2019s answers to interrogatories were admissible under Rule 2-311(d) provided that Chief Smith\u2019s affidavit was itself admissible under Rule 2-501(c). And it was.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">Chief Smith averred in the body of his affidavit that he was \u201ccompetent to testify\u201d and had \u201cpersonal knowledge of the facts ... set forth herein.\u201d Appellant nonetheless challenges the legal validity of the affidavit, noting that, with the exception of Chief Smith\u2019s observations of \u201cglory holes\u201d at appellant\u2019s store, his \u201caffidavit contained mostly hearsay and was not admissible for the truth of the matters asserted.\u201d But appellant misconstrues the nature of the \u201cfacts\u201d set forth in Chief Smith\u2019s affidavit. They were not, as appellant contends, offered as evidence that hundreds of homosexual encounters and HIV transmissions had actually taken place at appellant\u2019s store. Rather, they were offered as evidence of the \u201chealth and safety concerns that [had been] raised\u201d by neighboring residents about appellant\u2019s store, which prompted the City to enact the Ordinance. Thus, it was not necessary that Chief Smith verify the truth or falsity of the residents\u2019 concerns, but only affirm that those concerns had been personally expressed to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">Similarly, as the City notes in its brief, the Health Department abatement order was not offered for the facts it contained, that is, to prove that appellant\u2019s store actually had \u201cglory holes,\u201d or that it failed to abate said \u201cglory holes.\u201d Rather, like the complaints received by Chief Smith, the order was produced as part of the evidentiary \u201cfoundation\u201d that was \u201creasonably believed to be relevant\u201d to the secondary effects addressed by the Ordinance in accordance with <em>Renton, </em>475 U.S. at 51, 106 S.Ct. 925. Moreover, because there was no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>indication that the circuit court considered the Order \u201cfor the truth of the matter\u201d in its decision to award summary judgment, we see no basis for error.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\">Finally, the September 5th memorandum from Interim Planning Director Everhart to Administrator Zimmerman was, by appellant\u2019s own admission, merely a restatement of the Ordinance itself. Therefore, it did not constitute an allegation based on facts not contained in the record, and the circuit court, to the extent that it even considered this memorandum in rendering its opinion \u2014 and it is unclear to us that that occurred \u2014 did not commit reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">Appellant next argues that the circuit court erred in holding that the Ordinance did not constitute an unconstitutional prior restraint of speech. Specifically, the appellant asserts that the \u201cprior restraint of the [Ordinance\u2019s] licensing provision is not saved from a facial challenge\u201d because it does not provide the appropriate level of judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">The circuit court ruled that, even though the plain text of the Ordinance did not itself provide for prompt judicial review, it did not constitute an impermissible prior restraint because the \u201cMaryland Rules enable the court to handle challenges to this sort of ordinance, effectively and expeditiously.\u201d Appellant counters, however, that <em>City of Littleton v. Z.J. Gifts D-4, LLC (\u201cLittleton\u201d), </em>541 U.S. 774, 124 S.Ct. 2219, 159 L.Ed.2d 84 (2004) requires more \u2014 both judicial review by the circuit court and appellate review of the circuit court\u2019s decision. But that argument, as the City noted in its brief, was not raised below. Although appellant did cite <em>Littleton </em>in its opposition to the City\u2019s second motion for summary judgment, it did so solely in support of its claim that the Ordinance was unconstitutional because it did not have a provision for maintaining the status quo during an appeal of a licensing revocation, denial or suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-8\">Because appellant\u2019s argument as to the appropriate level of judicial review was not raised before the circuit court, we need <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>not consider it here. But, even if it had been preserved for our review, we would find no merit in it.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">In <em>Littleton, </em>the Supreme Court stressed that \u201cnothing in\u201d the two prior restraint cases on which it relied\u2014 <em>FW/PBS v. City of Dallas, </em>493 U.S. 215, 110 S.Ct. 596, 107 L.Ed.2d 603 (1990) and <em>Freedman v. Maryland, </em>380 U.S. 51, 85 S.Ct. 734, 13 L.Ed.2d 649 (1965) \u2014 \u201crequires a city or State to place judicial review safeguards all in the city ordinance that sets forth a licensing scheme.\u201d 541 U.S. at 775,124 S.Ct. 2219. Indeed, where \u201cthe regulation conditions the operation of an adult business on compliance with neutral and nondiseretionary criteria,\u201d and \u201cdoes not seek to censor content,\u201d a state\u2019s \u201cordinary rules of judicial review are adequate,\u201d the Court opined. <em>Id. </em>at 784,124 S.Ct. 2219. In the instant case, the circuit court, having found the Ordinance to be such a regulation, appropriately concluded that Maryland\u2019s \u201cordinary rules of judicial review\u201d provided such a satisfactory safeguard.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">Appellant argues, however, that the Ordinance did not contain \u201cneutral and non-diseretionary requirements\u201d and, therefore, more judicial oversight is necessary than the Maryland Rules provide. Specifically, appellant maintains, the Ordinance \u201cdoes not contain any mandatory language that would eliminate the discretion\u201d of officials charged with issuing adult business licenses. But this assertion is contrary to the plain language of the Ordinance. Indeed, the Ordinance expressly requires City officials to issue an adult business license to any applicant that submits the information specified in \u00a7 46-4.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">Appellant counters that, even if an applicant satisfies \u00a7 46-4, the Ordinance still gives City officials the discretion to withhold a license, noting that, under \u00a7 46-6, \u201c \u2018[a]n adult business license may be denied ... if after receipt of written notice, the [adult business] owner fails to eliminate any violations of the regulations contained [under \u00a7 46-5]\u2019 \u201d The use of the term, \u201cmay\u201d in this provision, according to appellant, means that \u201c[t]here is no limiting language in \u00a7 46-6 that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>license can only be denied for a violation of \u00a7 46-5.\u201d But that interpretation strains credulity. Appellant would have been more persuasive if the Ordinance stated that \u201c[a]n adult business license <em>may </em>be <em>awarded\u201d </em>if the adult business owner complies with the requirements of \u00a7 46-4 and has no violations under \u00a7 46-5. But it does not. Instead, it only grants City officials the discretion to deny licenses to adult businesses when those businesses fail to meet certain criteria. In other words, while the Ordinance provides that officials may deny a license if there is a violation of \u00a7 46-5, it does not state that they may deny a license on any other grounds. Therefore, assuming that the business is not in violation of \u00a7 46-5 and has submitted all the information required by \u00a7 46-4, the Ordinance provides that a license <em>must </em>be granted, as indeed, one was in appellant\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-4\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.
