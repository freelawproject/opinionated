After these motions were denied, he noted this appeal, raising four questions, which we have recast and reordered:<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-10\">1.

We hold that the suppression court did not err in denying Massey\u2019s motion to suppress. We shall also hold, however, that the State was obligated to provide the defense with any report that was prepared by a police officer who testified as a State\u2019s witness, and that the trial court erred by not directing the State to disclose this report. We choose to discuss the remaining issues for guidance only.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">The charges against Massey arise from his arrest on June 18, 2004, for possession with intent to distribute cocaine and possession of cocaine. A criminal information formally charging Massey with these offenses was filed on September 24, 2004. Unsuccessful in pretrial motions to suppress evidence, Massey elected a bench trial and, as we have noted, was convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-9\">We shall develop the facts as they relate, first, to the suppression issue and then to the evidentiary issues as they arose at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-10\">\n<em>1. Whether the suppression court erred in denying Massey\u2019s motion to suppress.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b122-11\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b122-12\">In reviewing the court\u2019s disposition of a motion to suppress, \u201cwe look only to the record of the suppression hearing and do not consider the evidence admitted at trial.\u201d <em>In re Tariq A-R-Y, </em>347 Md. 484, 488, 701 A.2d 691 (1997). In this limited review, we consider the evidence and reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>inferences drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the prevailing party, in this instance the State. <em>Id. </em>We review the factual findings of the motions court for clear error. <em>Byndloss v. State, </em>391 Md. 462, 477, 893 A.2d 1119 (2006). Although we defer to the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact, we must make a <em>de novo </em>constitutional evaluation by \u201creview[ing] independently the application of the law to those facts to determine if the evidence at issue was obtained in violation of the law[.]\u201d <em>See Whiting v. State, </em>389 Md. 334, 345, 885 A.2d 785 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">Suppression Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">A hearing on Massey\u2019s motion to suppress was conducted on January 21, 2005.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Detective Ronald Marzec of the Delmar Police Department, who for over seven years has been assigned to a narcotics enforcement task force operated by the Drug Enforcement Administration, was conducting an investigation of Room 123 at the Delmarva Inn and Convention Center in Delmar. As a result of this investigation, officers arrested Takoma Griffith at about 4:00 p.m. on June 18, 2004, and charged him \"with possession with intent to distribute crack cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">During the course of his post-arrest interview with Griffith, Marzec learned that Massey \u201cwould deliver a quantity of crack cocaine to Room 123.\u201d With Marzec sitting next to him, Griffith telephoned Massey at about 4:30 p.m. Marzec could hear \u201cpartial voices\u201d on the other end of the call as Griffith spoke, but he acknowledged that he did not know the identity of the person to whom Griffith was speaking. He also admitted that no details regarding any type of drug transaction were mentioned during the telephone conversation. Griffith said \u201cI\u2019m ready\u201d and the other party responded \u201cI\u2019m on my way.\u201d Marzec described the telephone conversation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-8\">[Pjrior to the telephone call being placed Mr. Griffith advised me that the logistics of the phone call would just basically ..., that Mr. Griffith would state that he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>ready. And upon him saying that, Mr. Massey would go en route to Mr. Griffith\u2019s location to deliver the crack cocaine.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">Griffith told Marzec that this was \u201cthe normal course of business between the two of them[,]\u201d and that they had dealt that way at least several times in the past.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">Marzec learned that Massey would be coming from the \u201cBridgeville, Coverdale area\u201d of Delaware in either a Ford Explorer or by motorcycle. Marzec queried the Delaware Criminal Justice Information System computer and obtained a photograph of Massey and registration information about Massey\u2019s vehicles. The detective printed out the photograph and showed it to Griffith, who confirmed Massey\u2019s identity. Griffith said that Massey usually took one of two routes\u2014 southbound on Route 13 or the Old Stage Road. The trip was expected to take about 25 minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">As a part of the investigation, a \u201croad unit\u201d was positioned north of the state line in Delaware to look out for Massey. That \u201croad unit\u201d was Sergeant Michael Bond of the Delmar Police Department, who spotted Massey heading south on Route 13 and alerted Marzec. Bond told Marzec that he would attempt to follow the vehicle and \u201cdevelop probable cause for a traffic stop at that location on the highway prior to Mr. Massey arriving.\u201d Bond was unable to justify a traffic stop, so he followed Massey while Massey first stopped for gas and then drove to the Delmarva Inn. Massey parked near Room 123, left the Explorer, and approached the door. Marzec looked out of the room\u2019s window and saw Massey arrive and get out of the Explorer. Armed with the photograph from the Delaware computer, Marzec confirmed Massey\u2019s identity. Marzec said also that Bond confirmed that the Explorer\u2019s tag number matched the registration to Massey\u2019s Explorer.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-9\">It was shortly after five o\u2019clock when Massey knocked on the door to Room 123. He was greeted by Marzec and other officers, who took him into custody. The officers searched Massey incident to the arrest and recovered a plastic baggie with about \u201cthree and a half grams of crack cocaine.\u201d Bond <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>was assigned to search the Explorer and, within ten minutes, recovered another baggie \u201ccontaining approximately two and a half grams of suspected crack cocaine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">In asserting that the evidence should have been suppressed, Massey contends that the information supplied by Griffith did not provide probable cause for his arrest. We disagree, and conclude that there was ample probable cause to arrest Massey as he appeared at the door to Room 123.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that the \u201cright of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated[.]\u201d U.S. Const., amend. IV. \u201cA warrantless arrest of an individual in a public place for a felony, or a misdemeanor committed in the officer\u2019s presence, is consistent with the Fourth Amendment if the arrest is supported by probable cause.\u201d <em>Maryland v. Pringle, </em>540 U.S. 366, 370, 124 S.Ct. 795, 157 L.Ed.2d 769 (2003). Put another way, \u201c[t]he legality of a warrantless arrest is measured by the existence of probable cause at the time of the arrest.\u201d <em>Collins v. State, </em>322 Md. 675, 678, 589 A.2d 479 (1991).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">\u201c[T]he probable-cause standard is a \u2018 \u201cpractical, nontechnical conception\u201d \u2019 that deals with \u2018 \u201cthe factual and practical considerations of everyday life on which reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>and prudent men, not legal technicians, act.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Pringle, supra, </em>540 U.S. at 370, 124 S.Ct. 795 (quoting <em>Illinois v. Gates, </em>462 U.S. 213, 231, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983) (additional citations omitted)). Probable cause exists when the police possess reasonably trustworthy information, drawn from the totality of the facts and circumstances of each case, which supports the fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place or that the suspect has committed a crime. <em>See Beck v. Ohio, </em>379 U.S. 89, 91, 85 S.Ct. 223, 13 L.Ed.2d 142 (1964); <em>State v. Wallace, </em>372 Md. 137, 147-48, 812 A.2d 291 (2002), <em>cert. denied, </em>540 U.S. 1140,124 S.Ct. 1036,157 L.Ed.2d 951 (2004). \u201cProbable cause does not demand the certainty we associate with formal trials.\u201d <em>Illinois v. Gates, </em>462 U.S. at 246, 103 S.Ct. 2317.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">A law enforcement officer \u201cmay draw inferences based on his own experience in deciding whether probable cause exists.\u201d <em>Ornelas v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 690, 700,116 S.Ct. 1657, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996). \u201cTo determine whether an officer had probable cause to arrest an individual, we examine the events leading up to the arrest, and then decide \u2018whether these historical facts, viewed from the standpoint of an objectively reasonable police officer, amount to\u2019 probable cause.\u201d <em>Pringle, supra, </em>540 U.S. at 371, 124 S.Ct. 795 (quoting <em>Ornelas, supra, </em>517 U.S. at 696,116 S.Ct. 1657).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">The issue before us, therefore, is whether the information supplied by Griffith to Marzec was sufficient to establish probable cause for Massey\u2019s arrest. Massey asserts that the suppression court clearly erred in concluding that the informant was \u201ctrustworthy\u201d and takes issue with the motions court\u2019s rationale that the informant Griffith was known to the police and was motivated to cooperate.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">\u201cIn testing the sufficiency of probable cause for an officer\u2019s action even without a warrant, [the Supreme Court has] held that he may rely upon information received through an informant, rather than upon direct observations, so long as the informant\u2019s statement is reasonably corroborated by other matters within the officer\u2019s knowledge.\u201d <em>Jones v. United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number><em>States, </em>362 U.S. 257, 269, 80 S.Ct. 725, 4 L.Ed.2d 697 (1960), <em>overruled on other grounds, United States v. Salvucci, </em>448 U.S. 83, 100 S.Ct. 2547, 65 L.Ed.2d 619 (1980). The informant\u2019s reliability, veracity, and basis of knowledge are relevant factors in the probable cause determination. <em>State v. Lee, </em>330 Md. 320, 327, 624 A.2d 492 (1993) (citing <em>Winters v. State, </em>301 Md. 214, 227, 482 A.2d 886 (1984)). <em>See Illinois v. Gates, supra, </em>462 U.S. at 230, 103 S.Ct. 2317 (factors are \u201cclosely intertwined issues that may usefully illuminate the commonsense, practical question whether there is \u2018probable cause[.]\u2019 \u201d). <em>See generally, West v. State, </em>137 Md.App. 314, 328-33, 768 A.2d 150, <em>cert. denied, </em>364 Md. 536, 774 A.2d 409 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">Challenging the basis for police actions in this case, Massey relies primarily on <em>Dixon v. State, </em>133 MdApp. 654, 758 A.2d 1063 (2000), in which this Court determined that a tip from a confidential informant did not provide police with probable cause. The informant\u2019s information in <em>Dixon </em>prompted the police to search the trunk of Dixon\u2019s car. The informant, who supposedly had provided police with information on prior occasions, called one officer to inform him that \u201ca black male named Orville Dixon would be transporting approximately ten pounds of marijuana to the second level of a parking garage adjacent to the Nordstrom\u2019s department store at the Montgomery Mall.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 659, 758 A.2d 1063. The informant also reported that Dixon would show up at about 8:15 p.m. in a dark-colored Acura and conduct a drug sale. <em>Id. </em>Relying upon that information, the police arrived at the parking garage and set up a surveillance. They saw the suspect car, and verified that it belonged to Dixon.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">Dixon first emerged from the stairwell in the garage and started toward his car. He appeared to be looking for someone, but did not go to the car, but left the garage by the stairway. When Dixon, who was employed at the Nordstrom\u2019s store, appeared in the garage a second time, he went to his car and sat behind the wheel. Police officers converged on his car, blocked him in, and officers removed Dixon from the car and placed him in handcuffs. Although police saw nothing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>incriminating inside the car\u2019s passenger compartment, an officer opened the trunk, without Dixon\u2019s consent and without a warrant, and discovered marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">Dixon\u2019s motion to suppress the results of the search was denied by the circuit court. On appeal, this Court reversed. Posing the question as \u201cwhether the police had probable cause to search appellant\u2019s trunk[,]\u201d we then concluded that the tip from the confidential informant did not justify the search of the trunk. <em>Id. </em>at 678, 758 A.2d 1063. Writing for this Court, Judge Hollander stressed that, in the case of a confidential informant., \u201cevidence as to the informant\u2019s demonstrated reliability is also vital.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 695, 758 A.2d 1063 (citing <em>Gates, supra, </em>462 U.S. at 244 n. 13, 103 S.Ct. 2317). She explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AjE\">In this case, making our own constitutional review, as we are required to do, we conclude that the informant\u2019s tip did not provide probable cause to search the trunk. The content of the tip, standing alone, was inadequate to furnish \u201ca reasonable assurance of being based on firsthand observation.\u201d ... Moreover, it was sorely lacking in meaningful detail. Nor did the police testify to any significant corroboration of the tip. Additionally, the record with respect to the confidential informant\u2019s reliability was woefully undeveloped____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-6\">Moreover, the kind of information provided by the tipster, such as appellant\u2019s place of employment and his schedule, could have been known to Dixon\u2019s co-workers, other persons employed at the Montgomery Mall, a garage attendant, personal acquaintances, or a party interested in making mischief. Therefore, the police did no more than corroborate innocuous information related by the informant. As we have seen, \u201cthe tip must provide something more than facts or details that are readily visible to the public.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b128-7\"><em>Dixon, supra, </em>133 Md.App. at 695-97, 758 A.2d 1063 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">We believe <em>Dixon </em>is distinguishable. We are not persuaded by Massey\u2019s challenge to the motions court\u2019s finding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>Griffith was a known and trustworthy informant or his complaint about the court\u2019s explanation that Griffith was motivated to cooperate with the expectation of leniency.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">Although Marzec did not explain that Griffith had provided information in the past, and thus had no \u201cknown\u201d track record, Griffith clearly was not an \u201cunknown\u201d informant. \u201c \u2018[I]t is improper to discount [out of hand] an informant\u2019s information simply because he has no proven record of truthfulness or accuracy.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Canfield, </em>212 F.3d 713, 719 (2d Cir.2000) (citation omitted). On the contrary, we believe the motions court could readily infer from the totality of the circumstances that Griffith, a target of a search and seizure warrant who had his own troubles with the police, was \u201cknown\u201d because he had been identified and provided the information face-to-face. For example, in <em>United States v. Couch, </em>367 F.3d 557, 560 (6th Cir.2004), the court, in rejecting the argument that police failed to show that the provider of information was a \u201creliable informant,\u201d observed that the informant\u2019s identity was known to police, had been named in the affidavit, and could be held accountable for lying to the police. <em>See Florida v. J. L\u201e </em>529 U.S. 266, 270, 120 S.Ct. 1375, 146 L.Ed.2d 254 (2000) (known informant can be held responsible).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">Again, Griffith was neither a confidential informant, nor an anonymous tipster. Nor was he an innocent civilian who was motivated by a civic purpose. He was caught red-handed after police executed a search and seizure warrant for his room, and, after being \u201cinterviewed\u201d by the police, arranged to set up a drug buy from Massey. The fact that Griffith was interviewed \u201cface to face\u201d by Marzec strengthens the reliability of his information. <em>United States v. Greenburg, </em>410 F.3d 63, 67 (1st Cir.2005). As noted by the Second Circuit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-7\">Here, the district court improperly discounted [the informer\u2019s] information. [The informer], who at the time was believed to be a participant in the crime at issue, gave the information to Customs Agents face-to-face after he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>apprehended with 142 pounds of marijuana, circumstances that ordinarily would suggest reliability.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b130-5\"><em>United States v. Gagnon, </em>373 F.3d 230, 237 (2d Cir.2004) (footnote omitted) (citing cases). <em>See Cross v. State, </em>165 Md.App. 164, 185-87, 884 A.2d 1236 (2005); <em>see also United States v. Christmas, </em>222 F.3d 141, 144 (4th Cir.2000) (citing cases), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 1098, 121 S.Ct. 830, 148 L.Ed.2d 712 (2001). <em>Cf. West v. State, supra, </em>137 Md.App. at 331, 768 A.2d 150 (no indication that informant had provided information for warrant face-to-face).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">It is also reasonable to assume that Griffith would be motivated to cooperate. The following language is instructive:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AOt\">Even if favorable treatment had not been offered to him, [the informant] was presumably motivated to provide information after his arrest out of hope that his cooperating would result in more lenient treatment for himself by the authorities. He could not achieve that goal if he gave false information, so the circumstances in which he provided the information further served to corroborate its reliability.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b130-7\"><em>United States v. Patayan Soriano, </em>361 F.3d 494, 505 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>543 U.S. 852, 125 S.Ct. 266, 160 L.Ed.2d 86 (2004) (citing <em>United States v. Davis, </em>617 F.2d 677, 693 (D.C.Cir.1979) (informant who lies to police risks disfavor with prosecution), <em>cert. denied, </em>445 U.S. 967, 100 S.Ct. 1659, 64 L.Ed.2d 244 (1980)). Indeed, Griffith could have faced prosecution for lying to the police, in addition to the likely forfeiture of any \u201cbreak\u201d from the prosecution. <em>Herod v. State, </em>311 Md. 288, 297, 534 A.2d 362 (1987). Judge Rodowsky also pointed out in <em>Herod </em>that the informant disclosed the basis of her knowledge by describing participation with the defendant in past drug transactions. <em>Id. </em>at 297, 534 A.2d 362. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>Griffith told Marzec about prior dealings with Massey. <em>See also, e.g., State v. Martinez, </em>150 N.CApp. 364, 562 S.E.2d 914, 916-17 (2002) (after serving warrant, police learn from now cooperative subject of warrant about two drug dealers on their way to house), <em>appeal dismissed and discretionary review denied, </em>356 N.C. 172, 568 S.E.2d 859 (2002). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number><em>Cf. State v. Purvey, </em>129 Md.App. 1,15, 740 A.2d 54 (1999) (co-defendant\u2019s statement may provide sufficient probable cause), <em>cert. denied, </em>357 Md. 483, 745 A.2d 437 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">The police were able to verify the details provided by Griffith. Although we emphasized in <em>Dixon </em>that \u201c \u2018the tip must provide something more than facts or details that are readily visible to the public[,]\u2019 \u201d <em>Dixon, supra, </em>133 Md.App. at 697, 758 A.2d 1063 (quoting <em>Hardy v. State, 121 </em>Md.App. 345, 363, 709 A.2d 168 (1998)), the reliability of Griffith\u2019s information was enhanced when his statements about Massey\u2019s future actions were verified and were placed within the context of his past dealings with Massey. <em>See Herod, </em>311 Md. at 295, 534 A.2d 362. The following passage from the Supreme Court is relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-6\">We think it also important that, as in <em>[Illinois v.[ Gates, </em>\u201cthe anonymous [tip] contained a range of details relating not just to easily obtained facts and conditions existing at the time of the tip, but to future actions of third parties ordinarily not easily predicted.\u201d ... The fact that the officers found a car precisely matching the caller\u2019s description in front of the 235 building is an example of the former. Anyone could have \u201cpredicted\u201d that fact because it was a condition presumably existing at the time of the call. <em>What was important was the caller\u2019s ability to predict respondent\u2019s </em>future behavior, <em>because it demonstrated inside information </em>\u2014 a <em>special familiarity with respondent\u2019s affairs.

And the verified corroborative details supplied by Griffith make <em>Dixon </em>inapposite. Police were informed that Massey would drive to the Delmarva Inn by one of two possible routes in either a green Ford Explorer or on a motorcycle, \u201cupon Mr. Griffith telephoning [him].\u201d Unlike Dixon, who was scheduled to work at the Nordstrom\u2019s store, and presumably would adhere to that schedule in driving to work and parking at the garage near his store, Massey\u2019s trip was prompted by a telephone call from Griffith. Not long after the telephone conversation with Griffith, Massey\u2019s green Ford Explorer was seen heading south on Route 13 toward the Delmarva Inn. Marzec verified Massey\u2019s identity, as well as his ownership of the vehicles Griffith said he owned, by information and a photograph from the State of Delaware\u2019s public records. Massey arrived as predicted and went directly to Griffith\u2019s door, even leaving the Explorer\u2019s motor running in the process. Before this, Griffith told Marzec that he and Massey <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>had conducted similar transactions in the past, and Marzec testified that Griffith told him that the transaction would usually entail the transfer of $300 worth of drugs. Griffith even explained to Marzec that he would tell Massey that he was \u201cready\u201d and then Massey would be on his way.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">We are satisfied that on these facts the police had sufficient probable cause to arrest Massey. <em>See Herod, </em>311 Md. at 295-97, 534 A.2d 362. The basis of Griffith\u2019s knowledge was easily established because his information was grounded on his past conduct of dealing with Massey, and by the events as they unfolded in Marzec\u2019s presence. The reliability of his information was confirmed by the corroboration of details by the police, and his veracity was enhanced by the fact that he provided the information \u201cface-to-face\u201d with Marzec under circumstances that would make his information more likely to be true, <em>viz. </em>his arrest by the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">We find no error in the denial of the motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">\n<em>2. Whether the trial court erred, by not directing the State to provide the defense with a witness\u2019s report.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">The trial court first heard testimony from Marzec, who, except for details about Griffith, essentially reiterated the account that he had provided in the hearing on Massey\u2019s motion to suppress. Since Massey does not question the sufficiency of the evidence, we need only recite Marzec\u2019s trial testimony in detail where necessary to address the issues on appeal. <em>See Martin v. State, </em>165 Md.App. 189, 193, 885 A.2d 339 (2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>391 Md. 115, 892 A.2d 478 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-9\">Marzec described how the police learned from Griffith that Massey would arrive at the Delmarva Inn to deliver narcotics. He elaborated on Bond\u2019s role in observing the anticipated route that Massey would take, and in alerting officers when Massey would be on his way. Marzec and two other officers arrested Massey as soon as he arrived at Room 123. A search of Massey\u2019s person, incident to this arrest, produced a plastic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>baggie containing \u201ca white rocky substance.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">As recounted, <em>supra, </em>after spotting Massey\u2019s Explorer on Route 13 South, Bond followed Massey to the Delmarva Inn. When Marzec informed Bond that Massey had been arrested, Bond searched the Explorer, from which he recovered a plastic baggie containing crack cocaine. This evidence was admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">At issue here is whether Bond should have been permitted to testify even though the State failed to provide, through discovery, any report that he may have prepared. In his direct examination, there was no mention of Bond having prepared a written report of his involvement in the investigation and later in the search and seizure.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">Bond was asked on cross-examination whether he had prepared a report. He recalled that, while he believed that he had, he had not used it to prepare his testimony, and did not bring a copy to court. Defense counsel took issue with the fact that a possible report prepared by Bond had not been provided by the State, as is reflected by the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-7\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Corporal [sic] Bond, part of your training includes the importance of accurately recording important details in your report, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-10\">[SERGEANT BOND]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-11\">Q. Did you file a report in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-12\">A. I believe so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-13\">Q. Do you have that with you here today?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-14\">A. No, I do not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-15\">Q. Do you know where it is?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>A. I imagine it\u2019s at the office, I don\u2019t need it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-4\">Q. Did you review it in preparation for your trial here today?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-5\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-6\">Q. You recall all the testimony that you stated today?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-7\">A. Yes, I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-8\">Q. Did you submit a copy to the State?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-9\">A. I have no idea. I didn\u2019t do it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-10\">Q. You didn\u2019t do what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-11\">A. I didn\u2019t pull a case, no, it\u2019s not my case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-12\">Q. Well, you participated in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-13\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-14\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Your Honor, there\u2019s obviously a report out there we did not get, we have no information about any of the testimony that this particular officer is testifying to here today. We could not have filed a motion to compel because we don\u2019t know if it\u2019s not been provided to us. We simply assumed that there was no report. Now that there\u2019s a report out [there] somewhere we don\u2019t have the opportunity to effectively cross-examine this officer. It\u2019s a little bit of an unfair surprise.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-15\">THE COURT: First of all, the issue of the report was never brought up in his direct examination. So at first blush one can say that this is improper cross-examination. But let\u2019s assume you\u2019re saying it goes to his ability to perceive or recount or observe what happened on June 18, 2004. But in response to that the officer says I don\u2019t need the report. The only reason he would need the report would be to refresh his recollection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-16\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: And I would agree but respectfully I don\u2019t think that obviates the requirement of the State to provide us with those reports in advance when a specific request was made of the State.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-17\">THE COURT: But she didn\u2019t offer the report into evidence and the officer says he does not need the report to testify,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>therefore assuming you even asked for it what bearing does the report have on anything pertaining to this case? [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Well, Your Honor, it would enable me to effectively cross-examine the officer with those events that he recorded in the report immediately after the incident. In this particular ease I asked for any and all reports which have been reduced to writing. There\u2019s only two officers essentially involved in this case. The one report that we have is really deficient with information to effectively cross-examine. There\u2019s a report out here that the State apparently has or may have that\u2019s not been provided to us.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-5\">I just don\u2019t think that\u2019s fair, Your Honor, I don\u2019t see how I can effectively cross-examine an officer without that report that was specifically requested.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-6\">THE COURT: I\u2019m overruling the objection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">Massey\u2019s complaint is two-fold. He first asserts that Bond\u2019s written report should have been disclosed and provided pursuant to <em>Carr v. State, </em>284 Md. 455, 397 A.2d 606 (1979) and <em>Leonard v. State, </em>46 Md.App. 631, 421 A.2d 85 (1980), <em>aff'd, </em>290 Md. 295, 429 A.2d 538 (1981). Additionally, Massey contends that Bond\u2019s report should have been provided in discovery under the authority of Md. Rule 4-263(a)(2)(A).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">The State responds in two ways. First, it asserts that Massey has waived the issue, implying that Massey is not entitled to relief because he \u201cnever took steps to verify that the report actually existed.\u201d Alternatively, the State suggests that, assuming the matter is before us, the trial court\u2019s error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>In <em>Carr, </em>the Court held that the defendant had a right to obtain and use the written statements of a prosecution witness for purposes of cross-examination or impeachment. 284 Md. at 472-73, 397 A.2d 606. Judge Smith specifically observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-5\">Effective cross-examination here made it necessary that defense counsel be permitted to directly confront the witness with his inconsistent prior statement. To deny to defense counsel the tool necessary for such adequate cross-examination under these circumstances amounts in our view to a denial to the defendant of due process of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">In <em>Leonard, </em>this Court elaborated on the principles set forth in <em>Carr:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-8\">Carr makes clear beyond question that a defendant\u2019s right, at trial, to inspect the prior statement of a State\u2019s witness who has testified is not necessarily limited (1) by the rules pertaining to pretrial discovery, or (2) to statements that are merely exculpatory. When confronted with the actual testimony of a critical witness and the knowledge that the witness has given a prior statement bearing on a material issue in the case, counsel is not engaged in a mere \u201cfishing expedition\u201d in seeking access to the prior statement. At that point, it becomes more than a matter of casting a seine over the State\u2019s files to see what turns up, but of directly confronting the witness; and the statement thus assumes a specific importance and relevance beyond its general value for trial preparation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-9\">46 Md.App. at 637-38, 421 A.2d 85.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-10\">The principles adopted in <em>Carr </em>were drawn from the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Jencks v. United States, </em>353 U.S. 657, 77 S.Ct. 1007, 1 L.Ed.2d 1103 (1957). <em>See Jones v. State, </em>310 Md. 569, 583, 530 A.2d 743 (1987), <em>vacated, </em>486 U.S. 1050, 108 S.Ct. 2815, 100 L.Ed.2d 916, <em>aff'd in part and vacated on other grounds, </em>314 Md. Ill, 549 A.2d 17 (1988). In the wake of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, Congress acted quickly to codify the rules articulated in <em>Jencks </em>by passing the \u201cJencks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>Act,\u201d which \u201celarif[ies] and limit[s] the <em>Jencks </em>holding.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Robinson v. State, </em>354 Md. 287, 303, 730 A.2d 181 (1999). <em>See </em>Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure, Criminal 3d \u00a7 436 at 195 (2000). Although the Maryland General Assembly has not enacted a counterpart to the federal statute, \u201cMaryland courts have looked to the Act, as well as subsequent analysis and interpretation of the [Jencks Act], for guidance in interpreting the reach and ramifications of the <em>Carr </em>decision.\u201d <em>Robinson, supra, </em>354 Md. at 303, 730 A.2d 181.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">In <em>Butler v. State, </em>107 Md.App. 345, 667 A.2d 999 (1995), this Court held that an officer\u2019s report was a \u201cstatement\u201d that is subject to disclosure for the purposes of <em>Carr/Leonard </em>analysis. Bond\u2019s response of \u201cI believe so\u201d to a question of whether he had prepared a report placed the issue of disclosure squarely before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">Waiver and Adequate Request</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">When defense counsel raised the issue of a Bond report, the trial court implied that because the issue of the report had not come up in direct examination, Massey\u2019s arguments with respect to the report constituted \u201cimproper cross-examination.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">The State bears the affirmative obligation to provide the disclosure that is required under <em>Carr/Leonard. See Butler, supra, </em>107 Md.App. at 358-59, 667 A.2d 999. Moreover, defense counsel was unaware until cross-examination that a report may have been prepared by Bond. The disclosure of such a document is generally needed to assist in cross-examination, and the issue may not arise until defense counsel begins that task. That is particularly so under the facts before us, where the State made no such reference during Bond\u2019s direct examination. To hold that a request for a statement under <em>Carr/Leonard </em>is beyond the scope of cross-examination merely because the prosecutor did not ask the witness about it during direct examination would undermine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>the policy concerns as set forth in the Maryland cases and their federal counterparts. Such a rule would also allow the prosecution to dictate the non-disclosure of <em>Carr/Leonard </em>material by avoiding any mention of such material on direct examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">The State also urges that this issue has been waived, that Massey has not adequately substantiated his request for Bond\u2019s report, and that there is no showing that the report in fact exists. The State\u2019s position lacks merit. The trial transcript reflects that Massey vigorously asserted his right to any statement that Bond may have prepared. Indeed, the trial court understood as much by overruling counsel\u2019s objection. We believe that, on these facts, there was a sufficient request for <em>Carr/Leonard </em>material.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">The record also provides a sufficient foundation for the probability of the report\u2019s existence. Bond \u201cbelieved\u201d that he had written a report, although he denied using it to prepare for trial, or filing it with the State. While the burden rests with the defense to invoke the disclosure, we agree with the Ninth Circuit that \u201c \u2018[n]o ritual of words\u2019 is required, but the defendant must plainly tender to the Court the question of the producibility of the document <em>at a time when it is possible for the Court to order it produced, </em>or to make an appropriate inquiry.\u201d <em>United States v. Hanna, </em>55 F.3d 1456, 1459 (9th Cir.1995) (citations omitted) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">The State also maintains that the issue has been abandoned because counsel failed to move to strike Bond\u2019s testimony. In <em>Banks v. United States, </em>348 F.2d 231, 235 (8th Cir.1965), the Eighth Circuit rejected the government\u2019s argument that the defendant waived the right to examine disputed material because counsel failed to move to strike the witness\u2019s testimony. Although that decision rested on 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3500(d), which places the burden on the trial court to strike the witness\u2019s testimony, we believe that, in the instant circumstances, where counsel raised the issue of Bond\u2019s report, and Bond \u201cbelieved\u201d that he had prepared a report, counsel was not obligated to move to strike to assure preservation. We note that, in <em>Butler, supra, </em>107 Md.App. 345, 667 A.2d 999, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>there was no indication that defense counsel had moved to strike Agent Bloomer\u2019s testimony. Nevertheless, we reversed Butler\u2019s conviction because the failure to disclose a pertinent report compromised Butler\u2019s right to effective cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">We conclude that the trial court erred in its disposition of Massey\u2019s request. Bond\u2019s testimony with respect to the report was, at best, equivocal and unhelpful. The situation was exacerbated by the State\u2019s silence. Despite the State\u2019s obligation under Md. Rule 4-268 to provide such a report in discovery, the prosecutor made no effort to assuage the issue by providing relevant information. The State, at that juncture, in fulfillment of its discovery obligation, should have affirmatively advised the trial court that such report either did or did not exist. Or, if the State was likewise uncertain, the State ought to have sought from the court the opportunity to clarify whether such a report was made. There was no effort by the prosecutor to clarify whether a report had been provided to her office, or whether she would assist in making the report available. The State\u2019s ill-advised silence served only to compound the problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">In the circumstances, and in view of the State\u2019s silence, the trial court had an \u201caffirmative duty\u201d to ascertain whether Bond\u2019s report indeed existed and, if so, to ensure that it was available for review. <em>See Saunders v. United States, </em>316 F.2d 346, 349 (D.C.Cir.1963) (citing <em>Campbell v. United States, </em>365 U.S. 85, 95, 81 S.Ct. 421, 5 L.Ed.2d 428 (1961)). It is not for the witness to declare, as did Bonds, that the report was not used for his testimony. The disclosure decision was not his to make. Whether the report is useful to the defense is up to the defendant. <em>See Butler, supra, </em>107 Md.App. at 360, 667 A.2d 999 (quoting <em>Aud v. State, </em>72 Md.App. 508, 522-23, 531 A.2d 706 (1987)).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">Harmless Error</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">Alternatively, the State suggests that the court\u2019s error, if any, in not ordering disclosure of the Bond report is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, arguing that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>any such error, if it does exist, was harmless. Massey asks for reversal when he has failed to establish: (1) the existence of the report; and (2) that if the report existed, it contained anything that would have assisted him in cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">Our discussion, above, has disposed of the State\u2019s first assertion: the burden of delivering such report rests with the State, not the defendant. The State\u2019s second contention is likewise without merit. To suggest that appellant ought to bear the burden of establishing useful information from a report with which he has not been provided is, at best, disingenuous.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">That is not to say that such an error can never be subject to a harmless error review. <em>See Butler, supra, </em>107 Md.App. at 360, 667 A.2d 999. On these facts, we are not able, however, to declare that failure to disclose, or to determine the existence of, Bond\u2019s report is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Bond was not a peripheral player in the investigation. He alone was the searching and seizing officer of the contraband that was admitted into evidence. His involvement was substantive.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">Accordingly, we shall vacate Massey\u2019s convictions and remand for a new trial. We are confident that, on remand, the State will comply with its discovery obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">\n<em>3. Whether the trial court erred by considering evidence outside of the record.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b141-9\">On the day of Massey\u2019s arrest, police confiscated two separate baggies of crack cocaine. The first, from his person, contained 3.9 grams by weight. The second, from his vehicle, contained 3.1 grams. Massey\u2019s objection to the admission of the laboratory analysis of the 3.9 grams was sustained, and admission was precluded as a discovery sanction against the State, although Marzec made reference to that contraband during his testimony. In fact, the court engaged in a colloquy with Marzec as to the significance of 3.9 grams <em>vis a\u2019 vis </em>3.1 grams in terms of intent to distribute as opposed to personal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>use. The second, smaller quantity, and the laboratory analysis, was admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">Massey argues that the trial court erred in permitting discussion of the 3.9 grams, even though the laboratory analysis was excluded. Essentially, Massey suggests that the court took into account the total amount of cocaine seized from him in reaching its verdict of possession with intent to distribute, and that the possession of only 3.1 grams is insufficient to infer such an intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">Marzec was able to elaborate on the significance of the contraband he seized from Massey.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-6\">[PROSECUTOR]: And with respect to the quantity that you extracted from the Defendant, Mr. Massey, what\u2019s the significance of that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-7\">[DETECTIVE MARZEC]: Your Honor, the quantity that was recovered by myself from Mr. Massey\u2019s person, the quantity of the substance is indicative of the intent to distribute. A common user amount of crack cocaine is normally, when purchased on the street, one to two pieces. A piece of crack cocaine averages around one tenth to two tenths of a gram which sells for $20 to $40.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-8\">Your Honor, the quantity that was located within the bag ended up being approximately 3.9 grams. And based on my training and experience, Your Honor, that would be significantly more than for personal use.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-9\">The trial court heard testimony from Arthur Fassio, Jr., a State Police forensic chemist, who performed the analyses on the bags that were seized from both Massey\u2019s person and the Ford Explorer. Fassio was not permitted to testify about the results of his testing on the contents of the bag that was seized from Massey in the hotel room, because of the discovery sanction.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> With respect to the contraband seized from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>Explorer, Fassio opined that the baggie contained a substance with a net weight of 3.1 grams, consisting of cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">After the State rested, the defense moved for a judgment of acquittal. Counsel argued that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the charge of possession with intent to distribute based on the suppression of the analysis of the drugs found on Massey in the hotel room. Because that evidence was excluded, the State was left with the single baggie from the Explorer; hardly evidence, in Massey\u2019s view, of possession with intent to distribute.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">The trial court denied the motion, ruling:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-7\">But in evidence at this time is cocaine in the quantity of 3.1 grams found in the vehicle that [Massey] was operating, so I think the State has made a case sufficient to carry it beyond a motion for judgment of acquittal at this stage and I deny your motion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">The defense called Marzec to testify. After counsel was finished, the court inquired:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-9\">I have a question of the officer, which is you testified earlier as to the significance of a quantity of cocaine in the amount of 3.9 grams. Do you have an opinion as an expert in the area of controlled dangerous substances with respect to the significance of an amount of cocaine equaling 3.1 grams?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-10\">[MARZEC]: Your Honor, my opinion would be the same as the 3.9 as it would be to 3.1. There\u2019s not that much of a difference between eight tenths of a gram. Basically on the street it\u2019s equivalent of an eight ball and usually an eight ball quantity is used for distribution purposes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-11\">THE COURT: Let me just follow up. So I derive from that that 3.1 grams is not indicative of what a mere user would possess?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-12\">[MARZEC]: No, Your Honor. The packaging of the 3.1 grams and the weight of the 3.1 grams based on my training <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>and experience, Your Honor, is indicative of the intent to distribute the same.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">Marzec recounted on redirect examination that the 3.1 grams were contained in a single bag. When asked whether he would agree that a person who would distribute the cocaine would package it separately, Marzec indicated that it would depend on the level of dealer. He explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-5\">In this particular case, taking into account the other bag that was also recovered along with the 3.1 grams of suspected crack cocaine that was recovered from the vehicle, two bags equally of the same approximate weight I believe is indicative of the intent to distribute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">He admitted that an addict could use 3.1 grams and even as much as ten grams over the course of a few days, but noted that \u201ca monetary factor comes into play.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">After hearing final argument, the trial court ruled as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-8\">The Court has before it the testimony of three witnesses, three called by the State, two called by the Defendant, but they were one and the same, essentially three witnesses, two of whom were qualified as expert witnesses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-9\">Detective Ronald Marzec of the Delmar Police Department, an expert in law enforcement matters pertaining to controlled dangerous substances, received information that the Defendant, Richard Massey, was approaching Maryland, specifically Delmar, in either a green Ford Explorer or a Honda motorcycle. As a result of that information he arrested Richard Massey in room 123 of the Delmarva Inn and Convention Center in Delmar, Maryland, on the 18th of June 2004 sometime between 4:00 and 5:00 p.m.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-10\">Pursuant to a search incidental to a lawful arrest he received a plastic baggie from the front pocket of the Defendant and he testified that the substance was 3.9 grams. The substance was not admitted into evidence for procedural reasons, essentially as a discovery sanction. Notwithstanding the fact that the substance was not admitted into evidence without objection he testified that 3.9 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>grams of whatever it was, because he was not allowed to say what it was, was nevertheless something that would not be consumed for personal use. That testimony alone is not persuasive with me because that was kept out of evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-4\">The next witness was Sergeant Michael Bond of the Delmar Police Department who was on the lookout in Delaware on Route 13 for either a motorcycle southbound thereafter green Ford Explorer or a Honda. He saw a green Ford Explorer on Route 13 in Delaware, shortly crossing into Maryland. The vehicle was within his visual observation until it was parked ultimately near or at the Delmarva Inn and Convention Center.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-5\">Whereupon he observed the Defendant, who he identified in court, Richard Massey, getting out of the vehicle. He also observed that Richard Massey was alone in the vehicle and he did lose sight of the Defendant but shortly thereafter he received a radio call from Detective Marzec indicating that the Defendant was under arrest in one of the rooms in the motel. In the meantime the green Ford Explorer had been under his constant surveillance and there was no evidence that any one entered the vehicle during that time period.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-6\">Upon learning of the arrest, he searched the Defendant\u2019s vehicle and located a plastic baggie in the overhead console, which he weighed on a portable scale later at the Delmar Police Department headquarters and said it was two and a half grams gross weight.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-7\">The substance in that plastic baggie ultimately made its way to the Maryland police lab and was tested by the third witness in this case, Arthur Fassio, who qualifies as an expert witness, forensic chemist in the field of controlled dangerous substances. He describes his testing procedures and arrived at a conclusion that the substance he was testing was 3.1 grams of cocaine. That was admitted into evidence as State\u2019s Exhibit No. 2.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-8\">Despite the best efforts of defense counsel I do not find any serious questions or issues raised regarding the chain of custody, the testing procedures themselves, any indication <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>of any induced change by virtue of the passage of time or mishandling of evidence and there is no evidence of tampering.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-5\">In response to my question later Detective Marzec testified that 3.1 grams as a quantity does not indicate personal use but would indicate an intent to distribute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-6\">This testimony earlier as a part of the State\u2019s case had been that one piece would be .1 or .2 grams, that would be what a user would typically have. 3.1 grams obviously adds up to 15 or 16 pieces.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-7\">Detective Marzec also testified that by virtue of the fact that the substance was packaged in two bags, although no evidence came in regarding the actual identity of the substance in the other bag, the fact that there were two bags does give inference that there is an intent to distribute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-8\">Going back to the amount that wasn\u2019t admitted into evidence, 3.1 grams, that almost equaled the amount known in the trade as an eight ball, which he said had a wholesale value of $150, $250 and a street value of $700.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-9\">I think of significance also is the fact that the police in this case had received information that the Defendant is heading to a specified room at a specified motel and the question arises why does a user drive from one state to another state, rent a motel room, which he pays for out of his own pocket in order to use drugs. There\u2019s an inference that that trip was for the purpose of distributing the substance which was found in his vehicle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-10\">Therefore I have no problem finding beyond a reasonable doubt that the Defendant is guilty under count one of felonious possession of cocaine. He\u2019s also guilty under count two but count two merges into count one.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-11\">The trial judge in the instant case was clearly aware of what evidence had been admitted, and what was not in the record. Massey\u2019s objection went only to the laboratory analysis report of the 3.9 gram package. The court\u2019s ruling sustained that objection \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m sustaining the objection based upon [the State\u2019s] failure to provide discovery as to the 3.9 grams.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b147-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>In its elaboration of the verdict of guilty of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, the trial court said, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"An5\">Detective Marzec also testified that by virtue of the fact that the substance was packaged in two bags, although no evidence came in regarding the actual identity of the substance in the other bag, <em>the fact that there were two bags does give inference </em>[sic] <em>that there is an intent to distribute.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">In a bench trial, the court may not rely on facts that are not in the record. In <em>Corbett v. State, </em>4 Md.App. 269, 242 A.2d 603 (1968), the trial court referenced the fact that an alibi witness \u2014 one Morgan \u2014 had been indicted with Corbett in another matter. This led the trial judge to reject Morgan\u2019s testimony, especially in view of his denial that he even had known Corbett. Judge Thompson wrote for this Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-6\">We hold that the trial judge was clearly erroneous when he relied upon knowledge acquired from outside of the record that Corbett and Morgan had been jointly indicted for other offenses. The other indictments were not introduced into evidence and were not called to the attention of the judge on the record, and it was not until the decision was announced that the trial judge indicated that he had any knowledge of these other indictments.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b147-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 273, 242 A.2d 603.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">Certainly, the trial court was aware of that evidence which had been excluded \u2014 the results of the forensic analysis of the item seized from Massey\u2019s person. The Court of Appeals has observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-9\">\u201c[I]t is clear that we have consistently reposed our confidence in a trial judge\u2019s ability to rule on questions of admissibility of evidence and to then assume the role of trier of fact without having carried over to his factual deliberations a prejudice on the matters contained in the evidence which he may have excluded.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b147-10\"><em>Graves v. State, </em>298 Md. 542, 547, 471 A.2d 701 (1984) (quoting <em>State v. Hutchinson, </em>260 Md. 227, 236, 271 A.2d 641 (1970)).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>While the trial judge in this case was certainly aware of what evidence had been admitted and what was not in the record, his decision nevertheless demonstrates that the identity of the other substance played some part in the finding that Massey had possessed cocaine in sufficient quantity to indicate the intent to distribute it. Notwithstanding that there is sufficient evidence of possession with intent to distribute based solely on the possession of 3.1 grams of cocaine that was in Massey\u2019s Ford Explorer, we are unable to conclude that the trial judge ignored the persistent references to the other substance and other bag. We would also vacate Massey\u2019s conviction for possession with intent to distribute cocaine, and remand for a new trial on that charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">\n<em>4. Whether the trial court erred in accepting Massey\u2019s jury trial waiver.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">Massey next asserts that he is entitled to reversal because the trial court made no finding that his waiver of his right to a trial by jury was intelligently and voluntarily made. We are satisfied that the waiver procedure was adequate and in compliance with Md. Rule 4-246. While consideration of this issue is not relevant to our ultimate disposition, we pause to discuss it briefly.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">In <em>Zylanz v. State, </em>394 Md. 632, 635, 907 A.2d 242 (2006),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the Court of Appeals was presented with the question of \u201cwhether the ... trial judge[ ] ... erred by not making explicit findings on the record regarding the knowing and voluntary waiver[ ] of the Petitioner^] right[ ] to trial by jury, in accordance with Maryland Rule 4-246(b).\u201d In responding to that question, the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-8\">As we noted ... Maryland Rule 4-246(b) presently does not compel, by its language, that the trial judge supply an explicit statement regarding his or her findings of the knowingness and voluntariness of a defendant\u2019s jury trial waiver. Therefore, where the record of the case sufficiently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>demonstrates that the trial court implicitly determined that the elements of a knowing and voluntary jury trial waiver existed, the Rule is not violated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b149-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 643, 907 A.2d 242.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">We are satisfied that the record before us, \u201csufficiently demonstrates that the trial court implicitly determined that the elements of a knowing and voluntary jury trial waiver existed[.]\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b150-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>DENIAL OF MOTION TO SUPPRESS AFFIRMED; JUDGMENTS OF CONVICTION VACATED; CASE REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR WICOMICO COUNTY FOR A NEW TRIAL.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">COSTS ASSESSED TO WICOMICO COUNTY.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b121-11\">.
