After the Circuit Court for Baltimore City reversed the Maryland Tax Court, the Comptroller noted this appeal and presents one question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-10\">Did the Circuit Court for Baltimore City err in concluding that a settlement reached between Colonial and the Internal Revenue Service, which provided that 60% of Colonial\u2019s income from certain long-term real estate mortgage loans was exempt from tax, was binding on the Comptroller for determining Maryland taxable income for state income tax purposes?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b197-11\">Colonial states the question somewhat differently:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-12\">Whether the Circuit Court correctly determined that Colonial\u2019s federal taxable income, as finally determined pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>suant to IRC \u00a7 7121 Closing Agreements On Final Determinations Covering Specific Matters, serves as Colonial\u2019s federal taxable income for Maryland income tax purposes pursuant to MD Code Ann., Tax-Gen. \u00a7\u00a7 10-304 and 10-107.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">For the following reasons, we shall affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">The facts of this case are undisputed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A corporation\u2019s Maryland income tax liability is based on its \u201cfederal taxable income for the taxable year as determined under the Internal Revenue Code.\u201d Md.Code (1988, 2004 RepLVdL), \u00a7 10-304(1) of the Tax-General Article (\u201cTax-Gen.\u201d). In 2002, Colonial filed amended Maryland tax returns for 1991 and 1993-2000 on the ground that it had reached an agreement with the Internal Revenue Service that its federal taxable income for those years was lower than originally reported. In a letter dated November 6, 2002, the Comptroller denied Colonial\u2019s amended returns. Colonial filed a protest, and an informal hearing was held on January 23, 2003. The Comptroller affirmed its denial in a Notice of Final Determination dated March 31, 2004. Colonial appealed the Comptroller\u2019s decision to the Maryland Tax Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">After a hearing on December 8, 2004, the Tax Court affirmed the Comptroller\u2019s denial of the amended tax returns. Colonial petitioned for judicial review in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. After a hearing, the court reversed the decision of the Tax Court. Thereafter, the Comptroller noted this timely appeal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Additional facts will be provided as necessary for our discussion of the issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">\u201cThe scope of our review is substantially the same as that of the circuit court. That is, we review the Tax Court\u2019s decision and not the decision of the circuit court.\u201d <em>Pleasants Investments Ltd. P\u2019ship v. State Dept. of Assessments &amp; Taxation, </em>141 Md.App. 481, 489, 786 A.2d 13 (2001). \u201c[A] reviewing court is under no statutory constraints in reversing a Tax Court order which is premised solely upon an erroneous conclusion of law.\u201d <em>Supervisor of Assessments of Anne Arundel County v.

It serves the purpose \u201cof improving the income and well-being of American farmers and ranchers by furnishing sound, adequate, and constructive credit and closely related services to them, their cooperatives, and to selected farm-related businesses necessary for efficient farm operations.\u201d 12 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2001(a). In response to economic difficulties in the 1980s, Congress enacted the Agricultural Credit Act of 1987 \u201cto provide credit assistance to farmers, to strengthen the Farm Credit System, to facilitate the establishment of secondary markets for agricultural loans, and for other purposes.\u201d Act of Jan. 6, 1988, Pub.L. No. 100-233, 101 Stat. 1568.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">Among other things, the Act provided for voluntary \u201cMerger of Like and Unlike Associations\u201d within the Farm Credit System. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 416. Under 12 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2279e-l(a), \u201c[t]wo or more associations within the same district ... may merge into a single entity,\u201d if the merger is approved by the Farm Credit Administration Board, the boards of directors of the merging associations, the majority of the shareholders of each association, and the Farm Credit Bank. The resulting association is known as an \u201cAgricultural Credit Association\u201d (\u201cACA\u201d). <em>See, e.g\u201e </em>12 C.F.R. \u00a7 611.1040.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">Among the associations within the Farm Credit System are Federal Land Bank Associations (\u201cFLBAs\u201d) and Production Credit Associations (\u201cPCAs\u201d). The principal function of FLBAs is to facilitate long term real estate mortgage loans from Farm Credit Banks, 12 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2093, and they are exempt from federal and state income taxation, 12 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2098. The general purpose of PCAs is to \u201cmake, guarantee, or participate with other lenders in short- and intermediate-term loans and other similar financial assistance\u201d to qualified agriculture-related borrowers. 12 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2075. PCAs are not tax exempt. 12 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2077.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>FLBAs and PCAs can merge under 12 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2279c-l to create an ACA. \u201cThe idea [of the Agricultural Credit Act of 1987] was to streamline the System, reduce costs and increase efficiency, and ultimately to assist member institutions to provide competitive interest rates. Thus a PCA and an FLBA could merge, creating an ACA, and offer short, intermediate and long-term loans within its chartered territory.\u201d <em>Buckeye Production Credit Ass\u2019n v. Farm Credit Admin., </em>997 F.2d 11, 13-14 (4th Cir.1993) (citations omitted). Colonial was formed in 1989 through the merger of The Colonial, PCA, and Colonial, FLBA.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">With respect to the nature of ACAs, 12 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2279c-1(b) states: \u201cExcept as otherwise provided by this subchapter, a merged association shall \u2014 (A) possess all powers granted under this chapter to the associations forming the merged association; and (B) be subject to all of the obligations imposed under this chapter on the associations forming the merged association.\u201d Thus, an ACA may continue to conduct the transactions that were previously conducted by the various associations that were merged to form the ACA.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">After the creation of ACAs by Congress, disputes arose between ACAs and the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) regarding whether lending activities that would have previously been conducted by FLBAs remained tax exempt after the merger of an FLBA into an ACA. In <em>United States v. Farm Credit Servs. of Fargo, ACA, </em>89 A.F.T.R.2d (R.I.A.) 2002-334-36 (1998), the United States District Court for the District of North Dakota considered one such dispute. Fargo had paid income taxes on all of its lending activities, but then sought a refund of taxes paid on lending activities that would have previously been performed by the merged FLBA. The IRS initially granted the refund, but later requested repayment, leading to the litigation before the federal district court. The court concluded that the lending services at issue are tax exempt:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-6\">12 U.S.C. \u00a7 2098 specifically grants an income tax exemption to FLBAs whose income is derived from providing and servicing long term real estate loans. This Court holds that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>this exemption from taxation applies equally to the restructured Fargo-ACA which has been formed by merger pursuant to 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 2279c-l. Fargo-ACA is merely the continuation of the local FLBA and PCA with identical powers and obligations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-4\">Section 2279c-l provides that the restructured ACA shall \u201cpossess all powers granted under this chapter,\u201d and likewise is \u201csubject to all the obligations imposed under this chapter on the Associations forming the merged association.\u201d Since no corporate powers or obligations unique to the ACA are provided, it is obvious that the ACA can only function under the auspices of the incorporated sections of the chapter explicitly referenced, specifically those sections applicable to the pre-merger entities. This would clearly include the taxation provisions for FLBAs pursuant to 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 2098.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-5\">To conclude that Congress intended to deny the continuance of the exemption from federal income tax on income earned from long term lending activities, which has been exempt since 1916, would be illogical and absurd. <em>See </em>The Federal Farm Loan Act, Pub.L. No. 158, \u00a7 26, 39 Stat. 360, 380 (1916). This is especially so upon a simple reading of the Act of 1987: Congress means to provide financial assistance to the agricultural industry, not create obstacles.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-6\"><em>Fargo, </em>89 A.F.T.R.2d at 2002-336-37.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">According to Colonial, the Fargo decision resulted in \u201cclosing agreements\u201d between the IRS and all ACAs as to the taxable income for FLBA-like lending activities for certain years. The IRS entered into a closing agreement with Colonial, which entitled Colonial to a refund of 60% of its \u201clong-term taxable income\u201d for the years 1991 and 1993-1999, and a second closing agreement to the same effect for the year 2000. Those closing agreements, which adjusted Colonial\u2019s federal taxable income for the years at issue, are the basis for Colonial\u2019s contention that it is entitled to a refund of state income taxes for the years at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>State Income Tax</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">Maryland income tax liability is dependent, to some extent, on the taxpayer\u2019s federal income tax liability. Tax-Gen. \u00a7 10-107 provides that, \u201c[t]o the extent practicable, the Comptroller shall apply the administrative and judicial interpretations of the federal income tax law to the administration of the income tax laws of this State.\u201d With respect to state corporate income tax, Tax-Gen. \u00a7 10-301 provides: \u201cThe Maryland taxable income of a corporation is its Maryland modified income as allocated to the State under Subtitle 4 of this title.\u201d Tax-Gen. \u00a7 10-304 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-5\">Except as provided in Subtitle 4 of this title, the Maryland modified income of a corporation, including a real estate investment trust or regulated investment company, is:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-6\">(1) the corporation\u2019s federal taxable income for the taxable year as determined under the Internal Revenue Code and as adjusted under this Part II of this subtitle ____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">The Court of Appeals has explained the doctrine of conformity between state and federal tax law as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AzK\">[T]he whole thrust of the Maryland Act is to impose a tax on the amount determined under the Internal Revenue Code as the adjusted gross income of an individual or the taxable income of a corporation. This is a formula or yardstick objectively derived which initially takes no account of the source, nature or composition of the funds; it is simply a figure developed by the federal return.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-8\"><em>Katzenberg v. Comptroller of Treasury, </em>263 Md. 189, 204-205, 282 A.2d 465 (1971). As a result, \u201c[wjhereas federal law must enumerate and define items of income in a wide variety of factual situations, Maryland law, by virtue of its adoption of the federal law, need not.\u201d <em>Comptroller of the Treasury v. Chesapeake Corp. of Virginia, </em>54 Md.App. 208, 214, 458 A.2d 459 (1983). \u201c[T]he essential, initial determination which must be made before a corporation may be subjected to Maryland tax is whether that corporation has federal taxable income\u201d and the amount of that taxable income. <em>Ford Motor Land </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number><em>Dev. Corp. v. Comptroller of Treasury, </em>68 Md.App. 342, 353, 511 A.2d 578 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">Nevertheless, Maryland tax law looks only to the total federal taxable income generated on the federal tax return, without regard to other aspects of federal law that might ultimately affect the taxpayer\u2019s federal tax liability. For example, the \u201ctaxable income\u201d figure cannot be modified for Maryland tax purposes based on federal tax breaks. <em>Marco Assocs. v. Comptroller of the Treasury, </em>265 Md. 669, 291 A.2d 489 (1972). In Marco, which was decided before Maryland recognized Subchapter S corporations, the Court of Appeals held that Marco Associates could not deduct from its state taxable income the amount of its income that, under federal tax law, \u201cpassed through\u201d to its shareholders. The Court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-5\">[The] focus [of Maryland income tax law] is on the taxable income of a corporation, or the adjusted gross income of an individual, as the same is developed in the taxpayer\u2019s federal income tax return, subject to the modifications permitted by the Act, whether a federal tax is or is not generated by the return.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-6\">The fact that a gain recognized by a Subchapter S corporation and reflected in its taxable income may be attributed to the corporation\u2019s shareholders under federal law does not alter the fact that it remains within the concept of taxable income under the Act \u2014 a figure upon which the Maryland tax is based.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b204-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 678, 291 A.2d 489.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">Similarly, in <em>NCR Corp. v. Comptroller of the Treasury, </em>313 Md. 118, 544 A.2d 764 (1988), the Court of Appeals held that NCR was not permitted to deduct certain amounts from its taxable income that had been added to the income figure for federal income tax purposes only. NCR had claimed credits on its federal income tax return for foreign taxes paid by its foreign subsidiaries. The credits appeared on its federal return as \u201cgrossed-up\u201d dividend income. The Court of Ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>peals concluded that NCR was not entitled to deduct the \u201cgrossed-up\u201d dividend income from its state taxable income:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AiR\">As we have seen, \u00a7 280A(a) instructs, as it did in 1976, that \u201c[t]he net income of a corporation shall be the taxable income of such taxpayer as defined in the laws of the United States ... for the corresponding taxable period.... \u201d The purpose of that provision is \u201cto bring the State taxation system in conformity with the federal scheme.\u201d <em>Comptroller v. American Satellite Corp., </em>312 Md. 537, 545, 540 A.2d 1146,1150 (1988). Since NCR\u2019s 1976 federal taxable income included the gross-up, and since the Maryland statutes applicable to 1976 contained no authority to adjust or deduct that figure, it should, one would think, be included in Maryland taxable income.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b205-4\"><em>NCR Corp., </em>313 Md. at 123, 544 A.2d 764.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">On the other hand, the Comptroller is not required to accept the federal taxable income figure provided on a taxpayer\u2019s federal tax return merely because that figure was accepted by the IRS. To the contrary, the doctrine of conformity presupposes a truthful and accurate federal taxable income figure: \u201cObviously the Maryland law contemplates the truthful reporting of income on the federal return; otherwise a defrauding taxpayer, while subject to federal prosecution, would escape state prosecution, a result hardly contemplated by the legislature.\u201d <em>Winters v. State, </em>301 Md. 214, 236, 482 A.2d 886 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">The Comptroller therefore has the authority to adjust a taxpayer\u2019s taxable income to ensure that it is truthful and accurate under the IRC:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-7\">If a taxpayer failed to report certain income on its federal tax return that the I.R.C. mandated it to report, and the IRS accepted that figure, [the Comptroller] should be permitted to recalculate the Maryland modified income because the federal taxable income figure it relies on would be incorrect. Likewise, if the IRS exercised its discretion to create mandatory regulations that required the taxpayer to report certain income, and the taxpayer failed to do so, [the Comptroller] could follow those IRS regulations in recalcu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>lating the Maryland modified income. In both cases, the statute or regulation are rigid and objective in their determination of what is taxable income. If we were to hold that [the Comptroller] could never apply such provisions, then taxpayers who evade their federal income taxes would be free, without considering criminal sanctions, to evade their Maryland income tax obligation as well. We should not attribute such an illogical intent to the Legislature\u2019s 1967 revision of the state tax code.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b206-4\"><em>Comptroller of the Treasury v. Gannett Co., </em>356 Md. 699, 716, 741 A.2d 1130 (1999) (footnote omitted). In <em>Gannett, </em>the Comptroller had argued that he had authority to make a discretionary determination to impute to a parent company certain interest income from intercompany accounts with its subsidiaries because the Secretary of the IRS has such authority under the IRC. The Court held that, although the Comptroller may enforce mandatory reporting requirements under the IRC, he may not exercise discretionary authority under the IRC. <em>Id. </em>at 719-20, 741 A.2d 1130.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">Closing Agreements</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">There are two methods by which a taxpayer may enter into a binding agreement with the IRS on a disputed issue: (1) a closing agreement under 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 7121, or (2) a compromise under 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 7122. <em>Matter of Avildsen Tools &amp; Machine, Inc., </em>794 F.2d 1248, 1253 (7th Cir.1986); <em>Combs v.

The Tax Court concluded that the closing agreements are merely the result of negotiations between Colonial and the IRS to settle a dispute over Colonial\u2019s federal tax liability, and that they do not establish Colonial\u2019s federal taxable income for purposes of its state income tax:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-19\">[Cjounsel for the Petitioner takes the position that the Closing Agreement that was entered into with the Internal Revenue Service is a final determination. I do not agree with that. I think that the Closing Agreement is, for all intents and purposes, a settlement agreement.... In other words, the Taxpayer took a position with the I.R.S., and the I.R.S. took a position on behalf of the I.R.S. And, apparently, there were extensive negotiations in connection with this matter.... It was give and take.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>Another thing that influences me ... in connection with the decision [at] which I have arrived today, is that when one looks at the Closing Agreement, and specifically to paragraph 5____[the] Closing Agreement makes it abundantly clear that [the] credits for an exemption and what have you is not going to happen after January 1 of 2001.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A4N\">Now, again, when I look at ... [Tax-Gen. \u00a7] 10-107, I find that [the closing agreement], in this Court\u2019s opinion, ... does not fall within the definition of what the Comptroller is obligated to follow in connection with the interpretation of what is taxable from the standpoint of the Comptroller\u2019s Office under Maryland law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">The Tax Court later noted that a closing agreement with the IRS applies to \u201ca factual situation\u201d in \u201cone case\u201d concerning \u201cone given set of facts,\u201d and it is \u201cnot of such a nature that it applies to each and every taxpayer that may fall into that category at some future time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b212-9\">The Tax Court also rejected Colonial\u2019s contention that <em>Fargo </em>established that FLBA-like lending activities by an ACA are tax exempt:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-10\">I realize that <em>[Fargo] </em>is a Federal District Court decision; but, number one, I find, as a matter of law, that the Maryland Tax Court is not bound by that particular decision. In other words, as I would understand the law, there can be circumstances under which that decision would not bind federal courts even in other areas of the country that were not in that particular district.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-11\">[Moreover,] it seems to me that whoever wrote [the <em>Fargo] </em>opinion did not fully understand the principles of law involved in connection with a case of [that] nature____ In essence, what the law says is that when it comes to exemptions they have got to be very clearly stated and if they\u2019re not very clearly stated and the court has any doubt about it at all, the court is obligated on a judicial finding to deny the exemption....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-13\">Now, everyone agrees, as I see it, that there is no specific statute that grants this exemption---- [The <em>Fargo </em>judge] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>premised his decision on [the statute providing that ACAs] have all the powers and authorities and what have you of the former Federal Land Bank [Associations,] and because of that they get this exemption because Congress never specifically took it away. And that, to me, it not only flies in the face of sound judicial judgment, but it flies in the face of, really, logic, as far as I\u2019m <em>concerned----[Fargo] </em>says the exemption is explicit, [but] it\u2019s not.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">The circuit court found that a closing agreement with the IRS is a unique resolution of a tax dispute distinct from a mere settlement agreement. The court concluded that a closing agreement is authoritative as to a taxpayer\u2019s taxable income and is therefore binding on the Comptroller for purposes of state income tax liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">The Comptroller argues on appeal that the Tax Court correctly characterized the closing agreements as \u201csettlement[s]\u201d between Colonial and the IRS. According to the Comptroller, the doctrine of conformity is based on \u201cthe objectivity of the Internal Revenue Code as a measurement or yardstick,\u201d rather than \u201cthe subjective give and take\u201d of \u201cnegotiated settlements and compromises.\u201d The Comptroller notes that the 60% credit to Colonial is not specifically provided for in the IRC and contends that it is therefore not binding on Maryland. He also argues that a decision to the contrary would mean that \u201cthe Comptroller is locked in to each and every federal settlement and the Comptroller\u2019s authority to audit and assess is lost.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b213-8\">Colonial responds that \u201cthe Comptroller is bound by the definition of Colonial\u2019s federal taxable income as set forth in the Closing Agreements.\u201d It assures us that a decision in its favor would not unduly limit the Comptroller\u2019s ability to \u201caudit and assess.\u201d Alternatively, Colonial contends that, because Tax-Gen. \u00a7 10-107 requires the Comptroller to \u201capply the administrative and judicial interpretations of the federal income tax law to the administration of the income tax laws of this State,\u201d the Comptroller is bound by <em>Fargo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b214-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>The starting point for determining a corporation\u2019s state income tax liability is \u201cthe corporation\u2019s federal taxable income for the taxable year as determined under the Internal Revenue Code.\u201d Tax-Gen. \u00a7 10-304(1). In this case, the Internal Revenue Code does not clearly establish Colonial\u2019s federal taxable income. The ambiguity regarding whether an ACA\u2019s long-term lending activities are subject to federal taxation is the dispute that led to the closing agreements. The Comptroller points out that Colonial has no clear statutory basis for arguing that only 60% of its income from long-term lending is taxable. But, by the same token, the Comptroller has no statutory basis for contending that 100% of that income is taxable. The IRS entered into closing agreements with Colonial, which established its federal taxable income for the years at issue. The closing agreements state that \u201c[t]he taxpayer\u2019s taxable income ... is decreased\u201d by the various amounts provided for. The agreements are \u201cfinal and conclusive\u201d determinations of Colonial\u2019s federal taxable income for the years 1991 and 1993-2000. 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 7121(b). As such, they establish its federal taxable income for purposes of state income taxation.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">The Comptroller fears that he will now be \u201clocked in to each and every federal settlement\u201d and his \u201cauthority to audit and assess is lost.\u201d We believe that fear is unfounded. Tax-Gen. \u00a7 10-304(1) is not so rigid as to \u201clock\u201d the Comptroller into taxing an income figure merely because that figure is reported on the taxpayer\u2019s federal return. Rather, the Comptroller has the authority to levy taxes on the taxpayer\u2019s true and accurate federal taxable income, even if that amount differs from the figure that was accepted by the IRS. <em>Gannett Co., </em>356 Md. at 716, 741 A.2d 1130; <em>Winters, </em>301 Md. at 236, 482 A.2d 886. A taxpayer should not, however, be \u201clocked into\u201d a federal taxable income figure even after a later determination by the IRS that the figure does not truly and accurately reflect the taxpayer\u2019s taxable income. A settlement agreement between a taxpayer and the IRS does not necessarily alter the taxpayer\u2019s legally required federal taxable income, and a compromise generally would not create an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>income figure that is binding on Maryland. A closing agreement, on the other hand, can have the effect of altering a taxpayer\u2019s federal taxable income. When it does, as in the case before us, the taxable income figure established by the closing agreement is binding as the basis for Maryland income tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">In our view, the Tax Court erred as a matter of law in finding that the closing agreements are merely representative of a settlement and do not establish Colonial\u2019s federal taxable income. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the circuit court. We need not consider Colonial\u2019s alternative argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b197-13\">. <em>\"ACA\u201d </em>is an abbreviation for \"Agricultural Credit Association,\u201d discussed <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b198-8\">.
