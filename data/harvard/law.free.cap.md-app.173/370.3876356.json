Appellants, Richard A. Doyle and Ruth M. Doyle, brought suit against appellee, Finance America, LLC, to recover the interest.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> II.III.IV.V.VI.The Circuit Court for Montgomery County granted appellee\u2019s motion to compel arbitration and stayed appellants\u2019 suit pending arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-10\">Appellants challenge the court\u2019s ruling that arbitration is required and present a series of questions to this Court, which we have consolidated and rewritten as follows:<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>I. Does the plain language of the arbitration agreement prevent litigation from being pursued before a circuit court?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-4\">II.

Settlement for the residence was to take place on April 26, 2004. On that day, the parties executed a Dispute Resolution Agreement (the \u201cAgreement\u201d), which states, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-9\">Maintaining good relationships with our loan applicants and borrowers, is very important to us at Finance America, LLC (hereinafter referred to as \u201cLender\u201d). We ask you to contact us immediately if you have a problem with a loan application or loan transaction with us. Often, a telephone call to us will resolve the matter amicably and as quickly as possible. However, if you and we are not able to resolve our differences informally, you and we agree that any dispute, regardless of when it arose, shall be resolved, at your option or ours, by arbitration in accordance with this agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>Only disputes involving you and us may be addressed in the arbitration. The arbitration shall not address any dispute on a \u201cclass wide\u201d basis nor shall it be consolidated with any other arbitration proceeding. This means that the arbitration will not address disputes involving other persons that may be similar to the disputes between you and us.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">Appellants assert that appellee failed to disburse the loan proceeds until April 27, 2004 \u2014 the day following settlement. Appellants filed suit in circuit court to recover damages from appellee, pursuant to Maryland Code Annotated (1974, 2003 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 7-109 of the Real Property Article. Appellee filed a motion to dismiss and motion to compel arbitration. After a hearing on the motions, appellee\u2019s motion to compel arbitration was granted and the case was stayed, pending an outcome in arbitration. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">The circuit court\u2019s order, compelling arbitration, is appropriate where a valid and enforceable arbitration agreement exists. <em>Holmes v. Coverall North America, Inc., </em>336 Md. 534, 546, 649 A.2d 365 (1994). As a question of law, whether a valid and enforceable arbitration agreement exists will be reviewed <em>de novo. Holloman v. Circuit City Stores, Inc., </em>391 Md. 580, 588, 894 A.2d 547 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b397-9\">The Agreement states that \u201carbitration shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act.\u201d The Federal Arbitration Act (\u201cFAA\u201d) is set forth under Title 9 of the United States Code. Section 2 of the Act states that an arbitration clause will not be enforceable where \u201cany grounds ... for the revocation of any contract\u201d apply. Because state courts \u201care not bound by the federal procedural provisions of the FAA,\u201d our enforcement of Section 2 requires that we \u201clook to the pertinent Maryland law\u201d for guidance. <em>Walther v. Sovereign Bank, </em>386 Md. 412, 423, 872 A.2d 735 (2005). The Maryland Uniform Arbitration Act (\u201cMUAA\u201d) is codified under Mary<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>land Code Annotated (1974, 2006 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7\u00a7 3-201 <em>et seq. </em>of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (\u201cCJ\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">\n<em>I. Plain Language of the Agreement</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">The interpretation of a contract is a question of law and subject to <em>de novo </em>review. <em>United Servs. Auto. Ass\u2019n v. Riley, </em>393 Md. 55, 79, 899 A.2d 819 (2006). On review, we shall examine the language of the contract objectively. <em>8621 Ltd. P\u2019ship v. LDG, Inc., </em>169 Md.App. 214, 226, 900 A.2d 259 (2006). \u201c \u201cWhere the language of the contract is unambiguous, its plain meaning will be given effect. There is no need for further construction.\u2019 \u201d <em>Spengler v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>163 Md.App. 220, 239, 878 A.2d 628 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">Appellants argue that the Agreement is a contract of adhesion and thusjnust be viewed with heightened scrutiny; any ambiguity must be resolved against appellee.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Appellants assert that the plain language of the Agreement does not require arbitration of their claim for two reasons. First, the Agreement requires the parties to attempt an \u201cinformal resolution\u201d prior to arbitration. This failed to occur. Second, the Agreement does not prohibit class actions from being pursued in the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>\n<em>A. Informal Resolution</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">The introductory paragraph of the Agreement reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-5\">Maintaining good relationships with our loan applicants and borrowers, is very important to us at Finance America, LLC (hereinafter referred to as \u201cLender\u201d). We ask you to contact us immediately if you have a problem with a loan application or loan transaction with us. Often, a telephone call to us will resolve the matter amicably and as quickly as possible. However, <em>if </em>you and we are not able to resolve our differences informally, you and we agree that any dispute, regardless of when it arose, shall be resolved, at your option or ours, by arbitration in accordance with this agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">Appellants assert that the word \u201cif\u2019 creates a condition that must be satisfied prior to arbitration; specifically, an attempt must be made to informally resolve any problems that arise, prior to arbitration. We do not read the Agreement to contain such a requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">When all four sentences of the introductory paragraph are read together, it is clear that the Agreement <em>recommends, </em>but does not <em>require, </em>that disputes be resolved through informal means. The first sentence acknowledges appellee\u2019s desire to maintain \u201cgood relationships\u201d with its borrowers. The second sentence simply \u201cask[s],\u201d aggrieved borrowers to contact appellee when a problem arises \u2014 it does not \u201crequire\u201d borrowers to contact appellee. The third sentence <em>suggests </em>that placing a telephone call to appellee might \u201cresolve the matter amicably\u201d \u2014 it does not <em>require </em>borrowers to place a telephone call. The fourth sentence merely recognizes that problems are not always resolved informally and, <em>if </em>the borrower and appellee \u201care not able to resolve [their] differences informally,\u201d arbitration must proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-9\">We also note that appellants are the moving party in this case and chose to initiate formal proceedings in the circuit court. Contrary to the advice and suggestion in the Agree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>ment, appellants determined to forgo any attempts at resolving the matter amicably through informal means and filed a complaint against appellee. In essence, appellants have waived their ability to challenge the arbitration provision on this ground.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-4\">Appellants rely on <em>Wells v. Chevy Chase Bank, F.S.B., </em>863 Md. 232, 768 A.2d 620 (2001), for the proposition that a condition precedent contained in an arbitration agreement must be satisfied prior to proceeding with arbitration. Because we have already determined that the Agreement between appellants and appellee does not contain a condition precedent, <em>Wells </em>is inapposite.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">\n<em>B. Class Action Law Suits Are Barred</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">Appellants also claim that arbitration is not required because they are properly pursuing a class action in the circuit court. Appellants assert that the Agreement only limits their opportunity to file a class action in arbitration, leaving open the option to file a class action in the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">The portion of the Agreement relating to class action proceedings states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-8\">Only disputes involving you and us may be addressed in the arbitration. The arbitration shall not address any dispute on a \u201cclass wide\u201d basis nor shall it be consolidated with any other arbitration proceeding. This means that the arbitration will not address disputes involving other persons that may be similar to the disputes between you and us.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-9\">This paragraph must be read in conjunction with the sentence that requires arbitration: \u201c[Y]ou and we agree that any dispute, regardless of when it arose, shall be resolved, at your <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>option or ours, by arbitration in accordance with this agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">The plain language of the Agreement requires that <em>any dispute </em>arising out of or in any way related to the loan <em>shall </em>be resolved by arbitration.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Therefore, if the Agreement bars the filing of a class action claim in arbitration, there can be no filing of a class action claim at all. Appellants contend that, without a blanket or general restriction on class action suits, they may proceed with a class action in the circuit court. Although it may have been wise to expressly include a \u201cno-class-action\u201d provision in the Agreement,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> we cannot say that appellee\u2019s failure to do so renders the class action provision in the Agreement any less clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">\n<em>II. Arbitration Is Not Permissive</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">Appellants contend that the arbitration provision \u201cis permissive\u201d because it \u201callows either party to sue <em>or </em>arbitrate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">This contention is simply incorrect. The Agreement pellucidly states that \u201cany dispute ... shall be resolved ... at your <em>option </em>or ours, by arbitration.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Appellants\u2019 argument clings for life to the word \u201coption\u201d as though its very presence in the Agreement allows them to bring a suit in the circuit court. Like Hannibal, <em>\u201cAut viam inveniam aut </em>faciam.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> To the contrary, either party has the option to proceed in arbitration and once that option is exercised, arbitration is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>As the moving party, appellants elected to file a lawsuit in the circuit court, which they were entitled to do pursuant to the Agreement. Had appellee preferred that venue, it could have proceeded in circuit court. Appellee desired arbitration, however, and under the plain language of the Agreement, any dispute shall be resolved by arbitration at the option of either party. Having exercised that option, arbitration must proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">Appellants take their argument one step further. CJ \u00a7 3-207(a) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-6\"><em>Refusal to arbitrate. </em>\u2014 If a party to an arbitration agreement described in \u00a7 3-202 of this subtitle <em>refuses to arbitrate, </em>the other party may file a petition with a court to order arbitration.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">(Emphasis added in bold.) Appellants interpret this provision as requiring appellee to make two requests for arbitration; the first request must be denied by appellants and only after they refuse to arbitrate may the court properly rule on appellee\u2019s second request.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">We are convinced that CJ \u00a7 3-207(a) has been satisfied. We shall not require the parties to jump hurdles that are nonessential to proceed in arbitration, particularly when arbitration is patently mandated under the plain meaning of the Agreement. Under CJ \u00a7 3-207(c), \u201c[i]f the court determines that the agreement [to arbitrate] exists, it shall order arbitration. Otherwise, it shall deny the petition.\u201d Having found that an arbitration agreement exists, the court ordered arbitration. We concur with that determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>\n<em>III. Policy Considerations</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">An arbitration agreement is valid and enforceable unless grounds exist that would render the arbitration agreement revocable as a contract. CJ \u00a7 S-206(a). Appellants assert that the Agreement is invalid and unenforceable for two reasons. First, the Agreement is repugnant to the public policy of Maryland. Second, the Agreement is procedurally and substantively unconscionable. We shall address the unconscionability claim in Part IV of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">Appellants argue that the Agreement is \u201cnothing more than a thinly veiled exculpatory agreement\u201d that denies consumers access to the courts while preserving appellee\u2019s ability to file certain claims in court. In support of their policy argument, appellants note that \u201cthe nation\u2019s largest funders and guarantors of home loans ... have ... banned the use of pre-dispute arbitration provisions.\u201d This argument is, in essence, nothing more than a policy-based assault on the shortcomings of arbitration. D\u00e9j\u00e1 vu.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">In <em>Bel Pre Med. Ctr., Inc. v. Frederick Contractors, Inc., </em>21 Md.App. 307, 319-20, 320 A.2d 558 (1974), we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-7\">The Uniform Arbitration Act constitutes a radical departure from the common law. Executory agreements to arbitrate are to be deemed \u201cvalid, irrevocable and enforceable,\u201d and suits to compel arbitration or to stay the action of a court pending arbitration may now be brought. The prime purpose of these provisions is to discourage litigation and to foster voluntary resolution of disputes in a forum created, controlled and administered according to the parties\u2019 agreement to arbitrate. Thus, by its enactment, the General Assembly established a policy in favor of the settlement of disputes through the arbitration process and ended the ambivalence of courts under the common law. Not only suits to enforce an arbitrator\u2019s award, but also suits to compel arbitration and suits to stay court action pending arbitration, are now to be viewed as \u201cfavored\u201d actions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aiaq\">(Internal citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">Since our announcement <em>in Bel Pre Med., </em>21 Md.App. 307, 320 A.2d 558, this Court and the Court of Appeals have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>continued to recognize the legislative policy favoring enforcement of arbitration agreements. <em>See Questar Homes of Avalon, LLC v. Pillar Constr., Inc., </em>388 Md. 675, 684, 882 A.2d 288 (2005) (The MUAA \u201cexpresses the legislative policy favoring enforcement of agreements to arbitrate.\u201d (internal cite omitted)); <em>Holmes, </em>336 Md. at 541, 649 A.2d 365 (\u201cThe same policy favoring enforcement of arbitration agreements is present in both\u201d the MUAA and the FAA.); <em>The Redemptorists v. Coulthard Servs., Inc., </em>145 Md.App. 116, 150, 801 A.2d 1104 (2002) (Maryland law \u201creflect[s] a strong public policy in favor of arbitration.\u201d); <em>Howard County Bd. of Educ. v. Howard County Educ. Ass\u2019n, Inc., </em>61 Md.App. 631, 641, 487 A.2d 1220 (1985) (recognizing the legislative policy \u201cin favor of\u2019 arbitration agreements); <em>Southern Maryland Hosp. Ctr. v. Edward M. Crough, Inc., </em>48 Md.App. 401, 406, 427 A.2d 1051 (1981) (\u201cArbitration is a \u2018favored\u2019 process in Maryland.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">We are keenly aware of the opposition to arbitration agreements taken by consumers and consumer-advocates. Nonetheless, arbitration agreements enjoy \u201cfavored\u201d status in Maryland. \u201c \u2018The Legislature makes the laws[ and] the Judiciary expounds them. . . . \u2019 \u201d <em>Schisler v. State, </em>394 Md. 519, 582, 907 A.2d 175 (2006) (quoting <em>City of Baltimore v. State, </em>15 Md. 376, 456 (1860)). The law on this issue is clear, leaving us with nothing to decipher. We shall not entertain a debate that should be directed to the General Assembly.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">\n<em>IV. Unconscionability</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b404-9\">Unconscionability is an \u201cextreme unfairness\u201d in the formation or substance of a contract. <em>See </em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1560 (8th ed.2004).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Uniform Commercial Code allows a court to modify a contract if the contract, or any of its terms, is unconscionable. U.C.C. \u00a7 2-302 (2001). It is problematic, however, that the U.C.C. does not define unconscionability, nor does it provide any guidance as to the factors, circumstances, and standards that should be employed in making such a finding. \u201cUnconscionability is an amorphous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>concept that evades precise definition. Indeed, it has been said that \u2018[i]t is not possible to define unconscionability. It is not a concept but a determination to be made in light of a variety of factors not unifiable into formula.\u2019 \u201d <em>Coady v. Cross County Bank, </em>No.2005AP2770, 2007 WL 188993 at \u00b6 26 (Wis. App. Jan.25, 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">The doctrine of unconscionability contains two components, substantive and procedural aspects. Procedural unconscionability concerns deceptive practices employed at the bargaining table. <em>See Holloman, </em>391 Md. at 603, 894 A.2d 547. Thus procedural unconscionability looks to how the agreement was reached. It relates to the individualized circumstances surrounding each contracting party at the time of contracting. Substantive unconscionability concerns the actual terms of the contract. <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe prevailing view is that [procedural and substantive unconscionability] must both be present in order for a court to exercise its discretion to refuse to enforce a contract or clause under the doctrine of unconscionability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal cite omitted). This is also the position taken in Maryland. <em>See, e.g., Walther, </em>386 Md. at 431, 872 A.2d 735.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">\n<em>A. Procedural Unconscionability</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">Certain elements of the bargaining process tend to indicate the presence of procedural unconscionability: \u201coverwhelming bargaining strength or use of fine print or incomprehensible legalese may reflect procedural unfairness in that it takes advantage of or surprises the victim of the clause.\u201d 8 Richard A. Lord, <em>Williston on Contracts </em>\u00a7 18:10 (4th ed.1999). Additional factors include, but are not limited to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Asj\">age, education, intelligence, business acumen and experience, relative bargaining power, who drafted the contract, whether the terms were explained to the weaker party, whether alterations in the printed terms would have been permitted by the drafting party, and whether there were alternative providers of the subject matter of the contract.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AFG\"><em>Wisconsin Auto Title Loans v. Jones, </em>290 Wis.2d 514, 534-535, 714 N.W.2d 155, 165 (2006). That the arbitration agree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>ment was presented as an adhesion contract is also significant.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>See Holloman, </em>391 Md. at 603, 894 A.2d 547; <em>Walther, </em>386 Md. at 453, 872 A.2d 735.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">Appellants claim that the Agreement is procedurally unconscionable because they were only made aware of the need to sign the Agreement on the settlement date, after their loan had already been approved. Because the proceeds of the loan were needed to effectuate the closing, appellants argue that they were constrained to sign the loan, which was presented on a take-it-or-leave-it basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">A similar argument was presented to the Court of Appeals in <em>Walther, </em>386 Md. 412, 872 A.2d 735.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Petitioners claimed that they \u201cwere provided no opportunity to review the [arbitration agreement] on the night of the closing and were provided no opportunity to review the [arbitration agreement] beyond a cursory perusal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 428, 872 A.2d 735. They also argued \u201cthat the arbitration agreement should [have been] set aside because the arbitration clause Vas provided on a take-it-or-leave-it basis, with no opportunity for negotiation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 430, 872 A.2d 735.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">The appeal presented in <em>Walther </em>was, if anything, more compelling on this issue. The arbitration agreement in <em>Walther </em>is better characterized as an arbitration \u201cclause.\u201d The document presented to petitioners at closing contained 17 enumerated paragraphs, the last of which was an arbitration clause. Petitioners claimed, which appellants in this case do not, that they were unaware of the presence of an arbitration clause in the document. The Court responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-8\">As this Court stated in the case of <em>Merit Music Service, Inc. v. Sonnebom, </em>245 Md. 213, 221-22, 225 A.2d 470, 474 (1967), \u201cthe law presumes that a person knows the contents of a document that he executes and understands at least the literal meaning of its terms.\u201d <em>See also Vincent v. Palmer, </em>179 Md. 365, 375, 19 A.2d 183, 189 (1941) (stating that, \u201cas a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>general rule, when one signs a release or other instrument, he is presumed in law to have read and understood its contents, and he will not be protected against an unwise agreement\u201d); <em>Owens v. Graetzel, </em>149 Md. 689, 696, 132 A. 265, 268 (1926) (stating that parties to mortgage are bound by its terms and \u201cmust be held to know its meaning as thereby expressed\u201d). In the nearly-century-old case of <em>Smith v. Humphreys, </em>104 Md. 285, 65 A. 57 (1906), Judge Boyd expressed the Court\u2019s generally critical view of such defenses to the enforcement of a contract:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-4\">Any person who comes into a Court of equity admitting that he can read, and showing that he has average intelligence, but asking the aid of the Court because he did not read a paper involved in the controversy, and was thereby imposed on, should be required to establish a very clear case before receiving the assistance of the Court in getting rid of such document. It is getting to be too common to have parties ask Courts to do what they could have done themselves if they had exercised ordinary prudence, or, to state it in another way, to ask Courts to undo what they have done by reason of their own negligence or carelessness.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 290-91, 65 A. at 59.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 429, 872 A.2d 735.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">The Court did not directly resolve petitioners\u2019 argument. Recognizing that both procedural and substantive unconscionability must exist in order to find that an arbitration agreement is invalid, the Court proceeded to \u201cconsider whether the terms in the arbitration clause [were] so one-sided as to oppress or unfairly surprise an innocent party or whether there exist[ed] an egregious imbalance in the obligations and rights imposed by the arbitration clause.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 431, 872 A.2d 735. We shall analyze the procedural unconscionability argument further before turning to the issue of substantive unconscionability.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">This issue raises a question that remains unaddressed by the Court in <em>Walther: </em>whether it is proeedurally unconsciona<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>ble for a mortgagee to approve a loan and wait until the day of closing to present the mortgagor with an arbitration agreement that must be signed, in order that the loan proceeds be disbursed. We believe that such conduct, at least, approaches procedural unconscionability.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">Appellants argue that \u201cthe first time the Doyles were informed of the arbitration \u2018agreement\u2019 was at the settlement table.\u201d In <em>Walther, </em>petitioners argued that they were presented with a document containing an arbitration clause \u201con the night of the closing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 428, 872 A.2d 735. Appellee demands that a rule, requiring \u201ca lender ... to present to borrowers an agreement to arbitrate prior to settlement ... would treat arbitration agreements differently than other contracts and thus would be contrary to established law.\u201d We disagree.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">At the motions hearing, the following discussion ensued between the court and counsel for appellants:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-7\">[COUNSEL]: You Honor, I would like to point out there is no dispute that this is a contract of adhesion. As such, the Court\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-10\">THE COURT: Why do you say it\u2019s a contract of adhesion?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-11\">[COUNSEL]: Because it\u2019s giv[en] on a take it or leave it basis. There was no negotiation back and forth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-13\">THE COURT: All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>[COUNSEL]: In fact, if they want the loan, it even states in [the Agreement that] ... they have to sign this. Obviously, there\u2019s not equal bargaining power between the two parties. THE COURT: They go to some other lender.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-5\">[COUNSEL]: That\u2019s true.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-6\">THE COURT: There\u2019s not a lack of lenders. Adhesion occurs when there\u2019s no negotiation and no choice of party with whom to negotiate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-7\">[COUNSEL]: You Honor, obviously I would argue that anytime you have unequal bargaining power in the context of this\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-8\">THE COURT: All contracts are negotiated with unequal bargaining power. Let\u2019s start from that premise. They all start that way.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-9\">THE COURT: We\u2019re never on the same playing field----</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-10\">While it may be true that appellants were not initially limited to appellee as the only lender available for a mortgage loan, the court\u2019s response to counsel fails to consider that appellants, at settlement, were required to sign the Agreement or possibly risk some adverse consequences related to their new commitment. No documents that appellants may have signed were presented to the court during the motions hearing. We have no knowledge of the nature of the contract that appellants entered into for the purchase of the home, what loan documents appellants may have initially executed, and what, if any, penalties appellants may have incurred by refusing to execute the arbitration agreement. No evidence was presented of appellants\u2019 age, education, intelligence, business acumen and experience, whether the terms were explained to them, whether alterations in the printed terms would have been permitted by appellee, or whether there were alternative providers of the subject matter of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-11\">In <em>Walther, </em>the Court noted that petitioners \u201cdid not allege that they needed to negotiate and were rebuffed by respondent____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 431 n. 6, 872 A.2d 735. We are aware that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>same argument could be made in this case. This argument is unpersuasive. If appellants had challenged appellee\u2019s presentation of the Agreement, they would be then faced with two adverse results, one resulting within seconds of saying, \u201cNo, we refuse to sign,\u201d or one resulting later, such as litigation concerning this identical issue. It is not difficult to imagine that, faced with such a Hobson\u2019s choice, they would have signed the Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">\n<em>B. Substantive Unconscionability</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">Appellants claim that the Agreement is substantively unconscionable because fees associated with arbitrating this dispute will consume more than the amount of their claim. Appellants estimate that they will be required to pay, at a minimum, $1,550 to arbitrate a claim worth only $1,539. The total value of $1,550 is comprised of two expenses: (1) a filing fee and a case service fee amounting to $950, and (2) the arbitrator\u2019s compensation, which will be no less than $600.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">In support of this allegation, appellants rely on two affidavits. The first was filed in a case in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, which disclosed that in an AAA administered dispute, the National Rules for the Resolution of Employment Disputes would apply and the median daily rate of an arbitrator\u2019s compensation is $1,500. The second affidavit was filed in the District Court, Boulder County, State of Colorado, applying the AAA\u2019s Arbitration Rules for the Resolution of Consumer-Related Disputes, establishing that the median daily rate of arbitrator compensation is $1,500.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">Appellee contends that the estimated fees and expenses claimed by appellants are \u201cmisplaced\u201d and constitute \u201cmere speculation.\u201d Appellee maintains that appellants\u2019 affidavit regarding AAA rules for employment disputes is irrelevant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>consumer related disputes, and as to the affidavit from Colorado, the \u201cSupplementary Procedures\u201d of the AAA apply to this consumer dispute, which provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-4\">If the consumer\u2019s claim or counterclaim does not exceed $10,000, the consumer is responsible for one-half the arbitor\u2019s fees up to a maximum of $125.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">Appellee further contends that, even if appellants\u2019 estimate of the fees and expenses is accurate, appellee \u201chas acknowledged and agreed to pay the costs associated with proceeding in arbitration.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">Again, <em>Walther </em>proves instructive. Presented with a similar argument, the Court relied on the pronouncements of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Green Tree Financial Corp.-Alabama v. Randolph, </em>531 U.S. 79,121 S.Ct. 513, 148 L.Ed.2d 373 (2000), and the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in <em>Bradford v. Rockwell Semiconductor Sys., Inc., </em>238 F.3d 549 (4th Cir.2001). As explained by the Court of Appeals of Maryland,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-7\">[t]he Supreme Court ... reversed the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s holding that the arbitration agreement\u2019s silence as to the filing fees, arbitrators\u2019 costs, and other arbitration expenses had rendered the arbitration provision unenforceable because it exposed the buyer to potentially steep arbitration costs. <em>[Green Tree Financial, </em>531 U.S.] at 84, 121 S.Ct. [513]. Acknowledging that the <em>Green Tree Financial </em>parties had provided no detail of the expected arbitration fees and costs, the Supreme Court observed that while \u201cthe existence of large arbitration costs could preclude a litigant\u201d of limited resources from effectively pursing her claims in an arbitral forum, \u201c[t]he \u2018risk\u2019 that [the buyer] will be saddled with prohibitive costs is too speculative to justify the invalidation of an arbitration agreement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 90-91, 121 S.Ct. [513] (alteration added). Effectively, <em>Green Tree </em>Financial placed upon the party asserting the prohibitive expense \u201cthe burden of showing the likelihood of incurring such costs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 92,121 S.Ct. [513].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 439-440, 872 A.2d 735.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-9\">The Court continued:</p>\n<p id=\"b412-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>In a case decided shortly after <em>Green Tree Financial, </em>the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit observed it would be inappropriate to apply a broad per se rule to the efficacy of an arbitral forum:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-4\">The cost of arbitration, as far as its deterrent effect, cannot be measured in a vacuum or premised upon a claimant\u2019s abstract contention that arbitration costs are \u201ctoo high.\u201d Rather, an appropriate case-by-case inquiry must focus upon a claimant\u2019s ejected or actual arbitration costs and his ability to pay those costs, measured against a baseline of the claimant\u2019s expected costs for litigation and his ability to pay those costs. Another factor to consider in the cost-differential analysis is whether the arbitration agreement provides for fee-shifting, including the ability to shift forum fees based upon the inability to pay. We note that parties to litigation in court often face costs that are not typically found in arbitration, such as the cost of longer proceedings and more complicated appeals on the merits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-5\"><em>Bradford v. Rockwell Semiconductor [Sys.J, Inc., </em>238 F.3d 549, 556 n. 5 (4th Cir.2001) (rej\u00e9cting argument that arbitration clause containing a fee-splitting provision which required employee to share the arbitration costs and pay half the arbitrator\u2019s fee rendered the arbitration agreement per se unenforceable).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 440-441, 872 A.2d 735.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">At the motions hearing, the trial court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-8\">I\u2019ve read the papers and I think I\u2019m satisfied that I\u2019m familiar with them. But I\u2019d be happy to have any additional factual information identified first and then I\u2019d hear from you (sic) legal argument.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-9\">[APPELLANTS\u2019 COUNSEL]: Your Honor, the plaintiff would have no additional factual submissions for the Court at this time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-10\">The trial court indicated that it had before it \u201ca motion to compel arbitration and to dismiss by the defendants against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>Finance America with opposition thereto.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">As indicated, no evidence was presented by appellants to demonstrate the excessive costs of the arbitration forum. Although the question of whether a contract is unconscionable is a question of law and subject to <em>de novo </em>review, the factual findings of the trial court that inform its judgment are subject to the clearly erroneous standard. <em>See, e.g., Monetary Funding Group, Inc. v. Pluchino, </em>87 Conn.App. 401, 867 A.2d 841, 848 (2005) <em>(\u201c[T]he factual findings of the trial court that underlie [an unconscionability] determination are entitled to the same deference on appeal that other factual findings command.'\u201d); </em>Md. Rule 8-131(c). As the Court of Appeals has recognized, \u201cthe burden of showing the likelihood of incurring such costs\u201d is \u201cplaced upon the party asserting the prohibitive expense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 440, 867 A.2d 841. In <em>Walther, </em>the Court did not conclude that the arbitration clause was substantively unconscionable \u201c[bjecause the fees arising from the arbitration [could not] be predicted in detail and petitioners [did] not show them to be unduly burdensome.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 422, 872 A.2d 735. We are compelled to conclude the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b395-11\">.

An adhesion contract \"has been defined as one 'that is drafted unilaterally by the dominant parly and then presented on a \"take-it-or-leave-it\u201d basis by the weaker party who has no real opportunity to bargain about its terms.\u2019 \u201d <em>Meyer v.

Adhesion or form contracts are not the same as an unconscionable contract and do not render the Agreement invalid, per se. <em>See Walther v.
