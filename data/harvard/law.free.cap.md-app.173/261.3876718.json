The value of these misappropriated stocks allegedly exceeds $1.5 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">Thomas Gibbons deposited ill-gotten funds into an account at Provident Bank of Maryland, held in the name of L &amp; S Computer Consultants (LSSC). From this account, Mr. Gibbons regularly withdrew funds that he then deposited into a different Provident account he held jointly with Mrs. Gibbons, and thereafter into jointly held Bank of America accounts.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The misappropriated monies were commingled with $502,331 in salary and bonus earnings that Mr. Gibbons also deposited into that joint Bank account over this period. Mrs. Gibbons wrote most of the checks drawn on this account, primarily for household and family purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">In an effort to recover some of the stolen funds allegedly deposited into and spent to fund a lavish lifestyle for Mrs. Gibbons and the Gibbons children, Bank of America filed suit against Mrs. Gibbons. During the litigation, it became clear that Mrs. Gibbons had no knowledge of her husband\u2019s theft, her belief being that the source of funds he deposited into the joint household account was her husband\u2019s legitimate earnings. The Bank pursued conversion and unjust enrichment claims against Mrs. Gibbons.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">On cross-motions for summary judgment, the Circuit Court for Harford County held that Mrs. Gibbons is entitled to judgment on the Bank\u2019s conversion and unjust enrichment claims. The court explained its ruling in a written opinion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>that analyzed each element of unjust enrichment and concluded that the Bank \u201cfailed to meet [its] burden on all three prongs of the cause of action.\u201d The Bank argues that the motion court committed legal error by applying the wrong legal principles to each element. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">Review Of Summary Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">Although \u201c[s]ummary judgment unquestionably is an important device ... for streamlining litigation[,]\u201d in that it \u201csaves the parties expense and the delays of protracted and non-meritorious litigation[,]\u201d the \u201cdismissal of [a] case deprives the parties of a trial and the opportunity to develop their claims and present them to a jury.\u201d <em>Sadler v. Dimensions Healthcare Corp., </em>378 Md. 509, 534, 836 A.2d 655 (2003). The Court of Appeals \u201chas therefore been careful to restrict application of summary judgment to cases that present no material facts that may reasonably be said to be disputed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe purpose of the summary judgment procedure is not to try the case or to decide the factual disputes, but to decide whether there is an issue of fact, which is sufficiently material to be tried[.]\u201d <em>Jones v. Mid-Atl. Funding Co., </em>362 Md. 661, 675, 766 A.2d 617 (2001). \u201cThe standard of review for a grant of summary judgment is whether the trial court was legally correct.\u201d <em>Goodwich v.

But before \u201cdetermining whether the trial court was legally correct, an appellate court must first determine whether there is any genuine dispute of material facts.\u201d <em>Dashiell v.

Even if it appears that the relevant facts are undisputed, \u2018if those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>facts are susceptible to inferences supporting the position of the party opposing summary judgment, then a grant of summary judgment is improper.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ashton v.

Greenberg, </em>242 Md. 359, 364, 219 A.2d 237 (1966). Under Maryland law,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-6\">[a] claim of unjust enrichment is established when: (1) the plaintiff confers a benefit upon the defendant; (2) the defendant knows or appreciates the benefit; and (3) the defendant\u2019s acceptance or retention of the benefit under the circumstances is such that it would be inequitable to allow the defendant to retain the benefit without the paying of value in return.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b290-7\"><em>Benson v. State, </em>389 Md. 615, 651-52, 887 A.2d 525 (2005). As we discuss below, the motion court erred in concluding as a matter of law that Bank of America could not establish any of these three elements.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-9\">First Element: Benefit Conferred</p>\n<p id=\"b290-10\">\u201cA person confers a benefit upon another if he gives to the other possession of or some other interest in money[.]\u201d <em>Restatement of Restitution </em>\u00a7 1 cmt. a (1937, updated through 2006). The Bank challenges the motion court\u2019s ruling that the</p>\n<p id=\"b291-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>Bank did not confer a benefit on Mrs. Gibbons. The court reasoned as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">A. <em>Benef\u00edt conferred on the Defendant by the Plaintiff.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">At the heart of the concept of unjust enrichment is the willingness of the court under appropriate facts to say that there was an implied or constructive contract between the plaintiff and the defendant.... [TJhere is absolutely no allegation that the Plaintiff and this particular Defendant had any dealings with one another either directly or indirectly. This court can find no reported appellate case in this state in which there was a claim for unjust enrichment where the claim did not arise out of dealings directly between the parties. With an implied or constructive contract, as with any other contract, there must be found to be some \u201cmeeting of the minds\u201d that creates the obligation from one party to the other and that is absent in this particular case. Under the Plaintiffs theory, they could pursue an unjust enrichment claim against anyone to whom Mr. Gibbons had given any of the money that he misappropriated from the Plaintiffs clients. This court cannot see how the Defendant in this particular case stands in any different position from a car dealership where Mr. Gibbons may have purchased a car, a casino where he may have gambled away a portion of the money or a restaurant where he may have bought expensive dinners for his various female companions. To satisfy the first element of this cause of action, the Plaintiff must have conferred some sort of benefit directly on the Defendant from whom the restitution is sought. The only individual in this case with whom the bank had any direct dealings was Mr. Gibbons and there is not one scintilla of evidence that has been produced that any direct benefit was conferred on Mrs. Gibbons. (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">The Bank argues that the motion court committed several legal errors in concluding that the Bank cannot establish the threshold \u201cbenefit conferred\u201d element of its unjust enrichment claim. In its view, the court\u2019s threshold error was to premise its benefit analysis on implied-in-fact contract principles, which require some evidence from which a mutual agreement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>can be inferred, rather than on quasi-contract (also know as implied-in-law contract) principles, which \u201cinvolve[ ] no assent between the parties, no \u2018meeting of the minds.\u2019 \u201d The Bank contends that the motion court then compounded this error by holding that the Bank had to directly deal with Mrs. Gibbons in order to warrant recovery under a theory of unjust enrichment. Finally, the Bank argues, the court erred in concluding that \u201cthere is not one scintilla of evidence ... that any direct benefit was conferred on Ms. Gibbons,\u201d despite the obvious cash benefits conferred upon both Mr. and Mrs. Gibbons by the Bank. We agree with all three contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">No Meeting Of The Minds Required</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">The motion court erroneously believed that, for an implied contract, there must be some \u201cmeeting of the minds\u201d that creates the obligation to perform. The Court of Appeals has distinguished between contracts that are implied-in-fact, which require evidence of a \u201cmeeting of the minds,\u201d and contracts that are implied as a matter of law, for which a meeting of the minds is not required.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-7\">\u201cAn implied contract is an agreement which legitimately can be inferred from intention of the parties as evidenced by the circumstances and \u2018the ordinary course of dealing and the common understanding of men.\u2019 \u201d... <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>... defines [a quasi-contract] as a</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ANE\">[l]egal fiction invented by common law courts to permit recovery by contractual remedy in cases where, in fact, there is no contract, but where circumstances are such that justice warrants a recovery as though there had been a promise. It is not based on intention or consent of the parties, but is founded on considerations of justice and equity, and on doctrine of unjust enrichment. It is not in fact a contract, but an obligation which the law creates in absence of any agreement, when and because the acts of the parties or others have placed in the possession of one person money, or its equivalent, under such circumstances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>that in equity and good conscience he ought not to retain it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-4\"><em>See County Comm\u2019rs of Caroline County v. J. Roland Dashiell &amp; Sons, Inc., </em>358 Md. 83, 94-95, 747 A.2d 600 (2000) (citations omitted). <em>See </em>also Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 4 cmt. b (1981, updated through 2007)(contracts implied in law \u201care not based on the apparent intention of the parties to undertake the performances\u201d; \u201c[t]hey are obligations created by law for reasons of justice\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">Because an \u201cunjust enrichment claim is based on a quasi-contract or an implied-in-law contract[,]\u201d <em>Alternatives Unltd., </em>155 MdApp. at 461, 843 A.2d 252, \u201cit is simply a rule of law that requires restitution to the plaintiff of something that came into defendant\u2019s hands but belongs to the plaintiff in some sense.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mass Transit Admin, v. Granite Constr. Co., </em>57 Md.App. 766, 775, 471 A.2d 1121 (1984)(quoting 1 <em>Dobbs </em>\u00a7 4.2). The motion court erred in holding that the Bank\u2019s unjust enrichment claim fails for lack of evidence showing a meeting of the minds.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">No Dealings Directly Between The Parties Required</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">The court also erroneously required direct dealings between the Bank and Mrs. Gibbons. Contrary to the motion court\u2019s legal conclusion, a cause of action for unjust enrichment may lie against a transferee with whom the plaintiff had no contract, transaction, or dealing, either directly or indirectly-</p>\n<p id=\"b293-9\"><em>Plitt v. Greenberg, </em>242 Md. 359, 219 A.2d 237 (1966), is instructive, in that the Court of Appeals explicitly rejected a similar contention that unjust enrichment requires transactional privity between the party who conferred the benefit and the party who received it. Blacker, an attorney, represented Plitt in a number of financial transactions. Plitt agreed to loan Blacker and his partner, Greenberg, the sum of $38,333.34. Plitt wrote a check in that amount, payable to Blacker and his wife. Blacker endorsed the check and forged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>his \u2019 wife\u2019s signature. Unaware of that forgery, Plitt then endorsed the check with a special endorsement that it be paid \u201cto the order of the First National Bank of Balto. for wire transfer to the Central National Banks Richmond, Va. for credit Theodore E. Greenberg.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 362, 219 A.2d 237. Although Plitt never had direct contact with Greenberg, he endorsed payment to Greenberg because Blacker told him that he \u201ccould look to Greenberg and the Blackers for repayment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The funds were deposited into Greenberg\u2019s checking account.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">As security for the debt, Blacker endorsed over to Plitt a $45,000 note payable to the Blackers from Alsage Realty Corporation, as well as Blacker\u2019s oral promise that replacement collateral would be secured via Greenberg. But no replacement collateral ever materialized, the notemaker proved to be a paper corporation with no assets, and the Blackers filed bankruptcy. As a result, Plitt sued Greenberg, with whom he had never dealt directly, for debt, fraudulent misrepresentation, and unjust enrichment. The trial court directed a verdict on the unjust enrichment claims in favor of defendant Greenberg.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that Plitt had \u201ca colorable cause of action grounded on a theory of unjust enrichment or restitution[,]\u201d even though there was no evidence that Greenberg dealt with Plitt or otherwise participated in Blacker\u2019s fraud. <em>See id. </em>at 363, 219 A.2d 237. The Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-6\">Although Greenberg may not have known that he had received the proceeds of Plitt\u2019s check into his account, and no express contract for debt existed between Plitt and Greenberg, the law implies a debt \u201cwhenever the defendant has obtained possession of money which, in equity and good conscience, he ought not to be allowed to retain.\u201d According to the <em>Restatement, Restitution </em>\u00a7 123:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-7\">\u201cA person who, non-tortiously and without notice that another has the beneficial ownership of it, acquires property which it would have been wrongful for him to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>acquire with notice of the facts and of which he is not a purchaser for value is, upon discovery of the facts, under a duty to account to the other for the direct product of the subject matter and the value of the use to him, if any[.]\u201d....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-4\">\u201cIt is immaterial how the money may have come into the defendant\u2019s hands, and the fact that it was received from a third person will not affect his liability, if, in equity and good conscience, he is not entitled to hold it against the true owner.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 363-64, 219 A.2d 237 (emphasis added and citation omitted). <em>See also Hill v. Cross Country Settlements, LLC, </em>172 Md.App. 350, 914 A.2d 231, 2007 WL 29191, *6 (\u201cThe lack of an express contract or privity between appellant and [defendant] does not preclude application of the principles of unjust enrichment\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">The Court of Appeals explained that Greenberg\u2019s innocence could not shield him because he had given no consideration for the loan.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-7\">It has been held that a plaintiff could recover money from even an innocent transferee who was without knowledge that he possessed the plaintiffs money.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-8\">However, if a transferee came into possession of a plaintiffs money in good faith after paying a good and valuable consideration for it, then the plaintiff could not prevail and recover back the funds in that transferee\u2019s possession.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-9\">In order to make out a case of unjust enrichment, the burden rested upon Plitt to prove that the proceeds of his check, which were deposited into Greenberg\u2019s account, were received without the payment of valuable consideration from Greenberg to Blacker.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-10\"><em>Plitt, </em>242 Md. at 364-65, 219 A.2d 237 (emphasis added and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-11\">Although Greenberg claimed that he paid Blacker $38,333.34 in exchange for Plitt\u2019s check in that amount, Green-berg was \u201cunable to produce any checks, check stubs or records\u201d showing payments from Greenberg to Blacker total<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>ing that amount. <em>See id. </em>at 365-66, 219 A.2d 237. Pointing to bank statements that contradicted Greenberg\u2019s testimony, the Court of Appeals held that there was \u201csufficient evidence of lack of payment to Blacker for the proceeds of Plitt\u2019s check received into Greenberg\u2019s account as would justify taking the case to the jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 367, 219 A.2d 237. If the jury found that Greenberg did not pay for the $38,333.34 deposit from Plitt, Greenberg could not establish an \u201cinnocent transferee for value\u201d defense to Plitt\u2019s claim for unjust enrichment. <em>See id. </em>at 365-66, 219 A.2d 237.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">As Mrs. Gibbons correctly points out, <em>Plitt </em>differs from this case in that the party seeking restitution in that case (Plitt) directly endorsed payment of the disputed funds to the defendant from whom he sought to recover those funds (Green-berg), whereas there is no evidence in this case that Bank of America approved payment of the disputed funds to Mrs. Gibbons. We do not find that factual distinction material, however. In <em>Plitt, </em>the Court of Appeals made it clear that the dispositive element would not be whether Greenberg \u201cdealt\u201d with Plitt, but whether Greenberg, as the defendant transferee, paid value for the funds transferred to him as a result of the actions of Blacker, the culpable third party. Thus, the fact that Bank of America neither \u201cendorsed\u201d nor otherwise approved Thomas Gibbons\u2019 transfer of stolen money to Mrs. Gibbons does not preclude the Bank\u2019s claim for unjust enrichment.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">Instead, the dispositive question is whether Lynne Gibbons, as the defendant transferee, paid value for the funds transferred to her by Thomas Gibbons, the culpable third party. If the misappropriated Bank funds can be traced into her account,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> there was no consideration for such deposits, and there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>is no other defense to the Bank\u2019s claim for restitution,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> then the Bank could prevail on its unjust enrichment cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">The motion court\u2019s emphasis on \u201cdirect dealings\u201d between the Bank and Lynne Gibbons ignores the potential significance of evidence that Mrs. Gibbons did not pay value. In particular, the court erred in concluding, as a matter of law, that stolen funds traced into the Gibbons\u2019 joint accounts should be treated as if those funds had been used to purchase cars, gamble at casinos, or dine in fine restaurants. As Bank of America points out, if an innocent transferee may retain the benefit of stolen funds without paying value for them, not only would she receive a windfall, but so would the thief. He would benefit from his wrongdoing by being permitted to place the funds beyond reach of the victim simply by depositing them into a joint account with his spouse and shielding her from any knowledge of his wrongdoing.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">Benefit Conferred</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">Bank of America argues that the court\u2019s third error with respect to the first element of unjust enrichment was to conclude that there was no evidence \u201cthat any direct benefit was conferred on Mrs. Gibbons.\u201d The Bank points to Mrs. Gibbons\u2019 admission that proceeds from her husband\u2019s thefts were deposited into her joint checking account. Those funds belonged to the Bank and its customers. <em>See, e.g., Keller v. Frederickbown Sav. Inst., </em>193 Md. 292, 296, 66 A.2d 924 (1949)(recognizing that bank owns the money deposited by its customers, \u201csubject to the right of the depositor to draw on it\u201d); <em>Suburban Trust v. Waller, </em>44 Md.App. 335, 339-40, 408 A.2d 758(1979)(relationship between bank and its customers is one of debtor and creditor).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>Mrs. Gibbons responds that \u201cthere is no authority under Maryland law supporting th[e] proposition\u201d that the benefit conferred element of an unjust enrichment cause of action may be satisfied by evidence that such benefit was conferred upon the defendant by the third-party wrongdoer, rather than by the plaintiff itself. To the contrary, she cites <em>Crosby v. Crosby, </em>769 F.Supp. 197, 200-01 (D.Md.1991), <em>affd on other grounds, </em>986 F.2d 79 (4th Cir.1993), as precedent for her thesis that summary judgment is appropriate when the claimed benefits were not directly conferred by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">We do not agree that <em>Crosby </em>supports Mrs. Gibbons\u2019 argument. There, the plaintiff, Margaret Crosby, was the deceased husband\u2019s wife, from whom he was never divorced. Margaret sued Joan Crosby, the husband\u2019s purported second wife, seeking a declaration that Margaret was entitled, <em>inter alia, </em>to the deceased\u2019s interest in his home, car, and pension benefits. Margaret argued that the pension benefits were payable to her as surviving spouse, because \u201cthey were \u2018constructively or indirectly\u2019 conferred upon the defendant [Joan] by the plaintiff [Margaret].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 201. The federal district court noted that it found no authority for that proposition, but then granted summary judgment on alternative equitable grounds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-5\">[W]ere this Court to determine that the benefits were conferred by plaintiff upon defendant, plaintiff still could not prevail. Margaret Crosby fails to prove that defendant\u2019s acceptance or retention of the benefit under the circumstances of this case make it inequitable for her to retain the payments. Joan Crosby accepted the pension benefits of a man with whom she lived for twenty two years. Defendant believed until after Leonard Crosby\u2019s death that the two were legally married. Margaret Crosby has come forward after having no contact with Leonard Crosby for as many as fifteen years and seeks his pension benefits. Under these circumstances it is not inequitable for defendant to retain the benefits already conferred upon her.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-6\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). The Fourth Circuit affirmed on grounds relating to the exercise of discretion under ERISA.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number><em>See id., </em>986 F.2d at 82-84. Thus, the decision in Crosby does not rest on any requirement that the plaintiff must directly confer the benefit upon the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">In our view, <em>Plitt </em>illustrates that the benefit may be conferred by the wrongdoer or the plaintiff seeking restitution. <em>See also Restatement (First) of Restitution </em>\u00a7 128 (1937, updated through 2006)(innocent recipient of property that he could not lawfully acquire must account to true owner if he is not a purchaser for value). Many courts have held an innocent spouse accountable for a benefit conferred by the embezzling mate, rather than the unjust enrichment claimant. <em>See, e.g., In re Marriage of Allen, </em>724 P.2d 651, 659 (Colo.l986)(exwife whose husband deposited embezzled funds into family account used to purchase family home and other property was subject to unjust enrichment claim); <em>Fed. Ins. Co. v. Smith, </em>144 F.Supp.2d 507, 524-25 (E.D.Va.2001), <em>aff'd, </em>63 Fed.Appx. 630, 634-35 (4th Cir.2003) (innocent spouse of embezzler who used stolen funds to satisfy spouse\u2019s personal and joint obligations and expenses held liable under conversion theory); <em>Bransom v. Std. Hardware, Inc., </em>874 S.W.2d 919, 927 (Tex.App.l994)(husband of embezzler who used stolen funds for household purposes held liable on unjust enrichment claim). Here, the motion court erred in concluding that lack of evidence that the Bank approved Mrs. Gibbons\u2019 receipt of the stolen money prevented the Bank from prevailing on its unjust enrichment claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">Second Element: Knowledge Of The Benefit</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">In evaluating the second element of whether \u201cthe defendant knows or appreciates the benefit,\u201d the motion court relied on evidence provided in the affidavits of Mr. and Mrs. Gibbons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-8\">B. <em>Appreciation or knowledge by the Defendant of the benefit conferred. </em>... Mr. Gibbons stated in his affidavit that the great majority of the funds that he misappropriated during the course of employment was spent by him on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>personal entertainment, trips and other activities that his wife did not know about or participate in. While some of the funds were deposited into the family\u2019s checking account, they were commingled with the money that he earned as salary and bonuses and Ms. Gibbons did not know the source of these additional funds. He further stated that he kept strict control over the family\u2019s finances and all banking statements and checking accounts were sent to addresses other than the family residence. He also stated that he told Ms. Gibbons that all of the monies that were available to him were legitimately obtained and that she had no knowledge that he obtained money from unlawful activities.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-4\">Ms. Gibbons in her Affidavit stated that her husband maintained control over the family accounts and records and did not share any financial information with her. She went on to state that her husband had actively concealed his various activities, illegal and otherwise, from her, that she had no knowledge that he was engaged in unlawful activities or was placing money from third parties into their joint account and that whatever money was placed into the joint account was used by her for family expenses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">The circuit court concluded that, because this evidence was unrebutted, the Bank failed to establish a dispute as to whether Mrs. Gibbons knew that the funds deposited by her husband were stolen. It then ruled that Mrs. Gibbons\u2019 lack of awareness that the funds deposited by her husband resulted from misappropriation barred the Bank\u2019s unjust enrichment claim:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-6\">It is clear from the unrebutted facts as set forth in the affidavits of the Defendant and Mr. Gibbons that Ms. Gibbons had no actual knowledge that some \u201cbenefit\u201d was being conferred upon her by the Plaintiff, albeit indirectly, by reason of Mr. Gibbons\u2019 making a small percentage of the funds that he stole available to her for her use and the use of their family. The court therefore believes that the Plaintiffs claim fails on this particular element of the cause of action pled. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b301-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>Bank of America asserts that the erroneous \u201cview taken by the trial court was that a defendant must have actual or constructive knowledge of the source of the benefit received in order to satisfy the second element[.]\u201d (Emphasis added.) Citing <em>Plitt, </em>the Bank argues that a transferee\u2019s innocence as to the source of the deposited funds is not a bar to recovery for a claim based on unjust enrichment. Acknowledging that the good faith of Mrs. Gibbons is a factor that the court can consider when determining the third element of unjust enrichment, the Bank urges that her good faith is not the \u201cdetermining factor\u201d on this second element.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">We agree that Bank of America is not required to prove Mrs. Gibbons knew of her husband\u2019s thefts. The <em>Restatement (First) of Restitution </em>section 123, as cited and applied in <em>Plitt, </em>explains that the knowledge necessary to establish the second element of an unjust enrichment claim is not necessarily knowledge that the funds were obtained by wrongful conduct against the plaintiff who seeks their return:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-5\">\u00a7 123. Bona Fide Transferee Who Is Not A Purchaser For Value</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-6\">A person who, non-tortiously and without notice that another has the beneficial ownership of it, acquires property which it would have been wrongful for him to acquire with notice of the facts and of which he is not a purchaser for value is, upon discovery of the facts, under a duty to account to the other for the direct product of the subject matter and the value of the use to him, if any, and in addition, to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-7\">(a) return the subject matter in specie, if he has it;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-8\">(b) pay its value to him, if he has non-tortiously consumed it in beneficial use;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-9\">(c) pay its value or what he received therefore at his election, if he has disposed of it. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b301-10\">This rule \u201cis applicable to a person who, by gratuitous grant, by will or by descent, has received the title to property, either real or personal, in which another has a beneficial ownership <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>of which the transferee has no notice at the time of the receipt.\u201d <em>Id., </em>cmt. a (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">This principle was applied explicitly in <em>Plitt, </em>where the Court of Appeals held that Plitt\u2019s claim for unjust enrichment could be supported by evidence that Greenberg was a transferee who was not a purchaser for value. In doing so, the Court observed that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-5\">[although Greenberg may not have known that he had received the proceeds of Plitt\u2019s check into his account, ... the law implies a debt \u201cwhenever the defendant has obtained possession of money which, in equity and good conscience, he ought not to be allowed to retain.\u201d ... [A] plaintiff could recover money from even an innocent transferee who was without knowledge that he possessed the plaintiffs money.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-6\"><em>Plitt, </em>242 Md. at 363-64, 219 A.2d 237 (citation omitted and emphasis added). <em>See also In re Marriage of Allen, </em>724 P.2d at 659 (collecting cases). Here, the motion court erred in granting summary judgment on the ground that Bank of America failed to establish that Mrs. Gibbons knew her husband was depositing the proceeds of his thefts from Bank clients into their joint bank accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">Third Element: Unjust Retention Of The Benefit</p>\n<p id=\"b302-9\">\u201c[W]hile \u2018a person is enriched if he has received a benefit,\u2019 the law does not consider him unjustly enriched unless \u2018the circumstances of the receipt of the benefit are such as between the two that to retain it would be unjust.\u2019 \u201d <em>First Nat\u2019l Bank v. Shpritz, </em>63 Md.App. 623, 640, 493 A.2d 410 (quoting <em>Hamilton v. Bd. of Educ., </em>233 Md. 196, 201, 195 A.2d 710 (1963)), <em>cert. denied, </em>304 Md. 297, 498 A.2d 1184 (1985). With respect to this final element, the motion court also determined that Bank of America failed to establish a dispute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AQD\">C. <em>The acceptance or retention of the benef\u00edts under circumstances that make it inequitable to retain bene\u00f1ts without payment </em>of their value. This court believes that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>considering the totality of the circumstances and even viewing the pleadings and facts in the light most favorable to the bank, the Plaintiff has failed to set forth sufficient facts and allegations that would meet this particular element of the cause of action. The Plaintiff in its Complaint asserts that Ms. Gibbons had knowledge of her husband\u2019s theft but backs this up with no facts and, as set forth above, this allegation is completely rebutted by Mr. and Mrs. Gibbons\u2019 affidavits. The Plaintiff goes on to allege that the Defendant lived a \u201clavish lifestyle\u201d and cites as examples the fact that in mid-2005 the Gibbons\u2019 son went to Europe at a cost of $2,388 and the rest of the family went to Disney World. Even accepting these facts as true, neither of the activities in question are outside the scope of families with the Defendant\u2019s base income. It is also noted that both trips took place in mid-2005, after the embezzlement by Mr. Gibbons had been discovered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-4\">Considering the Defendant\u2019s total lack of knowledge of the source of the supplemental funds that were placed in the family account and the lack of any factual assertions by the Plaintiff that there was any reason that Ms. Gibbons should have been aware of any wrongdoing on her husband\u2019s part, it is difficult to see how the circumstances are such that it would be equitable to require the Defendant to pay money to the Plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">The Bank argues that the motion court mistakenly relied on Lynne Gibbons\u2019 innocence regarding her husband\u2019s thefts in concluding that she should not be required to return the money he stole from the Bank. Citing <em>Plitt </em>and the <em>Restatement, </em>the Bank also contends that \u201cconsideration of the respective financial positions of the parties is ... improper[.]\u201d Although Mrs. Gibbons\u2019 good faith \u201cis a factor that the court can consider when determining whether the circumstances are such that it would be inequitable for the defendant to retain the benefit without payment of its value, it is neither the exclusive nor determining factor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">We conclude that the motion court\u2019s almost exclusive focus on Lynne Gibbons\u2019 lack of knowledge undermined and unduly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>limited its analysis about whether, as a matter of law, it would be equitable to require her to pay money to the Bank as restitution. Although Mrs. Gibbon\u2019s good faith is a highly relevant factor, it does not, by itself, support a determination as a matter of law that \u201c \u2018the circumstances of the receipt of the benefit are such as between the [Bank and Mrs. Gibbons] that to retain it would be unjust.\u2019 \u201d <em>See also Ammons v. Coffee County, </em>716 So.2d 1227 (Ala.Civ.App.l998)(affirming verdict against innocent spouse when stolen funds were used to acquire boat and trailer.)</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">Courts often have required an innocent recipient benefitted by third party wrongdoing to establish a change of circumstances that makes it inequitable to order restitution. <em>See Fed. Ins. Co., </em>144 F.Supp.2d at 524-25; <em>Restatement Restitution </em>\u00a7 142. Thus, when the recipient\u2019s change of circumstances was not caused by his or her wrongful conduct, \u201cthe primary rule is that if repayment will cause the recipient loss, restitution is barred to the extent that such loss would occur.\u201d <em>Hilliard v. Fox, </em>735 F.Supp. 674, 677-78 (W.D.Va. 1990). <em>See also Restatement Restitution </em>\u00a7 142 cmt. b (\u201cAny change of circumstances which would cause ... the recipient entire or partial loss if the claimant were to obtain full restitution, is such a change as prevents full restitution\u201d). This rule rests on the recognition that the innocent recipient\u2019s repayment of ill-gotten funds \u201cwill not normally cause the recipient any net loss \u2014 he will merely be returned to the <em>status quo ante. </em>\u201d <em>Hilliard, </em>735 F.Supp. at 678.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">An innocent spouse could also avoid liability by proving that the money deposited in a joint account was used by the wrongdoing spouse for his (or her) own benefit, without any benefit to the family. <em>Cf. McMerty v. Herzog, </em>702 F.2d 127, 130 (8th Cir.l983)(burden on innocent spouse to prove, with respect to joint property bought with wrongfully obtained funds, which part of purchase price, if any, was not wrongfully diverted); <em>Namow Corp. v. Egger, </em>99 Nev. 590, 668 P.2d 265, 267 (1983)(when misappropriated funds are used to purchase real property, innocent donee of property is entitled to offset <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>principal mortgage payments, and payments for improvements and taxes against party seeking constructive trust).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">In sum, the motion court erred in granting summary judgment based on Mrs. Gibbons\u2019 lack of knowledge. The innocence of Mrs. Gibbons, by itself, does not preclude a claim for unjust enrichment. The motion court did not consider whether exclusive use of money by Mr. Gibbons (without benefitting the family), a change in Mrs. Gibbons\u2019 circumstances, or other equitable circumstances might warrant denial or reduction of the Bank\u2019s unjust enrichment claim. On remand, the parties may present evidence pertinent to these equitable considerations.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">JUDGMENT VACATED.
