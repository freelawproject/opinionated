Eichhom, III, Assistant Attorney General, </em>with whom were <em>Francis B. Burch, Attorney General, Milton B. Allen, State\u2019s Attorney for Baltimore City, </em>and <em>C. Keith Meiser, Assistant State\u2019s Attorney for Baltimore City, </em>on the brief, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b699-12\">Thompson, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AVf\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-13\">James C. Palmer, the appellant, was convicted of escape by Judge Milton Gerson, sitting without a jury in the Criminal Court of Baltimore. Judge Gerson imposed a five (5) year sentence to run consecutive to a term of twenty (20) years he was then serving.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-14\">Appellant, though only thirty-six (36) years old, has achieved to date an abundant and intimate acquaintance with our system of criminal justice. Over the last twenty (20) years, he has been convicted, <em>inter alia, </em>for larceny after trust, larceny (on four separate occasions), assault, attempted forgery, forgery, conspiracy and uttering checks, burglary, daytime housebreaking, two counts of armed robbery, and escape from the Maryland House of Correction. On appeal, the appellant seeks to overturn his most recent conviction for escape upon the technical grounds that he was not adequately apprised of his constitutional rights at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>On April 17, 1968, appellant was convicted on two charges of armed robbery and was sentenced to concurrent twenty (20) year terms. While serving that sentence, appellant was interned at O\u2019Brien House, a Community Vocational Rehabilitation and Release Center in Baltimore City. Appellant took his leave of this minimum security facility by escaping on August 28,1971.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">The trial for escape commenced on March 23, 1973. Counsel for appellant, in open court and in appellant\u2019s presence, waived a reading' of the indictment stating, \u201c.. . We are familiar with the charge.\u201d Counsel entered, what he termed, a \u201ctechnical plea of not guilty.\u201d Judge Gerson addressed the appellant and received an express waiver of jury trial. A stipulation of facts, which encompasses the State\u2019s case, was entered. The State\u2019s Attorney recited the State\u2019s evidence which is detailed above. After the stipulation was recited, defense counsel expressly agreed with the facts. Appellant was then advised as to his right not to testify. Judge Gerson asked appellant, if he desired to take the witness stand with regard to the case, to which appellant responded, \u201cEverything he said [reading of the stipulation] is true.\u201d The court rendered its. verdict of guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">This appeal questions whether appellant effectively waived his Sixth Amendment right to confront witnesses, with the derivative right to cross-examine, by entering, through counsel, a stipulation to a statement of facts which comprised the State\u2019s case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The case involves procedure rather than substantive rights. It concerns whether or not direct appeal presents the proper time and place for a defendant in a criminal case to question the binding effect of his counsel\u2019s stipulation to all of the facts in the prosecution\u2019s case, when the defendant sat silently by and made no objection to the stipulation at the trial. We hold the proper time and place is provided for under the Uniform Post Conviction Procedure Act. Md. Code, Art. 27, \u00a7 645A-645J.</p>\n<p id=\"AP9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>In Maryland, a defendant can properly enter only four pleas in a criminal case: not guilty, not guilty by reason of insanity,<footnotemark>1A</footnotemark> guilty or, with the consent of the court, <em>nolo contendere. </em>We have construed <em>Boykin v. Alabama, </em>395 U. S. 238, 89 S. Ct. 1709, 23 L.Ed.2d 274 (1969) to require, when a guilty plea is entered, that the record on direct appeal show, among other things, a personal waiver of the right of confrontation, the right to a jury trial and an understanding that at trial the accused would not have to testify, with no unfavorable inference to be drawn therefrom. <em>English v. State, </em>16 Md. App. 439, 441-42, 298 A. 2d 464 (1973), <em>cert. granted, </em>268 Md. 748, <em>dismissed, </em>July 3, 1973. We have applied the same rule, of affirmative disclosure from the record, when a plea of <em>nob contendere </em>is filed. <em>McCall v. State, </em>9 Md. App. 191, 201, 263 A. 2d 19 (1970), <em>cert. denied, </em>258 Md. 729. We eschew further emburdening court proceedings with such talismanic ritual. <em>See State v. McKenzie, </em>17 Md. App. 563, 569, 303 A. 2d 406 (1973). We decline to extend the rule under discussion to embrace stipulations of facts, even of the entire facts, when the accused has entered a not guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">Our decision is supported by <em>State v. Zimmerman, </em>261 Md. 11, 273 A. 2d 156 (1971), in which the Court of Appeals of Maryland considered the question of waiver of a jury trial in a case identical to the legal posture of the present case. The Court concluded that a question of waiver could be raised only in post conviction proceedings. <em>See also State v. McKenzie, supra </em>at 589-90, wherein we held, that the waiver of the right not to testify, after a plea of not guilty, was a question of trial tactics and that waiver by trial counsel would ordinarily be binding upon the accused, if no objections were raised at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">Our holding, that there is a difference between what the record on direct appeal must show as to waiver of confrontation, when a guilty plea is entered as distinguished from when a not guilty plea is entered, is supported by reason as well as authority. When a guilty plea was entered, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>at trial in Maryland, before <em>Boykin\u2019s </em>ritualized recitations, there was frequently nothing in the proceedings to show that the accused had any knowledge of his state or federal constitutional right, <em>eo nomine, </em>to require that his accusers confront him. <em>Church a/k/a Holland v. State, </em>5 Md. App. 642, 645, 248 A. 2d 907 (1969), <em>cert. denied, </em>253 Md. 733; <em>Cooper v. State, </em>5 Md. App. 638, 640, 248 A. 2d 905 (1969), <em>cert. denied, </em>253 Md. 733. On the other hand, it has been consistently held when this right is waived after a not guilty plea, that there must be a showing in the record that counsel in the presence of the accused, has expressly waived the right of confrontation. <em>Waller v. Director, </em>244 Md. 229, 231, 223 A. 2d 265 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">If the question is presented on post conviction, appellant will be permitted to show, although it appears doubtful that he can: (1) that the stipulation was against his will, <em>Brookhart v. Janis, </em>384 U. S. 1, 86 S. Ct. 1245, 16 L.Ed.2d 314 (1966), or (2) that he had no knowledge, however acquired, of his right to confrontation of the witnesses against him. <em>Johnson v. Zerbst, </em>304 U. S. 458, 464, 58 S. Ct. 1019, 1023, 82 L. Ed. 1461 (1938).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">Appellant also claims unconstitutional prior convictions were used against him in violation of <em>Burgett v. Texas, </em>389 U. S. 109, 88 S. Ct. 258, 19 L.Ed.2d 319 (1967). No objection was made below, therefore, the question is not before us. Md. Rule 1085. <em>Bailey v. State, </em>263 Md. 424, 283 A. 2d 360 (1971); <em>Johnson v. State, </em>9 Md. App. 166, 263 A. 2d 232 (1970). His claim that the evidence was insufficient to support the conviction is frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b700-7\">. Appellant questions also, whether he effectively waived his right to a jury trial and his right to testify in his own behalf. The facts above evidence that he did so waive.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1A\">\n<p id=\"b701-8\">. Under Md. Code, Art. 59, \u00a7 25 (b) this plea should now read, \u201cthe defendant was insane at time of the commission of the alleged crime.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b702-8\">. It is possible that at some future time, stipulations of entire facts will be considered trial tactics. <em>See State v. McKenzie, supra </em>at 590 n. 16; <em>Poole v. Fitzharris, </em>396 F. 2d 544 (9th Cir. 1968). At this point we are not prepared to so hold.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
