He was sentenced by presiding Judge Ralph W. Powers to twelve years.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-10\">On this appeal, appellant alleges the lower court erred in:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-11\">1) Denying appellant twenty peremptory challenges to the jury panel;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-12\">2) Denying appellant\u2019s motion for a mistrial;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-13\">3) Refusing appellant\u2019s instruction that the jury verdict must be unanimous.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b704-14\">Seventh Circuit Rule 741 a provides that, in the event a defendant who is entitled to twenty peremptory challenges to prospective jurors does not file a statement signifying his intention to exercise his right between the tenth and fifth calendar days before the date set for trial, he waives that right. The Rule concludes \u201cfor good cause shown the court may waive the requirements of this rule.\u201d Appellant was entitled to twenty peremptory challenges by virtue of his penal exposure as charged. Md. Rule 746 a 1; Md. Code, Art. 51, \u00a7 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-15\">Appellant\u2019s counsel failed to file the required statement. He advised the court that he had not been familiar with the local rule. He stated that his failure to become cognizant of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>it should not be permitted to deprive the appellant of his rights. He contended that his unfamiliarity with the local rule was \u201cgood cause shown\u201d to permit the judge to lift the restriction imposed by Rule 741 a. Judge Powers did not agree and denied the twenty peremptory strikes.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">This court fully recognizes that the peremptory challenges to which an accused is entitled by virtue of Rule 746 a 1 represent an important right vital to the conduct of a criminal case in this State. <em>Cook v. State, </em>18 Md. App. 395, 400. However, varying local conditions create diverse procedural problems which require certain restrictions upon the exercise of such rights. Consequently, each circuit has the responsibility to impose rules, consistent with state rules, to alleviate local problems. Md. Rule 1 f.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">This court has upheld a local rule limiting the right to elect a jury trial to fifteen days after arraignment and held that there was no abuse of discretion in declining to waive the rule, although the rule explicitly permitted the court such discretion. <em>Walter v. State, </em>4 Md. App. 373, 378. In <em>Cole v. State, </em>12 Md. App. 379, 382, a similar rule was sustained, but we held that the court\u2019s discretion was abused under the circumstances of that case. Both cases demonstrate that a constitutional right may be limited by state procedural rules and'restricted further by local rule. It follows, therefore, that a statutory right defined by state rule may also be subject to time restrictions imposed by local rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">Appellant fires a Parthian dart. He argues that the local rule is not numbered and arranged identically to the pertinent state rule. Md. Rule 1 f 1 calls for circuit wide rules to have a numbering system and arrangement \u201cconsistent with\u201d the Maryland Rules. Such consistency exists in the rules of the Seventh Judicial Circuit. There is no requirement that they be identically numbered.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-8\">The court properly concluded that counsel\u2019s failure to apprise himself of the rules of the circuits wherein he chooses to practice was not \u201cgood cause\u201d to waive them. To permit self-flagellation and confession of a lack of familiarity with the rules to constitute \u201cgood cause\u201d would reward the dilatory at the expense of the diligent and would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>provide a useful tactical advantage detrimental to the judicial process.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">The appellant\u2019s second contention arises from his cross-examination of an eye witness. Appellant\u2019s counsel was testing the witness\u2019s recollection of the date he had appeared at the police station to view certain photographs.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-6\">\u201cQ. So there was no viewing by you by March of any of these photographs, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-7\">A. Not that I recall, no. As a matter of fact \u2014 wait a minute, I am thinking.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-8\">Q. Sure, you may answer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-9\">A. I believe I did go down to the police station, I think it was in February, February or March. I think after one of the defendants supposedly killed a Park policeman. I read that in the paper that he supposedly \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-10\">MR. KARCESKI: I would like to approach the bench at this time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-11\">THE COURT: Very well.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-12\">(Whereupon, counsel approached the bench and the following proceedings took place out of the hearing of the jury:)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-13\">MR. KARCESKI: I am going to have to ask for a mistrial. I don\u2019t think the answer was at all responsive to my question. It certainly is highly prejudicial to this defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-14\">THE COURT: I will instruct them that has nothing whatever to do with it. That is the most I can do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-15\">MR. KARCESKI: The instruction, if anything, is going to amplify it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-16\">MR. LORE: You told him to go on with what he was saying.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-17\">THE COURT: Take your choice. I will deny any motion for a mistrial. Start getting people to talk <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>about other things, sometimes that can come out, and it\u2019s just a hazard.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">The motion was denied by the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">Because of the trial court\u2019s advantageous position to judge the question of prejudice, its decision with reference thereto should not be reversed unless it is clear that there was prejudice. <em>Cook v. State, </em>225 Md. 603, 610, <em>cert. den. </em>368 U. S. 970; <em>Carroll v. State, </em>3 Md. App. 50, 53. We are not persuaded that the witness\u2019s response in the context in which it was made was sufficiently prejudicial to mandate a mistrial. <em>See Britton v. State, </em>10 Md. App. 70, 74.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">Finally appellant complains of the court\u2019s failure to instruct the jury on the need for a unanimous verdict. Following the court\u2019s instructions, the appellant requested certain additional instructions. One request was made with the following colloquy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-8\">\u201cMR. KARCESKI: Your Honor, I think the jury ought to be made known the jury\u2019s verdict must be unanimous in the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-9\">THE COURT: Well, they have a briefing at the beginning of their service. They all know that. This is an experienced jury. They have all sat on a number of cases.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-10\">MR. KARCESKI: That is all I have.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b707-11\">It would appear that counsel accepted that assurance. Counsel did not \u201cdistinctly\u201d object to the court\u2019s refusal to give the requested instruction, nor did he state any grounds of objection prior to the jury\u2019s retirement. Md. Rule 756 g. Had appellant the slightest concern that the jury\u2019s verdict was less than unanimous he should have exercised his right to have the jury polled.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-12\">It is worth reiterating that the rules of court, statewide or local, \u201care not guides to the practice of law but precise rubrics \u2018established to promote the orderly and efficient administration of justice and [that they] are to be read and followed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Isen v. Phoenix Assurance Co., </em>259 Md. 564, 570, citing <em>Brown v. Fraley, </em>222 Md. 480, 483.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-13\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
