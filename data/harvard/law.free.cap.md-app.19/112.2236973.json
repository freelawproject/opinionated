An amended bill of complaint filed by the same and other <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> appellants sought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>additional relief as to taxes imposed after an allegedly unlawful assessment in Anne Arundel County in 1972. The amended bill alleged that state and county officials, departments and governments<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> failed to carry out the mandate imposed by Article 81, \u00a7 232 (8)(a) and (b); Article 81, \u00a7 14 (b)(1), and Article 81, \u00a7 232 (4) <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of the Annotated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>Code of Maryland requiring them to conduct an annual review and, w here appropriate, annually to reassess all residential properties in Anne Arundel and Talbot Counties. The bill allcgeu (hat the appellant taxpayers and other taxpayers similarly situated (being about one-third of the taxpayers in each of the two years) were forced to bear a greater tax burden in the ensuing fiscal year than was the burden of other taxpayers upon the tax rolls of the two counties. The bill alleged that those 1971 and 1972 reassessments, violative of the aforementioned statutes, also were in violation of Article 15 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights and of Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The bill further alleged that the appellees will continue to engage in the same improper and unlawful assessment practices in the future. The relief sought was as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">A. <em>Declaratory Relief</em></p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">(11 That appellees\u2019 assessment procedures contravene <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>Article 81, \u00a7 232 (a) and (b); do not conform to the requirements of Article 81, \u00a7 14; do not conform to Article 81, \u00a7 232 (4); and are in violation of Article 15 of the Declaration of Rights and Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">(2) That the tax levies resulting from the 1971 reassessment be declared void and illegal, or, alternatively, that any increase in tax levies resulting therefrom be declared void and illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">(3) That the 1972 reassessment in Anne Arundel County be declared void and illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">B. <em>Injunctive Relief</em></p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">(1) Forbidding valuation and assessment of residential properties in the counties on any other basis than upon an annual review and reassessment as required by Article 81, \u00a7 232 (8)(a) and (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-9\">(2) Requiring execution of a continuing method of assessments to assure that all real property in Anne Arundel and Talbot Counties is reviewed once a year and reassessed annually, if such review discloses a change in value.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-10\">(3) Requiring formulation, pursuant to Article 81, \u00a7 244, of a uniform plan for the assessment of property meeting the requirement of Article 81, \u00a7 232 (8)(a) and (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-11\">(4) Forbidding the collection of any property tax based on the 1971 assessment and requiring refund of any money paid by appellants or members of their respective classes, or, in the alternative, forbidding the collection of any taxes based on any increase resulting from the 1971 reassessment and requiring refund of such increase that those appellants and members of their respective classes may have paid following the 1971 reassessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-12\">(5) Forbidding the Supervisors of Assessments for Anne Arundel and Talbot Counties from placing the 1971 and 1972 reassessments on the tax rolls of Anne Arundel and Talbot Counties respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-13\">(6) Forbidding the Supervisors of Assessments of Anne <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>Arundel and Talbot Counties to certify the tax rolls to the County Council and the County Commissioners of Anne Arundel and Talbot Counties respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">(7) Forbidding the Controller of Anne Arundel County and Herman F. Mielke, Treasurer of Talbot County, as collectors of taxes, to prepare and issue tax bills for fiscal 1973-74, based upon the 1971 and 1972 assessments, or, in the alternative, forbidding them to prepare and issue tax bills to appellants and members of their respective classes for fiscal 1973-74 as to any increase resulting from the 1971 and 1972 reassessments.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">The appellees Ward, Riley, Pumphrey, McDaniel and the State Department of Assessments and Taxation (allegedly responsible for the procedures utilized in the 1971 and 1972 reassessments) moved for partial summary judgment. The appellees Carter, Anne Arundel County, County Council of Anne Arundel County, Mielke, County Commissioners of Talbot County, and Goldstein (occupying roles in the collection of taxes but not in the reassessment procedures) moved for complete summary judgment. The motions for summary judgment were granted by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">The granting of the requested summary judgment denied to the appellants and to the classes they purport to represent the right to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-8\">(a) a refund of taxes paid or to any part thereof;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-9\">(b) injunctive relief against the collection of taxes based upon the 1971 and 1972 assessments;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-10\">(c) injunctive relief against the consequences of the reassessments of 1971 and 1972;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-11\">(d) injunctive relief forbidding preparation and issuance of tax bills based on the reassessments of 1971 and 1972;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-12\">(e) injunctive relief forbidding preparation and issuance of tax bills reflecting increased tax liability because of the reassessments of 1971 and 1972.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-13\">The grant of summary judgment left for further decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>by the trial court the determination, upon the merits of the case, whether the assessment practices in Anne Arundel and Talbot Counties in 1971 and 1972 were in conformity with applicable substantive law. Although the decision appealed from determined less than all claims, the trial judge directed entry of a final judgment with an express determination that there was no just reason for delay, as authorized by Rule 605 a. The appeal, therefore, was properly taken,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> subject to the single caveat that the reserved issue is not before us. In the posture of the case on this appeal, we assume, without deciding, that the assessment practices were not in conformity with law.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">\n<em>Appellants\u2019 Claims to Refund of Taxes</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\"><em>Rapley v. Montgomery County, </em>261 Md. 98, 274 A. 2d 124, is wholly dispositive of this claim to relief. In <em>Rapley </em>it was said at page 110 [130]:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-7\">\u201c* * * the common law rule, as interpreted by our prior decisions, * * * precludes the recovery of taxes paid voluntarily under a mistake of law, even if paid under protest and even if the statute under which the tax was paid is later determined to be unconstitutional or invalid. The only possible escape from this harsh rule is found in the case where the taxing statute itself provides a refund; * * *.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">\n<em>Appellants\u2019 Claims for Injunctive Relief</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b138-9\">As heretofore stated, the appellants\u2019 claim to injunctive relief sought restraint of collection of taxes; relief from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>consequences of reassessments; and restraint upon preparation and issuance of tax bills reflecting any, or any increased, tax liability. In our view all such claims will stand or fall together.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">Appellants rely heavily upon <em>Hillsborough Township v. Cromwell, </em>326 U.S. 620, wherein it was said at page 623:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-7\">\u201cThe equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment protects the individual from state action which selects him out for discriminatory treatment by subjecting him to taxes not imposed on others of the same class. The right is the right to equal treatment. He may not complain if equality is achieved by increasing the same taxes of other members of the class to the level of his own. The constitutional requirement, however, is not satisfied if a State does not itself remove the discrimination, but imposes on him against whom the discrimination has been directed the burden of seeking an upward revision of the taxes of other members of the class.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">That case must be considered in the light of its extraordinary conditions. The Supreme Court there points out (p. 629) that federal injunctive relief to the taxpayer was accorded because:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-9\">\u201c* * * <em>so much uncertainty surrounds </em>the New Jersey remedy to protect the taxpayer\u2019s federal right that a refusal to dismiss the bill was a proper exercise of discretion. Thus however the case may be viewed, <em>the exceptional circumstances which we have noted take it out of the </em>general rule of Great Lakes Dredge &amp; Dock Co. v. Huffman, 319 U. S. 293.\u201d [Italics supplied]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b139-10\">Although the opinion in <em>Hillsborough </em>is not a model of clarity in the exposition of its facts, it is fair to conclude that the words \u201cexceptional circumstances which we have noted\u201d contained in the quotation immediately above made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>reference to the circumstances outlined in footnote 1 of the opinion, <em>i.e.:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-5\">\u201cThe <em>assessments call for tax payments of nearly $7,000,000 for each year as compared with the Township\u2019s budget of something like $97,000 </em>annually. <em>Prior </em>to these <em>assessments </em>the net assessed valuation for taxation of all property assessed, both real and personal, in the township <em>amounted to $3,117,863 </em>for 1940 and <em>$3,139,020 </em>for 1941. * * * <em>The additional assessments </em>against respondent <em>apparently would have increased the valuation </em>of the township tax ratables <em>by $221,940,438 </em>for each of the two years, * * *.\u201d [Italics supplied]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">It is plain that the absence of State remedy coupled with proof of a purposeful discrimination of the rights of the taxpayer compelled the grant of the relief in <em>Hillsborough, </em>supra. It is equally plain that (a) no uncertainty surrounds a Maryland remedy available to the named appellants, and (b) there is no showing of a purposeful discrimination against them.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">There is no contention here <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> that assessments imposed upon the individual appellants exceeded full cash value (as authorized and required by the provisions of Article 81, \u00a7 14 (b)(1). Moreover, the amended bill of complaint, (seeking relief also for the new and different one-third of the taxpayers of Anne Arundel County affected by the 1972 reassessment) necessarily implies that <em>all </em>taxpayers, including those reassessed in a prior or the ensuing year, would be entitled to the same relief. Carried to its logical end, this burgeoning effect would achieve the absurd result that <em>no taxpayer would be assessed in accordance with law.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">Such a result would bring chaos to the State and its political subdivisions. Balanced against the tax anarchy that would follow the grant of the relief here sought is the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>circumstance that <em>every taxpayer </em>(over a three year period) would have been subjected substantially to the same tax burden, (even though subjected to an added burden in the particular year of reassessment) because of benefits accruing from the absence of reassessment in the other two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">We do not imply of course that this circumstance would operate to permit the appellees to fail or to refuse to perform a duty prescribed by law. It is plain to us, however, that the form of injunctive relief sought by the appellants in this appellate aspect of the subject litigation is not available to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">The case of <em>Baltimore Steam Packet Co. v. State Tax Commission, </em>161 Md. 9, 155 A. 158, compels rejection of the relief here sought. In that case the Court of Appeals said at page 22 [163]:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-8\">\u201cUpon a full consideration of the contentions of the appellant, it would seem that its real complaint is that it is now taxed, while competitors are exempt, resulting in a pecuniary advantage to the competitors over it to the extent of the tax which it is required to pay. If this be true, its remedy lies, not in attempting to be relieved of the tax itself, but in restraining the proper taxing officials from allowing the exemption of its competitors. Every taxpayer has a financial interest in seeing that all property in the state, properly the subject of taxation, should be taxed, because, by increasing the taxable basis, the rate necessary for the production of the expenses of the state and local governments will be reduced, and the individual\u2019s tax correspondingly lowered. Such a proceeding was approved by this court in <em>Schley v. Lee, </em>106 Md. 390, 67 A. 252.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-9\">To the same effect is <em>State Tax Commission v. C &amp; P Telephone Co., </em>193 Md. 222, 66 A. 2d 477, wherein the Court said at page 235 [482]:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-10\">&lt;&lt;* * * othgj. utilities have been underassessed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>appellee\u2019s remedy lies not in attempting to be relieved of the assessment itself but in restraining the Commission from not properly assessing other utilities.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">The two cases last above cited make crystal clear that there is an appropriate remedy available to the appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">The case of <em>Sears, Roebuck v. State Tax Commission, </em>214 Md. 550, 136 A. 2d 567, cited by appellants, is distinguishable upon three grounds. First, the taxpayer there utilized the statutory relief provided by \u00a7 13 (a) of Article 81 of the Annotated Code (1951). Secondly, the Court of Appeals in <em>Sears, </em>itself pointed out at page 559 [572]: \u201c* * * the appellant is not contending that any other assessment made under the direction of the Commission was too low. It is complaining that its assessment is too high. The discrimination here has been intentional and arbitrary.\u201d Thirdly, although <em>Sears, supra, </em>cited <em>Hillsborough, supra, </em>and recognized its ruling \u201cthat the State itself must remove \u2022such discrimination,\u201d it also cited and did not depart from the doctrine declared in <em>Schley v. Lee, </em>106 Md. 390, 67 A. 252, upon which the controlling cases of <em>Baltimore Steam Packet </em>and <em>Commission v. C &amp; P, </em>both <em>supra, </em>were bottomed.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">Other Maryland cases cited by appellants factually are so disparate as to furnish no meaningful comparison,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> or did not reach the issue we find controlling in this case.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Out of state cases cited by appellants also have been considered, but we have found them distinguishable on their facts, or in conflict with principles declared in the decisions upon which we have relied.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>Because we find that none of the individual appellants is entitled to the relief denied by the trial court, we do not reach the subsidiary issue whether their claim of entitlement to bring a class action for others similarly situated is a valid one.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">\n<em>Costs to be paid by appellants.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">\n<em>Mandate to issue forthwith.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b133-13\">.
