Ann. Code Art. 27, \u00a7 534H provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-5\">\u201c(a) In Prince George\u2019s County, except as specifically in this section otherwise provided, it is unlawful on Sunday for any wholesale or retail establishment to conduct business for labor or profit in the usual manner and location or to operate its establishment in any manner for the general public. It shall not cause, direct, permit, or authorize any employee or agent to engage in or conduct business on its behalf on Sunday.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-6\">(c) Nothing in this section applies to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-7\">1. Farmers</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-8\">2. Nurserymen\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b728-9\">In this appeal we are asked to hold that the appellant, Hechinger Company, is a nurseryman within the meaning of Md. Ann. Code Art. 27, \u00a7 534H, and if it is not, then to toll the death knell for \u00a7 534H (c) 2. on the ground that it is void for vagueness. We shall do neither for the reasons hereinafter set forth.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-10\">On June 13, 1973 the State\u2019s Attorney for Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland, pursuant to Md. Ann. Code Art. 27, \u00a7 534H (i) filed a petition in which he sought an injunction against Hechinger. The basis for the requested relief was that Hechinger had conducted \u201ca retail hardware sales business on Sunday, June 3,1973, in Prince George\u2019s County . . . employing more than six employees . . .\u201d and therefore was in violation of the \u201cSunday Blue Laws\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-11\">On June 22, 1973 Judge Perry G. Bowen conducted the trial on the merits of the petition for relief. The State relied primarily upon the testimony of Sergeant Robert R. Ross of the Prince George\u2019s County Police Department. Sergeant Ross testified that at approximately 10:20 A.M. on Sunday, June 3, 1973 he went to the Hechinger store located at 4444 Branch Avenue, Marlow Heights, where he observed an estimated seventy-five customers and twenty-four <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>salespersons. Ross said that he thought only a small percentage of the seventy-five customers and \u201cfive or six\u201d salespersons were in the floor space in which garden supplies were sold. The cash registers were located at the \u201cmain entrance\u201d to the store. Sergeant Ross enumerated a number of items that he had observed to be for sale in the store. Those items included iceboxes, washing machines, stoves, building materials, appliances, lawn furniture, swimming pool accessories, hand tools, power tools, shrubs, barbecue grills, hibachis, paint, door frames, windows, picnic supplies, evergreen trees, charcoal, chemicals and insecticides for lawn care, decorative bark, stones, brick, fertilizer, garden carts, fountains, lawn sweepers, hand and power mowers, hoses, sprayers, spreaders, as well as other products. Ross opined that less than one-fourth of the total floor space was devoted to the display of the garden items.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-4\">The principal defense to the equity proceeding was that appellant, Hechinger, is a nurseryman. In support of that defense the appellant offered the testimony of its president, John W. Hechinger. Mr. Hechinger stated that the items sold by his company would be sold by the normal nursery. He was referred by his counsel to an article entitled \u201cGreen and Growing Market.\u201d The witness read from the list of products that a \u201cwell stocked nursery should have in order to compete.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The appellant\u2019s store sold \u201c220 different items of growing stock\u201d, and its employees have received training in \u201cgrass and lawn products.\u201d Furthermore, the employees are visited by a consultant \u201ctwo or three times a year . . . [who] hold[s] . . . seminars . . . for [the purpose of] answering questions of the salesmen.\u201d Mr. Hechinger said that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>questions put by the salesmen to the consultant were concerned with \u201cthe care and feeding of plants, especially the planting instructions, because we give ... a very strong guarantee . . . .\u201d According to the witness his store sold most of the goods that a well stocked nursery or hardware store would offer for sale. Appellant also sold lumberyard items, but those products were \u201cdirected toward the home rather than the trade.\u201d It was developed in the testimony that the Hechinger slogan is \u201cthe world\u2019s most unusual lumberyard.\u201d The appellant\u2019s president testified that on June 3, 1973 all of the departments of the store were in operation and not just the. garden section.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">On the record before us, we are unable to determine the principal business of the appellant. While the store is departmentalized, no business records were offered demonstrating the percentage of business transacted by any particular department. Mr. Hechinger did state that approximately one-third of the floor space was devoted to the garden aspect of the business and that the sales were \u201csubstantial, probably close to 50 percent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">In this Court the appellant argues that it \u201coffers more than 220 varieties of growing stock for public purchase. And common sense tells us that in order to stock such growing items . . . [appellant] would have to water and fertilize the plants periodically,\u201d in order to sell \u201cgood and healthy merchandise.\u201d Appellant utilizes the quoted statement as a premise upon which it grounds a conclusion that because it fertilizes and waters plants in order to sell them, it is in the business of \u201craising\u201d plants for sale and thus is a nurseryman. We decline to adopt the appellant\u2019s line of reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">The word \u201cnurseryman\u201d is defined in <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary of the English Language </em>(unabr. ed. 1967) as, \u201cone whose occupation is the scientific cultivation of trees, shrubs and plants.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A nursery is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>defined by the same source to mean \u201can area where trees, shrubs or plants are grown for transplanting, for use as stocks for budding and grafting, or for sale.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b731-4\">In <em>Town of Needham v. Winslow Nurseries, </em>330 Mass. 95, 100, 111 N.E.2d 453, 456 (1953), the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-5\">\u201cAccording to dictionary definition a nursery is a place where trees, shrubs, plants, and so forth, are propagated from seed or otherwise for transplanting, for use as stock for grafting, and for sale. <em>See Miethke v. Pierce County, </em>173 Wash. 381, 23 P.2d 405 [(1933)]; <em>Attorney General v. State Board of Judges, </em>38 Cal. 291, 296 [(1869)]; <em>Miller v. Baker, </em>[42 Mass. (1 Met.) 27 (1840)]; <em>Whitmarsh v. Walker, </em>[42 Mass. (1 Met.) 313 (1840)]; <em>Paine v. Board of Assessors of Town of Weston, </em>297 Mass. 173, 7 N.E.2d 584 [(1937)].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b731-8\">Appellant cites us to a series of cases in which courts have been called upon to consider what does and does not constitute a nursery business. The first such case, <em>A.C. Nurseries, Inc. v. Brady, </em>278 App. Div. 974, 105 N.Y.S.2d 933 (1951) is of no help to appellant, as that case merely notes that a nursery was a permitted non-conforming use under the City of Yonkers zoning ordinance. <em>Town of Needham v. Winslow Nurseries, supra, </em>also involved a local zoning ordinance, and it is factually inapposite to the instant case. <em>Anderson v. Humble Oil and Refining Company, </em>226 Ga. 252, 174 S.E.2d 415 (1970) is concerned solely with a question arising under the zoning laws of Fayette County, Georgia. The issue there involved was whether or not a nursery was properly zoned as \u201ccommercial\u201d or \u201cagricultural\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-9\">That the employees of the appellant water and fertilize the plants and shrubs that are part of the appellant\u2019s inventory, does not in our view place the appellant within the ambit of the definition of nurserymen.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-10\">We think the appellant was conducting a retail business and not, as the word is ordinarily and naturally used, a nursery. <em>Ergo, </em>appellant is not a nurseryman. If we were to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>adopt the argument urged upon us by the appellant we would in effect authorize every <em>bona fide </em>nurseryman in Prince George\u2019s County to engage in a retail business enterprise similar to that of the appellant. Nurserymen could then, under the guise of their statutory exemption, undertake to sell, on Sunday, the diverse and sundry items offered for sale by the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">The word <em>nurserymen </em>as used in Art. 27, \u00a7 534H (c) 2 is not void for vagueness, but on the contrary is clearly definitive. We cannot disregard the natural meaning of the statutory language \u201cunless some imperative reason is found in the statute for enlarging or restricting its meaning.\u201d <em>Giant of Md. v. State\u2019s Attorney, </em>267 Md. 501, 511, 298 A. 2d 427, 433 (1973). No such \u201cimperative reason\u201d is presented in the instant case. We confine ourselves to the construction of the statute as it was enacted by the General Assembly, and we conclude that the statutory language is plain, crystalline and unambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">Appellant also contends that because it was inspected, pursuant to Md. Ann. Code Art. 48, \u00a7 79, by a representative of the Secretary of Agriculture for the State of Maryland, that they had a \u201cright to rely on their status as a nursery.\u201d Their reliance upon the cited code provision is misplaced. Md. Ann. Code Art. 48, \u00a7 79 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-6\">\u201cThe Secretary of Agriculture shall inspect at least once in every six (6) months all nurseries of trees, vines, shrubs, and plants subject to the aforesaid insects or diseases within the State, and if found free, so far as can be determined by inspection, from the aforesaid insects or disease to give to the owner or owners or persons in charge of said nurseries a certificate of inspection showing such nurseries or premises to be apparently free from such insects and diseases .... <em>No nurseryman, broker, agent, dealer or other person shall be permitted, to sell, ship, send out, or give away, by mail, express, freight or otherwise, any trees, vines, shrubs, plants, buds or cuttings from any such nurseries or premises, without </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number><em>accompanying the same, with a copy of the said certificate . . . </em>,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>\u201d (Emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b733-4\">It is apparent that the Code not only requires the inspection of \u201cnurseries of trees, vines, shrubs, and plants\u201d, but also mandates that a \u201cbroker, agent, dealer or other person\u201d shall not be permitted to trade or deal in trees, vines, plants and shrubs unless the items have been inspected as required by law. The statute thus confers upon the Secretary of Agriculture the duty, not only to inspect nurseries, but to assure that other persons engaged in the sale of the specified items are also complying with the terms of the act. The inspection of the appellant\u2019s stock-in-trade of plants, vines, trees and shrubs by the Secretary does not transform the appellant\u2019s obvious retail store into a nursery.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">\n<em>Costs to be paid by the appellant.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b729-5\">.
