United States, </em>393 U. S. 410, 89 S. Ct. 584, 21 L.Ed.2d 637 (1969), purported \u201cto explicate\u201d <em>Aguilar v. Texas, </em>378 U. S. 108, 84 S. Ct. 1509, 12 L.Ed.2d 723 (1964). <em>Spinelli </em>is not itself without some need of explication. The precise influence of <em>Spinelli </em>upon <em>Aguilar </em>and the murky relationship to both of <em>Draper v. United States, </em>358 U. S. 307, 79 S. Ct. 329, 3 L.Ed.2d 327 (1959), govern our review of the conviction by a Baltimore County jury, Judge H. Kemp MacDaniel presiding, of the appellant, David Richard Stanley, for the possession of heroin.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-11\">The sufficiency of the incriminating evidence is not in dispute. When the appellant was arrested at 8:30 p.m. on July 3,1972, two glassine bags of heroin were found beneath the driver\u2019s seat of the vehicle which he had been operating until the moment of arrest. Our decision hangs upon the validity of that search and seizure. The Baltimore County Police were operating without a warrant, upon ostensible probable cause to believe that the appellant was selling heroin from his automobile. The probable cause ran to both the person and the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-12\">If the police did, indeed, have probable cause, the search <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>and seizure in issue was reasonable upon either of two distinct exceptions to the warrant requirement. That postulated probable cause, in conjunction with what we deem to have been ample exigency, would have justified a warrantless search of the vehicle under the so-called \u201cautomobile exception.\u201d <em>Carroll v. United States, </em>267 U. S. 132, 45 S. Ct. 280, 69 L. Ed. 543 (1925); <em>Chambers v. Maroney, </em>399 U. S. 42, 90 S. Ct. 1975, 26 L.Ed.2d 419 (1970); <em>Coolidge v. New Hampshire, </em>403 U. S. 443, 91 S. Ct. 2022, 29 L.Ed.2d 564 (1971); <em>Mobley v. State, </em>270 Md. 803, 310 A. 2d 803; <em>King and Mobley v. State, </em>16 Md. App. 546, 298 A. 2d 446; <em>Soles v. State, </em>16 Md. App. 656, 299 A. 2d 502; <em>Peterson v. State, </em>15 Md. App. 478, 292 A. 2d 714; <em>Bailey v. State, </em>16 Md. App. 83, 294 A. 2d 123; <em>Skinner v. State, </em>16 Md. App. 116, 293 A. 2d 828. That same postulated probable cause would, quite independently, have justified a warrant-less arrest of the appellant, Art. 27, Sect. 594B, and, the unities of time and place having been in our judgment adequately established, <em>Chimel v. California, </em>395 U. S. 752, 89 S. Ct. 2034, 23 L.Ed.2d 685 (1969); <em>Brown v. State, </em>15 Md. App. 584, 292 A. 2d 762, the search beneath the seat where the appellant had been seated when arrested scant seconds before, would have been a legitimate \u201csearch incident\u201d to that arrest. <em>Peterson v. State, supra, </em>at 15 Md. App. 481-493; <em>Howell v. State, </em>18 Md. App. 429, 306 A. 2d 554. Both State theories, it is therefore quite clear, depend upon the adequacy in the first instance of the probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">The probable cause consisted of minimal direct observations by the arresting officer coupled with significantly incriminating hearsay from an anonymous police informant. Our problem, upon our constitutionally mandated independent review, <em>Ker v. California, </em>374 U. S. 23, 34, 83 S. Ct. 1623, 10 L.Ed.2d 726, 738 (1963), is, as was the problem of the trial judge upon the motion to suppress, to evaluate that hearsay \u2014 to determine whether it was an appropriately trustworthy predicate for the Fourth Amendment intrusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">In that regard, it is established that the guidelines for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>evaluation of hearsay information in a probable cause setting are the same whether a magistrate is contemplating the issuance of a warrant or whether a trial judge is weighing the propriety of a policeman\u2019s actions without a warrant. <em>Wong Sun v. United States, </em>371 U. S. 471, 479-482, 83 S. Ct. 407, 9 L.Ed.2d 441, 450-452 (1963); <em>Beck v. Ohio, </em>379 U. S. 89, 93-97, 85 S. Ct. 223, 13 L.Ed.2d 142, 146-148 (1964); <em>McCray v. Illinois, </em>386 U. S. 300, 87 S. Ct. 1056, 18 L.Ed.2d 62 (1967); <em>Spinelli, </em>at 393 U. S. 417, n. 5; <em>Mobley v. State, supra; King and Mobley v. State, supra, </em>at 16 Md. App. 554-557; <em>Schmidt v. State, </em>17 Md. App. 492, 302 A. 2d 714; <em>Thompson v. State, </em>16 Md. App. 560, 298 A. 2d 458; <em>Soles v. State, supra, </em>at 16 Md.

In applying the strictures of <em>Aguilar </em>to a warrantless arrest based upon an informant\u2019s hearsay, former Chief Judge Murphy said for this Court in <em>Bolesta v. State, </em>9 Md. App. 408, 264 A. 2d 878, at 9 Md. App. 412:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-5\">\u201cWhere the arrest is initiated on hearsay information received from an informant, the State to establish its legality where challenged should sufficiently inform the trial judge of some of the underlying circumstances from which the informant concluded that a crime was being or had been committed by the person to be arrested, and some of the underlying circumstances from which the police concluded that the informant was credible or his information reliable. See <em>Spinelli v. United States, </em>393 U. S. 410, and <em>Mullaney v. State, supra </em>[5 Md. App. 248] at page 254.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">In undertaking then the evaluation of the hearsay information furnished to the arresting officer by the informant at bar, we follow the procedure set out in <em>Spinelli, </em>at 393 U. S. 415:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-7\">\u201cThe informer\u2019s report must first be measured against <em>Aguilar\u2019s, </em>standards so that its probative value can be assessed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>\n<em>The \u201cVeracity\u201d Prong</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">We will look first to the \u201cveracity\u201d prong of <em>Aguilar\u2019s </em>\u201ctwo-pronged test\u201d to determine whether there was furnished sufficient \u201cunderlying circumstances from which the officer concluded that the informant, whose identity need not be disclosed . .., was \u2018credible\u2019 or his information \u2018reliable\u2019.\u201d <em>Aguilar, </em>at 378 U. S. 114.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">We are persuaded that the informant was \u201ccredible.\u201d Detective Robert Oatman testified, at the suppression hearing outside the presence of the jury, as to the following knowledge about his informant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-7\">\u201cYour Honor, on 6/4/72 the reliable informant was made reliable by myself and Detective Minnerly. I went to a certain location and met the informant. At this time the subject was searched and found to be free of any narcotics and any money whatsoever. He was given a ten dollar bill and observed to walk into a home on Propeller Court in the Essex District, at which time he purchased a ten dollar amount of marihuana. He returned to the police unit where again he was searched and found to be free of the ten dollar bill given to him. He was also free of any narcotics. At this time he turned over the suspected marihuana to the Crime Lab and it was found to be marihuana, a controlled dangerous substance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-8\">On 6/15/72, again the same reliable informant, 077, supplied our Department and myself with information involving the arrest of two subjects and the confiscation of 43 pounds of marihuana. This case is pending in Baltimore City. On 6/28/72 the same reliable informant, 077, supplied myself with information that led to the arrest of six subjects and the confiscation of 68 pounds of marihuana.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b532-11\">This represents a highly commendable type of detail which enables a reviewing trial court to make a truly informed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>judgment as to the credibility of a source of information rather than be asked to ratify a policeman\u2019s conclusion in that regard. It is, under the circumstances, superfluous even to consider the buttressing effect, under <em>Spinel,hi, </em>of certain independent police verifications. <em>A\u00a1guilar\u2019s </em>\u201cveracity\u201d prong is already satisfied with flying colors, upon the basis of the internal description itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">\n<em>The \u201cBasis of Knowledge\u201d Prong</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">Such is not the case, however, with <em>Aguilar\u2019s </em>\u201cbasis of knowledge\u201d prong. The trial judge was not furnished \u201cthe underlying circumstances from which the informant concluded that the narcotics were where he claimed they were.\u201d Detective Oatman\u2019s testimony in this regard was unenlightening:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-7\">\u201c[H]e stated at this time one, David Stanley, would be operating a 1964 yellow Chevrolet and he would have in his possession Cocaine and Heroin. The informant stated the Stanley subject would be in the Dundalk area near the pool hall between the hours of eight o\u2019clock and 8:30. At this time he would also be accompanied by another white male subject by the name of Walter Holak.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">There was no direct indication that the informant spoke from personal knowledge \u2014 no assurance that he arrived at his conclusion on the basis of that which he had seen with his own eyes or heard with his own ears \u2014 no direct elimination of the possibility that he was a mere conduit for information from yet a third party if not, indeed, for information no \u201cmore substantial than a casual rumor circulating in the underworld.\u201d <em>Spinelli, </em>at 393 U. S. 416.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-9\">The hearsay at bar was, therefore, initially hung up on <em>Aguilar's </em>\u201cbasis of knowledge\u201d prong. The trial judge was not informed as to what the informant based his conclusion upon \u2014 as to how the informant came upon his information. \u201cTo permit the informant, no less than to permit the affiant, to offer an unsupported conclusion, would be to usurp the [judicial] function, which the Fourth Amendment forbids.\u201d <em>Dawson v. State, </em>14 Md. App. 18, 31, 284 A. 2d 861.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>We would ordinarily now proceed to a routine examination of the \u201cbasis of knowledge\u201d prong under <em>Spinelli\u2019s </em>augmentation to <em>Aguilar\u2019s </em>analysis to see if the information coming <em>from </em>the informant was furnished in such detail \u2014 \u201cself-verifying\u201d detail \u2014 as to permit the reasonable inference that the informant spoke from firsthand knowledge. <em>Spinelli, </em>at 393 U. S. 416-417; <em>Soles v. State, supra, </em>at 16 Md. App. 660-665.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">\n<em>A Suggested Reinforcement and a Suggested Alternative</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">The State, however, strenuously urges upon us that it has an alternative arrow (or two) in its constitutional quiver \u2014 a perplexingly undifferentiated reliance upon <em>Spinelli </em>and <em>Draper, </em>citing independent verification as a significant factor. We hold that reliance to be misplaced. There is, to be sure, however, an elusive quality to the general notion that makes it difficult to pinpoint precisely where it goes astray. The chameleon-like thesis of diffuse and non-particularized reliance has appeared before, both here and elsewhere. The alarming frequency with which \u201cfuzzy\u201d law is being advocated (and sometimes judicially promulgated) in this Fourth Amendment area, merits that an effort at clarification at least be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">The testimony at bar on the issue of probable cause contained, in addition to the hearsay, a few direct observations of Detective Oatman made just before the arrest was consummated. Detective Oatman drove to Dundalk and set up an observation post across the street from the pool hall. His observations consisted of the following: 1) at approximately 8:20 a yellow Chevrolet drove up to the intersection of Baltimore Avenue and Dundalk Avenue, just across from the pool hall; 2) the appellant was behind the wheel; and 3) Walter Holak was a passenger.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-8\">On the basis of those observations, the State posits a general reliance upon the precedent of <em>Draper </em>as providing \u201ca substantial basis for crediting the hearsay\u201d and, alternatively, a specific reliance upon the \u201cindependent police verifications\u201d \u2014 buttressing technique described in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number><em>Spinelli </em>Our examination and review of the State\u2019s thesis will be, of necessity, on two separate planes. Our first responsibility is to try to dispel the insidious and recently growing myth that some diffuse \u201csubstantial basis\u201d test \u2014 growing out of <em>Draper </em>and <em>Jones </em>v. <em>United States, </em>362 U. S. 257, 80 S. Ct. 725, 4 L.Ed.2d 697 (1960), invigorated by the rhetoric of <em>United States v. Ventresca, </em>380 U. S. 102, 85 S. Ct. 741, 13 L.Ed.2d 684 (1965), and sanctioned by <em>United States v. Harris, </em>403 U. S. 573, 91 S. Ct. 2075, 29 L.Ed.2d 723 (1971) \u2014 is now abroad as a distinct and alternative hearsay trustworthiness test to the traditional analysis of <em>Aguilar </em>and <em>Spinelli </em>Hopefully having laid that ghost to rest, we will then measure the State\u2019s thesis against the accepted standard of <em>Aguilar </em>and <em>Spinelli</em></p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">\n<em>\u201cSubstantial Basis\u201d: Synonym or Alternative?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">Without critical analysis of the hearsay evaluation problem as such, <em>Brinegar v. United States, </em>338 U. S. 160, 69 S. Ct. 1302, 93 L. Ed. 1879, in 1949 accepted hearsay as a legitimate factor in determining whether a policeman had probable cause for the warrantless search of an automobile. A decade later, <em>Draper, </em>again not addressing itself significantly to a qualitative analysis of receivable hearsay, nevertheless treated hearsay as a legitimate factor in the amassing of probable cause for a warrantless arrest. <em>Jones, </em>in 1960, was the first Supreme Court decision to deal with hearsay in a warrant application and was the first decision ever to face squarely the fundamental issue of whether hearsay should or should not be received in a probable cause setting. It ruled unequivocally that hearsay was not only appropriate to be received by a magistrate on the issue of probable cause but that it could be sufficient, standing alone, to establish such probable cause. Justice Frankfurter, writing for the Court, did not give it carte blanche, however; he cautioned that it could serve as the predicate for a warrant \u201cso long as a substantial basis for crediting the hearsay is presented.\u201d <em>Jones, </em>362 U. S. at 269. <em>Jones </em>did not undertake to spell out what \u201ca substantial basis for crediting the hearsay\u201d would be.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>That office fell, four years later, to Aguilar.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The so-called \u201ctwo-pronged test,\u201d whereunder \u201cthe magistrate must be informed of some of the underlying circumstances from which the informant concluded that the narcotics were where he claimed they were, and some of the underlying circumstances from which the officer concluded that the informant . . . was \u2018credible\u2019 or his information \u2018reliable\u2019 \u201d was, indeed, the fleshing out of the earlier phrase \u201ca substantial basis for crediting.\u201d There was np conflict or tension between <em>Aguilar </em>and <em>Jones. Aguilar </em>explicitly built upon the foundation of <em>Jones. </em>It analyzed the facts of <em>Jones </em>at great length, at 378 U. S. 114-115, n. 5, and showed how the hearsay in <em>Jones </em>would have passed muster by the more fully articulated standards of <em>Aguilar.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">In <em>Jones, </em>the informant related explicitly that he had \u201con many occasions . . . gone to said apartment and purchased narcotics drugs from the above mentioned persons and that the narcotics were secreated [sic] in the above mentioned places,\u201d to wit, \u201ceither on their person, under a pillow, on a dresser or on a window ledge in said apartment.\u201d Even anticipatorily, <em>Jones </em>met every demand of <em>Aguilar\u2019s </em>\u201cbasis of knowledge\u201d prong. The informant saw with his own eyes and heard with his own ears.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">Similarly, <em>Jones </em>satisfied <em>Aguilar\u2019s </em>\u201cveracity\u201d prong. The affiant recited that his \u201csource of information\u201d had \u201cgiven information to the undersigned on previous occasions and which was correct.\u201d The affiant pointed out further, on the issue of \u201cveracity,\u201d how \u201cother sources\u201d had given similar information to both the affiant and to other officers of the Narcotics Squad. Most significantly, in terms of independent verification, the affiant was personally familiar with both suspects and recited that \u201cBoth have admitted to the use of narcotic drugs' and display needle mark's as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>evidence of same.\u201d A careful reading of <em>Jones </em>simply will not support the proposition that \u201ca substantial basis for crediting the hearsay\u201d under <em>Jones </em>means anything different from or less than the \u201ctwo-pronged test\u201d of <em>Aguilar.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\">The same is true of <em>Draper. </em>Even if one could accept the dubious notion that an earlier and more primitive case could ever overrule later and more fully developed cases, <em>Draper </em>simply would not erode <em>Aguilar-Spinelli </em>but would pass muster according to them. The informant in <em>Draper </em>\u2014 \u201cone Hereford\u201d \u2014 was not even anonymous; he was named. It was, furthermore, recited about him that he \u201chad been engaged as a \u2018special employee\u2019 of the Bureau of Narcotics at Denver for about six months, and from time to time gave information to Marsh [the affiant] regarding violations of the narcotic laws, for which Hereford was paid small sums of money, and that Marsh had always found the information given by Hereford to be accurate and reliable.\u201d <em>Draper, </em>at 358 U. S. 309. In addition, four of the five details passed on to the affiant by Hereford were independently verified by direct police observations. Under the circumstances, his \u201cveracity\u201d was amply established by the most rigorous <em>Aguilar-Spinelli </em>testing. As to Hereford\u2019s \u201cbasis of knowledge,\u201d he did not, to be sure, explicitly establish \u201chow he came by his information.\u201d The teaching of <em>Spinelli, </em>however, using <em>Draper </em>as its illustrative \u201cbenchmark,\u201d is that where the information has been furnished by the informant in sufficient detail \u2014 what <em>Spinelli </em>refers to as \u201cself-verifying detail\u201d \u2014 firsthand knowledge may be implicit.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, <em>Draper </em>also is an unsound base for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>proposition that the Supreme Court will accept hearsay in a probable cause setting according to some vague alternative standard different from and less than the accepted <em>Aguilar-Spinelli </em>one.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">Nor may the proponents of some looser, alternative standard take more than momentary comfort from <em>Ventresca, </em>decided one year after <em>Aguilar. </em>Ignoring its facts and, therefore, its solid holding, they grasp (very selectively) at its rhetoric that courts \u201cshould not invalidate the warrant by interpreting the affidavit in a hypertechnical, rather than a commonsense, manner.\u201d <em>Ventresca </em>cited <em>Aguilar </em>with approval and analyzed its own facts to demonstrate its solid compliance with <em>Aguilar. </em>Indeed, the full paragraph from which the \u201cdon\u2019t be hypertechnical\u201d language is so frequently pulled affirms that the oft-quoted directive comes into play only after Aguilar\u2019s standards have first been met:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-6\"><em>\u201cThis is not to say that probable cause can be made out by affidavits which are purely conclusory, stating only the affiant\u2019s or an informer\u2019s belief that probable cause exists mthout detailing any of the \u2018underlying circumstances\u2019 upon which that belief is based... . Recital of some of the underlying circumstances in the. affidavit is essential if the magistrate is to perform his detached function and not serve merely as a rubber stamp for the police. </em>However, <em>where these circumstances are detailed, where reason for </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number><em>crediting the source of the information is given, </em>and <em>when a magistrate has found probable cause, </em>the court should not invalidate the warrant by interpreting the affidavit in a hypertechnical, rather than a commonsense, manner. Although in a particular case it may not be easy to determine when an affidavit demonstrates the existence of probable cause, the resolution of doubtful or marginal cases in this area should be largely determined by the preference to be accorded to warrants.. . .\u201d 380 U. S. 108-109. (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">The hearsay information in <em>Ventresca </em>passed traditional muster.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Even <em>Harris </em>pointed up the fundamental compatibility of <em>Aguilar </em>and <em>Ventresca. </em>After quoting at length from <em>Ventresca\u2019s </em>urgings to be \u201cpractical and not abstract\u201d and its inveighings against the \u201ctechnical requirements of elaborate specificity\u201d and \u201cthe grudging or negative attitude by reviewing courts,\u201d <em>Harris </em>noted: <em>\u201cAguilar </em>in no way departed from those sound principles.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Abis\">The last redoubt of the \u201clooser alternative\u201d advocates is <em>Harris, </em>but again the case won\u2019t hold the weight of the argument based upon it. Even if one were to accept the mere plurality opinions of four justices, three justices and four justices, respectively, for the three stated principles of <em>Harris </em>as the \u201claw of the land,\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> no damage is done to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number><em>Aguilar </em>and the most minor adjustment is made to <em>Spinelli. </em>In the first place, the informant in <em>Harris </em>explicitly spoke from firsthand knowledge. The . informant personally purchased the untaxed whiskey from the suspect on the suspect premises and made a significant number of firsthand observations. The plurality, concurring and idissenting opinions unanimously agreed that Aguilar\u2019s \u201cbasis of knowledge\u201d prong was preeminently satisfied. That was simply no issue in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">Nor was there any disagreement with the fundamental requirement that the other \u2014 the \u201cveracity\u201d \u2014 prong must also and independently be satisfied. Even the plurality opinion agreed that \u201ca bare statement by an affiant that he believed the informant to be truthful would not, in itself, provide a <em>factual </em>basis for crediting the report of an unnamed informant.\u201d 403 U. S. at 579. The informant in <em>Harris </em>had no \u201ctrack record\u201d of demonstrated past \u201cveracity\u201d. In issue were the alternative means by which his \u201cveracity\u201d might be established. The debate in <em>Harris </em>was not over the fundamental question of whether an informant\u2019s \u201cveracity\u201d must be established, but only over the subsidiary question of the means by which it could be shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">The <em>Harris </em>plurality set out to bolster the first-time informant\u2019s \u201cveracity\u201d by showing two items of independent corroboration and by showing that the \u201ctip\u201d was a declaration against penal interest.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The only peripheral collision between <em>Harris </em>and <em>Spinelli </em>was over the legitimacy of considering the suspect\u2019s reputation with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>police as one of the corroborative factors.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The other corroborative item \u2014 that a constable \u201clocated a sizeable stash of illicit whiskey in an abandoned house under Harris\u2019 control\u201d at some time within the past four years \u2014 would have been credible under <em>Spinelli, </em>with only its weight in issue, fluctuating presumably with the freshness or staleness of that earlier encounter. The quarrel between the Burger plurality opinion and the Harlan dissent over declarations against penal interest was over a point not considered by or involved in either <em>Aguilar </em>or Spinelli.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>Thus, even though <em>Harris </em>may have used the words \u201csubstantial basis,\u201d we read those words \u2014 dealing as they do, in the full context of the case, with two corroborative items and a declaration against penal interest as providing \u201ca substantial basis for crediting\u201d the informant\u2019s report \u2014 not as devising some new and alternative test to <em>Aguilar-Spinelli </em>but simply as describing an operating procedure within the framework of Aguilar<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and Spinelli.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">The cases themselves are reconciled and rumors of their estrangement, ill-founded. There is simply no \u201csubstantial-basis-for-crediting\u201d or \u201ctotality-of-circumstances\u201d alternative test.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Those who posit a looser approach offer not an alternative analysis but only a flight from analysis. One standard still prevails for the evaluation of hearsay information in a probable cause setting.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We will now proceed to an examination of the State\u2019s argument against that traditional standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>\n<em>The Distinct Therapeutic Devices of Spinelli</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">The State urges that the independent police observations bolster, under Spinelli, the initially inadequate satisfaction of <em>Aguilar\u2019s </em>\u201cbasis of knowledge\u201d prong. Anything less than a scrutinous reading of <em>Spinelli </em>encourages such a position. The confusion and the misreading are, moreover, understandable. A word is in order as to where and why analysis so frequently goes awry.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">The \u201ctwo-pronged test\u201d of <em>Aguilar </em>put the State to the task of answering satisfactorily two very separate questions for two very separate purposes. <em>Spinelli </em>devised (or at least enunciated) substitute means for satisfying those demands where the direct initial efforts had proved unsuccessful. <em>Aguilar </em>listed two distinct structural flaws that might inhere in hearsay-based probable cause; <em>Spinelli </em>designed two distinct buttressing techniques to shore up the hearsay against those flaws. Chaotically, however, the national case law is now replete with the undifferentiated application of either <em>Spinelli </em>remedy to either <em>Aguilar </em>defect. The analysis has not been clean.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">With two very differing ailments \u2014 faulty narration and faulty perception \u2014 in our pathology, and two very differing remedies \u2014 truth serum and bifocal lenses \u2014 in our pharmacopoeia, we need above all to be discriminating. The State has, in our judgment, indiscriminately prescribed \u201cCure A\u201d for \u201cDisease B\u201d \u2014 truth serum for an informant whose integrity is in good health but who desperately needs bifocal lenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-9\">\n<em>Impediments to Clean Analysis:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b543-10\">\n<em>Mistaken Identity Based on Surface Resemblance</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b543-11\">As the two cases \u2014 <em>Aguilar </em>and <em>Spinelli </em>\u2014 interact upon one another, the confusion stems from both ends. At the prescribing end, the root of difficulty is that the functionally distinct remedies of <em>Spinelli </em>involve, largely by coincidence, two surface similarities: both speak of \u201cdetail\u201d (although one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>speaks of independent police observations verifying a number of \u201cdetails,\u201d while the other speaks of the story told by the informant himself being \u201cin great detail,\u201d to wit, \u201cself-verifying detail\u201d); additionally, both refer to <em>Draper </em>as an illustrative \u201cbenchmark\u201d (they refer, of course, to different aspects of <em>Draper: </em>one, to the observations made by the FBI and the other, to the story told by the informant in the first instance). Because of the surface resemblances, a less than careful reading of <em>Spinelli </em>results in a hopeless intermingling of these remedies and makes confusion inevitable.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">\n<em>Impediments to Clean Analysis:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">\n<em>The Unreliability of \u201cReliability\"</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">The source of confusion at the diagnostic end, on the other hand, is not inherent in the <em>Aguilar </em>opinion itself but results from the careless linguistic habits of the opinions which refer to <em>Aguilar </em>\u2014 from what Justice Frankfurter referred to as \u201cthe use of language not with fastidious precision.\u201d <footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The fault lies in the indiscriminate overuse of the adjective \u201creliable\u201d and its variant forms.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\"><em>Aguilar </em>was concerned with the ultimate trustworthiness of hearsay information. All hearsay was not to be rejected out of hand; neither was all hearsay to be uncritically accepted; some guidelines had to be devised to separate the wheat from the chaff. <em>Aguilar </em>sought first to ascertain the actual source of the incriminating information. The \u201cbasis of knowledge\u201d prong was designed to locate that source and to examine the validity of his conclusion. It was not concerned with the integrity of the informant (that test would come later via the other prong) but only with his ratiocinative process \u2014 not with the honesty of his narration but with the nature of his perception: (How did he reach <em>his </em>conclusion? Did he see something or hear something firsthand or did he merely pass on a story or rumor from someone else? Or did he simply jump to a wrong conclusion on the basis of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>inadequate or ambiguous observations?) The simple thrust of the \u201cbasis of knowledge\u201d prong was that the informant must not pass on his conclusion, let alone the conclusion of someone else, but must furnish the raw data of his senses, so that the reviewing judge could draw his own conclusion from that data.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">Once having located the original source \u2014 the person who saw, heard or smelled something firsthand \u2014 then and only then did <em>Aguilar </em>look to the \u201cveracity\u201d of that source. As a substitute for the classic trustworthiness device of the oath, it sought some alternative guarantee that the declarant spoke truthfully. It sought \u201csome of the underlying circumstances from which the officer concluded that his informant was \u2018credible,\u2019 or his information \u2018reliable\u2019.\u201d The \u201cveracity\u201d prong, in precise terms, has two disjunctive spurs, seeking <em>either </em>a) the inherent \u201ccredibility\u201d of the person himself <em>or </em>b) some other circumstances reasonably assuring the \u201creliability\u201d <footnotemark>15</footnotemark> of the information on the particular occasion of its being furnished.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">In outline form, <em>Aguilar </em>was concerned with:</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">The <em>Trustworthiness </em>of Hearsay</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ARA\">I.

The case law is strewn with the random employment of the word \u201creliability\u201d to connote the overall subject of the outline itself and every one of its constituent parts.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> There is frequently no consistency in usage within a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>single opinion, let alone between opinions and between courts. As a result, to use one opinion\u2019s \u201creliability\u201d analysis as authority to solve another case\u2019s \u201creliability\u201d problem is all too often to compare apples with oranges. We should never use a portmanteau word unless we are careful to designate which of its various connotations we have in mind on a particular occasion. When the case law speaks of \u201creliability,\u201d does it refer to: RELIABILITY SUB 1 (\u201cIs the hearsay information as a whole ultimately \u2018reliable\u2019 and, therefore, acceptable?\u201d); RELIABILITY SUB 2 (\u201cWas the information gathered in a \u2018reliable\u2019 way?\u201d); RELIABILITY SUB 3 (\u201cDoes the hearsay stem from a \u2018reliable\u2019 source?\u201d); RELIABILITY SUB 4 (\u201cHas past performance shown the informant to be a \u2018reliable\u2019 person?\u201d); RELIABILITY SUB 5 (\u201cDo the circumstances under which the information was furnished otherwise guarantee it to be \u2018reliable\u2019?\u201d).

Incredibly, they sometimes lift the \u201ceither-or\u201d language describing an internal operation within the \u201cveracity\u201d prong and misapply it to the external relationship between the two prongs. Having once made that inadvertent transfer, they then conclude erroneously that the two requirements of the \u201ctwo-pronged test\u201d are in the disjunctive rather than the conjunctive and that it suffices, under <em>Aguilar, </em>to show <em>either </em>\u201cveracity\u201d <em>or </em>\u201cbasis of knowledge.\u201d <footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">The mistake is facilitated by the treacherously inadvertent reference to the \u201cbasis of knowledge\u201d prong as that prong which seeks to ascertain \u201cwhether the information was gathered in a reliable p] way\u201d \u2014 sometimes informally abbreviated as <em>informational reliability. </em>It is all too easy to misidentify that \u201cbasis of knowledge\u201d prong, when it is thus traveling under its informal label, with the second spur of the \u201cveracity\u201d prong, which seeks to know whether the informant\u2019s \u201cinformation is reliable p] \u201d \u2014 also sometimes informally abbreviated as <em>informational reliability. </em>When both dualities end up containing a linguistically identical (though functionally distinct) term, the mistaken identity of one for the other is almost guaranteed. If we can\u2019t keep our terms straight, we can\u2019t keep our thoughts straight.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">The quintessential difficulty lies, in the last analysis, not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>with <em>Aguilar </em>and <em>Spinelli </em>as opinions,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> but with the elusive nature of the hearsay problem itself \u2014 How does a judge fulfill his constitutional obligation to test a non-appearing and non-swearing declarant? As long as we are properly committed to accept some, but not all, hearsay to establish probable cause, <em>Aguilar </em>and <em>Spinelli </em>are well-honed instruments for sorting the trustworthy from the untrustworthy. The built-in subtleties are such, however, that a slipshod application calls down upon us the fury of Murphy\u2019s Law.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">\n<em>The Present Case:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">\n<em>The Primary Function of Independent Observations</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">With a \u201cweather eye\u201d then to the linguistic and analytical snares, we look to the State\u2019s suggested cure in terms of the hearsay\u2019s perhaps fatal infirmity.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">The State urges, inter alia, the utility of independent police observations. We reject the notion that the independent observations can serve them in any fashion in the case at bar. Such observations serve two purposes. They have a primary function, of course, bearing directly on the establishment of probable cause. When such observations are sufficient in themselves to demonstrate probable cause, the final problem is thereby solved and all information both from and about the informant becomes a redundancy; probable cause is established without necessary resort to the hearsay. Similarly, direct observations, insufficient unto themselves to establish probable cause, may nevertheless be added to trustworthy hearsay, which meets Aguilar\u2019s standards but is also insufficient unto itself, so that the combination of incriminatory elements may establish the probable cause which neither alone quite demonstrates. In that primary capacity, independent observation is an element contributing directly to the ultimate totality. This is the basic function of data observed by the affiant himself. In that primary role, police observation parallels qualified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>hearsay and represents an independent factor tending in the same ultimate direction. It is added to the hearsay but does not influence the qualifying of the hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">It is not that primary function which concerns us here, however. The direct observations at bar, standing alone, were innocuous and did not remotely approach a showing of probable cause. Nor may their contribution to that showing in a direct but supplementary fashion have any significance, unless and until the hearsay itself qualifies as an element eligible for supplementation. We are concerned here rather with the subsidiary and ancillary function of direct police observations \u2014 the qualifying influence they may have on otherwise questionable hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">\n<em>The Ancillary Function of Independent Observations</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">That direct observations may have a qualifying influence upon questionable hearsay is both the teaching of <em>Spinelli </em>and the ineluctable dictate of plain logic. That influence bears, furthermore, directly on the issue of \u201cveracity.\u201d When the internal recitation of \u201csome of the underlying circumstances which led the officer to conclude that his informant was \u2018credible\u2019 or his information \u2018reliable\u2019 \u201d has not been sufficient to satisfy <em>Aguilar\u2019s </em>\u201cveracity\u201d prong directly, then this buttressing technique enunciated by <em>Spinelli </em>comes into play to determine whether it can \u201cfairly be said that the tip, even when certain parts of it have been corroborated by independent sources, is as trustworthy as a tip which would pass <em>Aguilar\u2019s </em>tests without independent corroboration.\u201d <em>Spinelli, </em>at 393 U. S. 415.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">The relevance of this particular remedy to this particular defect is clear. When independent police observations have verified part of the story told by an informant, that corroboration lends credence to the remaining unverified portion of the story by demonstrating that the informant has, to the extent tested, spoken truly. <em>Hignut v. State, </em>17 Md. App. 399, 411, 303 A. 2d 173. The verification helps to demonstrate his \u201ccredibility.\u201d Present good performance shows him to be probably \u201ccredible\u201d just as surely as does past good performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>In the instant case, however, the informant\u2019s \u201cveracity\u201d needed no additional buttressing. It had already passed muster by the initial <em>Aguilarian </em>analysis. The verification was, therefore, superfluous. Contrary to the suggestion of the State, the dual requirements represented by the \u201ctwo-pronged test\u201d are \u201canalytically severable\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> and an \u201coverkill\u201d on one prong will not carry over to make up for a deficit on the other prong.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">In the case at bar, it was Aguilar\u2019s \u201cbasis of knowledge\u201d prong which the testimony of Detective Oatman failed to satisfy. The inappropriateness of the \u201cindependent verification\u201d curative technique to that defect is self-evident from the very nature of the test itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">\n<em>The Nature of the \u201cBasis of Knowledge\u201d Test</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">The \u201cbasis of knowledge\u201d test is not concerned one whit with an informant\u2019s honesty or \u201cveracity.\u201d It is concerned, rather, with conclusionary validity. Even assuming \u201ccredibility\u201d amounting to sainthood, the judge still may not accept the bare conclusion of that \u201ccredible\u201d informant anymore than he may accept the bare conclusion of a sworn and known and trusted police-affiant.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> <em>Nathanson v. United States, </em>290 U. S. 41, 54 S. Ct. 11, 78 L. Ed. 159 (1933); <em>Giordenello v. United States, </em>357 U. S. 480, 78 S. Ct. 1245, 2 L.Ed.2d 1503 (1958). To do so would be an unconstitutional delegation of the decision-making function which the Fourth Amendment lodges exclusively in the judge himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>The \u201cbasis of knowledge\u201d prong assumes an informant\u2019s \u201cveracity,\u201d and then proceeds to probe and test his conclusion: (\u201cWhat are the raw facts upon which the informant based <em>his </em>conclusion?\u201d \u201cHow did the informant obtain those facts?\u201d \u201cWhat precisely did he see or hear or smell or touch firsthand?\u201d \u201cIf he heard the facts from someone else, what makes that third person \u2018credible\u2019 and how did that third person come by the knowledge?\u201d). The judge must ascertain the source for the raw data \u2014 the product of someone\u2019s senses \u2014 and then weigh that data for himself. He is concerned not with that part of an affidavit or testimony which provides information <em>about </em>the informant but with the recitation of the story coming <em>from </em>the informant.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">\n<em>The Non-Transferability of Spinelli\u2019s Remedies</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">Apparently not being willing to rely exclusively upon the curative technique of \u201cself-verifying detail,\u201d the State tenders, as an alternative or additional remedy, the curative technique of \u201cindependent verification.\u201d The tender is unacceptable. Each remedy is appropriate only to the particular infirmity for which it was uniquely devised. They are simply not transferable.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">On the one hand, the \u201cindependent verification\u201d technique cannot repair a defect in the \u201cbasis of knowledge\u201d prong. Verifying the truth of part of a story does nothing either to ascertain the story\u2019s source or to check the informant\u2019s perhaps invalid conclusions. To the extent to which police observations, in their primary function, duplicate parts of an informant\u2019s tale, they do, to be sure, make those parts redundant. To the extent to which the unverified portion remains an indispensable element, however, it has to present data from an ascertainable source. We simply do not verify the \u201ccredibility\u201d of the vague unknown.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">An informant who does not speak from personal knowledge may well be passing on an amalgam of underworld rumor and barroom gossip. If that be true, the verification of one contributing rumor would do nothing for the \u201cveracity\u201d of other contributing rumors. An informant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>may have made, moreover, innocent observations and then received incriminating information from a third party lending inculpatory color to those observations. Merely verifying the informant\u2019s innocuous observations does nothing to verify the crucial third party who supplied the damning catalyst.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">An informant may, furthermore, be leaping to an erroneous conclusion on the basis of innocent or ambiguous observations. Independent verification of an ambiguous factual premise cannot allow an informant to draw an invalid conclusion therefrom. The full premises must be set forth from which the judge may construct his own ultimate syllogism. Even a \u201ccredible\u201d informant may engage in bizarre flights of logic, which is precisely why the judge must know just what the informant saw and heard and must not buy an informant\u2019s bare conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">Partial verification of an unattributed tale does not, by its very nature, pinpoint the source or sources of the tale, nor does it certify the validity of the possible conclusions interwoven therein. \u201cBasis of knowledge\u201d still requires, explicitly or implicitly, an ascertainable source for each item of raw, primary data. Partial verification does not serve to provide that.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The remedy has no bearing on the problem. The Comment, <em>The Informer\u2019s Tip as Probable Cause for Search or Arrest, </em>54 Cornell L. Rev. 958 (1969), is instructive, at 963, n. 30:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-7\">\u201c[Cjorroboration should not be considered in applying this [the \u201cbasis of knowledge\u201d] test. Independent corroboration of some of the facts alleged by the informer may indicate truthfulness; i.e., that the tip is not completely fabricated, but does not suggest that the informer\u2019s knowledge was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>obtained through personal observation or other dependable manner.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">Conversely, the \u201cself-verifying detail\u201d technique cannot repair a defect in the \u201cveracity\u201d prong. The notion that great detail implies personal observation rather than the overhearing of barroom gossip, presupposes an honest informant. If the informant were concocting a story out of the whole cloth, he could fabricate in fine detail as easily as with rough brush strokes. Minute detail tells us nothing about \u201cveracity.\u201d As was observed in Note, <em>Probable Cause and the First-Time Informer, </em>43 Colo. L. Rev. 357 (1972), at 362:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-7\">\u201cUncorroborated detail of any amount hardly supports an inference that the informer is trustworthy, for even a wealth of detail is easily fabricated. For this reason, detail of this sort goes only to the first test of <em>Aguilar, </em>the basis test.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">\n<em>The Cure for Defective \u201cBasis of Knowledge\u201d:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AFH\">\n<em>\u201cSelf-Verifying Detail\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b553-9\">Having established that the remedies of <em>Spinelli </em>are nontransfcrable and having rejected the independent police verification proffered by the State to repair the defect in Aguilar\u2019s \u201cbasis of knowledge\u201d prong because the very technique has no relevance whatsoever to that defect, we do not necessarily hold that probable cause has not been established. Having rejected the false remedy, we proceed to analyze the effect on the infirmity at bar of the proper remedy \u2014 the \u201cself-verifying detail\u201d technique described in <em>Spinelli.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b553-10\">When that recitation coming <em>from </em>the informant is defective \u2014 when it fails to assert that the informant is recounting firsthand observations \u2014 then the curative technique suggested by <em>Spinelli </em>is that of \u201cself-verifying detail.\u201d In taking <em>Draper </em>as an illustrative benchmark for this technique, <em>Spinelli </em>pointedly referred only to that aspect of <em>Draper </em>\u201cdetailing\u201d the story coming <em>from </em>the informant. The independent verifications made by the police in <em>Draper </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>were not considered in this context and were, indeed, irrelevant to the point to be proved. <em>Spinelli </em>described the logical inference at work, at 393 U. S. 416-417:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-5\">\u201cIn the absence of a statement detailing the manner in which the information was gathered, it is especially important that the tip describe the accused\u2019s criminal activity in sufficient detail that the magistrate may know that he is relying on something more substantial than a casual rumor circulating in the underworld or an accusation based merely on an individual\u2019s general reputation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-6\">The detail provided by the informant in <em>Draper v. United States .. . </em>provides a suitable benchmark. While Hereford, the Government\u2019s informer in that case, did not state the way in which he had obtained his information, he reported that Draper had gone to Chicago the day before by train and that he would return to Denver by train with three ounces of heroin on one of two specified mornings. Moreover, Hereford went to describe, with minute particularity, the clothes that Draper would be wearing upon his arrival at the Denver station. A magistrate, when confronted with such detail, could reasonably infer that the informant had gained his information in a reliable way.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">Justice White, in his concurring opinion in <em>Spinelli, </em>added the fifth and necessary vote to make \u201cself-verifying detail\u201d the \u201claw of the land,\u201d reiterating as he did so the point that it is only the \u201cdetail\u201d contained within the informant\u2019s story which gives rise to the inference, at 393 U. S. 425:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-8\">\u201cI am inclined to agree with the majority that there are limited special circumstances in which an \u2018honest\u2019 informant\u2019s report, if sufficiently detailed, will in effect verify itself \u2014 that is, the magistrate when confronted with such detail could reasonably infer that the informant had gained his information in a reliable way. . .. Detailed information may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>sometimes imply that the informant himself has observed the facts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">Within that analytical framework, we note that the quantity of information furnished by the informant is borderline. The question is a close one. It would have been preferable for Detective Oatman to have demanded more detail from his informant and, in turn, to have passed on more detail to the trial court. Using <em>Draper </em>and our own decision in <em>Owings v. State, </em>8 Md. App. 572, 261 A. 2d 223, as \u201cbenchmarks,\u201d however, we conclude that the detail coming <em>from </em>the informant in this case was enough, though just barely so, to provide a reasonable assurance that he was speaking from firsthand observation.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">Under the \u201cself-verifying detail\u201d technique of <em>Spinelli, </em>using the appropriate portion of <em>Draper </em>as its guideline, the initially inadequate satisfaction of <em>Aguilar\u2019s </em>\u201cbasis of knowledge\u201d prong in the case at bar is repaired.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">\n<em>Disclosure of the Informant\u2019s Identity</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">The appellant also contends that the trial judge committed error in permitting the State to withhold the identity of the informant. The law is clear that where an informant simply furnishes probable cause and is not a participant in the criminal transaction, the State is not required to divulge his identity. The critical question, in determining when disclosure is required, is whether the informant was \u201can integral part of the illegal transaction\u201d and, therefore, \u201cnecessary and relevant to a fair defense.\u201d <em>McCray v. Illinois, supra; Nutter v. State, </em>8 Md. App. 635, 262 A. 2d 80; <em>Whittington v. State, </em>8 Md. App. 676, 262 A. 2d 75; <em>Gill v. State, </em>11 Md. App. 593, 275 A. 2d 505. The appellant proceeds on the thesis, however, that the informant may have been Walter Holak and that that fact brings the case within the rule of <em>Roviaro v. United States, </em>353 U. S. 53, 77 S. Ct. 623, 1 L.Ed.2d 639 (1957). The rule of <em>Roviaro </em>is simply that a defendant is entitled to the name of a participant in the crime, because that participant is a material witness to the critical transaction. In the case at bar, the material witness was Walter Holak and the appellant was fully aware of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>identity. Whether he was or was not an informant in addition to being a material witness is beside the point. To the extent to which his testimony was necessary to the defense, his identity was fully known.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">\n<em>Permitting a Witness to Invoke the Fifth Amendment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">The appellant called Walter Holak as a defense witness. The judge asked the jury to retire before putting Mr. Holak on the stand. Judge MacDaniel then pointed out for the record that Holak\u2019s attorney had visited the judge in chambers that morning and had informed him that, after full discussion between the attorney and Holak, it was their mutual decision that Holak would refuse to give testimony on the ground that it might tend to incriminate him. After that recital, Judge MacDaniel asked Holak if it was still his intention to invoke the Fifth Amendment privilege against compulsory self-incrimination. Holak answered that it was. Counsel for the appellant pointed out that all questions would be restricted to the events of July 3, 1972, the day on which Holak and the appellant were arrested. Holak reiterated his firm resolve to invoke the privilege as to all questions concerning the activities of that day. Judge MacDaniel ruled that Holak was not a compellable witness and excused him. He thereafter informed the jury that Holak had been called by the defense but had invoked the privilege against self-incrimination and would not, therefore, testify in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">We see nothing improper in the actions of the court and nothing that offends the guidelines set out in <em>Midgett v. State, </em>223 Md. 282, 164 A. 2d 526, and <em>Royal v.

The <em>Draper </em>Court appeared to treat both factors as reasons for believing the informer reliable but showed no visible concern with a basis of knowledge test. Thus, <em>Draper </em>is arguably incompatible with <em>Aguilar, </em>but the <em>Draper </em>opinion is really too brief to indicate the Court\u2019s reasoning. In <em>Spmelli, </em>both Justices Harlan and White believed the <em>Draper </em>tip contained self-verifying detail sufficient to infer an adequate basis of knowledge. Thus, under <em>Spmelli, </em>the <em>Draper </em>decision is sound as applied to its facts.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b539-6\">. The analysis of the case in Comment, <em>The Informer\u2019s Tip as Probable Cause for Search or Arrest, </em>54 Cornell L. Rev. 958 (1969), is instructive, at 961:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-7\">\u201cThe opinion indicates that the affidavit, viewed realistically, passed each of the <em>Aguilar </em>tests. Since IRS investigators are presumed to be truthful, a statement that information came from IRS investigators satisfies the reliability test. The basis of knowledge test is met because at least some of the information was stated to be derived from the observations of other investigators, and the smell of mash and sounds of a motor were explicitly stated to be personal observations of investigators.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b539-8\">. But see <em>Baker, Whitfield &amp; Wilson v. State, </em>15 Md. App. 73, 77-78 and 82-83, 289 A. 2d 348, and particularly the words of Chief Judge Orth at 15 Md.

State, supra, </em>at 14 Md. App. 24-25, n. 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b540-12\">. One possibly profitable alternative rationale was strangely not explored. It would appear that the informant in <em>Harris, </em>although having broken the law by buying untaxed whiskey, was not a regular or typical police informer \u201cfrom the criminal milieu.\u201d He might have been deemed \u2014as a mere customer \u2014 at least part-way along the road toward the cleaner and inherently less suspect category, of \u201ccitizen-informer.\u201d See <em>People v. Glaubman, </em>485 P. 2d 711. (Colorado, 1971).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b541-5\">. The two cases could be distinguished as <em>Harris </em>tried to do. The reputation discounted by <em>Spinelli </em>was that of the suspect being \u201ca known gambler,\u201d with no basis given for that assertion. In <em>Hams, </em>the bad reputation in question arguably took on more substance from the fact that it had persisted for \u201cfour years\u201d and sprang, furthermore, from rural soil rather than from the faceless anonymity of an urban swarm. The affiant further buttressed the reputation in question with \u201cnumerous information from all types of persons as to his activities\u201d as well as recounting that a \u201csizeable stash\u201d of contraband had been recovered on an earlier occasion from the suspect premises by a fellow constable. The distinction between the bald and unilluminating statement as to reputation, on the one hand, and the better substantiated reputation, on the other hand, may be valid, in which case even the peripheral conflict between <em>Harris </em>and <em>Spinelli </em>disappears. The Harlan quarrel, in dissent, with the Burger plurality, was not so much with the relevance of a criminal reputation, as such, but rather with the loose and questionable means of establishing that reputation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b541-6\">. Even here, the difference between the two positions may well be more apparent than real. The Harlan dissent did not so much quarrel with the general proposition that a genuine declaration against penal interest would' be some guarantee of trustworthiness, but only with the application of that principle to the typical paid and protected police \u201cstool pigeon,\u201d whom the courts have always treated with a healthy skepticism as inherently suspect. The Burger position, on the other hand, does not necessarily espouse the application of the general principle in the indiscriminate fashion condemned by Harlan, since the only informant under examination in <em>Harris </em>would not seem to have been, as a customer for bootleg whiskey, a typical police \u201cstool pigeon.\u201d The quarrel may well, therefore, not be over the general principle itself but simply over the factual question of which tips furnished by which informants under which circumstances are, in truth, genuine declarations against penal interest. See McCormack, <em>The Law of Evidence, </em>\u00a7 256 (1954). The literal holding of even the plurality opinion, therefore, is not nearly as frightening or as inconsonant with earlier decisions as is the unnecessarily broad language of Chief Justice Burger.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">The fallacious doctrine which some now read into this section of the <em>Harris </em>opinion would put a premium on informants \u201cfrom the underworld milieu\u201d and would treat them as more credible than the disinterested \u201ccitizen-informers\u201d. Maryland has firmly rejected such an absurdity in the sound analysis of Chief Judge Murphy in <em>Mobley v. State, supra, </em>at 270 Md. 76:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-8\">\u201cWe are in full agreement . . . that a different rationale exists for establishing the reliability of citizen-informers than for establishing that of the more suspect and anonymous police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>informer; and \u2018that the strictures of <em>Aguilar v. Texas ... </em>and <em>Spinelli v. United States ... </em>are aimed primarily at unnamed police \u2018informers\u2019 rather than at that broad class of secondary sources who are the victims of crime, the disinterested witnesses of crime, other disinterested civilian sources of information or other law enforcement officers.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b542-7\">. The \u201csubstantial basis for crediting\u201d language came, of course, from <em>Jones. Harris </em>took pains to point out, \u201cSignificantly, the Court in <em>Aguilar </em>cited with approval the affidavit upheld in <em>Jones. </em>\u201d 403 U. S. at 578. Even <em>Harris </em>does not consider <em>Aguilar </em>and <em>Jones </em>to be traveling separate routes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b542-8\">. Realistically, the quarrel that even the \u201clooser alternative\u201d advocates have with <em>Spinelli </em>seems to be not with the analytical framework of <em>Spinelli </em>as such but only with the application of that analysis to its own facts. Conversely, the defenders of the <em>Spinelli </em>analysis, as an efficient gauge, could well differ with the Supreme Court\u2019s verdict, as constitutional fact finders, that the police observations in the <em>Spinelli </em>case were inadequate to verify the informant\u2019s \u201cveracity\u201d. One could easily reach an opposite verdict on the facts of <em>Spinelli </em>without wishing to alter one whit its analytical framework.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b542-9\">. Though some lament <em>Aguilar-Spinelli </em>as \u201cconfusing,\u201d we must note that it is far less confusing to have one test in the field than to suffer two conflicting and inconsistent tests operating simultaneously. The complexity, <em>moreover, </em>stems not from the cases themselves but from the inherent, immemorial difficulty of the hearsay concept itself.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b542-10\">.
