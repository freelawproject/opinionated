LOHSS and DONALD M. SPRENKLE were jointly indicted, charged with violations of the controlled dangerous substances law. The indictment was dismissed as to each of them prior to trial on the merits because the State could not prove the charges presented without evidence which was excluded upon grant by the court below of motions to suppress property obtained by a search and seizure found to have been unlawful. The order dismissing the indictment as to Lohss was issued by Evans, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>J. on 20 March 1973 upon written motion of Lohss. In the record is a pencil notation on a pad-size sheet of paper bearing the printed name of Judge Evans: \u201cMr. Anders [Assistant State\u2019s Attorney] concedes; no objection to order.\u201d The order dismissing the indictment as to Sprenkle was issued by Wray, J. on 27 June 1973 upon written motion of the State. Judge Wray noted on the motion on that date: \u201cI have earlier talked with Mr. Bloom [defense counsel]. He has no objection to grant of Motion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">In Maryland appellate jurisdiction is at the largess of the General Assembly. A state is not required by the federal constitution to provide the right of appellate review. <em>Griffin v. Illinois, </em>351 U. S. 12, 18; <em>Harris v. State, </em>6 Md. App. 7, 17.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Constitution of Maryland, however, established a Court of Appeals; by amendment it permits the statutory creation of intermediate courts of appeal and their appellate jurisdiction. Constitution of Maryland, Art. IV, \u00a7\u00a714 and 14 A. By virtue of this authority the General Assembly created the Court of Special Appeals, Code, Art. 26, \u00a7 130, and from time to time has allocated jurisdiction between the two appellate courts. See Code, Art. 5, \u00a7\u00a7 5 A-5 D.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">By Acts 1957, Ch. 399, \u00a7 4, the General Assembly repealed Art. 5 of the Code, entitled \u201cAppeals and Errors\u201d and enacted a new Art. 5 in lieu thereof, entitled \u201cAppeals\u201d. In \u00a7 14 of the new Article 5 it prescribed the right of appeal by the State. Section 14, as amended by Acts 1966, Ch. 12, \u00a7 l,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-8\">\u201cThe State may appeal to the Court of Special Appeals from a final order or judgment granting a motion to dismiss, or quashing or dismissing any indictment, information, presentment or inquisi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>tion in a criminal action, but the State shall have no right of appeal in any criminal action where the defendant has been tried and acquitted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">We have declared that the statute means precisely what it says. <em>State v. Simms, </em>13 Md. App. 203, 205, citing <em>State v. Hunter, </em>10 Md. App. 300. What it says, loud and clear, is that the State is given the right to initiate and perfect, and the Court of Special Appeals is given jurisdiction over, an appeal from a final order or judgment granting a motion to dismiss or dismissing an indictment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The plain legislative intent is that the State may appeal to this Court from the dismissal of an indictment irrespective of the reasons motivating such dismissal, the only limitation being where the accused has been tried and acquitted. So, in <em>Hunter, </em>at 307, we found \u201c* * * no intention on the part of the Legislature to restrict the State\u2019s right of appeal to cases where the dismissal was based on the legal insufficiency of the indictment.\u201d Recognition of this view is manifest in the appeals entertained by the Court of Appeals and this Court. Orders have been reviewed which dismissed indictments on the grounds of denial of a speedy trial,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> violation of the guarantee against double jeopardy,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> lack of prosecution,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and failure to provide a preliminary hearing.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We see nothing in the unambiguous language of the statute to indicate that the Legislature intended to exclude from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>right of the State to appeal from any order dismissing an indictment, an order in which the dismissal was predicated upon the grant of a motion to suppress evidence. On the contrary, we have, in the past, accepted that we have jurisdiction to hear such appeals and entertained them. See, for example, <em>State v. Graziano, </em>17 Md. App. 276; <em>State v. Lee, </em>16 Md. App. 296; <em>State v. Siegel, </em>13 Md. App. 444; <em>State v. Swales, </em>12 Md. App. 69.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">We do not think that the jurisdiction of this Court is affected by who initiates the order of dismissal. The statute does not limit the State\u2019s right to appeal to dismissals of indictments not at its instance. The dismissal is at the sound discretion of the trial court, and whether the dismissal is suggested or proposed or urged or formally moved by the accused or by the State, or is accomplished by the <em>sua sponte </em>action of the court is not material to our jurisdiction or to the State\u2019s right to appeal. As we have indicated, the statute flatly gives the State the right to appeal \u201cfrom a final order or judgment granting a motion to dismiss, or quashing or dismissing any indictment\u201d, the <em>only </em>exception being where \u201cthe defendant has been tried and acquitted.\u201d We adhere to our expressed belief that the statute means precisely what it says.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">We hold that the appeals here are within our jurisdiction.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b514-8\">The general rule is firmly established that appeals from interlocutory orders of the trial court in a criminal case are not allowed, the principle being that they are premature until after final judgment. Code, Art. 5, \u00a7 12; Rule 1035; <em>Raimondi v. State, </em>8 Md. App. 468, 470. See <em>Powers v. State, </em>8 Md. App. 487; <em>Davis v. State, </em>8 Md. App. 480; <em>Dodson v. State, </em>8 Md. App. 478; <em>Pearce v. State, </em>8 Md. App. 477. Compare <em>Westmoreland v. State, </em>8 Md. App. 482; <em>Brown v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number><em>State, </em>2 Md. App. 388. The grant of a motion to suppress evidence, standing alone, is an interlocutory order and not appealable. <em>State v. Mather, </em>7 Md. App. 549.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> But when a final judgment is attained by the dismissal of the indictment, the propriety of the motion to suppress is open to review by this Court upon appeal of the dismissal cf the indictment by the State. Rule 1087 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-6\">\u201cOn an appeal from a final judgment, every interlocutory order which has previously been entered in the action shall be open to review by this Court unless an appeal has theretofore been taken from such interlocutory order and has been decided on the merits by this Court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">We hold that the order of the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County entered 27 February 1973 granting the motion by Lohss and the motion by Sprenkle to suppress evidence claimed to have been obtained by an unlawful search and seizure is open to review by this Court, upon dismissal of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">We are not persuaded to the contrary by the argument of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>appellees that the State is accomplishing through the dismissal of the indictment an appellate review of the motion to suppress otherwise not available to it. We have found that such review in the circumstances is authorized by-statute, rule and judicial decision.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> It is true that the Court of Appeals and this Court have said that if the denial of a motion to suppress evidence is to be appealable, it must be granted by the Legislature. <em>State v. </em>Adams, 196 Md. 341, 351; <em>State v. </em>Barshack, 197 Md. 543, 545; <em>State v. Mather, supra, </em>at 554. But the statement was made in the frame of reference of an appeal from an interlocutory order standing alone.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Although the Legislature has not responded by bestowing the right of appeal to an interlocutory order, standing alone, which grants a motion to suppress the evidence, it has evidenced its satisfaction with the present status of the law, permitting review of the interlocutory order after final judgment, by not changing it.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">A motion to suppress evidence on the ground that it was obtained by an unlawful search and seizure was filed by Sprenkle on 18 December 1972 and by Lohss on 13 January 1973. Rule 729 b 1. A plenary hearing on the consolidated motions was had on 18 January. Rule 729 d l.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> They were granted by order entered 27 February.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">At the hearing testimony was received from Sprenkle, Lohss, Robert D. Housley, the City Manager for Texas International Airlines in Austin, Texas, employed by the company for eleven years, and two police officers, Corporal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>Warren Pitt and Trooper Wayne A. Peret of the Maryland State Police, Narcotics Section. The events leading to the seizure of the challenged evidence was undisputed in substantial part. On 31 August 1972 Sprenkle booked passage on a chartered plane from Robert Mueller Airport in Austin, Texas to Dallas, Texas. He checked his baggage, consisting of three suitcases, two large and one small, about 5:35 p.m. central standard time through to his ultimate destination, Friendship International Airport in Maryland. Warren B. Hewgley, the Customer Service Agent for Texas International whose duties at times included assisting in loading and unloading the planes, while processing Sprenkle\u2019s baggage noticed a strong odor of marijuana. He reported to Housley. \u201cHe came to my office and said we have a suitcase out here that smells very much like marijuana and he asked me to smell his hands and * * * the smell was all over his hands. * * * He asked me to come out and inspect it.\u201d The suitcase was opened. It contained a plastic garbage type bag and the odor of marijuana was very strong. \u201c [T]he smell would knock you down.\u201d Housley had seen and smelled marijuana fifteen or twenty times before in the course of his work. \u201cI\u2019ve seen it in small plastic, I would estimate, around one pound bags, plastic, I\u2019ve seen it loose in the bag, I\u2019ve seen it in clothing, I\u2019ve seen it in milk cartons, I\u2019ve seen it rolled up in tin foil, kitchen wrap, I\u2019ve seen it wrapped up in newspapers.\u201d From these contacts with the substance and from public displays of it, (apparently for educational purposes), he was familiar not only with its appearance but its odor. The suitcase he examined had been checked by Sprenkle.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The Sheriff\u2019s office was called and the matter reported. By the time a deputy sheriff arrived, the plane, carrying Sprenkle and his baggage had left.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The deputy sheriff called the Department <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>of Public Safety in Austin and had them call a law enforcement agency in Dallas where Sprenkle would change to an American Airline plane to proceed to Maryland.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">About 7:50 p.m., eastern standard time, the Maryland State Police received a teletype from the Department of Public Safety, Austin, Texas. Peret picked up the teletype at 8:10 p.m. It read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-6\">\u201cTfflS OFFICE RECEIVED INFORMATION FROM BOB HOUSLEY WITH THE TEXAS INTERNATIONAL AIRLINES OFFICE IN AUSTIN, TEXAS THAT A PASSENGER GOING BY NAME OF D.

OFFICIALS IN DALLAS HAVE BEEN NOTIFIED AND THEY WILL ATTEMPT TO MARK THIS BAGGAGE WHILE IN TRANSIENT. ADVISE THIS OFFICE WHEN AND IF APPREHENSION IS MADE.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">Peret and Pitt, with whom he was working on the case, desired to talk to Housley. Unable to reach him they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>requested he call back. He did so at 9:00 p.m. It is clear from the testimony of Housley, Peret and Pitt that Housley recounted to the officers everything that had occurred.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">Peret, Pitt and other officers went to Friendship Airport. They were informed by American Airlines that \u201ca Sprenkle, D. Sprenkle boarded the plane on 31 August, he went from Austin to Dallas and he was on the flight from Dallas to Baltimore and the flight was running late.\u201d Shortly thereafter a second teletype was received from the Texas authorities:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-7\">\u201cREFER 3371 TXDPS000 8-31-72</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aa_\">IT HAS BEEN CONFIRMED THAT D.

The plane came in and Sprenkle debarked. Peret testified: \u201cHis description given in the teletype was perfect. * * * He matched the teletype except for the mirror glasses.\u201d Peret made a judicial identification of Sprenkle as the man who fit the description. Sprenkle met a man, subsequently determined to be Lohss, who was accompanied by a woman and a child. Sprenkle and Lohss went to the baggage area and awaited the baggage at a point where luggage \u201ccomes onto the conveyor belt.\u201d Lohss picked up a tan suitcase and a blue suitcase. Sprenkle picked up a small blue suitcase. They walked toward the exit. Peret accosted Sprenkle, identified himself as a police officer, and \u201cmade a quick check\u201d of the baggage claim number on the suitcase carried by Sprenkle. It matched the number, in the teletype. Peret arrested Sprenkle. Lohss \u201churried for the exit but was stopped by Corporal Pitt.\u201d Pitt testified that upon Sprenkle\u2019s apprehension Lohss \u201cproceeded to head in the direction of the exit in a very quick manner.\u201d He explained: \u201cWell, prior to the time of the identity of Trooper Peret and the approach of Trooper Suttle and myself and the other officers in the area they were walking at a normal rate. After Trooper Peret identified himself as a State Police officer where the majority of the people in the immediate area could hear that\u2019s when Mr. Lohss proceeded to walk in a very fast pace.\u201d Pitt approached Lohss, and observed that the baggage claim checks on the suitcases he was carrying were identical to the ones received on the teletype and from Housley. He arrested Lohss.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>The police seized the suitcases and took them and Sprenkle and Lohss to the airport police office, which apparently consisted of two small adjoining rooms. The suitcases were in one room and Sprenkle and Lohss in the other, but within \u201cvisual range\u201d of the suitcases through an open door. The suitcases were opened and the property found therein, which was subsequently the subject of the motions to suppress, was seized.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">The hearing judge in granting the motions to suppress the evidence, assumed, although noting some doubt, that the arrests were legal. He thought, however, that the police were required to obtain a warrant to search the suitcases. He said in an opinion filed 27 February 1973: \u201cIt is elementary that searches are constitutionally \u2018unreasonable\u2019 if done without a warrant if there is time to get a warrant. The only on-the-spot searches the United States Supreme Court has approved are those of vehicles [he noted: \u2018Aside from a search of the person for weapons or contraband.\u2019], this on the theory that they are self-propelled and unlikely to remain if time is taken to get a warrant. No such exigent circumstances appear here. The suitcases were in police custody and were not self-propelled. If the police were afraid that they contained weapons, they did not mention it in testimony, or explain how the Defendants would get to them.\u201d We do not see it that way.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">Even if Housley was without authority to open Sprenkle\u2019s suitcase, there was no violation of the Fourth Amendment guarantee against unreasonable searches thereby. \u201c [B]y <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>history, judicial rule and application, the exclusionary rule as to evidence seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment comes into play only when the evidence is obtained by governmental action.\u201d <em>Herbert v. </em>State, 10 Md. App. 279, 284. It is clear from the evidence that neither Housley nor the employee he supervised was associated with enforcement authorities in any way.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Therefore, there was no constitutional impediment in the manner in which Housley came by the information he imparted first to the local sheriff and later directly to the Maryland State Police.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">The ultimate determination of the reasonableness of the seizure of the challenged evidence rests upon- the probable cause for the warrantless arrest of Sprenkle and Lohss. A basis of that probable cause was the hearsay information from Housley. The two-pronged test of <em>Aguilar v. Texas, </em>378 U. S. 108 established constitutional guidelines for measuring hearsay information in a probable cause setting. \u201cThe \u2018basis of knowledge\u2019 prong requires of him who would act upon hearsay, a knowledge \u2018of some of the underlying circumstances\u2019 upon which the informant based his conclusion. The \u2018veracity\u2019 prong is in the alternative. It requires of him who would act upon the hearsay, a knowledge of \u2018some of the underlying circumstances\u2019 which leads to the conclusion that the informant is 1) \u2018credible or 2) his information reliable.\u2019\u201d <em>Thompson v. State, </em>16 Md. App. 560, 562.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">We have not the slightest difficulty in concluding that the requirements of <em>Aguilar\u2019s </em>two prong test were met. We said in <em>King and Mobley v. State, </em>16 Md. App. 546, 554-555:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-7\">\u201c [T]he strictures of <em>Aguilar v. Texas, </em>378 U. S. 108, and <em>Spinelli v. United States, </em>393 U. S. 410, \u2018are aimed primarily at unnamed police \u2018informers\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>rather than at that broad class of secondary sources who are the victims of crime, the disinterested witnesses of crime, other disinterested civilian sources of information or other law enforcement officers. The members of this broad class are generally, but not universally, named. They are not from the criminal milieu.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">The Court of Appeals quoted this statement with complete approval in affirming our decision in that case, <em>Mobley and King v. State, </em>270 Md. 76, declaring its full agreement with our view that a different rationale exists for establishing the reliability of citizen-informers than for establishing that of the more suspect and anonymous police informer. Housley was named. He fell into that broad class of secondary sources. We said in <em>Dawson v. State, </em>11 Md. App. 694, 699:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-6\">\u201cThe practical distinction is that in dealing with a named source, the very naming of the source and the relationship of the source to the observed information may go a long way (or even be sufficient unto itself), under the facts of a particular case, to establish the credibility of that source or the reliability of his information. <em>Kapler v. State, </em>194 Md. 580; <em>Ward v. State, </em>9 Md. App. 583, 591-592; <em>Grimm v. State, </em>6 Md. App. 321, 328. See also <em>Taylor v. State, </em>238 Md. 424; <em>Jones v. State, </em>242 Md. 95; <em>Knight v. State, </em>7 Md. App. 282.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-10\">See also cases cited in the concurring opinion of Moylan, J. in <em>Dawson v. State, </em>14 Md. App. 18, 34, n. 9. Housley based his conclusion that Sprenkle\u2019s baggage contained marijuana on his own personal observations backed by his past experience. All of this was made known to the arresting officers by him directly. The information the police team secured from Housley clearly gave them probable cause for the warrantless arrests.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Code, Art. 27, \u00a7 594 B (d) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>\u201cA police officer may arrest a person without a warrant if he has probable cause to believe:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-5\">(1) That an offense listed in subsection (e) of this section has been committed, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-6\">(2) That the person has committed such offense, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-7\">(3) That unless the person is immediately arrested,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-8\">(i) He may not be apprehended, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-9\">(ii) He may cause injury to the person or damage to the property of one or more other persons, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-10\">(iii) He may tamper with, dispose of, or destroy evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-11\">Subsection (e) (ix) designates \u201cSections 276 through 313 D (relating to drugs and other dangerous substances) as they shall be amended from time to time.\u201d See also Code, Art. 27, \u00a7 298 (e). In the circumstances here existent, the statute patently authorized the arrest of Sprenkle and of Lohss. And see <em>Draper v. United States, </em>358 U. S. 307, which we believe to be so factually comparable in substance as to be indistinguishable. We hold that the arrest of Sprenkle and the arrest of Lohss were legal.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-13\">The arrests being legal, a substantially contemporaneous search and seizure incident thereto was reasonable. <em>Brown </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number><em>v. State, </em>15 Md. App. 584.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> \u201cWhen a man is legally arrested for an offense, whatever is found upon his person or in his control which is unlawful for him to have, and which may be used to prove the offense, may be seized and held as evidence in the prosecution.\u201d <em>Carroll v. United States, </em>267 U. S. 132, 158 as quoted in <em>Brown </em>at 590. See <em>Scott v. State, </em>7 Md. App. 505. The suitcases were in the control of Sprenkle and Lohss when they were arrested and were thus subject to search. We think that the search which followed was substantially contemporaneous with the arrests. The search of the suitcases was delayed after the arrests only so long as was necessary to take the arrestees to a place where it would be feasible to conduct the search. We do not believe that constitutional reasonableness required that the officers immediately open the suitcases on the floor of the public airport baggage room and search them. The right to seize and search the suitcases accrued at the time of the lawful arrests. It was not divested in the circumstances by the short time which elapsed before the right was exercised.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">In this case, moreover, the State troopers already had ample probable cause to believe that the suitcases contained contraband marijuana. The police were simply seizing what they already knew to be probable evidence, albeit the evidence was inside the suitcases.

We denied a motion made by Sprenkle prior to argument, but not within 10 days from the date the record was filed, to dismiss the appeal as to him. At oral argument Lohss asked that we dismiss the appeal as to him <em>sua sponte, </em>for the reasons advanced by Sprenkle.

We declared in <em>Mather </em>at 554: \u201cUnder the present law of Maryland * * * the State has no right to appeal, either by statute, by rule, or under the common law, from the granting of a motion to suppress evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b515-10\">As to a statute, we thought it plain that Code, Art. 5, \u00a7 14, limited the scope of the State\u2019s right to appeal to final orders or judgments granting a motion to dismiss an indictment. 7 Md. App. at 552. We also decided that the \u201cinquisition in a criminal action\u201d mentioned in \u00a7 14 provided no basis to authorize the State to appeal from the granting of a motion to suppress evidence. At 553. And see concurring opinion of Orth, J. at 555-558. As to a rule, we pointed out that Md. Rule 729 provides for appellate review when a motion to suppress is denied, but not when such motion is granted. We observed, after recognizing the rule that an appeal in a criminal case is premature until after final judgment, that the granting of such a motion was no more final than would be any other ruling excluding testimony at a trial. 7 Md. App. at 551-552. As to the common law, we considered and rejected an argument by the State that as the common law gave it the right to seek appellate review by writ of error of a judgment in a criminal case sustaining a demurrer to or quashing an indictment, and as the effect of the granting of a motion to suppress evidence was to strip the State of its evidence and render it powerless to proceed to trial, the granting of such a motion was tantamount to sustaining a demurrer to the indictment, and, therefore, appealable. We pointed out that this argument was flatly rejected in <em>State v. Adams, </em>196 Md. 341 and <em>State v. Barshack, </em>197 Md. 543, decided prior to the enactment of \u00a7 14. We further noted that, even assuming we had authority to issue a writ of prohibition, it was not the function of that writ to review proceedings. At 554.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b516-8\">. We observe that an accused is not afforded an appellate review of a denial of a motion to suppress evidence until final judgment, that is, conviction and sentence. See Rule 729. Just as the accused may challenge the correctness of the denial of his motion to suppress in appellate proceedings following his conviction, the State may challenge a grant of the motion following a dismissal of the indictment; in each case a final judgment has then been rendered.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b516-9\">.

Peret testified: \u201cHe advised that at approximately 5:35 p.m. his state, Texas time, two blue suitcases and one tan suitcase came through the baggage chute at the airlines. The suitcases were first noticed by Mr. Warren Hewgley. He\u2019s an agent for the airlines. He noticed a strong and unusual odor about the suitcases. He asked Mr. Housley to come over and examine the suitcases. Mr. Housley advised us that he recognized the smell, he cracked open the suitcase and recognized the smell to be marijuana. He further advised us that he has had previous experienced the identification in the odor of marijuana, and through previous experience recognized the contents or recognized the odor to be marijuana. He also advised us he assisted the police departments in many other investigations of this kind. * ** * Also he advised that he had a right to open the luggage under the CAI? regulations and this was one of his duties as City Manager.\u201d Pitt added that Housley also gave them the baggage claim numbers. Housley summed up what he told the officers: \u201cNumber of bags, what we had suspected in one of the bags, bag checks, the passenger itinerary, his final destination.\u201d Pie also gave them a description of Sprenkle.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b521-8\">. The transcript of the proceedings at the hearing does not disclose precisely what was seized or from what suitcases. The basis of the charges against Sprenkle and Lohss from the allegations in the indictment returned against them is the possession of marijuana. Lohss\u2019s motion to suppress asserts that \u201call of the incriminating evidence against [him] was obtained as a result of his unlawful arrest and the unlawful search of him and the illegal and unlawful seizures resulting from said arrest and searches.\u201d Sprenkle\u2019s motion to suppress makes clear that the challenged evidence was obtained from his baggage. \u201cThe tangible objects found inside movant\u2019s baggage and seized therefrom are not admissible in evidence because they were obtained as a result of said unlawful and unconstitutional seizures and searches.\u201d Argument of counsel at the hearing also so indicates.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b522-9\">. Housley testified that as the Austin Manager of Texas International Airlines, for which he had worked for eleven years, he was not part of any governmental unit or governmental agency, that he had never worked for any governmental agency or been employed by any governmental agency or received any fees or compensation from any governmental agency. He further testified that Hewgley was not \u201cemployed by any governmental unit of any kind.\u201d There is no suggestion that the inspection of Sprenkle\u2019s luggage by Housley and Hewgley was initiated in any way by the police or other governmental agents.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b523-11\">. The rule of probable cause is a non-technical conception of a reasonable ground for belief of guilt, requiring less evidence for such belief than would justify conviction, but more evidence than that which would arouse a mere suspicion. * * ~ \u2018[Q]nly the probability, and not a prima facie <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>showing, of criminal activity is the standard of probable cause. * * Of course, whether probable cause is shown to exist may be measured in terms of the collective information demonstrated by the record to be within the possession of the entire police team. * * (Citations omitted) <em>Mobley and King v.

Whether he was innocently caught in a web not of his own spinning, or whether he was guilty as charged, is not the issue before us. He testified that he was at home and \u201cthere were several people downstairs and someone just said Donald was coming into the airport and I had the car and I should pick him up * * * I should go and pick him up because I was the only one who had a car, I lived in a house with fourteen people.\u201d Such evidence was not relevant to the validity of his arrest. He admitted he went to the airport, met Sprenkle and helped with Sprenkle\u2019s baggage, although he claimed he carried only one suitcase.
