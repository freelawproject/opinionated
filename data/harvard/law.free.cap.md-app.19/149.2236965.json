He was fined $500.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">In this Court, appellant argues that there was no probable cause for the police to arrest him or to conduct a search of his person. He contends here, as he did in the trial court, that the evidence taken from him should have been suppressed. We agree, and reverse the judgment for the reasons stated <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">Deputy Sheriffs Ron Clarke and Chuck Kerr applied on June 2, 1972 to the Circuit Court for St. Mary\u2019s County for a search warrant for the premises known as \u201c236 Chinlee Drive, Center Gardens, Lexington Park, St. Mary's County. This apartment leased and occupied by one; Michael Schmitt.\u201d The affidavit in support of the warrant was bottomed on information furnished by two informants that \u201cmarijuana parties\u201d were conducted on the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-9\">In view of our disposition in this case, it is unnecessary to discuss the reliability and credibility of the informants, or whether, <em>vel non, </em>the affidavit meets the clear dictates of <em>Aguilar v. Texas, </em>378 U. S. 108, 84 S. Ct. 1509, 12 L.Ed.2d 723 (1964), and a plethora of cases of this Court. <em>See, e.g., Schmidt v. State, </em>17 Md. App. 492, 302 A. 2d 714 (1973); <em>Hignut v. State, </em>17 Md. App. 399, 303 A. 2d 173 (1973); <em>Soles v. State, </em>16 Md. App. 656, 299 A. 2d 502 (1973); <em>Thompson v. State, </em>16 Md. App. 560, 298 A. 2d 458 (1973); <em>Lomax v. State, </em>16 Md. App. 502, 298 A. 2d 454 (1973); <em>Hudson v. State, </em>16 Md. App. 49, 294 A. 2d 109 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-10\">The warrant contained the wording:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-11\">\u201cYou are, therefore, hereby commanded, with the necessary and proper assistance to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>e. Arrest all persons found in or upon said premises and vehicle who may be participating in violations of the statutes hereinbefore cited:\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">When the deputies executed the warrant they \u201centered the premises approximately 10:00, p.m. There were approximately nine or ten people in the downstairs section of the house . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">Deputy Clarke testified that, \u201cEverybody was detained in the house.\u201d Deputy Purdy, who participated in the execution of the warrant, said, \u201cDeputy Clarke and Kerr advised the subjects inside \u2014 there were four or five \u2014 and advised them they were under arrest, they had a search warrant for the premises.\u201d Purdy maintained a guard over^he \u201csubjects\u201d who were seated in the living room, while Clatke conducted the search. Admittedly, when the police arrived at the residence, they did not observe a violation of any law, nor were they able to say that the appellant, at any time prior to the search of his person, was violating any law. Clarke found a quantity of marijuana, which he described as a \u201csmall amount, enough to maybe roll one cigarette, maybe \u2014 small,\u201d in a pocket of a jacket lying on a bed in a room on the second floor. The ownership of the jacket was never ascertained. Based upon the discovery of the marijuana in the pocket of the jacket, Clarke ordered a search of each of the persons who were in the downstairs living room. In order to justify the search of the appellant, the Assistant State\u2019s Attorney argued, and the trial court agreed, that the finding of the marijuana in the jacket pocket in the upstairs bedroom constituted the commission of a misdemeanor in the presence of the deputies by the appellant and the other \u201cfour or five\u201d or \u201cnine or ten\u201d persons in the living room.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">The State candidly admits that, \u201c. . . the bare right to search the premises does not, of itself, confer a right to search and/or arrest persons found upon the premises.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">In <em>Haley v. State, </em>7 Md. App. 18, 253 A. 2d 424 (1969), we said, at 25:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-9\">\u201cThe search of ... [a person] and the seizure of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>evidence found on his person would be valid only if made under the authority of the warrant or as incident to a legal arrest outside of the warrant by reason that the officers had probable cause to believe that a felony had been committed and that the arrestee committed it or had probable cause to believe that a misdemeanor had been or was being committed in their presence and that the misdemeanant committed it or that the search was made with the voluntary consent of the person searched.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">The discovery of the small amount of marijuana in the pocket of a jacket lying on the bed in the second floor bedroom does not, in our view, establish probable cause for the belief that a misdemeanor is being committed by the persons seated in the living room on the first floor in the absence of a clear connection between the marijuana and those persons. The fact that the police were frustrated in their efforts (if, in fact, such efforts were made) to ascertain the identity of the owner of the jacket, and hence the marijuana, does not justify a wholesale search of all persons on the premises who, as we have stated, are observed to be occupied in lawful pursuits.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">When the appellant was searched, there was discovered in his wallet a piece of paper upon which there were \u201cthree and a quarter [green] dots.\u201d The dots were \u201canalyzed to be LSD 889. micrograms per dot.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">The State endeavors to establish the possibility of a consensual search by reason of the officer\u2019s asking to see the appellant\u2019s wallet. The testimony is pellucid that a search had been ordered by Deputy Clarke of each of the persons in the house; that in the course of that search, when the police asked for appellant\u2019s wallet and he surrendered the wallet to the officer, such surrender is not the equivalent of a consensual search. <em>See Kelly v. State, </em>18 Md. App. 145, 305 A. 2d 195 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">The Fourth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number><em>\u201cThe right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, </em>and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\u201d (Emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">We think it crystal clear that the search in this case violates the Fourth Amendment\u2019s prohibition against \u201cunreasonable searches and seizures.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">The very most that the record in this case reveals, prior to the search of appellant\u2019s person, is that he [appellant] was arrested while visiting an apartment where informants had stated that \u201cmarijuana parties were held,\u201d and a \u201csmall amount\u201d of marijuana was found in a pocket of a jacket on a bed in the second floor bedroom. No effort was made by the State to establish any proprietary or possessory interest on the part of appellant in the apartment of Michael Schmitt, nor, as we have previously noted, did the State show that the jacket belonged to the appellant. Although the trial judge admitted the marijuana into evidence, there was, in this case, no legally sufficient reason for the police to have arrested the appellant, and the subsequent search of his person was illegal. The motion to suppress the evidence, grounded upon the illegality of the arrest, should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">\n<em>Costs to be paid by County Commissioners of St. Mary's County.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
