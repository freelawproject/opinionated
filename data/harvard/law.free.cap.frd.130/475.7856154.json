The Resolution Trust Corporation, which is the plaintiff in the Arizona action and a defendant in California actions, and two other defendants support the motion; nine additional defendants favor centralization under Section 1407 in any appropriate forum. Another defendant favors centralization but suggests the Central District of California as transferee district. Plaintiffs in seven California actions oppose the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">On the basis of the papers filed and the hearing held, the Panel finds that centralization of all actions in the District of Arizona will best serve the convenience of the parties and witnesses and promote the just and efficient conduct of this litigation. All actions now before the Panel raise common questions of fact concerning the alleged liability for the highly publicized collapse of American Continental Corporation (ACC) and its wholly owned subsidiary Lincoln Savings and Loan Association, the largest thrift failure in United States history. Centralization under Section 1407 is necessary in order to avoid duplication of discovery, prevent inconsistent pretrial rulings, and conserve the resources of the parties, their counsel and the judiciary.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-11\">With regard to the selection of the transferee district, we are persuaded that the District of Arizona is the appropriate forum in light of the following factors: ACC was headquartered in Arizona; several other defendants and witnesses are located there; a document depository (wherein millions of documents are located) has been established in the Arizona forum; and ACC\u2019s bankruptcy action is pending there.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-12\">IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1407, the actions pending in the Central District of California and listed on the following Schedule A be, and the same hereby are, transferred to the District of Arizona and, with the consent of that court, assigned to the Honorable Richard M. Bilby for coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings with the action pending in that district and listed on Schedule A.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-13\">SCHEDULE A</p>\n<p id=\"b532-14\">Central District of California</p>\n<p id=\"b532-15\"><em>Sarah B.
