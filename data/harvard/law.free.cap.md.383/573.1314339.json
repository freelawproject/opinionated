Background</p>\n<p id=\"A99\">A. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b719-11\">On January 22, 2002, at approximately 7:45a.m., Officers Jason Ackerman and Jason Dietz of the Hagerstown Police Department, were on patrol in their vehicle, in the area of Wakefield Road and West Franklin Street. They had stopped their vehicle approximately six feet behind a burgundy Toyota Takoma truck, which was sitting at the intersection stop sign. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>While the officers were behind the truck, they noticed that the driver, later identified as Chris Nieves, was having \u201csome kind of problem around the shifting area.\u201d The truck then began to drift back, \u201cas if the clutch was engaged and it wasn\u2019t in gear,\u201d and struck the officers\u2019 vehicle. Officer Ackerman got out of the patrol car, approached Nieves, and asked Nieves, the sole occupant of the truck, for a valid driver\u2019s license. Nieves responded that he did not possess a valid driver\u2019s license in any state or any photo identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">After the officers reported the accident to police dispatch, they learned that the truck was registered to a female who had been reported missing by her parents ten days earlier. In response to their question about his identity, Nieves replied that his name was \u201cNathan Nieves\u201d and that his birth date was June 26, 1976. A subsequent search of police records failed to identify any person under that name. During the encounter, Nieves appeared \u201ccalm and relaxed\u201d to the officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">A third police officer, Jason Batistig, arrived at the scene within a matter of minutes, pursuant to police department policy, in order to investigate the accident involving the police patrol car. Officers Batistig and Dietz began to question Nieves about his identity and the truck\u2019s ownership. When asked again by the officers for his identity, Nieves supplied the same birth date but instead gave a different first name, \u201cChris,\u201d with the same last name. The dispatcher ran a search for \u201cChris Nieves\u201d and found that Nieves\u2019 driving privileges were suspended and that a state identification card had been issued to him. When asked how he came to be in possession of the truck, Nieves responded that \u201che got it from a guy named Mike\u201d from West Virginia. Officer Batistig stated that Nieves was then a little nervous, fidgety, and evasive during the interrogation. Nieves was placed under arrest for giving false information to the police and for obstructing a police officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">Nieves consented to a pat down, after Officer Ackerman requested permission, to insure that Nieves did not have weapons, because a crime could have been committed in light <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>of the fact that a \u201cfemale was missing.\u201d During the pat down, Officer Ackerman found a roll of money totaling $377.00 in Nieves\u2019 pocket. The officers then searched the truck that Nieves was driving and found no contraband or weapons. Officer Batistig thereafter transported Nieves to the police station.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">After Officer Batistig and Nieves arrived at the Hagerstown police station, they were met by Lieutenant Richard Johnson, who was investigating the disappearance of Melissa Langdon, the registered owner of the truck Nieves was driving. Based upon information provided by Langdon\u2019s parents, Lieutenant Johnson was aware that Langdon\u2019s disappearance was allegedly linked to drugs. Lieutenant Johnson immediately recognized Nieves as having been arrested twice in the year 2000 for drug offenses.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Although not aware of the $377.00 found on Nieves\u2019 person, Lieutenant Johnson ordered a strip search of Nieves during the booking procedures based upon \u201cthe information regarding the missing person and the prior history of drugs.\u201d At the request of Lieutenant Johnson, Detective Schultz conducted the strip search, which produced two small plastic baggies containing individually wrapped baggies of cocaine that were protruding from Nieves\u2019 rectum.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">B. Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">On January 22, 2002, Nieves was charged with possession of cocaine,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> possession with intent to distribute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>cocaine,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and five minor traffic violations: Failure to control speed,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> driving without a valid license,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> negligent driving,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>giving a false name,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and giving false accident report information.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Nieves was also charged with the common law crimes of obstructing and hindering a police officer. Prior to trial, Nieves filed a motion to suppress the cocaine that was seized during the strip search arguing that the arrest was unlawful and the strip search was unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment. On May 22, 2002, a suppression hearing was held on the motion, during which the court heard testimony from Officers Jason Ackerman, Jason Batistig, and Lieutenant Richard Johnson, and admitted the stipulated testimony of Detective Schultz. The officers\u2019 testimony recounted the facts as they have been presented here.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">In an order dated June 7, 2002, the Circuit Court denied Nieves\u2019 motion to suppress stating that \u201cdetaining the defendant under the totality of the circumstances and the subsequent search were reasonable.\u201d On October 8, 2002, the case proceeded to a bench trial in which Nieves was convicted of possession with intent to distribute cocaine and the lesser included offense of possession of cocaine. Subsequently, Nieves was sentenced to ten years imprisonment without the possibility of parole. He was also convicted of driving without a license, negligent driving, and failure to control speed, for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>which the court imposed monetary' fines. The court found Nieves not guilty of the charges of obstructing an officer, giving false information, and giving false accident report information.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">On appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, Nieves argued that the Circuit Court\u2019s denial of the suppression motion should be reversed because the officers lacked probable cause to arrest him. Nieves also argued that the officers lacked reasonable suspicion to strip search him subsequent to his arrest for a minor traffic offense and that the search was unconstitutional as violative of the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">The Court of Special Appeals addressed the probable cause issue and found that the officers lacked probable cause to arrest Nieves for obstructing an officer. The court found, however, that the officers did have probable cause to arrest Nieves for the multiple traffic violations. Because probable cause existed, the court reasoned, a search incident to the arrest was permissible under the circumstances.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">The Court of Special Appeals then turned to the question of whether the officers had reasonable, articulable suspicion to strip search Nieves incident to arrest for minor offenses and concluded that the strip search was unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment. The court applied a balancing test by weighing Nieves\u2019 privacy interests against the government interest in conducting the strip search. In applying the balancing test, the intermediate appellate court held that strip searches incident to an arrest for a minor offense should not occur unless the arresting officer has a reasonable, articulable suspicion that the individual is <em>presently </em>in possession of weapons or contraband. The court further reasoned that conducting a strip search solely on Nieves\u2019 past criminal record would create a <em>per se </em>rule that would shift the determination of reasonable suspicion from the individual arrestee to a class or category of offenders. Additionally, the court noted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>that it was \u201cfar too great a leap to conclude that any possible narcotics involvement of the missing female <em>ipso facto </em>carried over to [Nieves] simply because he was the driver of the vehicle.\u201d Thus, the court concluded that based upon the totality of the circumstances, the officers lacked reasonable, articulable suspicion to conduct the strip search and reversed the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-4\">The State filed a petition for a writ of certiorari in this Court to consider the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-5\">Did the Court of Special Appeals err when it determined that the strip search conducted by the police was unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">We granted the petition and issued the writ of certiorari. <em>State v. Nieves, </em>380 Md. 617, 846 A.2d 401 (2004). We hold that under the circumstances of this case, the strip search was unreasonable as a search incident to arrest for a minor crime, and therefore, Nieves\u2019 motion to suppress the evidenced seized from the search should have been granted. Thus, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">II. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b725-8\">In reviewing a Circuit Court\u2019s grant or denial of a motion to suppress evidence under the Fourth Amendment, we ordinarily consider only the information contained in the record of the suppression hearing and not the trial record. <em>Laney v. State, </em>379 Md. 522, 533, 842 A.2d 773, 779 (2004); <em>Dashiell v. State, </em>374 Md. 85, 93, 821 A.2d 372, 376 (2003) (quoting <em>State v. Collins, </em>367 Md. 700, 706-07, 790 A.2d 660, 663-64 (2002)) (citing <em>Ferris v. State, </em>355 Md. 356, 368, 735 A.2d 491, 497 (1999)). We view the evidence and all reasonable inferences drawn from that evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party on the motion. <em>Laney, </em>379 Md. at 533, 842 A.2d at 779; <em>Dashiell, </em>374 at 93, 821 A.2d at 376-77 (quoting <em>Collins, </em>367 Md. at 707, 790 A.2d at 664)(citing <em>Riddick v. State, </em>319 Md. 180, 183, 571 A.2d 1239, 1240 (1990)). Although we extend great deference to the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact and will not disturb them unless clearly erroneous, we review, independently, the application of the law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>to those facts to determine if the evidence at issue was obtained in violation of the law and, accordingly, should be suppressed. <em>Laney, </em>379 Md. at 533-34, 842 A.2d at 779-80; <em>Dashiell, </em>374 Md. at 93-94, 821 A.2d at 378 (citing <em>Lancaster v. State, </em>86 Md.App. 74, 95, 585 A.2d 274, 284 (1991)); <em>State v. Rucker, </em>374 Md. 199, 207, 821 A.2d 439, 444 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">The State asserts that the Court of Special Appeals erred in holding that the strip search was unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment because the search was not supported by reasonable, articulable suspicion that Nieves was concealing a weapon or contraband on his person. In the State\u2019s view, the reasonable suspicion standard for conducting strip searches incident to arrest requires a minimal level of objective justification and should be based upon the totality of the circumstances when assessing the reasonableness of the officer\u2019s basis for conducting the strip search. According to the State, because Nieves was driving the truck of a missing person suspected of being involved in drug activity, had failed to properly identify himself when questioned by the police, and had a criminal history involving drugs, reasonable, articulable suspicion justifying the strip search in this case had been created. Consequently, the State argues, the judgment of the intermediate appellate court should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">Nieves\u2019 argument, quite understandably, adheres to the analysis of the Court of Special Appeals. He maintains that the test for reasonableness of the officer\u2019s basis for conducting the strip search involves balancing the privacy interests of the person being searched against the government\u2019s need for conducting the search. Nieves argues that the police must have reasonable, articulable suspicion to conduct a strip search under the search incident to arrest exception to the Fourth Amendment, when the arrest is for a minor traffic offense. Nieves asserts that Lieutenant Johnson did not have reasonable, articulable suspicion that Nieves was carrying weapons or contraband. Even considering the totality of the circumstances, Nieves maintains that Lieutenant Johnson based his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>decision to order the strip search solely on Nieves\u2019 prior criminal history and his connection to a missing girl\u2019s truck. Those circumstances, according to Nieves, do not amount to reasonable, articulable suspicion justifying a strip search incident to arrest. For the reasons stated below, we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">A. Fourth Amendment and Search Incident to Arrest</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\"> The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution, made applicable to the State of Maryland through the Fourteenth Amendment, guarantees individuals the right to be secure in \u201ctheir persons, houses, papers and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures.\u201d <em>Mapp v. Ohio, </em>367 U.S. 643, 647, 81 S.Ct. 1684, 1687, 6 L.Ed.2d 1081, 1085 (1961); <em>Laney, </em>379 Md. at 545, 842 A.2d at 786. It is axiomatic that the Fourth Amendment only prohibits those searches and seizures that are unreasonable under the circumstances. <em>See Carter v. State, </em>367 Md. 447, 458, 788 A.2d 646, 652 (2002) (citing <em>Gadson v. State, </em>341 Md. 1, 9, 668 A.2d 22, 26 (1995)), <em>cert denied, </em>517 U.S. 1203, 116 S.Ct. 1704, 134 L.Ed.2d 803 (1996); <em>Little v. State, </em>300 Md. 485, 493, 479 A.2d 903, 907 (1984). In determining the reasonableness of a search, each case requires a balancing of the government\u2019s need to conduct the search against the invasion of the individual\u2019s privacy rights. <em>Bell v. Wolfish, </em>441 U.S. 520, 559, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 1884, 60 L.Ed.2d 447, 481 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">Furthermore, it is well established that warrantless searches are <em>per se </em>unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment absent some recognized exception. <em>Gamble v. State, </em>318 Md. 120, 123, 567 A.2d 95, 97 (1989). A search incident to a lawful arrest is one of the well delineated exceptions to the warrant requirement. <em>See Carter, </em>367 Md. at 460-61, 788 A.2d at 653-54; <em>State v. Evans, </em>352 Md. 496, 516, 723 A.2d 423, 432-33, <em>cert denied, </em>528 U.S. 833, 120 S.Ct. 310, 145 L.Ed.2d 77 (1999); <em>Ricks v. State, </em>322 Md. 183, 188, 586 A.2d 740, 743 (1991) (citing <em>Chimel v. California, </em>395 U.S. 752, 89 S.Ct. 2034, 23 L.Ed.2d 685 (1969)).</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>The Supreme Court in <em>Chimel v. California, </em>395 U.S. 752, 89 S.Ct. 2034, 23 L.Ed.2d 685 (1969), articulated the bases for a search incident to arrest, those being, \u201cto remove any weapons that the [arrestee] might seek to use in order to resist arrest or effect his escape .... [or] to search for and seize any evidence on the arrestee\u2019s person in order to prevent its concealment or destruction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 763, 89 S.Ct. at 2040, 23 L.Ed.2d at 694; <em>see also United States v. Edwards, </em>415 U.S. 800, 802-03, 94 S.Ct. 1234, 1237, 39 L.Ed.2d 771, 775 (1974); <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>414 U.S. 218, 226, 94 S.Ct. 467, 472, 38 L.Ed.2d 427, 435 (1973); <em>Carter, </em>367 Md. at 460, 788 A.2d at 653.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">Likewise, in <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>414 U.S. 218, 94 S.Ct. 467, 38 L.Ed.2d 427 (1973), the Court allowed a full search of the person, including a pat-down of his pockets and their contents as incident to a lawful arrest. <em>Id. </em>at 221-24, 94 S.Ct. at 470-71, 38 L.Ed.2d at 433-34. In <em>Robinson, </em>a police officer suspected the defendant of driving without an operator\u2019s permit based upon a previous check of the defendant\u2019s operator\u2019s permit four days earlier. <em>Id. </em>at 220, 94 S.Ct. at 469-70, 38 L.Ed.2d. at 432. The defendant was stopped by the officer, arrested for driving without a valid operator\u2019s permit, and patted down after getting out of the vehicle. <em>Id. </em>During the pat-down, the officer found a cigarette pack in the defendant\u2019s front coat pocket, which the officer opened and found several vials of heroin. <em>Id. </em>at 222-23, 94 S.Ct. at 470-71, 38 L.Ed.2d at 434. The officer then proceeded to search the defendant\u2019s waist, pants, and remaining pockets. <em>Id. </em>Subsequently, the defendant was convicted for possession of heroin and he appealed challenging the validity of the area of his person. <em>Id. </em>at 220, 94 S.Ct. at 469, 38 L.Ed.2d at 432.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">Chief Justice Rehnquist, writing for the Court, explained that the decision of an arresting officer to search a person incident to a lawful arrest \u201cis necessarily a quick <em>ad hoc </em>judgment\u201d and that the potential danger that the arrestee is carrying weapons provides \u201can adequate basis for treating all custodial arrests alike for purposes of [the] search justification.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 235, 94 S.Ct. at 476-77, 38 L.Ed.2d at 440. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>Consequently, the Court held that police officers are not required to assess the likelihood that the arrestee is carrying weapons or concealing evidence; rather, the officers may undertake a \u201cfull search\u201d of the arrestee. <em>Id. </em>The Court established that a full search incident to arrest can involve \u201ca relatively extensive exploration of the person,\u201d aimed toward locating weapons, or evidence that could be concealed or destroyed. <em>Id. </em>at 227, 94 S.Ct. at 473, 38 L.Ed.2d at 436 (quoting <em>Warden v. Hayden, </em>387 U.S. 294, 310, 87 S.Ct. 1642, 18 L.Ed.2d 782 (1967)); <em>see also Carter, </em>367 Md. at 461, 788 A.2d at 654 (recognizing that the right of an officer to search a person \u201cfollows automatically from the arrest.\u201d) (citing <em>Evans, </em>352 Md. 496, 508, 723 A.2d 423, 429, <em>cert denied, </em>528 U.S. 833, 120 S.Ct. 310, 145 L.Ed.2d 77 (1999)).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">In <em>United States v. Edwards, </em>415 U.S. 800, 94 S.Ct. 1234, 39 L.Ed.2d 771 (1974), the Court held that jail administrators could exchange and search the clothes of an individual who had been arrested and detained. <em>Id. </em>at 801-02, 94 S.Ct. at 1236, 39 L.Ed.2d at 775. The Court stated that exchanging and searching the detainee\u2019s clothes for evidence one day after his arrest was a normal search incident to a custodial arrest and that the delay in the search was reasonable because the search could have been conducted at the time of the arrest. <em>Id. </em>at 805, 94 S.Ct. at 1238, 39 L.Ed.2d at 777. The Court observed that it is customary to search an arrestee who is being processed for confinement and that such searches are reasonable. <em>Id. </em>at 804-05, 94 S.Ct. at 1238, 39 L.Ed.2d at 776. <em>See also Abel v. United States, </em>362 U.S. 217, 80 S.Ct. 683, 4 L.Ed.2d 668 (1960) (holding that a search of a suitcase that could have been made at the arrest scene was allowed at a later time in the detention center).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">Nevertheless, the Supreme Court has not addressed the validity of strip searches incident to an arrest; in <em>Illinois v. Lafayette, </em>462 U.S. 640, 103 S.Ct. 2605, 77 L.Ed.2d 65 (1983), the Court explicitly stated that, \u201c[w]e were not addressing in <em>Edwards, </em>and do not discuss here, the circumstances in which a strip search of an arrestee may or may not be appropriate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 646 n. 2, 103 S.Ct. at 2609 n. 2, 77 L.Ed.2d at 71 n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>B. Strip Searches</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">The term \u201cstrip search\u201d has been defined and used in differing contexts in Fourth Amendment jurisprudence. In general, strip searches involve the removal of the arrestee\u2019s clothing for inspection of the under clothes and/or body. <em>See </em>William J. Simonitsch, <em>Visual Body Cavity Searches Incident to Arrest: Validity Under the Fourth Amendment, </em>54 U. Miami L.Rev. 665, 667 (2000). Some have defined strip searches to also include a visual inspection of the genital and anal regions of the body. <em>Id. </em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (7th Ed.2004) defines a strip search as \u201ca search of a person conducted after that person\u2019s clothes have been removed, the purpose usually being to find any contraband the person might be hiding.\u201d Likewise, in the instant case, the Hagerstown Police Department procedural rules (Departmental Rules), define a strip search as \u201cany search of an individual requiring the removal or rearrangement of some or all clothing to permit the visual inspection of the skin surfaces of the genital areas, breasts, and/or buttocks\u201d. <em>See </em>Departmental Rules, \u00a7 18.11.2.1. There is a distinction between a strip search and other types of searches, such as body cavity searches, which could involve visually inspecting the body cavities or physically probing the body cavities. <em>Simonitsch, supra, </em>at n. 9. Based upon the record, it appears that a strip search was conducted rather than a physical body cavity search.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">It is clear that strip searches by their very nature can be degrading and invasive. <em>See Wood v.

Wolfish, </em>441 U.S. 520, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979), the Supreme Court addressed the permissible scope of searches incident to arrest that occurred in association with pretrial detention. <em>Id. </em>at 528, 99 S.Ct. at 1866, 60 L.Ed.2d at 458. Several defendants brought a class action suit challenging detention policies requiring pre-trial detainees to be subjected to a \u201cvisual body cavity\u201d search every time the detainee had contact with individuals outside of the institution. <em>Id. </em>The Court assessed the reasonableness of these searches by stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-6\">The test of reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment is not capable of precise definition or mechanical application. In each case it requires a balancing of the need for the particular search against the invasion of personal rights that the search entails. Courts must consider the scope of the particular intrusion, the manner in which it is conducted, the justification for initiating it, and the place in which it is conducted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b732-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 559, 99 S.Ct. at 1884, 60 L.Ed.2d at 481. Because penal institutions face unique security challenges arising from the possibility of having contraband and weapons brought into the institution, the Court held that the searches were reasonable and could be conducted on less than probable cause that the detainee was carrying weapons or contraband. <em>Id. </em>at 559, 99 S.Ct. at 1884-85, 60 L.Ed.2d at 481-82. Justice Powell, concurring in part and dissenting in part, suggested that reasonable suspicion should be the level required to justify the \u201cvisual body cavity\u201d searches that occurred in the case. <em>Id. </em>at 563, 99 S.Ct. at 1886, 60 L.Ed.2d at 484.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-8\">Since <em>Bell, </em>a number of courts that have examined institutional policies attempting to prevent detainees from bringing weapons and contraband into the institution and have required that the strip search be based upon reasonable suspicion that the individual was carrying weapons or contraband at the time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>of arrest. <em>See Swain v.

In <em>State v. Jenkins, </em>82 Conn.App. 111, 842 A.2d 1148 (2004), an undercover police officer, after having been informed that the defendant was dealing drugs, arranged to buy heroin from him. <em>Id. </em>at 1151. When Jenkins approached the officer and attempted to sell the heroin, the officer placed Jenkins under arrest, conducted a pat down, and noticed that an object was protruding from Jenkins\u2019 pants. <em>Id. </em>The officer pulled down Jenkins\u2019 pants and underwear and discovered several glass vials of crack and heroin protruding from Jenkins\u2019 buttocks. <em>Id. </em>As a result, Jenkins was charged with possession of narcotics with the intent to distribute and convicted. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">The intermediate appellate court of Connecticut, faced with a Fourth Amendment challenge to the strip search, held that probable cause did exist to arrest and that the strip search <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>was valid as a search incident to arrest. <em>Id. </em>at 1154. The court explained that the justification for an officer to search incident to a lawful arrest is predicated upon the need to \u201cdisarm the suspect in order to take him into custody as it does on the need to preserve evidence on his person for later use at trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1157. When the arrest is for a felony offense, the officer must have a reasonable and articulable suspicion to believe that the arrestee is carrying weapons or contraband. <em>Id. </em>at 1156. The court defined reasonable suspicion as the officer\u2019s \u201cspecific reasonable inferences which he is entitled to draw from the facts in light of his experience.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1157. In upholding the search, the court applied the balancing test articulated in <em>Bell, </em>and explained that the officer had reason to believe that Jenkins was carrying contraband because the officer was meeting Jenkins presumably to buy heroin. <em>Id. </em>The court also noted that the nature of the offense for which Jenkins was arrested created the suspicion necessary to justify the strip search. <em>Id. </em>Based on those factors, the court found that reasonable suspicion existed to conduct the search of Jenkins; therefore, the search was reasonable. <em>Id. </em>at 1158.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">Strip searches conducted of detainees who had been arrested for <em>minor </em>offenses not associated with weapons or contraband generally have been found wanting, unless the officer had information that would have led the officer to have reasonable suspicion that the person was carrying weapons or contraband at the time of arrest. <em>See Roberts, </em>289 F.3d at 112 (strip search unreasonable based upon arrest for an \u201coutstanding body attachment,\u201d a misdemeanor, because there was no evidence that the defendant was carrying weapons or contraband at the time of arrest); <em>Edwards v. State, </em>759 N.E.2d 626, 629 (Ind.2001) (strip search of arrestee charged with speeding and giving a false name held unconstitutional due to the absence of reasonable suspicion that the defendant had weapons or contraband on his person during the arrest); <em>People v.

Those courts held that conducting strip searches of detainees arrested for minor offenses must be justified by reasonable suspicion that the individual is carrying weapons or contraband at the time of arrest. <em>See Swain, </em>117 F.3d at 9 (holding strip search unconstitutional based upon arrest for non-felony matter because the type of offense did not indicate reasonable suspicion that the arrestee was carrying weapons or contraband at the time of arrest).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b739-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>In <em>Edwards v. State, </em>759 N.E.2d 626 (Ind.2001), the defendant, Michael Edwards, was arrested for giving police officers false information after being questioned about his identity. Id. at 628. Subsequent to the arrest, the officers transported Edwards to the police station, conducted a strip search, and found cocaine protruding from Edwards\u2019 buttocks. Id. Edwards was later convicted for possession of cocaine and appealed arguing that the cocaine was seized illegally. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">On appeal, the Supreme Court of Indiana held that the search was unreasonable as a search incident to arrest. Id. at 630. The court explained that because the strip search was incident to an arrest for a minor offense, the search must be justified by reasonable suspicion that Edwards was carrying weapons or contraband. Id. at 629-30. According to the Court, \u201c[tjhere may be misdemeanor charges for which a body search is appropriate because of the reasonable likelihood of discovery of evidence, but, false informing, without more, is certainly not such a crime.\u201d Id. at 629. Because Edwards had only been arrested for a non-violent misdemeanor, and the circumstances surrounding Edwards\u2019 arrest did not create the reasonable suspicion necessary to conduct the search, the court held that the search was unreasonable. Id. at 630.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">C. Nieves\u2019 Strip Search</p>\n<p id=\"b739-7\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>we are not dealing with a situation where institutional safety is at issue. The State has conceded that this case does not involve institutional policies of strip searching individuals prior to entering prison because the record is devoid of any evidence that Nieves was confined. Therefore, in the present case, where the person has been arrested for a minor traffic offense unrelated to drugs or violence, is a strip search justified, and what standard should be used to evaluate its reasonableness?</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>It is clear that arrestees, such as Nieves, whether or not they face detention, may conceal weapons and contraband underneath their clothes and on their person, so that the traditional rationales underlying searches incident to arrest apply. <em>See Edwards, </em>415 U.S. at 805, 94 S.Ct. at 1238, 39 L.Ed.2d at 776; <em>Robinson, </em>414 U.S. at 235, 94 S.Ct. at 476, 38 L.Ed.2d at 440; <em>Jenkins, </em>842 A.2d at 1151; <em>Edwards v. State, </em>759 N.E.2d at 630; <em>Jennings, </em>747 N.Y.S.2d at 236. Insofar as the standard to evaluate reasonableness, our jurisprudence is replete with the use of \u201creasonable, articulable suspicion\u201d to determine the reasonableness of searches conducted in other contexts. <em>See Ransome, </em>373 Md. at 106-07, 816 A.2d at 905 (applying the reasonable, articulable suspicion standard that the arrestee was concealing weapons or evidence to evaluate the reasonableness of a <em>Terry </em>frisk); <em>Carter v. State, </em>367 Md. 447, 788 A.2d 646 (2002) (evaluating the search of a lunch bag incident to the defendant\u2019s arrest using reasonable, articulable suspicion to determine if the defendant was carrying weapons or evidence of a crime); <em>Nathan, </em>370 Md. at 664-65, 805 A.2d at 1095-96 (assessing the reasonableness of a warrantless search of a vehicle passenger utilizing the reasonable, articulable suspicion standard); <em>Stokes v. State, </em>362 Md. 407, 765 A.2d 612 (2001) (requiring reasonable, articulable suspicion that the arrestee had committed a robbery in order to conduct an investigatory stop and warrantless search). Accordingly, based upon our own jurisprudence and utilizing the experience and analyses of many other courts addressing the reasonableness of strip searches, we hold that the reasonable, articulable suspicion standard applies in the strip search incident to arrest context.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">Using this standard, the strip search of Nieves was not reasonable. The very nature of the minor traffic violations for which Nieves was apprehended did not create a suspicion that he was carrying weapons or contraband at the time of arrest. Rather, during the suppression hearing, Lieutenant Johnson testified that he ordered a strip search of Nieves for the following reasons: (1) because of Nieves\u2019 prior drug arrests and (2) because at the time of his arrest, Nieves was driving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>the truck of a missing female, who had a history of drug involvement and was reported missing. When questioned during the hearing, Lieutenant Johnson explained that those two were the only justifications for ordering the strip search:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-4\">Q: And what action, if any, did you take at that time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-5\">A: When they were doing the booking procedures obviously the search and subsequent fingerprint processing, photographs and so forth I indicated to them because of his prior drug activity and the knowledge that I had at that time that he needed to be strip searched.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-6\">Q: And you gave that order?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-7\">A: Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-8\">Q: Besides the information regarding the missing person and the prior history of drugs, ... .was there anything else that you based the order on or was that it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-9\">A: No, that was it at the time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b741-10\">Lieutenant Johnson\u2019s rationale falls short of meeting the reasonable, articulable suspicion standard. Prior drug arrests do not necessarily yield reasonable suspicion that an individual is secreting weapons or drugs on his person at the time of his arrest on a drug offense, because to allow the reasonable, articulable suspicion standard to be satisfied based upon a person\u2019s status, rather than an individualized assessment of the circumstances, would undermine the purpose for requiring officers to justify their reasons for searching a particular individual. <em>See Richards v. Wisconsin, </em>520 U.S. 385, 392-93, 117 S.Ct. 1416, 1420-21, 137 L.Ed.2d 615, 622 (1997) (stating, \u201c[i]f a <em>per se </em>exception were allowed for each category of criminal investigation that included a considerable [ ] risk of danger to officers or destruction of evidence, the knock-and-announce element of the P\u2019ourth Amendment\u2019s reasonableness requirement would be meaningless\u201d); <em>see also State v. Lee, </em>374 Md. 275, 308, 821 A.2d 922, 941 (2003). Also, the fact that the defendant was driving the truck of a missing female associated with drugs confuses the nature of the inquiry of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>whether there was reasonable, articulable suspicion that Nieves was carrying weapons or drugs. The circumstances surrounding another person cannot be imputed to the person who is the subject of the search because the inquiry must be particularized and objectively based upon the person suspected of carrying weapons or contraband. <em>See Nathan, </em>370 Md. at 663, 805 A.2d at 1095.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">The State, nevertheless, argues that the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 opinion in <em>Fontaine v. State, </em>135 Md.App. 471, 762 A.2d 1027 (2000), is directly applicable. In <em>Fontaine, </em>the defendant was arrested for driving on a suspended driver\u2019s license. <em>Id. </em>at 475, 762 A.2d at 1030. The arresting officers, who recognized the defendant from a previous encounter for driving without a license and noticed the defendant making suspicious movements. <em>Id. </em>The intermediate appellate court applied the reasonable suspicion standard and the <em>Wolfish </em>balancing test to determine that the \u201cofficer had at least reasonable suspicion to perform a strip search incident to [Fontaine\u2019s] arrest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 482, 762 A.2d at 1033. Because Fontaine was fidgeting during the police encounter, attempted to try to place an object in his pants, and the officer had prior information as to where Fontaine normally concealed contraband, the court found that the strip search was reasonable. <em>Id. </em>Unlike the defendant in <em>Fontaine, </em>the present record is devoid of additional indicia of suspicious movements and attempts to conceal weapons or contraband; Nieves had consented to a pat down of his person and he was described as \u201ccalm and relaxed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">Under the circumstances of this case, the strip search conducted incident to arrest for a minor traffic violation was unreasonable and violated the Fourth Amendment. Although there may be circumstances in which a strip search may be conducted incident to a lawful arrest, the strip search of Chris Nieves was not one of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED WITH COSTS.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b722-6\">.
