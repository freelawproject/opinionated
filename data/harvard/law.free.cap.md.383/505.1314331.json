Code (1975, 2000 Repl. Vol), \u00a7 13-101 <em>et seq. </em>of the Commercial Law Article (\u201cAct\u201d), permits the Consumer Protection Division to order a person adjudicated in violation of the Act to post a surety bond before engaging in further business transactions and to disclose certain financial information.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Our narrow holding is that \u00a7 13-403(b)(l) does not authorize the Division \u201cto take affirmative action\u201d either to require a violator of the Act to post a bond or to disclose financial information to aid the Division\u2019s enforcement of a cease and desist order. Thus, we affirm the judgment of the Circuit Court for Baltimore County.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-9\">\n<em>The Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b652-10\">Paris George, (\u201cGeorge\u201d),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> is the sole proprietor of a company that sells durable medical equipment and other supplies. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>He operates out of his home under various trade names, including Allied Home Healthcare, Allied Healthcare, Allied Medical Equipment Co., Maryland Home Healthcare Services, Access Professionals, and Access Medical Equipment Co. He advertises in the yellow pages the sale and rental of durable medical equipment, i.e., wheelchairs, scooters, and stairlifts, as well as sickroom equipment, i.e., hospital beds, bed rails, and bathing equipment. His customers are seriously ill or disabled people or their families. The average consumer paid George more than $800.00 for equipment while others paid as much as $6,000.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">In a hearing before Administrative Law Judge Beverly Sherman Nash (\u201cALJ\u201d), the ALJ found that George violated the Consumer Protection Act, Md. Code (1975, 2000 Repl. Vol), \u00a7 13-101 <em>et seq. </em>of the Commercial Law II Article, the Door-to-Door Sales Act, Md. Code (1975, 2000 Repl. Vol), \u00a7 14-301 <em>et seq. </em>of the Commercial Law II Article, and the Merchandise Delivery Law, (1975, 2000 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 14-1801 <em>et seq. </em>of the Commercial Law II Article. Specifically, the ALJ found that George engaged in repeated violations of the Acts by, among other things, failing to deliver the purchased items,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> claiming to be an authorized dealer of a certain manufacturer when he was not,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> failing to refund money after not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>delivering the product or after delivering nonconforming goods,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and charging sales tax on nontaxable items.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> He also failed to properly notify customers of their rights to cancel orders and to provide written estimated delivery dates as required by law. When customers called to inquire about their ordered products, their calls often went unreturned. When customers did reach a live person at Allied, the person often identified himself as \u201cPat,\u201d an alias used by George, who informed them that George was unavailable or that he, Pat, would check on their items and call them back, which he would fail to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">Based on the above violations, the Division issued a Final Order against George on June 24, 2002. George appealed to the Circuit Court for Baltimore County, the Honorable John F. Fader II, presiding. The circuit court affirmed the order in the following respects:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-5\">1. Ordering George to cease and desist from violating Maryland law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-6\">2. Requiring George to make modifications to the contracts used by him so as to comply with Maryland law and to give fair notice to customers;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-7\">3. To provide refunds and restitution;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-8\">4. To require George to list his prior customers and the specifics of transactions with them, so as to identify and locate individuals who may be entitled to a refund from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>him, and to establish a claims process for those who are entitled to a refund;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-4\">5. To pay restitution in the amount of $32,510.92;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-5\">6. To establish a restitution account to be maintained by the Division for future claims against George; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-6\">7. Imposing a civil penalty against George in the amount of $75,000 for violations of the consumer protection laws, and requiring that he pay the costs of the administrative proceedings in the amount of $4,357.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">The circuit court reversed the order of the Division with regard to the following two provisions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-8\">1. Requiring George to post a surety bond in the amount of $30,000 for the protection of future customers; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-9\">2. Requiring George to list his assets, sources of income, and a list of all transfers of assets or payments in an amount greater than $1,000 to anyone in the previous two years.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-10\">In reversing the order regarding the bond, the circuit court noted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-11\">[w]hile the court is aware of the general remedial purpose of the statutes to protect consumers, it is not convinced that the general right to \u201cfence in\u201d a person found to have violated the law includes the right to order the posting of a bond.... Where the Maryland Legislature has meant there to be a requirement for the posting of a bond, they have so provided as part of other statutory schemes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-12\">With regard to the second issue, the disclosure of George\u2019s assets and transfers, the circuit court noted \u201c[t]he statute does not give that authority; the Division can point to no specific case law interpreting any part of the State or Federal consumer protection statutes as giving this authority, and no case law interpretation can be strained or bent to say the authority exists.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b655-13\">On March 12, 2004, the court issued an order and monetary judgment against George in the amount of $111,867.92, repre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>senting the sum of the civil penalty, restitution order, and costs in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">The Division appealed the circuit court\u2019s conclusions regarding the surety bond and the financial disclosure provisions. The Division argues that \u201c[t]he [Division\u2019s] Order against George furthered the purpose of the Consumer Protection Act, was issued pursuant to the [Division\u2019s] statutory authority and was reasonably tailored to address the violations committed by George.... \u201d We granted <em>certiorari </em>before consideration of the matter in the Court of Special Appeals. 380 Md. 617, 846 A.2d 401 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">\n<em>Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b656-8\">In <em>Watkins v. Dept. of Public Safety and Correctional Services, </em>377 Md. 34, 831 A.2d 1079 (2003), Judge Battaglia, writing for this Court, summarized the relevant standard of review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-9\">Because an appellate court reviews the agency decision under the same statutory standards as the circuit court, we reevaluate the decision of the agency, not the lower court. Generally, \u201cjudicial review of administrative agency action is narrow.\u201d The reviewing court must not \u201csubstitute its judgment for the expertise of those persons who constitute the administrative agency.\u201d We must respect the expertise of the agency and accord deference to its interpretation of a statute that it administers; however, we \u201cmay always determine whether the administrative agency made an error of law.\u201d Typically, such a determination requires considering \u201c(1) the legality of the decision and (2) whether there was substantial evidence from the record as a whole to support the decision.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b656-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 45-46, 831 A.2d at 1086 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-11\">In interpreting a statute we have said that the \u201cpredominant goal, when construing statutes, is to ascertain and implement the legislative intent.\u201d <em>Baltimore County v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number><em>RTKL, </em>380 Md. 670, 678, 846 A.2d 433, 437 (2004).

Code (1975, 2000 Repl. Vol), \u00a7 13-101 <em>et seq. </em>of the Commercial Law II Article. <em>Consumer Protection Division v. Consumer Pub\u2019l Co., </em>304 Md. 731, 745, 501 A.2d 48, 55 (1985). In adopting the Act, the General Assembly concluded that \u201cit should take strong protective and preventive steps to investigate unlawful consumer practices, to assist the public in obtaining relief from these practices, and to prevent these practices from occurring in Maryland. It is the purpose of this title to accomplish these ends and thereby maintain the health and welfare of the citizens of the State.\u201d CL \u00a7 13-102(b)(3). The General Assembly further provided that the Act should be \u201cconstrued and applied liberally to promote its purpose.\u201d CL \u00a7 13-105.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">We summarized the statutory powers of the Division in <em>Consumer Publishing:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-9\">The statutory powers of the Division include the power to receive and investigate consumer complaints, initiate its own investigation of any possibly unfair and deceptive trade practices, issue cease and desist orders, adopt rules and regulations which further define unfair or deceptive trade practices or otherwise effectuate the purposes of the Act, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>and seek a temporary or permanent injunction in a civil enforcement proceeding. \u00a7\u00a7 13-204 and 13-403(c)(2). The statute further provides that the Division may \u201cexercise and perform any other function, power and duty appropriate to protect and promote the welfare of consumers.\u201d \u00a7 13-204(11).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b658-4\"><em>Consumer Publishing, </em>304 Md. at 745, 501 A.2d at 55.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">The cease and desist provision of the statute is found at CL \u00a7 13-403(b)(l). It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-7\">If, at the conclusion of the hearing, the Division determines on the preponderance of evidence that the alleged violator violated this title, the Division shall state its findings and issue an order requiring the violator to cease and desist from the violation and to take affirmative action, including the restitution of money or property. The order shall contain a notice which states that if the Division determines that the violator has not corrected the violation and complied with the order within 30 days following service of the order, the Division shall proceed with enforcement pursuant to this title.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b658-8\">CL \u00a7 13-403(c)(2) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-9\">To obtain compliance with its order, the Division may institute a civil proceeding, including a proceeding which seeks a restraining order and a temporary or permanent injunction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b658-10\">CL \u00a7 13-406 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-11\">(a) The Attorney General may seek an injunction to prohibit a person who has engaged or is engaging in a violation of this title from continuing or engaging in the violation, (b) The Attorney General shall serve notice of the general relief sought on the alleged violator at least seven days before the action for an injunction is filed, (c) The court may enter any order of judgment necessary to: (1) Prevent the use by a person of any prohibited practice; (2) Restore to a person any money or real or personal property acquired from him by means of any prohibited practice; or (3) Appoint a receiver in case of wilful violation of this title.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b659-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>\n<em>The Surety Bond</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b659-4\">The Division ordered George to post a surety bond in the amount of $30,000.00 within thirty days of the date of the Final Order.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Order provides that the bond</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>shall permit any consumer who suffers any loss in connection with his or her purchase of medical equipment, devices, supplies or related services from [George] to file a claim for their loss with the surety and, if the claim is not paid, to bring an action based on the bond and recover against the surety; the bond shall also permit the [Division] to file a claim with the surety for any loss suffered by a consumer in connection with his or her purchase of medical equipment, devices, supplies or related services from [George].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AFK\">According to the terms of the bond, it shall remain in effect for three years following the last claim made against it, or if no claims are made, for three years from the date that the bond is posted. In the alternative, George has the option of providing the Division with a letter of credit or cash deposit in the same amount, subject to the same rules, in lieu of posting the surety bond. Although the Division titled the bond a \u201csurety bond,\u201d it is clear that the purpose of the bond is to insure performance of any contract George entered into with consumers.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Thus, for the purposes of our analysis, we shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>treat the three options as a performance bond. <em>See </em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1158 (7th ed. 1999) (defining \u201cperformance bond\u201d as \u201ca bond given by a surety to ensure the timely performance of a contract\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">The trial court concluded that the Division exceeded its statutory authority by requiring the posting of a bond. The court noted the general remedial purpose of the Act but concluded that whenever the General Assembly has intended for the posting of a bond it has expressly done so in other statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">The Division contends that the authority to order the posting of a bond is encompassed within CL \u00a7 13^403(b)(l)\u2019s grant of authority \u201cto take affirmative action\u201d when a person is found to have violated the Act. The Division argues that the bond will protect future customers by providing a financial incentive to George to actually deliver the ordered goods and services because he otherwise will not make a profit on the sale. The bond will also provide an efficient means of financial recovery to future customers, allowing them to purchase the necessary equipment from an alternative dealer should George fail to deliver the correct goods. It notes that in the interim between when the Division\u2019s Order was issued and when the appeal was pending in the circuit court, George continued to take money from consumers for medical-related equipment and services without providing the equipment or a refund.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">The term \u201caffirmative action\u201d is not defined in the statute beyond the instruction that \u201caffirmative action\u201d includes \u201cthe restitution of money or property.\u201d CL \u00a7 13 \u2014 403(b)(1). In <em>Consumer Publishing, </em>we stated that the affirmative action language authorized the Division to include \u201caffirmative disclosure provisions\u201d in future advertisements.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Consumer Pub</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number><em>lishing, </em>304 Md. at 772 n. 18, 501 A.2d at 69 n. 18. In <em>Consumer Protection Division v. Outdoor World Corporation, </em>91 Md.App. 275, 603 A.2d 1376 (1992), the Court of Special Appeals applied the \u201caffirmative action\u201d language to authorize the Division to require that any future notices from an out-of-state campground sent into Maryland disclose, \u201cin meaningful terms, what would be expected of the recipients should they attempt to claim any prizes [advertised in the notice] and what the likelihood is that they will receive a prize of any significant value.\u201d <em>Outdoor World Corporation, </em>91 Md.App. at 290, 603 A.2d at 1383. And in <em>Luskin\u2019s Inc. v. Consumer Protection Division, </em>353 Md. 335, 726 A.2d 702 (1999), we acknowledged the Division\u2019s authority to require a violator to take \u201caffirmative ' action,\u201d but held that the cease and desist order in question imposed requirements that went beyond the deceptive practices engaged in by the violator in the underlying matter and was, therefore, too broad. <em>Luskin\u2019s, </em>353 Md. at 380-82, 726 A.2d at 724-25.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">We have addressed the meaning of the term \u201caffirmative action\u201d in cases involving the Commission on Human Relations, Md. Code (1957, 1972 Repl. Vol.), Art. 49B, which contained a provision with statutory language similar to the language in question here. Section 14(e) of Art. 49B authorized the Commission to issue a cease and desist order provided that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-5\">If upon all the evidence, the Commission finds that the respondent has engaged in any discriminatory act within the scope of any of these subtitles, it shall so state its findings. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>The Commission thereupon shall issue and cause to be served upon the respondent an order requiring the respondent to cease and desist from the discriminatory acts and to take such <em>affirmative action </em>as will effectuate the purpose of the particular subtitle. (Emphasis added.)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ajv\">Expounding upon the term \u201caffirmative action,\u201d in <em>Bulluck v. Pelham Wood Apartments, </em>283 Md. 505, 520, 390 A.2d 1119, 1127 (1978), we said that the term \u201caffirmative action\u201d authorized the Commission to require an apartment complex \u201cto initiate a program of tenant recruitment designed to reach minorities\u201d after the apartment complex was found to have engaged in a discriminatory action in violation of \u00a7 14(e) of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-4\">In <em>Gutwein v. Easton Publishing Company, </em>272 Md. 563, 325 A.2d 740 (1974), however, we held that the term \u201caffirmative action\u201d did not authorize the Commission to order monetary awards for compensatory or other damages resulting from the discriminatory practices. <em>Gutwein, </em>272 Md. at 575, 325 A.2d at 746. Similar to the argument of the Division here that the purpose of the surety bond is to provide financial recovery for victims and protect future customers from fraud, it was argued in <em>Gutwein </em>that the purpose of the monetary award was \u201cto make whole victims of discrimination as well as insure against future unlawful conduct.\u201d <em>Gutwein, </em>272 Md. at 568, 325 A.2d at 743. We concluded that based on \u201cthe Commission\u2019s legislative background, the failure of [\u00a7 13(e)] to specifically authorize an award of compensatory damages, the unlikelihood of a legislative grant of unbridled power to an administrative agency to make monetary awards without guidelines or limitations, and the [state and federal cases cited in the opinion],\u201d that the Commission exceeded its statutory authority by awarding compensatory damages.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Gutwein, </em>272 Md. at 576-77, 325 A.2d at 747.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>Based on the cases discussed above, it is clear that the term \u201caffirmative action\u201d may be used to justify a variety of actions taken by the Division when those actions are corrective measures that address the specific violations that are the subject matter of the Division\u2019s Final Order. <em>See Consumer Publishing, </em>304 Md. 731, 501 A.2d 48; <em>Outdoor World, </em>91 Md.App. 275, 603 A.2d 1376; <em>Bulluck, </em>283 Md. 505, 390 A.2d 1119. It is equally clear, however, that the term \u201caffirmative action\u201d will not justify all actions taken by the Division simply because they are in furtherance of the purpose of the statute. <em>See Luskin\u2019s, </em>353 Md. 335, 726 A.2d 702; <em>Gutwein, </em>272 Md. 563, 325 A.2d 740. When the interpretation of \u201caffirmative action\u201d sought by the Division is not supported by the \u201crelevant indicia of statutory intent,\u201d we will not uphold the Division\u2019s interpretation. <em>See RTKL, </em>380 Md. at 678, 846 A.2d at 438 (noting that in interpreting ambiguous statutory language, \u201cthe [language] can take its proper meaning only by reference to other relevant indicia of legislative intent, the clearest and most pertinent evidence of which lies in other provisions of the statute ... \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">According to the Division\u2019s own assessment, the bond is designed to ensure future compliance with the Act. We agree with the Division that the requirement of posting a bond is an action in furtherance of the purposes of the statute. The bond will \u201cassist the public in obtaining relief from [unlawful consumer] practices, and ... prevent these practices from occurring in Maryland.\u201d <em>See </em>CL \u00a7 13-102(b)(3). If read in isolation, the term \u201caffirmative action\u201d may indeed justify the posting of a bond. We do not, however, read ambiguous statutory language in isolation. Here, the express language of the statute provides the Division a means of enforcing future compliance of its orders. The Division may institute other civil proceedings to restrain or enjoin continuing violations of its orders when a cease and desist order proves to be ineffective in stopping the unfair and deceptive practice. CL \u00a7\u00a7 13-403(b)(1), 13-403(c)(2), and 13-406; <em>Outdoor World, </em>91 Md.App. at 289, 603 A.2d at 1383 (\u201cSections 13-403 and 13-406 authorize the Attorney General to require violators of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>Consumer Protection Act to cease their violations and upon noncompliance, to seek an injunction against continued violations.\u201d). Because the plain language of the statute specifically addresses the steps to take in the case of noncompliance with the Act, we will not strain for a reading of the statute that would permit the same result as one expressly authorized. To do so would constitute a violation of the rule of statutory construction which requires that we \u201clook first to the words of the statute....\u201d <em>RTKL, </em>880 Md. at 678, 846 A.2d at 437. The Division has broad authority to construct the roadblock necessary to \u201cclose all roads to the prohibited goal,\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> it must do so, however, within the confines of the statutory authorization which in this case requires intervention of the courts.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b666-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>The Consumer Protection Division and the Attorney General of Maryland, like the Federal Trade Commission, clearly have a mandate \u201cto protect the consumer\u201d from \u201cdeceptive practices.\u201d <em>See </em>CL \u00a7 13-102; <em>Consumer Publishing, </em>304 Md. at 765, 501 A.2d at 66. Not unlike the FTC which has \u201cwide discretion in its choice of a remedy deemed adequate to cope with the unlawful practice disclosed,\u201d <em>(Ruberoid, </em>343 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>at 473, 72 S.Ct. at 803, 96 L.Ed. at 1087 (internal citation omitted)), the Maryland Consumer Protection Division also has \u201cbroad powers to enforce and interpret the Consumer Protection Act.\u201d <em>Consumer Publishing, </em>304 Md. at 745, 501 A.2d at 55.

A mechanism for determining individual consumer claims is also set forth in the Order. Additionally, if the $32,510.92 proves to be insufficient for satisfying claims against George, the Division is required to notify him of any necessary additional sums. George would then have 14 days to comply by submitting the additional funds. The two provisions of the restitution section in question on this appeal state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-6\">31.

As a follow through, the Division points to Rule 2-633 allowing a creditor to take steps in aid to enforce a judgment. Simply stated, the Division does not yet have a judgment.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">The Division, on the other hand, contends that the authority to require the disclosure is encompassed in CL \u00a7\u00a7 13-403(b)(1) and 13-410 which authorize the Division to order restitution and civil penalties. As previously noted, George has been ordered to pay $32,510.90 in restitution and $75,000 in civil penalties. The disclosure provisions, according to the Division, are designed to facilitate the payment of the money owed by George. It contends that, \u201c[requiring George to provide [the financial] information was a reasonable exercise of the [Division\u2019s] authority to order affirmative action, including the payment of restitution ... and fulfill the General Assembly\u2019s stated purpose of \u2018assisting the public in obtaining relief from these [unlawful] practices\u2019.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">There is no doubt that the Division may order an alleged violator to pay restitution if, based on a preponderance of the evidence, the Division determines the alleged violator violated the Act. CL \u00a7 13-403(b)(l). The Division may also assess civil penalties, not to exceed $1,000 per violation of the Act, for first time offenders, (CL \u00a7 13-410(a)), and not more than $5,000 per subsequent violation. CL \u00a7 13-410(b). The question is whether the Division\u2019s authority to assess penalties encompasses the authority to enforce the penalties through the disclosure of financial information as a requirement in a cease and desist order. We hold that it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">We have held that an order of restitution pursuant to the Act is intended to divest a violator of \u201c \u2018benefits it would be unjust for him to keep.\u2019 \u201d <em>Luskin\u2019s Inc. v. Consumer Protection Division, </em>353 Md. 335, 383, 726 A.2d 702, 726 (1999) (discussing the purpose of restitution verses damages and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>finding that an order of restitution is \u201c \u2018not aimed at compensating the plaintiff but at forcing the defendant to disgorge benefits it would be unjust for him to keep.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Consumer Publishing, </em>304 Md. at 776, 501 A.2d at 71); <em>State v. Andrews, </em>73 Md.App. 80, 89 n. 7, 533 A.2d 282, 287 n. 7 (1987) (\u201cTo permit the [retention of] even a portion of the illicit profits would impair the full impact of the deterrent force that is essential if adequate enforcement [of the law] is to be achieved.\u201d) (quoting <em>Consumer Publishing). </em>To this end the General Assembly has expressly authorized the Division to apply to a court for an \u201corder of judgment necessary to restore to a person any money or real personal property acquired from him by means of any prohibited practice.\u201d CL \u00a7 13M06(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-4\">In this ease, the order of restitution represents money George took from consumers in violation of the Act. Clearly, it would be unjust for George to continue to profit from his behavior by eluding the restitution order. The proper procedure for preventing this outcome, according to the express language of the statute, is for the Division to obtain a judgment. Armed with a money judgment, the Division could obtain information to aid in its enforcement of the judgment. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 2-633(a) (Circuit Court) (\u201cA judgment creditor may obtain discovery to aid enforcement of a money judgment (1) by use of depositions, interrogatories, and request for documents.\u201d); Md. Rule 3-633(a) (District Court) (\u201cA judgment creditor may obtain discovery to aid enforcement of a money judgment (1) by use of interrogatories pursuant to Rule 3-421.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">On March 12, 2004, the Division obtained a judgment against George in the amount of $111,867.92. Pursuant to the above mentioned rules the Division is in the position to enforce the judgment. The Division erred by seeking the information prior to receiving an order of judgment from a court of appropriate jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">JUDG1MENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE COUNTY AFFIRMED WITH COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b652-11\">. The Division states the issue as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-12\">Did the Consumer Protection Division err when, pursuant to \u00a7 13-403(b)(1) of the Consumer Protection Act, it ordered Paris George, who had repeatedly taken substantial amounts of money from consumers for medical goods and related services that George did not provide, to take affirmative action consisting of the posting of a security designed to prevent reoccurrence of his past violations and the disclosure of financial information to facilitate redress of past violations?</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b652-13\">.

In one instance, a customer contacted George to purchase a chairlift. After George met with the customer and her husband in their home in February of 1999, the customer contracted to purchase a chairlift for $2,650.00. The customer gave George a deposit of $1,886.50 representing two thirds of the purchase price and sales tax of $134.75. George gave the customer a receipt indicating installation would take place in 30 days. After 30 days passed with no word from George, the customer repeatedly attempted to get in contact with George. lie never returned the calls.
