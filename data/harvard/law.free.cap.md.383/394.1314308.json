The arrests, charges and convictions followed the search of 4011 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>Boarman Avenue, in Baltimore City, by officers of the Baltimore City Police Department, pursuant to a search and seizure warrant. The warrant incorporated by reference the affidavit of the police officer affiants, O\u2019Ree and Brickus. In that affidavit, they indicated that a \u201crushed or no knock forced entry\u201d of the premises would be required. The issue that this case presents is whether, where there is no statute so providing, a judge is authorized to issue a \u201cno-knock\u201d warrant, on the basis of which the police may make a \u201cno-knock\u201d entry to execute a search and seizure warrant.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Court of Special Appeals affirmed the judgments of conviction, holding both that a \u201cno-knock\u201d entry was justified by the exigent circumstances detailed in the search and seizure warrant, thus affirmatively validating the propriety of the issuance of a \u201cno-knock\u201d warrant, and that, in any event, the \u201cgood faith\u201d exception to the exclusionary rule \u201csaved\u201d the admissibility of the evidence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We shall reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">After conducting an investigation, police officers O\u2019Ree and Brickus applied for, and obtained, a search and seizure warrant for the Boarman Avenue premises, the petitioners,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>black Nissan Sentra, which they alleged was driven by the petitioners and associated with their operation. The application for the search warrant, which included the officers\u2019 affidavit, enumerated the applicants\u2019 considerable experience,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and detailed their investigation,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> including the conclusions they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>reached as a result of that investigation. Then, the applicants submitted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-5\">\u201cThe prior experience of your Affiant [sic] indicates that nareotic/drug dealers/users have, carry, and use Firearms to protect their operations. This protection is both from the Police and other drug dealers/users who may try to seize the drugs or moneys gained from the operation. These Firearms include handguns, rifles and shotguns. These weapons allow the drug dealer/user to operate openly and freely; also enabling them to retaliate against anyone they feel threatened by. The possession of these weapons is an extension of the narcotic operation and/or conspiracy being conducted. Due to the nature of the evidence you [sic] Affiant [sic] is seeking to seize in this investigation, specifically Article 27 Section 275-302 of the Annotated Code of Maryland. Your Affiant [sic] must gain entry quickly and safely into the dwelling. If entry is stalled or delayed the controlled dangerous substance can easily and quickly be destroyed. Therefore, Your Affiant [sic] will attempt to gain entry by the rush or No-Knock forced entry. This will enable the Entry Team to recover the evidence intact and provide members of the entry team with a margin of safety from weapons, which may be on the scene.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">A judge issued the search and seizure warrant. Although the warrant did not do so explicitly, no express provision to that effect being included in the warrant, because it \u201cincorporated by reference\u201d the affidavit of Officers O\u2019Ree and Brickus, which stated their intention \u201cto gain entry by the rush or No-Knock forced entry,\u201d the warrant implicitly authorized a \u201cno-knock entry.\u201d In executing the warrant, the police neither knocked, nor announced their presence or purpose; rather, they gained entry, as they stated that they intended to do, through the use of force. The petitioners were found in a second floor bedroom, in which various weapons and drug paraphernalia also were found. In a refrigerator in that same room, the officers recovered a large ziplock baggie containing 60 smaller baggies of suspected marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>The petitioners moved, pre-trial, to suppress<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the evidence seized during the search. Their argument was directed to, and challenged, the sufficiency of the showing the affiants made to justify the issuance of the warrant, which the petitioners characterized as a \u201cno-knock\u201d warrant. More particularly, the petitioners argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that the facts alleged in the affidavit submitted in support of the search and seizure warrant were insufficient to justify a \u201cno-knock entry.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Circuit Court denied the motion to suppress. It held that, in light of their wealth of experience in the area of narcotics drug enforcement, as detailed in their affidavit, the police officers\u2019 determination that a no-knock entry was required was not \u201cirrational.\u201d It reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-5\">\u201cSomewhat more vexing is the consideration whether the warrant itself provides say a sufficient basis for a no-knock forced entry. The cases, which have been discussed by the defense, and reviewed by the Court, largely involve situations in which law enforcement officers were confronted with situations which post entry were determined either to rise to the level of exigency permitting no-knock entry or failed to meet that standard, and thus require suppression \u201cNo cases were found in which the issue presented was, in this context, in which there was pre-raid approval for a no-knock entry on a set of facts which essentially recite the officers\u2019 general and specific experience in law enforcement, from which they extrapolate the need, as they perceive it, for a no-knock entry. It is, of course, well-settled in search and seizure law that the issuing judge is permitted to rely upon the experience of law enforcement officers and the conclusions which reasonably flow from that experience in making the probable cause determination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>\u201cI see no reason to depart from that pattern when the examination is not the presence or absence of probable cause, but is instead the existence of exigencies meriting a no-knock entry. It is, in any event, a closet ] question for the Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-5\">\u201cHowever, crediting the affiant\u2019s experience which involves hundreds of narcotics arrests, extensive training, and considerable experience in narcotics law enforcement, I cannot conclude that their conclusion with respect to the likeliness of firearms on the property is an irrational one.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">Both of the petitioners timely appealed. In separate opinions, by different panels of the court, the Court of Special Appeals affirmed the judgments of the Circuit Court. With regard to petitioner Adams, the court, in an unreported opinion, declined to consider whether the affidavit submitted in support of the application for the search and seizure warrant sufficiently alleged facts to authorize a \u201cno-knock\u201d warrant. Instead, it held that \u201ceven if the application for the search warrant did not set forth legally sufficient exigent circumstances justifying a \u2018no-knock\u2019 warrant, the evidence seized should not be suppressed under the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule.\u201d The court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-7\">\u201cAlthough the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule has not been considered by the appellate courts of this State in the context of a \u2018no knock\u2019 warrant, facially valid but later determined to have been issued on an insufficient showing of exigent circumstances, other courts have applied it in that context. <em>U.S. v. Carter, </em>999 F.2d 182, 184-87 (7th Cir.1993); <em>U.S. v. Moore, </em>956 F.2d 843, 851 (8th Cir.1992); <em>State v. Hughes, </em>589 N.W.2d 912, 915-16 (N.D.1999). We find those decisions persuasive and accordingly affirm Adams\u2019s convictions and sentences.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">Petitioner Davis\u2019s conviction was also affirmed, as previously indicated. In that case, which the intermediate appellate court reported, <em>see Davis v. State, </em>144 Md.App. 144, 797 A.2d 84 (2002), however, the court determined that the affidavit contained sufficient facts to establish a reasonable suspicion of the then existence of exigent circumstances and, thus, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>permit a judge to make a pre-entry finding that a \u201cno-knock\u201d entry onto the premises was justified. <em>Id. </em>at 152-58, 797 A.2d at 89-93. Pointing to the experience of the affiant officers, as set forth in their affidavit, the court credited their conclusion that those involved in the drug trade often are dangerous and carry weapons and that drugs are easily and quickly destroyed when entry onto the premises is delayed or stalled. The court further observed that the affidavit indicated that large amounts of drugs had been seized as a result of information supplied by one of their sources, the reliable confidential registered source, that several people resided in the dwelling, and that the petitioner\u2019s co-defendant Adams had several previous arrests for drug violations,\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>id. </em>at 158, 797 A.2d at 93, all of which, it concluded, supported its holding. Alternatively, the intermediate appellate court held that, even if the no-knock entry were illegal in that case, the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule applied to render the evidence seized in the case admissible. <em>Id. </em>at 159, 797 A.2d at 93. The court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-5\">\u201cOther courts have applied the good faith exception to cases involving the issuing of a no-knock search warrant. <em>See United States v. Tisdale, </em>195 F.3d 70 (2nd Cir.1999); <em>United States v. Carter, </em>999 F.2d 182 (7th Cir.1993); <em>United States v. Moland, </em>996 F.2d 259 (10th Cir.1993); <em>United States v. Moore, </em>956 F.2d 843 (8th Cir.1992); <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>164 F.Supp.2d 119,(D.Mass.2001); <em>United States v. Rivera, </em>2000 WL 761976, 2000 U.S. Dist. Lexis 7997 (D. Maine 2000); <em>United States v. Brown, </em>69 F.Supp.2d 518 (S.D.N.Y.1999); <em>United States v. Tavarez, </em>995 F.Supp. 443 (S.D.N.Y.1998); <em>State v. Van Beek, </em>591 N.W.2d 112 (N.D.1999); <em>State v. Eason, </em>245 Wis.2d 206, 629 N.W.2d 625 (2001). We agree with those decisions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-6\"><em>% </em>^ sfc H\u00ed</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-7\">\u201c[EJven if we had concluded that Judge Sweeney should not have authorized a no-knock entry in this case, we would not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>reverse appellant\u2019s conviction. Suppressing evidence under these circumstances would not serve the purpose of the exclusionary rule, which is designed to deter police misconduct rather than to punish police for the errors of judges and magistrates. When the police officers follow the proper course of conduct by seeking a no-knock search warrant, the good faith exception applies.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b548-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 160, 797 A.2d at 94.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">This Court granted the petitions for certiorari in both cases, <em>Adams v. State, </em>369 Md. 570, 801 A.2d 1031 (2002); <em>Davis v. State, </em>370 Md. 268, 805 A.2d 265 (2002), to address whether the intermediate appellate court correctly resolved the issues they presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">In this Court, petitioner Davis challenges, once again, the sufficiency of the factual support offered to justify the issuance of a \u201cno-knock\u201d warrant. He argues that, taken as a whole, the factual averments simply are insufficient, under <em>Richards v. Wisconsin, </em>520 U.S. 385, 117 S.Ct. 1416, 137 L.Ed.2d 615 (1997), to justify use of a \u201cno-knock\u201d entry to execute the subject warrant. In that case, the petitioner notes, the Supreme Court held that police officers may not rely on general allegations that narcotics investigations, <em>per se, </em>present circumstances that warrant no-knock entries, 520 U.S. at 388, 117 S.Ct. at 1417, 137 L.Ed.2d at 620, and that, in each case, the police and/or the court, as the case may be, must consider whether the facts of that particular case constitute an exigency sufficient to warrant a no-knock entry. Id. at 395, 117 S.Ct. at 1421, 137 L.Ed.2d at 625.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">Davis characterizes the invocation, by the applicants for the \u201cno-knock\u201d warrant, of their experience to establish that the petitioners, the suspected marijuana dealers, \u201cha[d], carried] and use[d] Firearms to protect their operations\u201d as \u201ca conclusory statement that drugs and weapons go hand-in-hand\u201d and submits that that use of experience, to create a reasonable suspicion that \u201c[i]f entry is stalled or delayed the controlled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>dangerous substance can easily and quickly be destroyed\u201d results in a \u201cconsiderable overgeneralization,\u201d of the kind against which the <em>Richards </em>Court cautioned. See 520 U.S. at 393, 117 S.Ct. at 1421, 137 L.Ed.2d at 623. Nor does petitioner Davis agree that the additional factors identified by the <em>Davis </em>court provide the requisite showing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-5\">\u201cEven with this additional information, the affidavit fails to establish the requisite reasonable suspicion that exigent circumstances existed to justify not knocking and announcing. Rather, the \u2018large amount of drugs\u2019 supports the petitioner\u2019s position that the danger of destruction of evidence was insignificant, the fact that \u2018several people resided in the dwelling\u2019 was not alleged to create any extra danger, and unlike the defendant in <em>Wynn [v. State, </em>117 Md.App. 133, 699 A.2d 512 (1997) ], the fact that Adams had \u2018several arrests for drug violations\u2019 does not in any way suggest that Adams had a propensity for violence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">Both of the petitioners deny that the \u201cgood faith\u201d exception to the warrant requirement is applicable to save the admissibility of the evidence in this case. This is so, they submit, because the police could not have acted objectively and reasonably because the offer of conclusory statements based on unsupported assumptions, rather than case specific and particularized facts, has been rejected, by <em>Richards, </em>as a sufficient basis for establishing a reasonable suspicion of the existence of exigency warranting a \u201cno-knock\u201d entry. As petitioner Adams puts it, \u201cto apply the \u2018good faith\u2019 exception to a no-knock authorization based on an affidavit\u2019s categorical statements about drug dealers is to create just another prohibited <em>per se </em>rule.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">The State, of course, does not agree. On the contrary, it proffers three arguments as to why this Court, as did the Court of Special Appeals, should affirm the judgment of the Circuit Court. With respect to the sufficiency of the factual allegations in support of a \u201cno-knock\u201d entry, it argues, pointing to the factors the intermediate appellate court identified in <em>Davis, </em>that they were of \u201cdetails specific to the case and supported the inference that knocking and announcing could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>pose a danger to police officer or risk the destruction of evidence.\u201d Also significant to the State, is the fact that authorization for the \u201cno-knock\u201d entry was sought from a judicial officer, in the request for the search . and seizure warrant, as to which a different, more deferential, standard of review from that applicable to an on the scene determination by the officers applies. Application of that standard to the case <em>sub judice, </em>the State submits, properly resulted in the trial judge upholding the no knock entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">Referencing the test of objective good faith set out in <em>United States v. Leon, </em>468 U.S. 897, 922 n. 23, 104 S.Ct. 3405, 3420 n. 23, 82 L.Ed.2d 677, 698 (1984), \u201cwhether a reasonably well-trained officer would have known that the search was illegal despite the magistrate\u2019s authorization,\u201d the State argues that the applicants \u201crelied in good faith on the warrant\u2019s authorization to conduct a no-knock entry, and thus, the evidence seized is admissible pursuant to the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">Finally, the State submits that, assuming a violation of the knock-and-announce rule, the evidence would be admissible pursuant to the independent source and inevitable discovery doctrines.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-6\">\u201cThe right of the people to be secure in their person, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">Its clear and unequivocal purpose is to protect against unreasonable searches and seizures and, because it recognizes \u201c \u2018the overriding respect for the sanctity of the home that has been embedded in our traditions since the origins of the Republic,\u2019 \u201d <em>Oliver v.

Pierson, </em>238 Neb. 872, 472 N.W.2d 898, 900-901 (1991) (citing Neb.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 29-411, which permits entry without notice when \u201cthe judge or magistrate issuing a search warrant has inserted therein that the officer executing it shall not be required to give such notice\u201d); <em>United States v.

Indeed, Maryland, by statute, does not in any way prescribe how search warrants are to be executed; unlike many of its sister states, <em>see, </em>e.g. CAL. Penal Code \u00a7 1531 (2000); FLA. STAT. ANN. \u00a7 901.19 (West 1997); OHIO REV. CODE. ANN. \u00a7 2935.12 (West 1990); PA. STAT. ANN. \u00a7 208 (West 2001), it does not have a \u201cknock and announce\u201d statute. The only statute regulating search and seizure warrants in Maryland when this warrant was issued was codified at Maryland Code (1957, 1996 Replacement Volume) Article 27, \u00a7 551.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> It authorized District and Circuit Court judges to issue search and seizure warrants, established the standard to be applied to their issuance, and prescribed the contents of the application for search warrant and for the search warrant, itself. That statute has been recodified, without substantive change, at Maryland Code (2001) \u00a7 1-203 of the Criminal Procedure Article. In pertinent part, \u00a7 1-203, as \u00a7 551 had done, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-5\">\u201c(a) <em>In general. </em>\u2014 (1) A circuit court judge or District Court judge may issue forthwith a search warrant whenever it is made to appear to the judge, by application as de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>scribed in paragraph (2) of this subsection, that there is probable cause to believe that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-5\">\u201c(i) a misdemeanor or felony is being committed by a person or in a building, apartment premises, place, or thing within the territorial jurisdiction of the judge; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"APr\">\u201c(ii) property subject to seizure under the criminal laws of the State is on the person or in or on the building, apartment, premises, place, or thing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-6\">\u201c(2) An application for a search warrant shall be:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-7\">\u201c(i) in writing;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-8\">\u2018(ii) signed and sworn to by the applicant; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AZ_\">\u2018(iii) accompanied by an affidavit that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-9\">\u201c1. sets forth the basis for probable cause as described in paragraph (1) of this subsection; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A8V\">\u201c2. contains facts within the personal knowledge of the affiant that there is probable cause.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-10\">\u201c(3) The search warrant shall:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-11\">\u201c(i) be directed to a duly constituted police officer and authorize the police officer to search the suspected person, building, apartment, premises, place, or thing and to seize any property found subject to seizure under the criminal laws of the State; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A9B\">\u201c(ii) name or describe, with reasonable particularity:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-12\">\u201c1. the person, building, apartment, premises, place, or thing to be searched;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-13\">\u201c2. the grounds for the search; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-14\">\u201c3. the name of the applicant on whose application the search warrant was issued.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-16\">Nevertheless, it has long been the law in Maryland that law enforcement officers executing a search and seizure warrant for an individual\u2019s private residence must knock and announce their presence before entering and searching. <em>State v. Lee, </em>374 Md. 275, 283-86, 821 A.2d 922, 926-28 (2003) (detailing the history of the knock and announce doctrine in Maryland); <em>Henson v. State, </em>236 Md. 518, 521-22, 204 A.2d 516, 518-19 (1964) (holding that police officer \u201cmust give <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>proper notice of his purpose and authority and be denied admittance before he can use force to enter the premises to be searched\u201d); <em>Frankel v. State, </em>178 Md. 558, 561, 16 A.2d 98, 97 (1940) (recognizing that \u201can officer in executing a warrant to enter a house, which warrant is valid on its face, may break open the doors if denied admittance, but a demand is necessary prior to breaking doors when the premises are in the charge of someone.\u201d); <em>Goodman v. State, </em>178 Md. 1, 8, 11 A.2d 635, 639 (1940) (\u201cA demand is necessary prior to the breaking in of the doors only where some person is found in charge of the building to be searched.\u201d (citation omitted)). The reasons for the knock and announce requirement were well stated in <em>Henson, </em>which noted that it is rooted in an individual\u2019s right to privacy in his or her own home and promotes the principle that \u201cbecause the dweller in the house would not know the purpose of the person breaking in, unless he were notified, and would have a right to resist seeming aggression on his private property.\u201d 236 Md. at 522, 204 A.2d at 519.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">The Maryland knock and announce requirement is rooted in the Common Law and is consistent with, and mirrors, Supreme Court precedent. That Court, in <em>Miller v. U.S., </em>357 U.S. 301, 306-307, 78 S.Ct. 1190, 1194, 2 L.Ed.2d 1332 (1958) noted that, although the knock and announce law applicable in that case was mandated by a federal statute, namely 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3108, which provided that \u201can officer, executing a search warrant, may break open a door only if, \u2018after notice of his authority and purpose,\u2019 he is denied admittance,\u201d the requirement that officers announce their presence before entering premises to be searched springs from the \u201cearliest days, [when] the common law drastically limited the authority of law officers to break the door of a house to effect an arrest.\u201d It cautioned that \u201c[t]he requirement of prior notice of authority and purpose before forcing entry into a home ... should not be given grudging application.\u201d 357 U.S. at 313, 78 S.Ct. at 1198, 2 L.Ed.2d at 1340. Relying on <em>Miller, </em>in <em>Sabbath v. U.S., </em>391 U.S. 585, 589-90, 88 S.Ct. 1755, 1758-59, 20 L.Ed.2d 828, 833-834 (1968), the Court held that a California State statute identical to the federal statute prohibiting entry pursu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>ant to a search warrant, unless an officer first knocked and announced his or her presence, was not limited only to when force was used to enter the premises but rather, placing emphasis on the lack of announcement, applied to any entry without announcement. <em>See Wilson v. Arkansas, </em>514 U.S. 927, 115 S.Ct. 1914, 131 L.Ed.2d 976 (1995) for a detailed discussion of the knock and announce rule, its vintage and importance.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">It is now clear that the knock and announce requirement is rooted in the Fourth Amendment reasonableness analysis, <em>see Wilson, </em>514 U.S. at 929, 115 S.Ct. at 1915, 131 L.Ed.2d at 979, the touchstone of which is the \u201c \u2018reasonableness in all the circumstances of the particular governmental invasion of a citizen\u2019s personal security; reasonableness depends on a balance between the public interest and the individual\u2019s right to personal security free from arbitrary interference by law officers.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Pennsylvania v. Mimms, </em>434 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>U.S. 106, 108-109, 98 S.Ct. 330, 332, 54 L.Ed.2d 331, 335 (1977), quoting <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 19, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 1878, 20 L.Ed.2d 889, 904 (1968). In addition, as this Court already had done, <em>see Henson, </em>236 Md. at 523-25, 204 A.2d at 519-20,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>Wilson </em>made clear that the announcement requirement is not rigid; the Fourth Amendment privacy interests must be balanced with the need for effective law enforcement and police safety. The \u201cflexible requirement of reasonableness [, therefore,] should not be read to mandate a rigid rule of announcement that ignores countervailing law enforcement interests.\u201d <em>Wilson, </em>514 U.S. at 934, 115 S.Ct. at 1918, 131 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>L.Ed.2d at 982 (1995). The Court, in <em>Wilson, </em>declined, however, to enunciate clear rules for when a given set of facts would be sufficient to constitute an articulated exigency warranting an exception to the knock and announce rule, preferring to leave that determination to development by the state courts. Nor did the Court address the timing of the exigency showing. And, although the Court commented on the subject in <em>Richards v. Wisconsin, </em>520 U.S. 385, 396 n. 7, 117 S.Ct. 1416, 1422 n. 7, 137 L.Ed.2d 615, 625 n. 7 (1997),<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> it has not decided it.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">As to the latter, as we have seen <em>supra, </em>some states have enacted \u201cno-knock\u201d warrant statutes, thus expressly authoriz<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>ing the issuance, by judicial officers, of search and seizure warrants, which permit the police to enter the premises to be searched without knocking and announcing. There is a split of authority among states that do not have \u201cno-knock\u201d warrant statutes as to whether judicial officers may, nevertheless, authorize \u201cno-knock\u201d entries when they issue a search and seizure warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">Some courts hold that \u201cno-knock\u201d warrants may be issued only if there is statutory authority to do so. <em>Parsley v. Superior Court, </em>9 Cal.3d 934, 109 Cal.Rptr. 563, 513 P.2d 611, 615 (1973) (holding that the magistrate was without power to pre-authorize violation of knock and announce requirement, observing, \u201cthe key to permissible unannounced entry is knowledge of exigent circumstances possessed by police officers at the time of entry\u201d); <em>State v. Bamber, </em>630 So.2d 1048, 1050-51 (Fla.1994) (\u201cNo statutory authority exists under Florida law for issuing a no-knock search warrant,\u201d citing <em>Parsley </em>); <em>State v. Eminowicz, </em>21 Ariz.App. 417, 520 P.2d 330, 331-32 (1974) (holding that justice of the peace \u201chad no authority, statutory or judicial, to issue a \u201cno-knock\u201d search warrant,\u201d observing, \u201cWhere the legislature has enacted a statute dealing with execution of a search warrant which is clear and unambiguous on its face, we, as a court may not weigh the reasons for and against such a statute-that is the province of the legislature.\u201d); <em>State v.

State, </em>136 Md.App. 458, 484-494, 766 A.2d 190, 203-209 (2001)), the intermediate appellate court concluded that \u201c[t]his preference should be equally applicable to \u201cno-knock\u201d warrants.\u201d 144 Md.App. at 156, 797 A.2d at 92. Thus, the court instructed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-8\">\u201cIf at the time he or she is applying for a search warrant, a law enforcement officer believes that the circumstances under which the warrant will be executed justify dispensing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>with the knock and announce requirement, the officer should seek no-knock authorization from the warrant issuing judge. If the judge is satisfied that the request for a no-knock entry is reasonable, the judge should include in the warrant a mandate that, in substantially the following form, ... provides:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-5\">\n<em>\u2018Good cause being shown therefor, the executing law enforcement officers are authorized to enter the premises to be searched without giving notice of their authority and purpose.\u2019</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-6\">\u201cMoreover, when they apply for no-knock authorization in a search warrant, law enforcement officers do not have to include in the affidavit the kind of search scene case-specific, particularized circumstances of exigency that they would have to establish during the suppression hearing if they did not have a no-knock provision in the warrant and made the no-knock entry determination on their own.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b563-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 156-57, 797 A.2d at 91-92 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">It was from this premise that the Court of Special Appeals, in this case, proceeded to the analysis of the factual allegations in support of exigency. Critical to the analysis was the court\u2019s view that the quality of \u201cthe search scene case-specific, particularized circumstances of exigency\u201d required is different when the \u201cno-knock\u201d authorization is obtained from a judicial officer, it is sought when the warrant is applied for, than when the decision to enter the premises without knocking and announcing is made on the scene, without judicial intervention. As the intermediate appellate court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-9\">\u201cDispensing with the search scene case-specific particularized circumstances of exigency for law enforcement officers seeking no-knock authorization from a judicial officer serves the public interest. It is more beneficial for law enforcement officers to seek no-knock authorization in a search warrant, rather than make their own independent on-the-scene determination of whether to enter without knocking and announcing. If law enforcement officers had to make an identical showing of exigency regardless of whether they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>received no-knock authorization in the search warrant, there would be no incentive to seek judicial authorization prior to entering without knocking and announcing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 157 n. 7, 797 A.2d at 92 n. 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">Subsequently, in two cases, <em>See State v. Riley, </em>147 Md.App. 113, 807 A.2d 797 (2002) and <em>Carroll v. State, </em>149 Md.App. 598, 817 A.2d 927 (2003), the Court of Special Appeals confirmed this approach. In <em>Riley, </em>the issue was the correctness of a ruling by the Circuit Court for Baltimore County invalidating a search and seizure warrant containing a \u201cno-knock\u201d provision because the application for the warrant did not provide sufficient justification for a \u201cno-knock\u201d entry. <em>Id. </em>at 117, 807 A.2d at 799-800. More specifically, the question presented involved determining to what deference a decision by a warrant issuing judge is entitled to be given by a reviewing judge; as the intermediate appellate court framed it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-7\">\u201cWhat will control the outcome of this appeal is the procedural posture in which the set of facts appears. In different postures, the same set of facts may yield diametrically different, albeit equally proper, results. It may make a critical difference whether the judge whose decision is being appealed was 1) properly making a decision on the merits of such exigency or 2) reviewing another judge\u2019s prior decision in that regard. It may make a critical difference whether the set of ostensibly exigent circumstances 1) was being advanced to justify a warrantless police decision to make a no-knock entry or 2) was the basis for a judge\u2019s decision to issue a no-knock warrant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 114, 807 A.2d at 798. Reasoning by analogy from the preference for warrants to determine whether a search of a dwelling will be permitted, <em>see Johnson v. United States, </em>333 U.S. 10, 14, 68 S.Ct. 367, 369, 92 L.Ed. 436, 440 (1948), and perceiving that \u201c[t]he fundamental policy undergirding the warrant requirement is just as strong with respect to the no-knock increment as it is with respect to the underlying entry into the home itself,\u201d the court concluded, \u201c[j]ust as the decision <em>WHETHER </em>to cross the threshold should be submit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>ted to a neutral and detached judicial figure, so too should the decision as to <em>HOW </em>to cross that threshold.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 120-21, 807 A.2d at 802. From this premise, which emphasizes the \u201cgreat deference\u201d a reviewing court owes the probable cause determination of a judicial officer, <em>see Illinois v. Gates, </em>462 U.S. 213, 236, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 2331, 76 L.Ed.2d 527, 547 (1983), and quoting the portion of <em>Davis, </em>144 Md.App. at 156-57, 797 A.2d at 92, set out <em>supra, </em>the court admonished the applicants for search and seizure warrants to advise the issuing judge of all exigencies that would justify a \u201cno-knock\u201d entry and admonished reviewing courts to give \u201cgreat deference\u201d to the \u201cno-knock\u201d determinations of the warrant issuing judge, that is,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-5\">\u201c \u2018the suppression hearing court should uphold that provision as long as the warrant application provided the issuing judge with a substantial basis for concluding that there existed a reasonable suspicion that, under the circumstances in which the warrant was to be executed, the knock and announce requirement would be dangerous to the executing officers or would result in the destruction of the items described in the search warrant.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">Id. at 121-22, 807 A.2d at 802-03, quoting <em>Davis, </em>144 Md.App. at 152, 797 A.2d at 84.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">The issue addressed in <em>Carroll </em>was whether the failure to seek a \u201cno-knock\u201d warrant foreclosed the right of the police to execute the warrant using a \u201cno-knock\u201d entry. Building upon <em>Davis </em>and <em>Riley, </em>the intermediate appellate court held that a \u201cno-knock\u201d entry to execute a search and seizure warrant was invalid where the police \u201cpurposely did not seek a \u2018no-knock\u2019 warrant,\u201d 149 Md.App. at 601, 817 A.2d at 929, and, at the time of the entry, the information known to the police was the same as that which they had when they applied for the warrant. <em>Id. </em>at 611-14, 817 A.2d at 935-36. The court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-8\">\u201cWhat is absent is the absolute lack of material change in the facts or circumstances surrounding the execution of the warrant between the time it was issued and served. In other words, the officers serving the warrant had no \u2018partic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>ularized knowledge.\u2019 Sergeant Bender\u2019s testimony clearly demonstrated that the \u2018particularized knowledge\u2019 was already known at the time they secured the warrant. No additional facts giving rise to a sudden emergency were shown other than what they previously had learned from the officers who secured the warrant, namely Detective Verderaime. ... Moreover, the record indicates that the officers did not witness any suspicious activities or events while surveilling Carroll\u2019s residence that would lead them to believe that the climate had changed and that would give rise to exigent circumstances. Thus, the officers serving the warrant based their decision not to knock and announce on the information previously given to them by Detective Verderaime that was known at the time they secured the search warrant, rather than on exigent circumstances that may have arisen at the time they executed the warrant.... Under these circumstances, there was no evidence of exigent circumstances that could possibly eliminate the constitutional requirement to knock and announce.\u201d \u25a0</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 611-13, 817 A.2d at 935-36.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">We reject the rule implicitly, if not expressly, enunciated by the Court of Special Appeals in <em>Davis, Riley </em>and <em>Carroll, </em>requiring applicants for search and seizure warrants to obtain pre-entry authorization for a \u201cno-knock\u201d entry, to obtain judicial approval of the method of entry in addition to the authorization of the search. The propriety of a \u201cno-knock\u201d entry, while certainly related to the question of the propriety of authorizing a search of the premises, is a different issue, both temporally and analytically. Different criteria inform the decision of the form of entry than inform the analysis of whether, or not, there is probable cause to search in the first place. In <em>Parsley, supra, </em>109 Cal.Rptr. 563, 513 P.2d at 614, the Supreme Court of California explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-8\">\u201c[Ijnformation providing probable cause for the issuance of a search warrant is of a different nature and source than information justifying unannounced entry. While a search <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>warrant must necessarily rest upon previously obtained information, unannounced entry is excused only on the basis of exigent circumstances existing at the time an officer approaches a site to make an arrest or execute a warrant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AL2\"><em>See </em>also <em>Dalia v. U.S., </em>441 U.S. 238, 99 S.Ct. 1682, 60 L.Ed.2d 177 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">In <em>Dalia, </em>the Supreme Court granted certiorari to consider two questions: \u201c... may courts authorize electronic surveillance that requires covert entry into private premises for installation of the necessary equipment? ... must authorization for such surveillance include a specific statement by the court that it approves of the covert entry?\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 241, 99 S.Ct. at 1685, 60 L.Ed.2d at 182. The petitioner in that case had been convicted of conspiracy to steal an interstate shipment of goods, partly based on evidence obtained as a result of wiretaps on his office phones. Surveillance developed probable cause to believe that he was involved in the conspiracy, and FBI agents obtained a warrant for the wiretaps. <em>Id. </em>at 243, 99 S.Ct. at 1685, 60 L.Ed.2d at 184. Although the wiretap warrant expressly identified the phones to be tapped, there was no clause authorizing covert entry into the office to place the taps. <em>Id. </em>at 246, 99 S.Ct. at 1687, 60 L.Ed.2d at 185. The petitioner\u2019s motion to suppress the evidence obtained pursuant to the warrant was denied and that ruling was affirmed on appeal. In the Supreme Court, he argued, with respect to the second question,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-6\">\u201cif covert entries are to be authorized ..., the authorizing court must explicitly set forth its approval of such entries before the fact. In this case, as is customary, the court\u2019s order constituted the sole written authorization of the surveillance of petitioner\u2019s office. As it did not state in terms that the surveillance was to include a covert entry, petitioner insists that the entry violated his Fourth Amendment privacy rights.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b567-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 254-255, 99 S.Ct. at 1692, 60 L.Ed.2d at 191.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">The Court did not agree. Rather, pointing to the fact that the Fourth Amendment warrant clause requires only three <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>things, namely: \u201cFirst, warrants must be issued by neutral and disinterested magistrates.... Second, those seeking warrants must demonstrate to the magistrate their probable cause to believe that \u2018the evidence sought will aid in a particular apprehension or conviction\u2019 for a particular offense.... Finally, ^warrants must particularly describe the things to be seized\u2019 as well as the place to be searched,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 255, 99 S.Ct. at 1692, 60 L.Ed.2d at 191 (citations omitted), the Court noted that authorization of the method of entry is not specified as a warrant requirement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-4\">\u201c[n]othing in the language of the Constitution or in this Court\u2019s decisions interpreting that l\u00e1nguage suggests that, in addition to the three requirements disc\u00fassed above, search warrants also must include a specification of the precise manner in which they are to be executed. On the contrary, <em>it is generally left to the discretion of the executing officers to determine the details of how best to proceed with the performance of a search authorized by a warrant-subject </em>of course to the general Fourth Amendment protection \u2018against unreasonable searches and seizures.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b568-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 257, 99 S.Ct. at 1693, 60 L.Ed.2d at 193 (emphasis added). It added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-6\">\u201c[o]ften in executing a warrant the police may find it necessary to interfere with privacy rights not explicitly considered by the judge who issued the warrant. For example, police executing an arrest warrant commonly find it necessary to enter the suspect\u2019s home in order to take him into custody, and thereby impinge on both privacy and freedom of movement. <em>See e.g., United States v. Cravero, </em>545 F.2d 406, 421 (C.A.5 1976) (on petition for rehearing). Similarly, officers executing search warrants on occasion, must damage property in order to perform their duty. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Brown, </em>556 F.2d 304, 305 (C.A.5 1977), <em>United States v. Gervato, </em>474 F.2d 40, 41 (C.A.3), cert. denied, 414 U.S. 864, 94 S.Ct. 39, 38 L.Ed.2d 84 (1973)) \u201cIt would extend the Warrant Clause to the extreme to require that, whenever it is reasonably likely that Fourth Amendment rights may be affected in more than one way, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>the court must set forth precisely the procedures to be followed by the executing officers. Such an interpretation is unnecessary, as we have held \u2014 and the Government concedes \u2014 that the manner in which a warrant is executed is subject to later judicial review as to it\u2019s reasonableness. <em>See Zurcher v. Stanford Daily, </em>436 U.S. 547, 559-560, 98 S.Ct. 1970, 1978-1979, 56 L.Ed.2d 525 (1978).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 257-258, 99 S.Ct. at 1693-94, 60 L.Ed.2d at 193.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">The decision as to how entry is to be made balances, at the least, the privacy interest of the individual, the need to protect the safety of police officers and the need to preserve evidence. <em>See Richards, </em>520 U.S. at 387, 117 S.Ct. at 1418, 137 L.Ed.2d at 620. The probable cause analysis, on the other hand, while ultimately concerned with the privacy issue, is more fact based; it is concerned more specifically with the probability of the item or items that are the subject of the inquiry being in the place to be searched. <em>Id. </em>at 389, 117 S.Ct. at 1419, 137 L.Ed.2d at 621. Thus, what the Supreme Court pointed out in <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>333 U.S. 10, 13, 68 S.Ct. 367, 368, 92 L.Ed. 436, 439-440 (1948), where the issue was probable cause, is entirely logical, absent exigent circumstances: deference to the determination of a detached warrant-issuing judge rather than a \u201czealous\u201d officer engaged in the often-adrenaline charged task of \u201cferreting out crime,\u201d is appropriate, because it supports the goal of encouraging officers to seek warrants. When the issue concerns the manner of entry, however, probable cause for the search already having been established, the appropriate inquiry, and thus the decision to be reviewed, is whether the form of entry used was reasonable in light of the facts as known to the officer at the time of the entry. <em>Ker v. California, </em>374 U.S. 23, 40-41, 83 S.Ct. 1623, 1633-34, 10 L.Ed.2d 726, 742 (1963) (\u201cIn addition to the officers\u2019 belief that Ker was in possession of narcotics, which could be quickly and easily destroyed, Ker\u2019s furtive conduct in eluding them shortly before the arrest was ground for the belief that he might well have been expecting the police\u201d); <em>Parsley, </em>109 Cal.Rptr. 563, 513 P.2d at 615 (\u201cthe key to permissible unannounced entry is the knowledge of exigent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>circumstances possessed by police officers at the time of entry. Thus, from the viewpoint of a court reviewing justification for an unannounced entry after the fact, a warrant authorizing such action adds nothing.\u201d); <em>Bomber, </em>630 So.2d at 1050-51.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">Moreover, the factors and circumstances bearing on the method of effecting entry to execute a search and seizure warrant may not be, and often are not, static; the facts bearing on the propriety of a \u201cno-knock\u201d entry, known to the judicial officer when the warrant was issued may well change and be different, perhaps rendering the judicial officer\u2019s finding on the question of exigency inappropriate when the warrant is executed. This is so whatever the magistrate\u2019s decision, whether the search warrant authorized a \u201cno-knock\u201d entry or refused to authorize such an entry. That deficiency of the \u201cno-knock\u201d warrant has been recognized and explained. In <em>Parsley, </em>explaining why the reasonableness of an entry to execute a search and seizure warrant must be judged at the time of the entry, itself, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-6\">\u201cFacts existing at the time of obtaining a warrant may no longer exist at the time of entry. Such an emergency, therefore, can be judged only in light of circumstances of which the officer is aware at the latter moment. Previously obtained information may at that time be taken into account in determining the necessity of dispensing with ordinary announcements <em>(People v. Dumas </em>(1973) 9 Cal.3d 871, 109 Cal.Rptr. 304, 512 P.2d 1208), but a more significant factor in this decision is perception and knowledge the officer acquires on the scene immediately prior to effecting entry. For this reason, earlier judicial authorization would be largely inappropriate in the context of unannounced entry and, thus, clearly cannot be considered a constitutional requirement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">109 Cal.Rptr. 563, 513 P.2d at 614.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-8\">The Supreme Court commented on this very point in <em>Richards, </em>pointing to the facts of that case and cautioning that, \u201ca magistrate\u2019s decision not to authorize a no-knock entry should not be interpreted to remove the officers\u2019 authority to exercise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>independent judgment concerning the wisdom of a no-knock entry at the time the warrant is being executed.\u201d 520 U.S. at 396 n. 7, 117 S.Ct. at 1422 n. 7, 137 L.Ed.2d at 625 n. 7. That Court has also made clear that officers requesting a warrant are not constitutionally required to set forth the anticipated means for execution of that warrant, even when they know beforehand that unannounced or forced entry likely will be necessary. <em>Dalia, supra, </em>441 U.S. at 257, n. 19, 99 S.Ct. at 1693 n. 19, 60 L.Ed.2d at 192 n. 19, citing 2 W. LaFave, Search and Seizure 140 (1978). <em>See U.S. v. Hernandez, </em>252 F.Supp.2d 1190, 1193 (D.Kan.2003) (the determination must always be made at the time the officers entered the house).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">Courts that authorize \u201cno-knock\u201d warrants have likewise commented and so held. <em>See Scalise, supra, </em>439 N.E.2d at 823; <em>Lien, supra, </em>265 N.W.2d at 839. Citing <em>Lien, </em>the <em>Scalise </em>court put it thus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-6\">\u201cWe recognize that the facts existing at the time the warrant is issued may no longer exist at the time the warrant is executed. In those instances, the officers would be required to knock and announce their purpose. The changed circumstances would render ineffective the magistrate\u2019s decision that a no knock entry was justified. 26 Hastings L. J., <em>supra, </em>at 285. Thus, the police officers at the scene are required to make a threshold reappraisal of the actual threat of the destruction of evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">Because whatever facts officers may know and the warrant issuing judge may find at the time of the application for the search warrant, the possibility of changed circumstances requires that there be a re-evaluation of the propriety of a no-knock entry at the time of the search. We come out on the side of those courts that, in the absence of valid statutory authority, refuse to authorize a judicial officer to make an advance determination of exigency. We hold that a judicial officer in Maryland, under current Maryland law, may not issue a \u201cno-knock\u201d warrant. Rather, the propriety of a \u201cno-knock\u201d entry will be reviewed and determined on the basis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>of the facts known to the officers at the time of entry, rather than at the time of the application for the warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">This holding is consistent with other search and seizure law situations, in which the competing interests of officer safety, evidence preservation and other exigencies existing at the time of the encounter are balanced against the defendant\u2019s privacy interest. <em>See, e.g., Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 20, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 1879, 20 L.Ed.2d 889, 905 (1968)(holding that police officers may pat down the outer clothing of a suspect\u2019s clothes when they have reasonable suspicion at the time they stop the suspect that he or she is involved in criminal activity and has weapons that might compromise officer safety); <em>Maryland v. Buie, </em>494 U.S. 325, 334, 110 S.Ct. 1093, 1098, 108 L.Ed.2d 276, 286 (1990) (holding that police officers may execute a limited sweep in conjunction with a home arrest, when the <em>arresting officer </em>has reasonable articulable suspicion that \u201cthe area to be swept harbors an individual posing a danger to those on the arrest scene.\u201d) (emphasis added); <em>Michigan v. Long </em>463 U.S. 1032, 103 S.Ct. 3469, 77 L.Ed.2d 1201 (1983) (holding that the search of a passenger compartment of automobile, limited to those areas in which weapons may be placed or hidden, is permissible if <em>police officer </em>possesses reasonable belief based on \u201cspecific and articulable facts which, taken together with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant ... officers in believing that suspect is dangerous and may gain immediate control of weapons\u201d) (quoting <em>Terry, </em>392 U.S., at 21, 88 S.Ct., at 1880, 20 L.Ed.2d at 906).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">We turn now to a determination of whether the \u201cno-knock\u201d entry by Officers O\u2019Ree and Brackus was justified by existing and articulated exigent circumstances. We do so, in this case, by reviewing the affidavit submitted in support of the search and seizure warrant. This is necessary in this case because there is no evidence as to the circumstances at the scene and that is where the trial court, the intermediate appellate court and, indeed, the parties looked to determine whether there were sufficient facts to show the need for a \u201cno-knock\u201d war<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>rant. As we have seen, as relevant to the resolution of the case <em>sub judice, </em>the affidavit sets out the officers\u2019 experience and their conclusion from that experience that participants in the drug trade often are dangerous and carry weapons and that drugs are easily and quickly destroyed if entry onto the premises is delayed or stalled, the fact that large amounts of drugs had been seized as a result of information supplied by one of their sources, that several people resided in the dwelling, and that the petitioner Adams had three prior juvenile arrests for controlled dangerous substances.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">Aside from their conclusions based on their general experience, Officers O\u2019Ree and Brackus cited no observations or facts in their affidavit that indicated that the petitioners were inherently dangerous. With the exception of the connection they posited existed between drugs and weapons, their affidavit did not allege that the petitioners were observed carrying, or were known to carry, a weapon. Neither was there reason given in that affidavit, again excepting the link provided by the officers\u2019 experience, to believe that there were weapons inside the subject premises. Moreover, the officers did not present any facts whatsoever that tended to indicate, much less prove, that the petitioners would react violently, attempt to flee when confronted by the police, or attempt to dispose of, or destroy, the evidence. To be sure, the affidavit did indicate that petitioner Adams had a criminal history, but, as indicated, it consisted only of juvenile drug arrests.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">The motions judge and the <em>Davis </em>court both credited the officers\u2019 experience and, applying the warrant preference, found a sufficient justification for the issuance of a \u201cno-knock\u201d warrant. That justification was the link that their combined experiences provided between drug traffickers, weapons, the ease with which drugs may be destroyed and the tendency of drug traffickers to dispose of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\"><em>Richards, supra, </em>520 U.S. 385, 117 S.Ct. 1416, 137 L.Ed.2d 615, addressed a similar issue and, therefore, is quite relevant. There, the Court considered a ruling by the Wisconsin Supreme Court holding that \u201cpolice officers are never <em>required, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>to knock and announce their presence when executing a search- warrant in a felony drug investigation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 387-88, 117 S.Ct. at 1417, 137 L.Ed.2d at 620. The Court reversed, rejecting blanket exceptions to the knock and announce requirement. <em>Id. </em>at 388, 117 S.Ct. at 1419, 137 L.Ed.2d at 620. Although it acknowledged that knocking and announcing in felony drug cases frequently might expose officers to physical violence or might lead to the destruction of evidence, the Court refused to \u201cdispense ... with [a] case-by-case evaluation of the manner in which a search was executed,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 392, 117 S.Ct. at 1420, 137 L.Ed.2d at 623, noting two serious concerns presented by such a blanket exception:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-5\">\u201cFirst the exception contains considerable overgeneralization. For example, while drug investigation frequently does pose special risks to officer safety and the preservation of evidence, not every drug investigation will pose these risks to a substantial degree. For example, a search could be conducted at a time when the only individuals present in a residence have no connection with the drug activity and thus will be unlikely to threaten officers or destroy evidence. Or the police could know that the drugs being searched for were of a type or in a location that made them impossible to destroy quickly. In those situations, the asserted governmental interests in preserving evidence and maintaining safety may not outweigh the individual privacy interests intruded upon by a no-knock entry. Wisconsin\u2019s blanket rule impermissibly insulates these cases from judicial review.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-6\">\u201cA second difficulty with permitting a criminal-category exception to the knock-and-announce requirement is that the reasons for creating an exception in one category can, relatively easily, be applied to others. Armed bank robbers, for example, are, by definition, likely to have weapons, and the fruits of their crime may be destroyed without too much difficulty. If a <em>per se </em>exception were allowed for each category of criminal investigation that included a considerable \u2014 albeit hypothetical \u2014 risk of danger to officers or destruction of evidence, the knock-and-announce element of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>the Fourth Amendment\u2019s reasonableness requirement would be meaningless.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b575-5\"><em>Id, </em>at 394, 117 S.Ct. at 1421, 137 L.Ed.2d at 624. The Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-7\">\u201cThus, the fact that felony drug investigations may frequently present circumstances warranting a no-knock entry cannot remove from the neutral scrutiny of the reviewing court the reasonableness of the police decision not to knock and announce in a particular case. Instead, in each case, it is the duty of a court confronted with the question to determine whether the facts and circumstances of the particular entry justified dispensing with the knock-and-announce requirement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b575-8\"><em>Id. </em>It further clarified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-9\">\u201cIn order to justify a \u2018no-knock\u2019 entry, the police must have a reasonable suspicion that knocking and announcing their presence, under the particular circumstances, would be dangerous or futile, or that it would inhibit the effective investigation of the crime by, for example, allowing the destruction of evidence. This standard \u2014 as opposed to a probable cause requirement \u2014 strikes the appropriate balance between the legitimate law enforcement concerns at issue in the execution of search warrants and the individual privacy interests affected by no-knock entries. <em>Maryland v. Buie, </em>494 U.S. 325, 337, 110 S.Ct. 1093, 1099-1100, 108 L.Ed.2d 276 (1990) (allowing a protective sweep of a house during an arrest where the officers have \u2018a reasonable belief based on specific and articulable facts that the area to be swept harbors an individual posing a danger to those on the arrest scene\u2019); <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 20, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 1884-85, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968) (requiring a reasonable and articulable suspicion of danger to justify a patdown search). This showing is not high, but the police should be required to make it whenever the reasonableness of a no-knock entry is challenged.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b576-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 394-95, 117 S.Ct. at 1421-22, 137 L.Ed.2d at 624.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">That several persons resided in the subject premises and the petitioner Adams had three juvenile drug arrests, while specific to this case and these defendants, added nothing to the relevant questions, whether the petitioners would constitute a danger or whether they, or the others residing in the premises, would destroy the contraband. Neither does the fact that the confidential source\u2019s information resulted in the seizure of large amounts of drugs and weapons address the relevant questions, because we are not informed of the circumstances surrounding those seizures. To the extent that the inference to be drawn is that the subject operation is a large one, that fact would seem to undermine the argument that the risk of destruction of the drugs was great. And, it does not address the dangerousness of the petitioners, except, that is, by reference to the generalization, which is, in turn, the product of the officers\u2019 experience.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">It is, then, in truth, only the officers\u2019 experience that provides any support for the issuance of a \u201cno-knock\u201d warrant and, therefore, the finding of the necessary exigency in this case. The trial court said as much:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-7\">\u201ccrediting the affiants\u2019 experience which involves hundreds of narcotics arrests, extensive training, and considerable experience in narcotics law enforcement, I cannot conclude that their conclusion with respect to the likeliness of firearms on the property is an irrational one.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">So, too, did the <em>Davis </em>court. 144 Md.App. at 148, 797 A.2d at 87. To use the officers\u2019 experience to establish a reasonable suspicion that the petitioners, because they are drug dealers, have, carry and use firearms and are likely to have, carry, and use them in this case and that, in the event of an announced entry to execute the search and seizure warrant, the drugs in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>this case could, and would likely, be destroyed is to do what the <em>Richards </em>Court forbids, to give effect to a blanket exception to the knock and announce requirement on the basis only of overgeneralizations. As <em>Richards </em>points out, see 520 U.S. at 392-93, 117 S.Ct. at 1421, 137 L.Ed.2d at 623, such overgeneralizations may be applied to every drug investigation. Moreover, the need and reason for the exception \u201ccan, relatively easily, be applied\u201d to many other categories of crimes. <em>Id,. </em>at 393, 117 S.Ct. at 1421, 137 L.Ed.2d at 623. We hold that the entry in this case was not justified by existing and articulated exigency.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">Other courts presented with similar facts have reached the same conclusion. <em>See Poole v.

The Court held, instead, that evidence is to be admissible, if the officer relied, in good faith, on a warrant obtained from a judge or magistrate and acted within its scope. <em>Id. </em>That also is the law in Maryland. <em>See McDonald v.

The purposes of the exclusionary rule are furthered, the Court instructed, \u201cif it can be said that the law enforcement officer had knowledge, or may properly be charged with the knowledge, that the search was unconstitutional under the Fourth Amendment,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 919, 104 S.Ct. at 3419, 82 L.Ed.2d at 696 (citing <em>Illinois v.

Four such situations have been identified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-5\">\u201c[1] if the magistrate or judge in issuing the warrant, was misled by information in an affidavit that the affiant knew was false or would have known was false except for a reckless disregard for the truth ...

[; 3 when] an officer [fails to] manifest objective good faith in relying on a warrant based on an affidavit \u2018so lacking in indicia of probable cause as to render official belief in its existence entirely unreasonable,\u2019 ... [; or 4 when] \u2018a warrant [is] so facially <em>deficient </em>\u2014 i.e., in failing to particularize the place to be searched or the things to be seized \u2014 that the executing officers cannot reasonably presume [the warrant] to be valid.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b579-6\"><em>Leon, </em>468 U.S. at 923, 104 S.Ct. at 3421, 82 L.Ed.2d at 698-699 (internal citations omitted). <em>See also McDonald v. State, </em>347 Md. 452, 468-69, 701 A.2d 675, 683 (1997) (internal citations omitted) (quoting <em>Connelly </em>322 Md. at 729, 589 A.2d at 963 in turn quoting <em>Leon, </em>468 U.S. at 923, 104 S.Ct. at 3421).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">In the present case, relying on <em>Leon, </em>the State argues that,, even if this court finds that the warrant application did not state an exigency with sufficient particularity to support a \u201cno-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>knock\u201d entry, the evidence obtained as a result of the search should nonetheless be admitted under the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule. It urges, in other words, this Court to extend the good faith exception to include not only those situations in which officers rely, in good faith, on warrants determined to lack probable cause, but also those, as in this case, in which they rely on the warrant\u2019s authorization of a \u201cno-knock\u201d entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">The State reasons that, because the police officers submitted an affidavit in support of their application for the search warrant that stated that the officers would \u201cattempt to gain entry by the rush or No-Knock forced entry,\u201d the magistrate authorized such an entry when the search warrant incorporated the affidavit by reference. Reliance on a \u201cno-knock\u201d warrant, it argues, is, therefore, akin to reliance on a general warrant lacking in probable cause. In this case, the State maintains, \u201c[a] review of the information in the affidavit shows that the facts supporting an unannounced entry were not so sparse that reliance on the warrant was \u2018entirely unreasonable.\u2019 \u201d The State relies on cases in which sister courts have applied the good faith exception to \u201cno-knock\u201d warrants. <em>E.g., United States v.

Specifically, they asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-11\">\u201c1. In order to justify issuance of a \u2018no-knock' warrant, may police allege only that the targets of the warrant were suspected marijuana dealers who kept a large supply of marijuana in the target premises, and that in the affiant's experience, drug dealers use guns and can easily destroy drugs?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-12\">\u201c2. If not, does the good faith exception to Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement apply to the execution of such a warrant? The petitioners thus, at the very least, seem to assume that judges may issue \"no-knock\u201d warrants.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-13\">For its part, the State's cross petition for writ of certiorari presented only the question whether, if the \u201cgood faith\u201d exception fails, the independent source and/or inevitable discovery doctrines apply to make the evidence admissible.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b562-9\">.

We have not in our cases ever resolved whether the issuance of \"no-knock\u201d warrants is authorized under Maryland law.

The <em>Richards </em>Court ultimately affirmed the Wisconsin Supreme Court decision on the basis that the petitioner's reaction to the presence of officers at the hotel door, provided sufficient support of the officers\u2019 concern that the petitioner might destroy evidence. <em>Richards, </em>520 U.S. at 396, 117 S.Ct. at 1416, 137 L.Ed.2d at 625.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b580-6\">.

Subsequently, the Court of Special Appeals, in <em>Lee v.

Van Beek, </em>591 N.W.2d 112 (N.D.1999), were decided post <em>-Richards, </em>the warrants in those cases were issued prior to <em>Richards. </em>Therefore, the courts decided that, notwithstanding the absence of particularized facts, the officers\u2019 reliance on those no-knock warrants was reasonable at the time. The other cases are distinguishable; in those cases, characterized as \u201cclose calls,\u201d the officers alleged more facts showing exigency than in the case <em>sub judice: United States v.
