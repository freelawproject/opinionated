Lussier, appeals from the judgment of strict foreclosure rendered in favor of the plaintiff, Seaside National Bank &amp; Trust. On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court (1) improperly granted the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment as to liability, (2) violated his constitutional right to procedural due process by denying him the opportunity\n   to depose the plaintiff's affiant upon whose testimony the court relied in rendering judgment, and (3) abused its discretion in denying his request for a continuance pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 17-47 and in granting the plaintiff's motion for a protective order. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following facts and procedural history are relevant to our discussion. The defendant executed an adjustable rate note, dated July 16, 2009, in favor of Taylor, Bean &amp; Whitaker Mortgage Corporation (Taylor Bean) in the principal amount of $318,131. To secure the note, the defendant executed and delivered a mortgage to Mortgage Electronic Registration System, Inc. (MERS), as nominee for Taylor Bean, on property located at 9 Patterson Place in Old Saybrook, which mortgage was duly recorded. The note was endorsed twice, first by Taylor Bean to the plaintiff and second by the plaintiff in blank. MERS assigned the mortgage to the plaintiff; this assignment was recorded on April 2, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Following a dispute over the amount of monthly mortgage payments and the defendant's decision to stop making payments, the plaintiff commenced the underlying foreclosure action on January 14, 2014. After unsuccessful mediation, the plaintiff filed a motion for summary judgment as to liability on July 17, 2015. The defendant filed a motion for a thirty day extension of time to respond to the motion. The court granted the\n   defendant's motion and the motion for summary judgment was marked ready for a hearing for August 31, 2015. On that day, the defendant filed an objection to the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment, stating that he needed more time to conduct discovery. The defendant also filed a request for a continuance pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 17-47, claiming that he needed to depose the affiant upon whose testimony the plaintiff was relying in support of its motion for summary judgment. On the same day, the defendant's counsel sent a notice of deposition to the plaintiff. The plaintiff subsequently filed a motion for a protective order to prohibit the deposition of the affiant, which the court granted on October 5, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The court granted the defendant one week to respond to the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment. On September 21, 2015, the defendant responded by filing an affidavit in opposition to the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment. On September 25, 2015, the court granted the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment as to liability. The plaintiff subsequently moved for a judgment of strict foreclosure. On March 7, 2016, the day of the hearing for the motion for a judgment of strict foreclosure, the defendant filed an objection to that motion, claiming that he needed to depose the plaintiff's affiant before the court entered final judgment. After hearing argument, the court overruled the defendant's objection and rendered a judgment of strict foreclosure. This appeal followed. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The defendant first claims that the court improperly granted the motion for summary judgment as to liability. Specifically, the defendant argues that there was a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the defendant had defaulted on his mortgage. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \"Our review of the trial court's decision to grant [a] motion for summary judgment is plenary.... [I]n seeking summary judgment, it is the movant who has the burden of showing ... the absence of any genuine issue as to all the material facts [that], under applicable principles of\n   substantive law, entitle him to a judgment as a matter of law....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \"In order to establish a prima facie case in a mortgage foreclosure action, the plaintiff must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that it is the owner of the note and mortgage, that the defendant mortgagor has defaulted on the note and that any conditions precedent to foreclosure, as established by the note and mortgage, have been satisfied.... Thus, a court may properly grant summary judgment as to liability in a foreclosure action if the complaint and supporting affidavits establish an undisputed prima facie case and the defendant fails to assert any legally sufficient special defense....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \"A party opposing summary judgment must provide an evidentiary foundation to demonstrate the existence of a genuine issue of material fact.... A party may not rely on mere speculation or conjecture as to the true nature of the facts to overcome a motion for summary judgment.... In other words, [d]emonstrating a genuine issue of material fact requires a showing of evidentiary facts or substantial evidence outside the pleadings from which material facts alleged in the pleadings can be warrantably inferred.... A material fact is one that will make a difference in the result of the case.... To establish the existence of a [dispute as to a] material fact, it is not enough for the party opposing summary judgment merely to assert the existence of a disputed issue.... Such assertions are insufficient regardless of whether they are contained in a complaint or a brief.... Further, unadmitted allegations in the pleadings do not constitute proof of the existence of a genuine issue as to any material fact .... The issue\n   must be one which the party opposing the motion is entitled to litigate under [its] pleadings and the mere existence of a factual dispute apart from the pleadings is not enough to preclude summary judgment.\" (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Bank of New York Mellon\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Horsey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12499058\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/190/105/#p435\">\n    182 Conn.

The affidavit stated further that the defendant \"failed to make monthly mortgage payments as required by the loan documents since the payment due July 1, 2013, and for each and every month thereafter\" and that the defendant was \"in default under the loan documents for failure to make payments as required by the terms of the note and mortgage.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The defendant filed an objection to the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment, stating that he intended to file a memorandum of law in opposition to the motion after he completed discovery, for which he needed more time. The defendant did not subsequently file a memorandum, but rather filed an affidavit, in which he was the affiant, in opposition to the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment. The affidavit recited in relevant part that in January, 2012, the mortgage servicer (servicer) increased the amount of his monthly mortgage payments, and attributed the increase to changes in required escrow payments for taxes and insurance. The affidavit stated further that the defendant paid the increased amounts for more than a year, but he stopped making payments because he didn't believe that the servicer properly could account for the increased escrow amount. The defendant sought explanations from the servicer, who did not satisfactorily respond. The defendant stated in the affidavit that he then\n   stopped making what he believed to be overpayments. He offered instead to pay the lower\n   monthly amount that he had paid in the past, but the servicer refused to accept the lower amount.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The defendant presented evidence showing that he disputed the calculation of his escrow payments, but the defendant's insistence in his affidavit that he did not consider himself to be in default, even though he stopped making payments, was not sufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact as to his default under the terms of the note and mortgage. There were no\n   <em>\n    facts\n   </em>\n   in the affidavit tending to show the allegedly correct amount, or, more critically, to show that he had paid the correct amount. \"A party opposing summary judgment must provide an evidentiary foundation to demonstrate the existence of a genuine issue of material fact....

It recites a history of the course of dealing and, together with an attached copy of an email, suggests amounts by which the defendant reportedly believed he was overcharged. There is, however, no\n   <em>\n    evidence\n   </em>\n   supporting the conclusion of overcharge, and\n   <em>\n    the defendant admitted in his affidavit that he stopped paying his mortgage in its entirety\n   </em>\n   . Evidence showing that the defendant believed that he was not in default\n   was not sufficient to create a genuine issue of fact regarding liability in light of his admission that he stopped making payments and evidence submitted by the plaintiff that he defaulted under the terms of the note. Accordingly, we conclude that the court properly granted the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The defendant next claims that the trial court violated his constitutional right to procedural due process by denying him the opportunity to depose the plaintiff's affiant upon whose testimony the court relied in rendering judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, the defendant argues that a deposition of the plaintiff's affiant was necessary to rebut the facts tending to show that he was in default and to rebut the presumption that the plaintiff was in possession of the note at the time it commenced this foreclosure action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The defendant's due process claim presents an issue of law over which our review is plenary.\n   <em>\n    In re Shaquanna M.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1158557\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/61/592/#p600\">\n    61 Conn.

On August 31, the defendant filed an objection to the motion for summary judgment, along with his request for a continuance under Practice Book \u00a7 17-47. The defendant's objection stated simply that he needed time to complete discovery necessary to oppose the motion for summary judgment. Alternatively, the objection asked that the trial court deny the plaintiff's motion pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 17-47.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the conclusion of a colloquy with counsel, the court extended a week in which to file \"whatever you want to file ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The issue of whether a court has abused its discretion in denying a continuance is not novel.

The court cited\n   <em>\n    Plouffe\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    New York, N.H. &amp; H.R.

Unless dilatory or lacking in merit, the motion should be liberally treated. Exercising a sound discretion the trial court then determines whether the stated reasons are adequate. And, absent abuse of discretion, the trial court's determination will not be interfered with by the appellate court.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Altfeter\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Naugatuck\n   </em>\n   , supra, at 806,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=732%20A.2d%20207\">\n    732 A.2d 207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

We also conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in overruling the defendant's objection to the motion for a judgment of strict foreclosure, which was\n   predicated on the defendant's stated need to depose the plaintiff's affiant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In this opinion the other judges concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    The defendant claims a due process violation under both the fifth amendment to the the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution.
