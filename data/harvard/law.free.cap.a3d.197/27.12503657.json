At trial, the trial judge overruled an objection by Agnew to the admission of a recorded\n   conversation recovered from his cell phone on the ground that it lacked two-party consent and was therefore inadmissible.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial judge entered a judgment of acquittal on both counts of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute. Following the two-day trial, on November 16, 2016, Agnew was convicted of possession of a firearm after a disqualifying conviction, possession with intent to distribute heroin, and possession with intent to distribute cocaine and acquitted of possession of a firearm during a drug trafficking crime. On February 23, 2017, Agnew was sentenced to eight years of imprisonment on each count, to run concurrently.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Thereafter, Agnew noted a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals based on the alleged error in admitting the audio-recorded conversation. The Court of Special Appeals affirmed the judgment of the trial court in an unreported opinion on December 26, 2017.\n   <em>\n    Agnew v. State\n   </em>\n   , No. 2701, Sept.

Agnew sought this Court's review regarding whether a recorded communication on a cell phone between Agnew and an unidentified speaker was \"intercepted\" in violation of the\n   Maryland Wiretap Act and erroneously admitted at trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   For the reasons articulated below, we shall affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In November 2015, members of the Montgomery County Police Department initiated an investigation into Agnew for suspicion of narcotics distribution. Members of law enforcement obtained and executed a valid search warrant for Agnew's apartment, where the following items were recovered: a bag of marijuana, a small pink wallet that contained a controlled dangerous substance, a silver iPhone, United States currency, a suitcase containing a loaded .32 caliber revolver and a black digital scale, a number of baggies containing a \"white powder substance,\" a baggie with a green leafy substance, a bottle of creatine, sandwich bags, and another digital scale. The Montgomery County Police Crime Laboratory subsequently tested and identified the substances found as including marijuana, cocaine, heroin, and a combination of cocaine and heroin known as \"speedball.\" Pursuant to the search warrant, law enforcement extracted data from the silver iPhone that included several text message communications and an audio recording of a phone conversation between Agnew and an unidentified person. The audio recording, which is the subject of this appeal, was taken with and stored on the silver iPhone's voice memo program.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    The Trial\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Grand Jury for Montgomery County indicted Agnew on June 17, 2016 and the trial commenced on November 14, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At trial, the State introduced the audio-recorded voice memo extracted from\n   Agnew's iPhone. After the playing of the entirety of the recording, Agnew objected to its admissibility at the bench, as reflected in the following colloquy:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Your Honor, there was no evidence that there was a consent by both people in the conversation. You hear the other person saying, I mean how that illegal act was taking place.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   THE COURT: Well, if it's illegal your client did it, didn't he?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I understand that but it doesn't make it admissible because it's illegal. You can't use illegally obtained material.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   [THE STATE]: If it were illegally obtained by the government then it wouldn't be able to be used, that's the Fourth Amendment which doesn't apply to [Agnew] and his illegal activities.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: No, it comes up in domestic cases rather regularly when someone is surreptitiously recording and then tries to use it and it's not admissible because it's a surreptitious recording. There's no indication, first right off that I'm recording this because I want to know what you're doing and you know it's recorded. Here we don't have that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   THE COURT: Well, if the State would try to use it and if the State intends to use it against the person on the other phone, undermine, whoever that is, then I would agree then that's illegal and you couldn't use it against whoever that other person is. But this is a recording that [Agnew] made and it's being used against the defendant so it should be admissible.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Thereafter, the trial court overruled Agnew's objection and admitted the recording into evidence. The State later replayed segments of the recording at trial. Detective Ryan Street testified as an expert in the areas of digital forensic examination of data recovery, narcotics trafficking, and narcotics dealing. Detective Street testified that the main voice on the recording belonged to Agnew, that the content of the conversation was \"indicative of a drug deal,\" and that the conversation\n   reflected that Agnew was aware that he could be arrested for transporting illegal drugs and was concerned about the risk of being stopped by the police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On November 16, 2016, the jury found Agnew guilty of possession of a firearm by a prohibited person, possession with intent to distribute heroin, and possession with intent to distribute cocaine. The trial court sentenced him on February 23, 2017 to eight years of incarceration on each count, to run concurrently. Thereafter, Agnew noted a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    The Court of Special Appeals\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Before the Court of Special Appeals, Agnew challenged,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , the trial court's decision to admit the audio recording taken from the voice memo program on Agnew's iPhone.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Agnew\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%206611973\">\n    2017 WL 6611973\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (posing whether \"the trial court err[ed] in admitting a communication, recorded on a cell phone, between [Agnew] and an unidentified speaker, which was intercepted in violation of the Maryland Wiretap Statute[.]\"). Agnew argued that the Maryland Wiretap Act barred admission of the audio recording \"because there is no evidence that the unidentified speaker gave prior consent to the interception of the communication.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *7. Agnew asserted that the recording was an \"unlawfully intercepted communication\" and that no enumerated exception within the Wiretap Act applied.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *6 (footnote omitted). In contrast, the State argued that this issue was \"not preserved for [the Court of Special Appeals'] review because [Agnew] did not timely object to\n   the admission of the recording.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Even if preserved, the State contended that the trial court \"correctly admitted a recording [Agnew] made of himself selling drugs.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Finding that Agnew preserved the issue, the Court of Special Appeals affirmed the trial court's admission of the audio recording, determining that the \"protective umbrella that the [General Assembly] raised over [third parties] and others who do not consent to the interception of their conversations affords [Agnew] no shelter.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *8 (quoting\n   <em>\n    State v.

Reiterating its holding in\n   <em>\n    Maddox\n   </em>\n   , the Court of Special Appeals\n   stated that \"when one party to a conversation expressly or implicitly consents to the recording of that conversation, the recording is admissible in evidence against the consenting party even though the other person or persons involved in the conversation were unaware of the interception.\"\n   <em>\n    Agnew\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%206611973\">\n    2017 WL 6611973\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Maddox\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4439400\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/69/296/#p301\">\n    69 Md.
