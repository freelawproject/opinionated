The petitioner argues that he established good cause for the delayed filing of his untimely petition, and the habeas court's judgment of dismissal was improper.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   We are not convinced and, thus, affirm the judgment of the habeas court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following facts are relevant to this appeal. In May, 1999, the petitioner was convicted of robbery in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (2), criminal possession of a firearm in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-217 and commission of a class\n   A, B, or C felony\n   with a firearm in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53-202k. The trial court imposed a total effective sentence of twenty-five years of incarceration. On appeal, the conviction was affirmed.\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Langston\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"260634,260591,260615\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/67/903/\">\n    67 Conn.

Although the petition was granted by the habeas court, on appeal that judgment was reversed and certification to our Supreme Court was denied.

Thereafter, in March, 2008, the petitioner filed a federal petition for a writ of habeas corpus, which was denied in March, 2012.\n   <em>\n    Langston\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Murphy\n   </em>\n   , United States District Court, Docket No. 3:08CV410 (DJS),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%20774196\">\n    2012 WL 774196\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D. Conn. March 7, 2012). Then, in May, 2012, he filed a second petition for a writ of habeas corpus in state court. The petition was withdrawn on September 22, 2014, three days prior to a hearing on a motion to dismiss and less than one month before the scheduled trial date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On December 3, 2014, the petitioner filed a new petition for a writ of habeas corpus in state court, which is the subject of the present appeal and alleged, inter alia, ineffective assistance of trial counsel. Following the appearance of counsel and the filing of an amended petition, the respondent Commissioner of Correction filed a request for an order to show cause as to why the present petition should not be dismissed as untimely pursuant to \u00a7 52-470 (d) and (e).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The petitioner filed\n   an objection, and a hearing was held on February 8, 2017. In its memorandum of decision, dated March 23, 2017, the habeas court found that the petition was untimely because it was filed after the October 1, 2014 deadline\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the petitioner had\n   failed to show good cause for the delay. Accordingly, the habeas court dismissed the petition. Thereafter, the court granted the petition for certification to appeal, and this appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \"The conclusions reached by the [habeas court] in its decision to dismiss the habeas petition are matters of law, subject to plenary review ...

Rather, on appeal, he argues that the habeas court erred in concluding that he failed to show good cause for the delay. Specifically, the petitioner contends that (1) this untimely petition does not violate the spirit or purpose of \u00a7 52-470 because it concerns issues that have been litigated consistently since 1999, and (2) in withdrawing his prior petition, he was following the advice of his former attorney and did not understand the consequences of this decision. We are not persuaded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \"For the purposes of ... [ \u00a7 52-470 (e) ], good cause includes, but is not limited to, the discovery of new evidence which materially affects the merits of the case and which could not have been discovered by the exercise of due diligence in time to meet the requirements of subsection (c) or (d) of this section.\" General Statutes \u00a7 52-470 (e). The parties also agree that good cause has been defined as a \"substantial reason amounting in law to a legal excuse for failing to perform an act required by law ... [a] [l]egally sufficient ground or reason.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Schoolhouse Corp.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Wood\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"792223\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/43/586/#p591\">\n    43 Conn. App. 586\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 591,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=684%20A.2d%201191\">\n    684 A.2d 1191\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1996), cert. denied,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1613122,1613462,1613279\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/240/913/\">\n    240 Conn. 913\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=691%20A.2d%201079\">\n    691 A.2d 1079\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1997).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The essence of the petitioner's first argument is that subsections (d) and (e) of \u00a7 52-470 were enacted to curtail stale claims brought years after final judgment\n   had been rendered in a prior habeas action, rather than to punish minor procedural missteps. The petitioner contends that he has challenged his convictions continuously for almost two decades and this petition, although technically untimely, is not representative of the vexatious or frivolous claims that the 2012 reforms to \u00a7 52-470 were implemented to address. We disagree. The petitioner voluntarily withdrew his prior petition just days before a motion to dismiss was to be heard, and on the relative eve of trial. The fact that the petitioner has litigated previous habeas claims does not excuse or justify this tactic, nor does it explain his failure to refile this case before the October 1, 2014 deadline. We cannot conclude that this argument demonstrates good cause for this untimely petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In his second argument, the petitioner implicitly concedes that it was unwise of him to have withdrawn his prior petition. He contends, nevertheless, that he should not be held accountable for this decision because he was acting at the direction of his erstwhile counsel. At the show cause hearing in the present case, however, the petitioner's prior counsel did\n   not testify and the habeas court concluded that there was insufficient evidence to ascertain whether counsel had failed to apprise the petitioner of the time constraints governing his subsequent petition. Accordingly, we cannot conclude the habeas court erred in dismissing the petition for a writ of habeas corpus given the petitioner's failure to adduce evidence in support of this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-22\">\n    The petitioner also argued on appeal that the habeas court erred in granting the request of the respondent Commissioner of Correction for an order to show cause because the pleadings had not been closed when the motion was filed. The petitioner abandoned this claim at oral argument, however, acknowledging that the recent decision by our Supreme Court in\n    <em>\n     Kelsey\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Commissioner of Correction\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12498822\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/189/578/\">\n     329 Conn. 711\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12498822\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/189/578/\">\n     189 A.3d 578\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2018), was dispositive and foreclosed further review.
