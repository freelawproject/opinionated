This appeal asks us to determine whether to recognize a similar right of recovery in a case where no probate bond was obtained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This appeal arises out of an action by the plaintiff, Bloomfield Health Care Center of Connecticut, LLC, in which it alleged that the defendant, Jason Doyon, breached a duty to use reasonable care in managing the estate of his ward, Samuel Johnson. Specifically, the plaintiff argues that the defendant was negligent by failing to apply for and to obtain on a timely basis Medicaid benefits that were necessary to pay the plaintiff for the cost of Johnson's care at the plaintiff's nursing home. The plaintiff now appeals from the summary judgment rendered by the trial court in favor of the defendant. On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the court improperly concluded that the defendant did not owe it a duty of care and, thus, was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. We agree with the plaintiff and, accordingly, reverse the judgment of the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The record, viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff as the nonmoving party, reveals the following facts. The plaintiff operates a chronic care and convalescent nursing home facility in Bloomfield. On April 19, 2013, Johnson was admitted as a resident to the plaintiff's facility. Thereafter, the plaintiff provided care and services to Johnson at a rate of $360 per day. On\n   October 1, 2013, the cost of care increased to $370 per day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On September 26, 2013, Johnson's daughter, who at the time was acting as his attorney-in-fact, filed an application for Medicaid benefits on behalf of Johnson. On November 26, 2013, Johnson's daughter sold his home. The net proceeds from the sale of the home totaled $48,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On January 8, 2014, the Department of Social Services (department) denied Johnson's application for Medicaid benefits for failure to provide required information. The information missing from the application included the disposition of the proceeds from the sale of his home, copies of bank statements, information regarding the surrender of his stocks, and proof that his assets totaled less than $1600.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On February 26, 2014, the plaintiff petitioned the Probate Court to appoint an involuntary conservator to oversee Johnson's estate for the purpose of assisting him with his finances and Medicaid application, and to ensure that it would be compensated for the necessary care it provided to him.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On April 8, 2014, the court adjudicated Johnson incapable of managing his financial affairs, granted the plaintiff's petition, and appointed the defendant as the conservator of Johnson's estate. The court dispensed with the requirement of a probate bond.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On April 15, 2014, the defendant tendered the $48,000 in proceeds from the sale of Johnson's home to the plaintiff to be applied to Johnson's outstanding bill, which totaled $124,000 at that time. After the proceeds\n   from the sale of Johnson's home were paid to the plaintiff, his only other source of income was $1363 that he received in social security benefits each\n   month, which the defendant subsequently began paying over to the plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Although Johnson did not have sufficient remaining funds or income to pay for his care, it was not until nine months later, on January 21, 2015, that the defendant submitted Johnson's application for Medicaid benefits. On February 17, 2015, the department told the defendant that Johnson's application was incomplete and requested that the defendant provide it with additional information by February 28, 2015, including the value of any of Johnson's remaining real property and bank account statements. The defendant failed to provide the department with the requested information, and, on March 24, 2015, Johnson's application was denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The defendant filed Johnson's second application for Medicaid benefits on August 12, 2015. The application was granted on September 24, 2015, and Johnson's Medicaid benefits were made retroactive to May 1, 2015. Johnson did not receive any Medicaid benefits for the cost of his care prior to that date. On October 21, 2015, Johnson died.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On February 1, 2016, the plaintiff commenced the present action. The plaintiff alleged in the operative complaint that the defendant's failure to apply for and to obtain on a timely basis Medicaid benefits for Johnson had violated a duty of care that he owed to the plaintiff. The plaintiff further alleged that the defendant's negligence caused it to suffer financial harm and loss, and therefore it requested monetary damages.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On July 19, 2016, the defendant filed an answer to the plaintiff's complaint and special defenses. On September 21, 2016, the defendant filed a motion for summary judgment. In his memorandum of law in support of his motion, the defendant argued that he did not owe a duty of care to the plaintiff. Specifically, he argued that he owed a duty of care only to Johnson, his ward, and thus the plaintiff did not have standing to bring the action. The defendant also argued that he was entitled to quasi-judicial immunity for his actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In its memorandum in opposition to the defendant's motion for summary judgment, the plaintiff argued that the defendant owed it a duty of care under a common-law theory of negligence. Specifically, the plaintiff argued that it was readily foreseeable that Johnson would be unable to pay it for the cost of his care if the defendant failed to timely submit a Medicaid application on his behalf and, further, that the plaintiff would suffer harm as a result. The plaintiff also argued that public policy supported its claim that the defendant owed it a duty of care and that there was \"no principled reason why a conservator should avoid liability for his negligence simply because there is no probate bond in a particular case.\" Finally, the plaintiff argued that the defendant was not entitled to quasi-judicial immunity because the Probate Court never expressly approved the defendant's actions with respect to Johnson's Medicaid application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On March 13, 2017, the court issued its memorandum of decision granting the defendant's motion for summary judgment, concluding that \"the law does not support the plaintiff's claim that the defendant, solely as a result of his appointment as a conservator, owed any duty to the plaintiff.\" The court reasoned that \"the defendant's duty, and, in fact, his authority to pursue Medicaid benefits on behalf of his ward, does not arise out of any relationship between the plaintiff and him,\n   but solely from his appointment by the Probate\n   Court as conservator, and his duties pursuant to that appointment.\" The court thus determined that the defendant did not owe the plaintiff a duty of care because \"[t]he purpose of a conservator is not to manage the ward's estate for the benefit of his creditors but for the benefit of the ward.\" On March 31, 2017, the plaintiff timely filed the present appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The plaintiff claims on appeal that the trial court improperly granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment because it incorrectly concluded that the defendant did not owe it a duty of care. Specifically, the plaintiff argues that the defendant owed it a duty to use reasonable care in managing Johnson's estate because (1) the harm caused to the plaintiff as a result of the defendant's negligence was foreseeable, and (2) public policy supports recognizing a duty of care in this context. We agree with the plaintiff that the defendant owed it a duty to use reasonable care to timely secure Medicaid benefits for Johnson.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   We begin by setting forth the relevant standards that govern our review of a court's decision to grant a defendant's motion for summary judgment. \"Practice Book \u00a7 [17-49] provides that summary judgment shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, affidavits and any other proof submitted show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.... In deciding a motion for summary judgment, the trial court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.... The party seeking summary judgment has the burden of showing the absence of any genuine issue [of] material facts which, under the applicable principles of substantive law, entitle him to a judgment as a matter of law ... and the party opposing such a motion must provide an evidentiary foundation to demonstrate the existence of a genuine issue of material\n   fact.... [I]ssue-finding, rather than issue-determination, is key to the procedure.... Our review of the decision to grant a motion for summary judgment is plenary.... We therefore must decide whether the court's conclusions were legally and logically correct and find support in the record.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Barbee\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Sysco Connecticut\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=156%20Conn.%20App.%20813\">\n    156 Conn.

General Statutes \u00a7 45a-655 sets forth the statutory duties of a conservator of an estate. Section 45a-655(a) provides in relevant part: \"A conservator of the estate appointed under section 45a-646, 45a-650, or 45a-654 shall, within two months after the date of the conservator's appointment, make and file in the Probate Court, an inventory, under penalty of false statement, of the estate of the conserved person, with the properties thereof appraised or caused to be appraised, by such conservator, at fair market value as of the date of the conservator's appointment. Such inventory shall include the value of the conserved person's interest in all property in which the conserved person has a legal or equitable present interest, including, but not limited to, the conserved person's interest in any joint bank accounts or other jointly held property. The conservator shall manage all the estate and apply so much of the net income thereof, and, if necessary, any part of the principal of the property,\n   <em>\n    which is required to support the conserved person\n   </em>\n   and those members of the conserved person's family whom the conserved person has a legal duty to support and\n   <em>\n    to pay the conserved person's debts\n   </em>\n   , and may sue for and collect all debts due the conserved person....\" (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Under certain circumstances, if a conservator is appointed to manage an individual's estate, a probate\n   bond is issued. A probate bond is a \"bond with security given to secure the faithful performance by an appointed fiduciary of the duties of the fiduciary's trust and the administration of and accounting for all moneys and other property coming into the fiduciary's hands, as fiduciary, according to law.\" General Statutes \u00a7 45a-139(a). Every probate bond is \"conditioned for the faithful performance by the principal in the bond of the duties of the principal's trust and administration of and accounting for all moneys and other property coming into the principal's hands, as fiduciary, according to law ....\" General Statutes \u00a7 45a-139(b). If the assets of the ward's estate total twenty thousand dollars or more, the issuance of a probate bond is required. General Statutes \u00a7 45a-139(c). A judge has discretion to waive the requirement of a probate bond if the assets of the estate total less than that amount, or under certain circumstances. See Probate Court Rules \u00a7 35.1 (b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   If a probate bond is issued and the conservator breaches his or her duties as fiduciary of the estate, a third party may bring an action on the bond to recover for the harm caused by the conservator's breach. In\n   <em>\n    Jewish Home\n   </em>\n   , our Supreme Court considered whether the plaintiff in that case, a nursing home facility, had \"a right to bring an action on a probate bond when it suffer[ed] a loss as a result of a conservator's failure to ensure payment to the nursing home for his ward's care.\"\n   <em>\n    Jewish Home\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"963469\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/257/531/#p532\">\n    257 Conn. at 532\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=778%20A.2d%2093\">\n    778 A.2d 93\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Id., at 541,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=778%20A.2d%2093\">\n    778 A.2d 93\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The complaint alleged that \"Cantore failed to make timely payment to the plaintiff for the care and services it provided to Kosminer and failed to apply for [M]edicaid benefits on Kosminer's behalf once timely payment for the plaintiff's services had exhausted the assets of the estate. The complaint further alleged that these actions by Cantore resulted in a breach of his fiduciary duties as conservator of Kosminer's estate and person. Kosminer incurred a substantial debt as a result of the services she received from the [nursing home]. Cantore's failure to pay this debt, despite the estate's ample resources, constituted a breach of his duty under \u00a7 45a-655(a) to use the assets of the estate to pay Kosminer's debts. Furthermore, Cantore's failure to ensure timely payment to the [nursing home] constituted a breach of\n   his duty under \u00a7 45a-656(a) to provide for Kosminer's care through the estate or through other private or public assistance.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=778%20A.2d%2093\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Our Supreme Court concluded, therefore, that the nursing home had properly alleged facts that, if proven, would establish that Cantore failed to fulfill his duties as conservator of Kosminer's estate and person.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=778%20A.2d%2093\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Our Supreme Court then considered the categories of plaintiffs that can bring an action on a probate bond to recover loss suffered as a result of a conservator's breach of his or her fiduciary duties pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 45a-144.

The plaintiff argues that\n   \"the absence of a probate bond ... is not and should not be determinative of a [c]onservator's liability for his negligent actions under the common law\" when the \"establishment of a bond is predicated upon the amount of assets\" in the estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \"The essential elements of a cause of action in negligence are well established: duty; breach of that duty; causation; and actual injury.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Jarmie\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Troncale\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=306%20Conn.%20578\">\n    306 Conn. 578\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 589,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20A.3d%20802\">\n    50 A.3d 802\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012). \"Duty is a legal conclusion about relationships between individuals, made after the fact, and imperative to a negligence cause of action.

The plaintiff also contends that the defendant was the only person who had control over Johnson's estate and, consequently, the authority to obtain Medicaid benefits for him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The defendant argues, however, that the harm suffered by the plaintiff was not foreseeable because the\n   defendant's only fiduciary responsibilities were to Johnson and not his creditors.

The plaintiff petitioned the Probate Court to appoint an involuntary conservator to Johnson to help him manage his estate and noted in its petition that Johnson needed help completing a Medicaid application. Once appointed as Johnson's conservator, the defendant\n   alone had access and control over Johnson's assets, income and property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Furthermore, it is undisputed that, when the defendant was appointed as conservator of Johnson's estate, Johnson already had accrued several thousands of dollars of debt to the plaintiff. It is also undisputed that, even though the defendant tendered the $48,000 in proceeds from the sale of Johnson's house to the plaintiff and began paying over his social security checks, Johnson still was unable to pay the $370 per day required to cover the cost of his care and, therefore, continued to accrue debt to the plaintiff.

Section 45a-655(a) provides that the defendant had a statutory duty to use Johnson's estate to support him as well as pay his debts, which, in Johnson's case, included his significant and growing debt to the plaintiff. Moreover, \u00a7 45a-655(d) provides, in relevant part, that, \"[i]n the case of any person receiving public assistance, state-administered general assistance or Medicaid, the conservator of the estate shall apply toward the cost of care such person any assets exceeding limits on assets set by statute or regulation\n   adopted by the Commissioner of Social Services....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   In the present case, Johnson did not have enough assets in his estate to pay the plaintiff for the cost of his care. Because Johnson was unable to pay for his care, the only way that the defendant could use Johnson's estate to support him and to pay his debt to the plaintiff would be to spend down Johnson's remaining assets such that he was eligible for Medicaid and, thereafter, timely complete Johnson's application for Medicaid benefits. See\n   <em>\n    Ross\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Giardi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1200328\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/237/550/#p555\">\n    237 Conn. 550\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 555-74,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=680%20A.3d%20113\">\n    680 A.3d 113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=680%20A.2d%20113\">\n    680 A.2d 113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1996) (discussing applicability of resource spend down methodology to Medicaid benefits). The defendant clearly had the authority, pursuant to statute, to take such actions. Section 45a-655(a) grants the conservator of the estate access to the ward's assets and financial records and the authority to manage his estate. Furthermore, \u00a7 45a-655(d) contemplates that the conservator of the ward's estate will assist the ward in qualifying for Medicaid benefits, specifically. It is a logical extension of the plain language of the statute, then, to conclude that the parties could expect that the defendant would timely submit Johnson's application for Medicaid benefits in the event that he was unable to pay the plaintiff for the cost of his care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   In addition to the statutory duties of a conservator of an estate outlined in \u00a7 45a-655(a), the Connecticut Standards of Practice for Conservators (2018), standard 17 I explicitly provides, in relevant part, that \"[w]ith the proper authority and within the resources available to the conserved person, the conservator of the estate shall have the following duties ... E.\n   <em>\n    The conservator shall seek public and insurance benefits that are beneficial for the conserved person\n   </em>\n   ....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Emphasis added.) Standard 17 I E suggests that it is widely understood by conservators in Connecticut that they are able to-and, in fact, have a duty to-seek public assistance for their ward when necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Moreover, we also find compelling in evaluating the normal expectation of the parties the fact that the plaintiff's petition for involuntary conservatorship specifically noted that Johnson needed help completing his application for Medicaid benefits. This allegation put the defendant on notice that (1) one of the purposes of his appointment was to help Johnson obtain Medicaid benefits, and (2) the plaintiff, specifically, would incur loss if the defendant failed to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   It is reasonable, then, considering the defendant's statutory duties under \u00a7 45a-655(a) and the authority granted in him thereunder, as well as the fact that the plaintiff's petition for a conservator specifically mentioned that Johnson needed help obtaining Medicaid benefits, that the plaintiff would have expected the defendant, as conservator of Johnson's estate, to take steps necessary to pay the portion of Johnson's debt to the plaintiff that accrued after he was appointed and to secure any available public funding that would help pay for the cost of his care.

Rather, he contends that, because there was no direct relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   it was the normal expectation of the parties\n   \"that any claim by the\n   [p]laintiff ... for money owed by the ward for the [p]laintiff's services would be brought against the ward's estate and not the [d]efendant.\" We disagree with the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   At the outset, we note that there is a fundamental inconsistency in applying the defendant's argument to our inquiry regarding the normal expectations of the parties. The sole issue in this case is whether the defendant owed the plaintiff a duty to use reasonable care in timely securing public assistance to pay for the services rendered to Johnson by the plaintiff. If we do agree with the plaintiff that the defendant owed it a duty of care and, therefore, that it properly could bring a negligence action against him, it would be the first time\n   that this notion was expressly recognized by either of our appellate courts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Because of this, our inquiry regarding the normal expectations of the parties cannot begin and end with the question of whether our appellate courts have considered previously the legal viability of this exact action. To conclude as such would render our inquiry pointless, as we only consider the normal expectations of the parties when we ask for the first time whether the defendant in a particular case owed the plaintiff a duty of care. Presumably, then, every time a plaintiff brought a negligence action against a defendant alleging breach of a duty that has not been explicitly recognized by our appellate courts, the defendant could simply make an argument that it was not the normal expectation of the parties that the defendant could be held personally liable to the plaintiff for his or her negligence. We must focus, instead, not on whether the defendant could have expected that the plaintiff could bring a negligence action against him, specifically, but on the broader inquiry of whether the defendant could have expected that he would be held liable to a nursing home, in some way, for the type of misconduct alleged in the present case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Our Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Jewish Home\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"963469\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/257/531/#p532\">\n    257 Conn. at 531\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=778%20A.2d%2093\">\n    778 A.2d 93\n   </extracted-citation>\n   is instructive on this point. Our Supreme Court concluded in that case that a conservator could be held liable to a nursing home, specifically, for the losses it incurred as a result of the conservator's failure to timely secure Medicaid benefits for his ward. Id., at 539-44,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=778%20A.2d%2093\">\n    778 A.2d 93\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It is true that the nursing home in\n   <em>\n    Jewish Home\n   </em>\n   brought an action on a probate bond, rather than an action in negligence. What is significant for the purpose of our analysis, however, is that our Supreme Court recognized that a conservator could be held liable (1) to a nursing home, and (2) for the exact type of misconduct alleged in the present case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The fact that the plaintiff in the present case and the plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Jewish Home\n   </em>\n   are both nursing homes is significant because nursing homes are unique and differ from other creditors of an estate. This difference is primarily due to the critical nature of the services they provide to the ward-namely, shelter, food, and care to a vulnerable segment of our population.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Moreover, nursing homes are also unique because, unlike other service providers, they are very limited in their ability to refuse to provide or discontinue service to individuals who are indigent. Indeed, Connecticut by statute has imposed strict rules that govern the circumstances under which a nursing home\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   can (1) refuse to\n   admit an indigent patient, or (2) involuntarily discharge a patient. General Statutes \u00a7 19a-533(b) provides in relevant part: \"A nursing home which receives payment from the state for rendering care to indigent persons shall: (1)\n   <em>\n    Be prohibited from discriminating against indigent persons who apply for admission to such facility on the basis of source of payment\n   </em>\n   . Except as otherwise provided by law, all applicants for admission to such facility shall be admitted in the order in which such applicants apply for admission....\" (Emphasis added.) Subsection (b)(3) of \u00a7 19a-533 further prohibits nursing homes from \"requiring that an indigent person pay any sum of money or furnish any other consideration, including but not limited to the furnishing of an agreement by the relative, conservator or other responsible party of an indigent person which obligates such party to pay for care rendered to an indigent person as a condition for admission of such indigent person ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   General Statutes \u00a7 19a-535 governs the circumstances under which a nursing home may involuntarily\n   discharge a patient. Section 19a-535(b) provides, in relevant part, that \"[a] facility shall not transfer or discharge a resident from the facility except to meet the welfare of the resident which cannot be met in the facility, or unless the resident no longer needs the services of the facility due to improved health, the facility is required to transfer the resident pursuant to section 17b-359 or 17b-360, or the health or safety of individuals in the facility is endangered, or\n   <em>\n    in the case of a self-pay resident\n   </em>\n   , for the resident's nonpayment or arrearage of more than fifteen days of the facility room rate, or the facility ceases to operate....\" (Emphasis added.) Section 19a-535(a)(5) provides, in relevant part, that a \"self-pay resident means\n   <em>\n    a resident who is not receiving state or municipal assistance to pay for the cost of care at a facility\n   </em>\n   , but shall not include a resident who has filed an application with the Department of Social Services for Medicaid coverage for facility care but has not received an eligibility determination from the department on such application, provided that the resident has timely responded to requests by the department for information that is necessary to make such determination ....\" (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Thus, pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 19a-533 and 19a-535, a nursing home may not refuse to admit a patient simply because he or she is indigent, nor may a nursing home discharge a patient who is reliant on Medicaid or in the process of obtaining Medicaid benefits but otherwise unable to pay for the cost of his or her care. In other words, the nursing home's hands are metaphorically tied-in the case that a patient is indigent and unable to pay for the cost of care, the nursing home itself cannot apply on behalf of the patient for public assistance yet must continue to provide services to the patient at its own expense. This predicament highlights just how critical it is to the nursing home that a conservator, once\n   appointed, performs his or her duties in a timely and attentive fashion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, with respect to the defendant's argument that he could not expect that he would be held liable for the plaintiff's loss because no probate bond was issued, we reiterate that the type of misconduct alleged by the plaintiff against the defendant in the present case is almost identical to that complained of by the plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Jewish Home\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"963469\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/257/531/#p532\">\n    257 Conn. at 535, 543-44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=778%20A.2d%2093\">\n    778 A.2d 93\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Thus, the defendant should have at least been on notice that his failure to submit timely Johnson's application for Medicaid benefits could give rise to some sort of liability. Indeed, it would be unreasonable for the defendant to believe that the plaintiff would be left without a remedy simply because no probate bond was obtained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Finally, the defendant argues that the parties could not have expected that he would be held personally liable to the plaintiff for his failure to timely submit\n   Johnson's application for Medicaid benefits because he was acting as an agent of the Probate Court and thus is entitled to quasi-judicial immunity. A conservator is entitled to quasi-judicial immunity, however, only when his or her actions are expressly authorized or approved by the Probate Court.

See\n   <em>\n    Lawrence\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    O &amp; G Industries, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=319%20Conn.%20641\">\n    319 Conn. at 658\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=126%20A.3d%20569\">\n    126 A.3d 569\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . With respect to these two factors, the plaintiff argues that, if we decline to recognize that a conservator can be held personally liable to it for his or her breach of statutory duties, it would lessen any incentive on conservators to perform their duties efficiently and adequately, and thus undermine the purpose of allowing nursing homes to petition to have a conservator appointed in the first place. The plaintiff further argues that, with respect to the consideration of increased litigation, any concern that recognizing a duty in this context would increase significantly a conservator's exposure is misplaced because a conservator already has certain statutory duties that require him or her to timely secure funding for the ward's care. The defendant argues, however, that recognizing a duty in this context would chill, rather than encourage, individuals to take\n   on the role of conservator because it would increase a conservator's liability.\n   We recognize that, with respect to the third factor which contemplates the concern of increased litigation, \"[i]t is [often] easy to fathom how affirmatively imposing a duty on the defendants ... could encourage similarly situated future plaintiffs to litigate on the same grounds; that is true\n   <em>\n    anytime\n   </em>\n   a court establishes a potential ground for recovery.\" (Emphasis in original.)\n   <em>\n    Monk\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Temple George Associates\n   </em>\n   , LLC, supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5707361\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/273/108/#p114\">\n    273 Conn. at 120\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=869%20A.2d%20179\">\n    869 A.2d 179\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Thus, the relevant inquiry in the present case is whether recognizing a duty in this context would further encourage conservators to use reasonable care in their administration of the ward's estate and, if so, whether the advantages of encouraging such behavior would outweigh the negative effects of a corresponding increase in litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Our statutory scheme-or lack thereof-with respect to conservator liability has created a liability \"loop-hole.\" Conservators are able to escape liability in cases\n   in which no probate bond is issued even if they act negligently in carrying out their duties.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   As discussed in part II A of this opinion, \u00a7 45a-655(a) imposes certain statutory duties on conservators. Interestingly enough, however, our statutes do not provide any corresponding statutory cause of action to third parties who are harmed by a conservator's negligent failure to perform his or her duties when no probate bond is issued. Thus, it is likely that recognizing that a conservator can be held liable for his or her negligence even without a probate bond would incentivize conservators to carry out their duties in a timely manner and with due care, whereas someone else who is already exposed to this type of liability would not be so incentivized.

As we discussed in part II A of this opinion, the conservator of the estate already has a duty to pay their ward's debt and to use the assets of the estate to support the ward,\n   which necessarily includes timely securing any available public assistance if the ward lives in a nursing home and is unable to pay for the cost of his or her care.

We are therefore not imposing any additional duties on the conservator of the estate that he or she is not already required to perform.

Although we agree that recognizing such a duty would expose conservators to a new\n   <em>\n    type\n   </em>\n   of liability, we conclude that any corresponding increase in litigation would be minimal and not enough to outweigh the advantages of encouraging conservators to perform their obligations with due care. First, there likely would be no need to bring an action against a conservator in his or her personal capacity in cases where a probate bond was issued because, in those cases, an action could be\n   brought on the bond. Second, the nature of the relationship between a conservator and a nursing home is not normally contentious or fertile ground for litigation in the first instance. See\n   <em>\n    Gross\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Rell\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=304%20Conn.%20234\">\n    304 Conn. at 258\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20A.3d%20240\">\n    40 A.3d 240\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Our Supreme Court considered whether conservators, like guardians ad litem, should be entitled to quasi-judicial immunity for discretionary acts and concluded: \"The role of a guardian ad litem for children in the inherently hostile setting of a marital dissolution proceeding ... is distinguishable ... from the role of a court-appointed conservator. It is all but inevitable that, in a dissolution proceeding, at least one of the parties will be disgruntled by the guardian ad litem's conduct towards the children and his or her recommendations concerning their best interests. Accordingly, without immunity, the guardians would act like litigation lightning rods.... In contrast,\n   <em>\n    it is not all but inevitable that conservators will act as litigation lighting rods for third party claims\n   </em>\n   because there is no such inherent conflict between the conservatee's interests and the interests of others.\" [Citation omitted; emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.] ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Finally, with respect to the \"safety\" of the participants of the activity, we find it particularly worrisome that, if we decline\n   to recognize that the defendant owed the plaintiff a duty in the present case, the plaintiff and other nursing homes similarly situated will be left without a remedy that would allow them to recover losses sustained as a result of a conservator's negligence in cases where no probate bond is issued. The defendant argues that the plaintiff could have (1) requested the issuance of the probate bond itself, or (2) pursued a claim directly against Johnson's estate. We disagree with the defendant that the pursuit of either of these alternatives would suffice to make the plaintiff whole.\n   We find the defendant's suggestion that the nursing home that houses the ward, rather than the conservator of that ward's estate, should be required to ask the court to issue a probate bond to be unfair and unrealistic, as it would require a nursing home to monitor probate proceedings to ensure that a probate bond has been issued for each of its patients for which a conservator has been appointed. Imposing this obligation seems unnecessary considering that the issuance of a probate bond is already mandated by statute in certain circumstances. See General Statutes \u00a7 45a-139(c) ; see also Probate Court Rules \u00a7 35.1 (b). Moreover, this potential avenue of recovery exists only if a nursing home acts preemptively on an assumption that a conservator will act negligently which, once again, seems unnecessary considering that a conservator already has certain statutory duties that require the conservator to pay the ward's debts and to use the estate to support the ward. See General Statutes \u00a7 45a-655(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Pursuing a direct claim against a ward's estate would likewise be a fruitless endeavor for the plaintiff and other similarly situated nursing homes that encounter this issue because, typically, the ward's estate is insolvent. To obtain Medicaid benefits, an applicant must have less than $1600 in assets. Furthermore, because the cost of care at a nursing home is so expensive, even those individuals that have a considerable amount of assets in their estate likely will not be able to pay for the long-term costs of care. In those instances, the conservator should \"spend down\" the ward's assets so that the ward becomes eligible to receive Medicaid benefits, meaning that the ward's estate becomes insolvent for all practical purposes. See\n   <em>\n    Ross\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Giardi\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1200328\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/237/550/#p555\">\n    237 Conn. at 555-74\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=680%20A.2d%20113\">\n    680 A.2d 113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, pursuing a third-party claim against the estate would often be fruitless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Having considered all the relevant concerns of the parties, we conclude that the benefits of encouraging\n   conservators to carry out their duties with care and preventing financial harm outweigh any corresponding minimal increase in litigation. Thus, the second and third factors support the plaintiff's claim that the defendant owed it a duty of care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   C\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The fourth and final factor that we consider in conducting our public policy analysis is the law of other jurisdictions on this issue.

The plaintiff and the defendant both agree, and our independent research confirms, that no other reported decisions from other jurisdictions have decided the exact issue in this case, i.e., whether a conservator can be held personally liable to a nursing home facility or other third-party creditor, under a common-law theory of negligence, for failure to use care in performing his or her duties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Several of our sister states, however, have enacted legislation that allows a third party to bring a\n   <em>\n    statutory\n   </em>\n   cause of action against a conservator if the conservator\n   commits a tort in the course of the administration of the estate or the conservator otherwise is personally at fault for the party's loss.

The fact that those states allow a third party to bring a statutory, rather than a common-law, cause of action is of no consequence to our consideration of whether public policy favors recognizing a duty of care. Instead, the relevant observation for purposes of the present analysis is that other jurisdictions recognize that principles of fairness weigh in favor of providing\n   a third party with a remedy in the event that a conservator acts negligently and, as a result of that negligence, causes a third party to suffer harm.
