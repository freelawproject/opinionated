Petitioner presents a constitutional due process claim and a statutory \"fail to advise\" argument, as reflected in the following questions for review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-10\">\n   1. Is it a violation of due process and a failure to \"fully advise\" a driver of the administrative penalties that shall be imposed for refusing a breath test pursuant to [Md. Code, Transportation Article] \u00a7 16-205.1 when, after reading the [Motor Vehicle Administration's (\"MVA\") ] DR-15 advice form, a police officer's oral restatement of the penalties for failing and refusing a breath test omits the most severe mandatory penalty for refusal?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   2. Is the DR-15 form's failure to advise suspected drunk drivers of the length of time the ignition interlock would be required in the event of a refusal - one year - a violation of due process and a failure to \"fully\n   advise\" a driver of the administrative penalties that shall be imposed for refusing a breath test pursuant to [Md. Code, Transportation Article] \u00a7 16-205.1 ?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   For reasons discussed\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   , we answer both questions in the negative and shall affirm the judgment of the circuit court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Maryland Implied Consent Statute, Md. Code, Transportation Article (\"Transp.\") \u00a7 16-205.1,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   provides that a\n   motorist, who operates a motor vehicle on the roadway of the state, has given consent to take a chemical test (\"test\") to determine drug or alcohol concentration, if detained on reasonable suspicion of intoxicated driving. Transp. \u00a7 16-205.1(a)(2). Upon the detention of drivers suspected of driving while intoxicated, officers must advise motorists of the test and provide information regarding consequences of a test refusal and a positive test result.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The MVA has developed a standard form (\"the DR-15\" or \"Advice of Rights\" form) that officers use to advise detained motorists of the sanctions that will be imposed as a result of test refusal or a positive test result. The DR-15 includes all of the legislatively mandated advice that must be provided to motorists who are subject to chemical testing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    Legislative History\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The scope of an officer's required advice to motorists who are stopped on suspicion of intoxicated driving has expanded, as reflected by the legislative history of Transp. \u00a7 16-205.1. In 1993, the General Assembly added \u00a7 16-205.1(b)(2)(iii), which\n   required that officers advise of \"ineligibility for modification of a suspension or issuance of a restrictive license[ ]\" when motorists refused to take a test. 1993 Laws of Md., ch. 407 (S.B. 18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Changes in 1998 expanded the MVA's Ignition Interlock Program (\"Interlock Program\"), which permits individuals who were stopped under suspicion of driving while intoxicated to continue driving when their vehicle is equipped with an ignition interlock device. The MVA provides these individuals with a restricted license, which may be granted despite test refusal. 1998 Laws of Md., ch. 526 (H.B. 928).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In 2006, the General Assembly added Transp. \u00a7 16-205.1(b)(2)(iv), which requires officers to advise motorists of \"the\n   administrative sanctions, including ineligibility for modification of a suspension or issuance of a restrictive license unless the person participates in the Ignition Interlock System Program.\" 2006 Laws of Md., ch. 461 (H.B. 525). Each of these respective changes to Transp. \u00a7 16-205.1 is reflected in the DR-15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    The Commercial Driver's License Program\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Maryland Commercial Driver's License Act is codified in Transportation Article \u00a7\u00a7 16-801 - 16-820 (\"Act\"). A commercial motor vehicle is a vehicle that transports passengers, property, or hazardous materials and meets the size and weight parameters specified in Transp. \u00a7 16-803(c)(1). The Act requires that the driver of a commercial motor vehicle possess a single driver's license and demonstrate the knowledge and skills necessary to drive a commercial vehicle. Transp. \u00a7\u00a7 16-804, 16-807(b)(1). Under the Act, the MVA can disqualify the commercial driver's license (\"CDL\") of drivers who refuse to submit to an alcohol concentration test while driving a commercial vehicle. Transp. \u00a7 16-812(a)(3). In accordance with Transp. \u00a7 16-205.1(f)(8)(vii), disqualification of a CDL is not subject to any modifications, nor may a restricted CDL be granted. Despite a CDL disqualification, the motorist may retain privileges to drive a\n   <em>\n    non-commercial\n   </em>\n   vehicle through participation in the Interlock Program. Transp. \u00a7 16-812(p).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In 2005, then Governor Robert L. Ehrlich, Jr. signed Senate Bill 640, which established new and stricter sanctions for those holding CDLs. The bill connected commercial driver's license holders' offenses in a non-commercial vehicle to their CDLs, and the change was reflected in Transp. \u00a7 16-205.1(b)(1)(iii). The statute reads, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   In addition to any applicable driver's license suspensions authorized under this section, in the case of a person operating a commercial motor vehicle\n   <em>\n    or who holds a commercial instructional permit or a commercial driver's license who refuses to take a test\n   </em>\n   :\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   1. Disqualify the person's commercial instructional permit or commercial driver's license for a period of 1 year for a first offense, 3 years for a first offense which occurs while transporting hazardous materials required to be placarded, and disqualify for life if the person's commercial instructional permit or commercial driver's license has been previously disqualified for at least 1 year ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   (Italics added for emphasis). The DR-15 also reflected these changes:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     If you hold a commercial driver's license (CDL)\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <em>\n    and were driving a non-commercial motor vehicle when you were stopped\n   </em>\n   , and you refuse to submit to a test, your CDL or privilege shall be disqualified for 1 year for a 1st offense or for life if your CDL or privilege has been previously disqualified for at least 1 year under Maryland Transportation Article \u00a7 16-812 (a) or (b), a federal law, or any other state's law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   (Bold in original) (italics added for emphasis).

Upon approaching the vehicle, officers detected a strong odor of alcohol on Petitioner's breath and observed bloodshot watery eyes as well as slurred speech. Suspecting that Petitioner was driving under the influence of alcohol, an officer instructed Petitioner to perform several field sobriety tests. Petitioner was unable to complete the tests in a satisfactory manner. He was detained for driving under the influence of alcohol. Officers transported Petitioner to the Montgomery County Police Department, where he was provided the DR-15 Advice of Rights form. The officer then instructed Petitioner to follow along as he read the form aloud. The DR-15 reads, in pertinent part, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   You may refuse to submit to the test(s), unless you were in a motor vehicle accident resulting in the death of or life-threatening injury to another person[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    Suspension of Your Maryland Driver's License or Driving Privilege:\n   </strong>\n   <em>\n    If you refuse to submit to the test\n   </em>\n   , or if you submit to the test and the result indicates an alcohol concentration of 0.08 or more at the time of testing,\n   <em>\n    your Maryland driver's license shall be confiscated\n   </em>\n   , you will be issued an Order of Suspension and, if eligible, a temporary license valid for 45 days.

A body camera used throughout Petitioner's stop and arrest reveals that officers attempted to clarify whether Petitioner held a CDL. During their inquiry and after reading the DR-15, the officers orally asserted the repercussions of refusing to take the test:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   Officer 1: Basically what I read you is, if you refuse to submit to the test, it's 270 days for your license, but you have a CDL Class B (holding license).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   Officer 2: You drive for Metro?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   Officer 1: Who do you drive for? The CDL that you have.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   Officer 2: You drive a Metro bus?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   Officer 1: It says trains, coach, or bus, you drive a bus?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   Officer 2: I saw your Metro ID in your wallet, you drive for Metro? You realize if you don't take the test, your driver's license is going to be suspended for 270 days, if you don't take this test. And if you take it, and it's a high blow, you blow anything 0.08 or higher, you get suspended for 180 days. So, if you take the test and you don't do well, it's a\n   180 day suspension. If you don't take the test, your license gets suspended for 270 days. And because I assume that you drive a bus for Metro based on your CDL and the ID you have in your wallet, that means this is going to affect your work. So this can affect your work for 180 days or it can affect your work for 270 days. It's completely up to you. Would you like to take the test or not?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Petitioner did not respond. The officers did not repeat the advisement that Petitioner's CDL would be disqualified for a year if he opted to refuse the test. After repeatedly asking Petitioner whether he wanted to take the test and based on his lacking responsiveness, the officers treated the lack of response as a refusal. As a result, Petitioner was issued an Order of Suspension.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Petitioner filed a timely request for an administrative hearing, which was held on July 14, 2017. Petitioner testified that the officers' oral assertions after the DR-15 led him to believe that he would be able to get his license and CDL back after 270 days. Petitioner testified that, had he known his CDL would be disqualified for a full year, he would have opted to take the test. Petitioner asserted that the officers' oral advisements and the DR-15 were false, misleading and violated his due process rights, as well as his right to \"full advisement\" of administrative sanctions under Transp. \u00a7 16-205.1. The Administrative Law Judge rejected Petitioner's arguments, and held that the DR-15 provided sufficient advice and that the officers' oral advisements were factually correct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   On January 10, 2018, following a hearing, the Circuit Court for Montgomery County affirmed the decision of the Administrative Law Judge.

In the case at bar, Petitioner was read the DR-15 in full. Officers subsequently advised Petitioner that if he took the test, his license would be suspended for 180 days, but if he did not take the test, his license would be suspended for 270 days. This timeframe regarding the suspension of Petitioner's non-CDL license was proper. The officers did, however, misstate the implication on Petitioner's work by stating \"[T]his can affect\n   <em>\n    your work\n   </em>\n   for 180 days or it can affect\n   <em>\n    your work\n   </em>\n   for 270 days.\" In reality, Petitioner's test refusal implicated his work for a year. (\"If you hold a commercial driver's license (CDL) and were driving a non-commercial motor vehicle when you were stopped, and you refuse to submit to a test, your CDL or privilege shall be disqualified for 1 year for a first offense ....\" DR-15 (bolding omitted) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Petitioner asserts that the oral advisements were misleading, particularly with regards to the effect on his work, because they implied that Petitioner's sanction would be confined to a maximum of 270 days rather than a year-long disqualification of his CDL. There is no evidence that officers' oral statements misled or confused Petitioner regarding the effect a test refusal could have on his employment. Petitioner did not testify that the oral advisements misled him in any way and the body camera footage reveals that Petitioner was unresponsive throughout the officers' inquiry regarding whether he wanted to take the test. There is nothing that demonstrates the officers constructed an obstacle or \"road block\" that unduly burdened Petitioner's decision-making, nor does anything that the officers said suggest that they induced Petitioner's decision-making. Because the information in the DR-15 provided full advisement and the officers' verbal assertions were not misleading or false, Petitioner's statutory claim regarding full advisement is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     As-Applied Due Process Claim under the Fourteenth Amendment and Article 24 of the\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Maryland Declaration of Rights\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Petitioner makes an as-applied due process claim, asserting that the officers' oral advisements prejudiced him because he did not appreciate that his CDL would be disqualified for a year if he refused the test.

The officers' subsequent oral advisements did not prejudice Petitioner, a requisite component of an as-applied due process claim.

The DR-15 provides officers with a script to address Transp. \u00a7 16-205.1(b)(3)(vii),\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   . The form states, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   <strong>\n    Instead of requesting a hearing or upon the suspension or revocation of your driver's license, you may elect to participate in the Ignition Interlock System Program\n   </strong>\n   if the following conditions are met: 1) your driver's license is not currently suspended, revoked, canceled, or refused, and 2) within 30 days of the date of this Order of Suspension you a) elect in writing to participate in the Ignition Interlock System Program\n   <em>\n    for 1 year if your test resulted in an alcohol concentration of 0.15 or more or you refused the test\n   </em>\n   or 6 months if your test resulted in an alcohol concentration of at least 0.08 but less than 0.15; and b) surrender a valid Maryland driver's license or sign a statement certifying that the license is no longer in your possession. An Ignition Interlock Election form is located on the reverse side of the driver's copy of the Order of Suspension.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   (Bold in original) (italics added for emphasis). Petitioner asserts that this one year participation in the Interlock Program for refusing a test or having an alcohol concentration of 0.15 or more is unclear, resulting in a violation of full advisement and due process. Petitioner contends that the lacking clarity of this year-long duration arises from another, earlier section of the DR-15, which states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   <strong>\n    If you refuse to submit to a test, your suspension shall be 270 days for a 1st offense and 2 years for a 2nd or subsequent offense.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   <strong>\n    If you refuse a test, or take a test with a result of 0.15 or more, you shall be ineligible for modification of your suspension or the issuance of a restricted license, unless you participate in the Ignition Interlock System Program under Maryland Transportation Article \u00a7 16-404.1.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   (Bold in original). Petitioner asserts that this portion of the DR-15 implies that motorists are eligible for modification of suspension or issuance of a restricted license if they participate in the Interlock Program for a period of 270 days. This is in contrast to the mandated year of participation that results from test refusal or a blood alcohol concentration at or above 0.15. However, the language of the DR-15 is clear. The provision providing that motorists must \"participate in the Ignition Interlock System Program for 1 year if your test resulted in an alcohol concentration of 0.15 or more or if you refused the test ...\" is unequivocal. Not only was Petitioner read this provision, but he was provided with a copy of the DR-15 to follow along as officers read it to him. The provision outlining the year-long duration begins with a bolded heading that draws the readers' attention to the fact that the paragraph applies specifically to the Interlock Program. There is no ambiguity regarding this provision or duration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Motor Vehicle Admin. v.

COSTS TO BE PAID BY PETITIONER.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Judge Watts joins in judgment only.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-99\">\n    Transp. \u00a7 16-205.1 provides a statutory structure for suspending the license of a driver who refuses to submit to testing. The statute operates to reduce the incidence of drunk driving and to protect public safety by encouraging drivers to take alcohol concentration tests.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-100\">\n    Transp. \u00a7 16-205.1(b) outlines the applicable sanctions for drivers producing a chemical test result greater than 0.08 or who refuse testing. The statute provides that a test result greater than 0.08 can result in suspension of the person's driving privilege for 180 days for the first offense, or suspension of the person's license for 270 days for refusing a test for the first offense. Transp. \u00a7 16-205.1(b)(1)(iii) further provides that individuals operating a commercial motor vehicle or who hold a commercial instructional permit or a commercial driver's license and refuse to take a test will have their commercial instructional permit or commercial driver's license suspended for one year for a first offense.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-101\">\n    A positive test result arises when a motorist has a blood alcohol concentration of 0.08 or more as measured by grams of alcohol per 100 milliliters of blood or grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath. Transp. \u00a7 11-174.1(a).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-102\">\n    The DR-15 outlines important information for the suspected drunk driver including the possible sanctions associated with varying levels of blood alcohol concentration, the sanctions for refusing to take the test, and the right to have an administrative hearing, among other things.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-103\">\n    Mr. Chamberlain\n    <em>\n     may\n    </em>\n    have obtained a restricted license or modification of suspension in the event that he took the test, but refusal to take the test provided no such option. 326 Md. at 312, 604 A.2d at 922.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-104\">\n    During his administrative hearing, Petitioner testified that he was not aware of how a test refusal would affect his CDL, which is distinct from the assertion that he was misled or provided with false information. Petitioner also never denied that the DR-15 was read to him in full.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
