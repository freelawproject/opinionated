BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   [\u00b6 2] The following facts are drawn from the docket entries and the court's findings set out in its competency order, which are supported by the record, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the State.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

He was arrested that day and released on bail with conditions. Gerrier was indicted on those charges on September 23, 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   [\u00b6 4] Gerrier has had a long history of mental health issues and treatment, and has limited cognitive and intellectual abilities. At Gerrier's request, a competency evaluation was conducted in October 2016. During the pendency of this case, Gerrier also underwent psychological, psychosexual, and neuropsychological evaluations. A competency hearing was held on December 5, 2016, and on December 14, the court (\n   <em>\n    Mullen, J.\n   </em>\n   ) issued an order in which it determined that Gerrier was competent to stand trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   [\u00b6 5] Gerrier ultimately entered conditional guilty pleas on all three charges, preserving his right to appeal from the order finding him to be competent and the order denying his motion to suppress.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   n.1. The court (\n   <em>\n    Marden, J.\n   </em>\n   ) sentenced Gerrier to a term of seven years for the gross sexual assault charge followed by twenty years of supervised release with conditions, and concurrent terms of five years for the unlawful sexual contact charge and 364 days for the charge of furnishing liquor to a minor. Gerrier timely appealed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   M.R. App. P. 2B(b)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   II. DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   [\u00b6 6] Gerrier argues that the court (\n   <em>\n    Mullen, J.\n   </em>\n   ) erred when it determined that he was competent to stand trial. Before addressing Gerrier's arguments, we take this opportunity to clarify Maine law regarding the burden of proof and the evidentiary standard that attends a pretrial competency determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   [\u00b6 7] Whether a person is competent to stand trial implicates his or her due process rights.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thursby v.

That responsibility is not limited to defense counsel, however, because the court also has a duty to order an inquiry into the defendant's ability to proceed with the case if it \"learns from observation, reasonable claim or credible source that there is genuine doubt of defendant's mental condition to comprehend his situation or make his defense.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8099531\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/223/61/#p66\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   15 M.R.S. \u00a7 101-D(1). Ultimately, if the defendant's competency is challenged, the court must determine whether the defendant is\n   <em>\n    incompetent\n   </em>\n   pursuant to 15 M.R.S. \u00a7 101-D(5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   [\u00b6 9] Under section 101-D(5), the court is obligated to make a competency determination \"upon the motion of the attorney for the defendant or upon the court's own motion.\" If, after conducting a hearing, the court determines that the defendant is incompetent to stand trial, it \"shall continue the case until such time as the defendant is determined by the court to be competent.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8099531\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/223/61/#p66\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The statute is therefore framed in terms of a finding of\n   <em>\n    incompetency\n   </em>\n   , further demonstrating a legislative approach that in Maine an accused is presumed to be competent. At the hearing, the burden of proof falls on the party seeking the determination of incompetency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   It is likely that in most cases that party will be the defendant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Medina v.

In the event that the court raises the issue sua sponte, both parties have the opportunity to present evidence of the defendant's mental condition. If, for whatever reason, the defendant disagrees with the court's concerns, he is not obligated to present evidence of his own incompetence and may choose to present evidence showing the contrary, or may present no evidence at all.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

The court acknowledged the psychologist's concerns that Gerrier's \"combination of intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, and significant mood issues do significantly impair his ability to demonstrate the full range of trial competence skills needed for this complex situation.\" After considering the psychologist's concerns, however, the court determined that Gerrier \"demonstrated an ability to perform each function set forth in\n   <em>\n    Haraden.\n   </em>\n   \"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   [\u00b6 15] The court's finding that Gerrier was competent to stand trial is supported by evidence in the record that Gerrier (1) was capable of understanding the nature and object of the charges against him; (2) demonstrated an understanding, albeit somewhat limited, of the potential consequences of the charges against him,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lewis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7389583\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/584/622/#p624\">\n    584 A.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   624 ; (3) understood the difference between the sentence contemplated by the original plea offer that the State rescinded and the possible sentence he could receive if he were found guilty after trial; and (4) had a basic understanding of the consequences of being on the sex offender registry.

The experts who evaluated Gerrier commented on his strong memory and his ability to understand the difference between a plea bargain and proceeding to trial.
