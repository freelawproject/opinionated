On December 1, 2017, this Court granted his petition for a writ of certiorari. He contends that he was denied effective assistance of counsel in his 2000 criminal trial and in his 2003 direct appeal to this Court. This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this case should not be summarily decided. After a close review of the record and careful consideration of the parties' arguments (both written and oral), we are satisfied that cause has not been shown and that this case may be decided at this time. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    Facts and Travel\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On September 11, 2000, applicant was charged by criminal indictment with: murder in the first degree (Count One); felony assault with a dangerous weapon (Count Two); carrying a pistol without a license (Count Three); and possession of a firearm by a fugitive (Count Four). Those charges stemmed from an incident that occurred on April 9, 2000, during which applicant fatally shot Manuel Clemente \"in the back of the neck as Clemente was leaving an apartment building on Dartmouth Avenue\n   in Providence\" after a confrontation between the two at a party.\n   <em>\n    State v.

I know it was my practice to make copies and especially if my people are out in the prison, I would bring them a copy * * *.\" Trial counsel added that he had no independent recollection of going to the prison and giving applicant physical copies of the documents. Trial counsel further testified as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \"I recall speaking to [Mr. Jimenez] about his testimony and what he had to say.

It is his contention that \"the fact that his counsel failed to give him any copies of documents standing alone would show counsel did not function at the level guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The only document that Mr. Jimenez alluded to in his postconviction relief application was \"applicant's hand written and executed April 9\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   , 2000 confession which applicant wrote at the Providence Police station * * *.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the hearing, Mr. Jimenez testified that his trial counsel did not provide him with that purported handwritten statement. The relevant portion of the hearing transcript reads as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   \"[APPLICANT'S COUNSEL:] What did [trial counsel] say about the handwritten statement?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   \"[APPLICANT:] Oh, he asked me where is the - I think he asked me where was the statement, and I told him, I mean, the police - the police has [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] the statement. That's what I told him.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   \"[APPLICANT'S COUNSEL:] And what did he say?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   \"[APPLICANT:] He said he was going to try to find it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   \"[APPLICANT'S COUNSEL:] Did he ever provide it or produce it for you?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   \"[APPLICANT:] No. Because I remember at the trial I asked him for my statement, and I don't know who said it, but somebody said that there was no statement. And I told him, Why not? I mean, I just - I wrote the statement, and I signed it. So it's supposed to be somewhere.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   In his decision following this hearing, the hearing justice found as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   \"At trial and at the [postconviction relief] hearing, Jimenez said that he had also provided the police with a handwritten statement, which he faults his trial attorney for not retrieving. He testified at trial and at the [postconviction relief] hearing that he had never read the typed statement. In denying Jimenez'[s] new trial motion, this Court rejected any notion that Jimenez was ignorant of the contents of that statement * * *. The Court also accepts the state's assertion that there never was any handwritten statement * * *.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The existence\n   <em>\n    vel non\n   </em>\n   of the just-referenced \"handwritten statement\" was a question of fact that the hearing justice ruled upon after hearing testimony from both Mr. Jimenez and his trial counsel. The hearing justice determined that that statement did not exist, and this Court perceives no clear error in his determination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fontaine v.

Affording the\n   requisite deference to the hearing justice's findings, we perceive no basis for concluding that trial counsel's representation of applicant was constitutionally deficient in this regard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   To the extent that applicant contends that his trial counsel was ineffective because he failed to provide applicant with other documents related to the case, we similarly defer to the hearing justice's determinations and conclude that there was no clear error on this ground. It is fundamental that \"[t]his Court will not disturb credibility determinations by a postconviction-relief hearing justice unless the [applicant] demonstrates by a preponderance of the evidence that the hearing justice was clearly wrong.\"\n   <em>\n    Rice v.

At the postconviction relief hearing, applicant's trial counsel testified in pertinent part as follows with respect to this issue:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   \"[COUNSEL FOR THE STATE:] Do you recall whether or not you provided Mr. Jimenez with the package that was put together by the police in this case?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   \"[TRIAL COUNSEL:] I don't remember whether or not I did give it to him. I know it was my practice to make copies and especially if my people are out in the prison, I would bring them a copy * * *. But I don't have an independent recollection that, you know, I actually went there and gave it to him.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   \"[COUNSEL FOR THE STATE:] And is that because it was so long ago?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   \"[TRIAL COUNSEL:] Yes, that's why.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   We see no basis for concluding that the hearing justice erred when he determined that applicant had not met his \"heavy burden\" under\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   with respect to this allegation of error. The applicant has failed to satisfy both prongs of the\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   analysis concerning ineffective assistance of trial counsel. Mr. Jimenez's assertion before this Court that he \"has proof of the prejudice that resulted from the counsel's error\" in not providing him with documents is not even remotely sufficient to meet his burden under\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   . Mr. Jimenez's burden was to show by a preponderance of the evidence that the hearing justice's determination was clearly wrong and that by allegedly failing to provide him with documents relating to the case, his trial counsel was so ineffective that \"there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\"\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n    466 U.S. at 694\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rice\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7294325\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/38/9/#p16\">\n    38 A.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   17 n.11.
