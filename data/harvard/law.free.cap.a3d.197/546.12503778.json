Here, we primarily consider whether legislation requiring hookah lounges to close at midnight violates due process and equal protection guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. Finding no Constitutional or other legal infirmity, we uphold the\n   restriction as a valid exercise of Baltimore County's police power.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND &amp; PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In May 2014, the Baltimore County Council passed a bill that requires hookah lounges in the County to close between midnight and 6:00 a.m. every day. Specifically, the bill amended the Baltimore County Zoning Regulations (\"BCZR\") to include a definition of \"Hookah Lounge\" that restricts hookah lounges' hours of operation. The definition of \"Hookah Lounge,\" codified at Article 1, \u00a7 101.1 of the BCZR, is as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   HOOKAH LOUNGE-Any facility, establishment, or location whose business operation, whether as its primary use or as an ancillary use, includes the smoking of tobacco or other substances through one or more hookah pipes (also commonly referred to as a hookah, waterpipe, shisha or nareghile), including but not limited to establishments known variously as hookah bars, hookah lounges or hookah cafes. A hookah lounge may only\n   operate from 6:00 a.m. to 12:00 midnight.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   This restriction on hours of operation prompted the corporation that operates the Towson Nights hookah lounge (\"Towson Nights\"), along with the landlord of the Towson Nights premises (collectively, \"Appellants\"), to challenge the bill on constitutional and other grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Towson Nights contends that, absent the County ordinance, approximately 90% of its business would take place between 11:00 p.m. and 2:00 a.m.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Before the bill went into effect, Towson Nights stayed open until 2:00 a.m. Sunday through Thursday, and until 3:00 a.m. on Fridays and Saturdays.) Thus, Appellants claim that the restriction on business hours was tantamount to a cessation of the business's lawful use,\n   which should have entitled Towson Nights to an \"amortization\" period longer than the 45 days given to comply with the act.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Appellants further argue: (1) the County's placement of time restrictions in a zoning ordinance is\n   <em>\n    ultra vires\n   </em>\n   ; (2) the requirement to close at midnight violates substantive due process; and (3) singling out hookah lounges, but not similar businesses, violates equal protection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The bill's constitutionality was first upheld by an administrative law judge, and then, upon a\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   appeal, by the Board of Appeals of Baltimore County.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Circuit Court for Baltimore County affirmed the Board's decision. Appellants timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Restricting Hookah Lounges' Hours of Operation Was an Exercise of the County's Police Power.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Contrary to Appellants' position, Baltimore County did not act\n   <em>\n    ultra vires\n   </em>\n   by enacting time restrictions in a zoning\n   regulation. Here, the provision restricting hours of operation is an exercise of the County's police power and not a zoning law, regardless of whether the restriction is encompassed within the BCZR definition of \"hookah lounge.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Piscatelli v.

Accordingly, Baltimore County has the authority to pass local laws upon all matters covered by its grant of express powers from the General Assembly. Those express powers specify that, as a charter county, Baltimore County may \"pass any ordinance, resolution, or bylaw not inconsistent with State law that ... may aid in maintaining the peace, good government, health, and welfare of the county.\" Md. Code (2013), Local Government Article, \u00a7 10-206(a)(2). In short, Baltimore County has the express power to pass ordinances to protect the public's health and safety.

We are not persuaded. To the contrary, the County's regulation is plainly a rational attempt at protecting the public's safety and welfare.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Preventive measures aimed at shielding the public from potential exposure to criminal activity can be a valid exercise of the police power.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dawson v.

And here, the record amply demonstrates reasonable grounds for public safety concerns. In the executive summary of the bill prepared for Councilmembers by the County's Legislative Counsel, the County stated that in a six-month-period prior to the bill's adoption, there were 37 arrests and 39 calls for service at various hookah lounges throughout the County-all occurring after 9:00 p.m.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The executive summary also observed that police had received disturbance\n   and loud music calls in connection with hookah lounges throughout the County, as well as calls connecting hookah lounges to underage drinking, assault, CDS violations, and handgun violations. Moreover, we note the grim irony that two separate stabbing incidents occurred outside Appellants' own hookah lounge after midnight on the very day that the bill went into effect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Additionally, public health concerns about exposure to tobacco smoke rationally support the County's regulation of operating hours.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The County's executive summary of the\n   ordinance observed that \"[a] typical one-hour-long hookah smoking session involves inhaling 100-200 times the volume of smoke inhaled from a single cigarette.\" According to one scientific study of hookah lounges in the Baltimore region that was included in the record, indoor airborne concentrations of particulate matter and carbon monoxide were not only \"markedly elevated in waterpipe cafes,\" but \"markedly greater than expected compared with venues allowing cigarette smoking.\" Christine M.

The study further found that the mean concentrations of particulate matter measured in the Baltimore region's hookah lounges \"greatly and consistently exceeded\" the EPA and World Health Organization's 24-hour ambient air quality standards, and that the overall average concentration of carbon monoxide was twice the EPA's 8-hour standard.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2016012\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/329/275/#p285\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Despite hookah's relatively benign reputation, the scientific literature has linked hookah use to \"health problems including chronic bronchitis, lung cancer, oral cancer, prostate cancer, heart disease and pregnancy complications similar to those seen with cigarette smoking.

In a 2016 memo to the People's Counsel for Baltimore County that was included in the record, the Legal Resource Center for Public Health Policy at the University of Maryland School of Law observed that nearly one in four college undergraduates use hookah, \"surpassing all other tobacco products among this population,\" and at least half of the hookah lounges in Maryland were then \"within 2 miles of a college campus.\" The 2016 memo further stated that \"hookah smoke contains many of the same harmful components found in cigarette smoke, including nicotine, tar, and various heavy metals,\" and that during a one-hour session a hookah user may inhale \"9 times the amount of carbon monoxide as a single cigarette.\"\n   Before turning to our equal protection analysis, we briefly address a few other claims raised by Appellants in the context of due process. First, Appellants seem to suggest that the County's time restrictions were irrational (or at least, that the County's motives were not discernible) because there was no stated purpose for the time restrictions contained within a preamble to the bill. Such a claim is without merit. Preambles are \"infrequently used\" in legislation\n   and are \"sometimes desirable\"-hardly required.\n   <em>\n    Wash. Gas Light Co. v. Md. Pub. Serv.

Additionally, Appellants contend that the County's regulation might actually be a back-door attempt at the sort of alcohol regulation preempted by the Alcoholic Beverages Article. On the one hand, this claim is a little curious for Appellants to make, considering that Towson Nights no longer allows the consumption of alcohol on its premises. In any event, the claim is meritless.

Over a six-month period prior to the bill's enactment, Baltimore County police made 37 late-night arrests related to hookah lounges, and police received calls linking hookah lounges to underage drinking, assault, CDS violations, and handgun violations. To repeat a few of the public health concerns-significant concentrations of particulate matter and carbon monoxide have been measured at hookah lounges, and during a one-hour smoking session a typical hookah user will inhale a volume of smoke equivalent to 100 or more cigarettes. Hookah lounges seem to have particular appeal to college students, and as of 2016 at least half of the hookah lounges in the State were within two miles of a college campus. As such, the fact that the County did not require other businesses that offer late-night diversions to close at midnight does not create an arbitrary distinction that rises to the level of an equal protection violation-especially considering that there has been no contention by Appellants that the County drew upon suspect distinctions or trammeled upon any fundamental rights in differentiating between late-night establishments. Despite Appellants' characterization of hookah lounges as basically equivalent to other sites of late-night diversion (especially cigar bars), we determine that the County's distinction is reasonable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Piscatelli\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"586465\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/378/623/#p639\">\n    378 Md. at 645\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"586465,586438\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/837/931/\">\n    837 A.2d 931\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (reasonable to conclude that patrons of one type of establishment offering entertainment \"might be more likely to disturb the public in the early morning hours than the patrons\" of similar businesses).
