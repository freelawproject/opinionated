We disagree, and thus affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n   The plaintiff commenced the present action in November, 2013. He alleged three counts against the defendant: employment discrimination in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 2011) \u00a7 46a-60 (a) (1);\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   discriminatory retaliation in violation of \u00a7 46a-60 (a) (4); and aiding and abetting discrimination in violation of \u00a7 46a-60 (a) (5). The plaintiff alleged that the defendant employed him to be a cleaner/porter at the Enterprise-Schoolhouse Apartments (apartments) in Waterbury from March 13, 2012, until August 3, 2012. The apartments were managed by WinnResidential, a client of\n   the defendant. Sandino Cifuentes was the plaintiff's supervisor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The plaintiff alleged that he was the pastor of Tabernacle of Reunion Church (church). Cifuentes knew that he was the pastor of the church. The plaintiff alleged that he was part of a cleaning crew that was led by Luis Martinez, who was the chaplain at the church, and that Cifuentes had informed Martinez that while he was working, Martinez should not refer to the plaintiff as \"pastor\" or give him the respect ordinarily afforded a pastor. While he was at work, the plaintiff frequently greeted tenants by stating \"God bless,\" but in giving such greetings, he was never delayed for more than a minute or two. On June 14, 2012, Cifuentes warned the plaintiff about interacting with tenants of the apartments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On or about June 22, 2012, Carolyn Hagan, the manager of the apartments, e-mailed Cifuentes, relaying information she had received from Daisy Alejandro, assistant manager of the apartments. Tenants Enrique Cintron and his wife, Jorge Cintron, had informed Alejandro that, during a church service, the plaintiff had read the names of tenants who were in jeopardy of being evicted. The plaintiff alleged that the Cintrons had lodged the complaint against him in retaliation for his having corrected them for inappropriately playing music in the church. He also alleged that at no time had he read the names of tenants who were in danger of being evicted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The plaintiff further alleged that on or about June 26, 2012, Hagan requested that Cifuentes remove the plaintiff from his position. Cifuentes discharged the plaintiff from the defendant's employ on August 3, 2012, for the reasons that the plaintiff spent too much time talking to the tenants and Hagan's accusation that the plaintiff had read the names of tenants in jeopardy of\n   eviction from the apartments. Also, the plaintiff alleged that Wendy Smart, a representative of the defendant, signed a statement stating that the plaintiff \"[o]ver-stepped the boundaries of church and work.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In count one, the plaintiff claimed that, through its agents, the defendant had violated the act by interfering with his privilege of employment on the basis of his religion. The defendant exhibited ill will, malice, improper motive, and indifference to his religion. In count two, the plaintiff alleged that he held a bona fide religious belief and that the defendant's agents were aware that the plaintiff was the pastor and Martinez was the chaplain of the church. The defendant's agents retaliated against him for practicing his religious beliefs and customs by using the terms \"pastor\" and \"chaplain.\" In count three, the plaintiff alleged that the defendant aided and abetted the unlawful conduct of its agents, who\n   discriminated against him on the basis of his religious beliefs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On March 30, 2015, the defendant filed an answer in which it denied the material allegations of the complaint and alleged nine special defenses. The fourth special defense to all counts of the complaint alleged: \"All actions taken by [the defendant] with respect to [the] [p]laintiff and [the] [p]laintiff's employment were under-taken for legitimate, nondiscriminatory business reasons.\" The plaintiff filed a general denial of the defendant's special defenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The defendant filed a motion for summary judgment on July 8, 2016. The defendant claimed that the plaintiff could not establish a prima facie case of employment discrimination and retaliation under the act. Even if the plaintiff were able to establish a prima facie case of\n   employment discrimination and retaliation, those claims would fail because the defendant had a legitimate, nondiscriminatory, nonretaliatory basis for terminating the plaintiff's employment, and the plaintiff cannot demonstrate that the basis is a pretext. The defendant further contended that the plaintiff's claim that it aided and abetted its agent's discriminatory conduct failed because (1) the plaintiff could not establish a material issue of fact as to his discrimination and retaliatory discharge claims, which are predicates to a claim of aiding and abetting, and (2) the defendant cannot be liable for aiding and abetting agents who are not parties to the present action. The defendant appended affidavits from Cifuentes, Hagan, Alejandro and Joseph Deming, superintendent of the apartments, and other documents to its memorandum of law in support of summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The plaintiff filed an objection to the defendant's motion for summary judgment on October 3, 2016. He asserted that there were genuine issues of material fact and that he had demonstrated a prima facie case of employment discrimination, retaliatory discharge and aiding and abetting under the act. The plaintiff attached his own affidavit to his memorandum of law. The defendant filed a reply to the plaintiff's objection in which it contended that the plaintiff had failed to present evidence that could persuade a rational fact finder that the defendant's legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for terminating the plaintiff's employment is false or pretextual.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The parties argued the motion for summary judgment on November 7, 2016. The court issued its memorandum of decision on February 15, 2017. The court set forth the procedural history of the case and identified the exhibits the defendant had submitted in support of summary judgment. After setting forth the standards for summary judgment and the legal principles governing\n   employment discrimination claims, the court found that the defendant was entitled to summary judgment on each count of the complaint by meeting its burden of proving the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   With respect to the plaintiff's claim of employment discrimination, the court cited the controlling statute. Section 46a-60 (a) provided in relevant part: \"It shall be a discriminatory practice ... (1) [f]or an employer ... to discharge from employment any individual ... because of the individual's ... religious creed ....\" The court found that the plaintiff alleged that on March 13, 2012, he was hired by the defendant\n   to be a cleaner/ porter at the apartments, and that he is the pastor at the church. During the course of his duties at the apartments, the plaintiff frequently greeted tenants with the phrase \"God bless\" and spent time talking with them. Cifuentes warned the plaintiff on June 14, 2012, about interacting with tenants as he had been doing. On June 22, 2012, Hagan received information that the plaintiff, during a service at the church, read the names of tenants who were in jeopardy of being evicted from the apartments. On June 26, 2012, Hagan requested that Cifuentes terminate the plaintiff from his position. Cifuentes discharged the plaintiff on August 3, 2012, on the basis of his spending too much time talking with tenants and acting inappropriately when he read the names of tenants at church. The court concluded that the plaintiff had not demonstrated that his firing occurred under circumstances giving rise to a prima facie inference of discrimination. The plaintiff merely had \"alleged the conclusory statement that [b]ecause [the] [d]efendant disapproved of [the] plaintiff's use of religious terms while at work and was aware of his\n   status as a pastor, [the] plaintiff has shown direct evidence of discriminat[ory] motive.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.) The court concluded that the plaintiff had not satisfied a prima facie case of employment discrimination under \u00a7 46a-60 (a) (1). The defendant demonstrated the absence of any genuine issue of material fact regarding the lack of circumstances giving rise to an inference of religious discrimination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   As to the retaliatory discharge claim alleged in count two, the court cited \u00a7 46a-60 (a) (4). Section 46a-60 (a) provided in relevant part: \"It shall be a discriminatory practice ... (4) [f]or any ... employer ... to discharge, expel or otherwise discriminate against any person ... because such person has filed a complaint or testified or assisted in any proceeding under section 46a-82, 46a-83 or 46a-84 ....\" The defendant asserted that the plaintiff had failed to allege that he had engaged in a protected activity. The plaintiff responded that he engaged in a protected activity when he openly used religious terms at work, spoke out against the defendant by communicating with Martinez and referred to him as chaplain, contrary to the defendant's instructions, and that the defendant retaliated against him by firing him. The court concluded that the protected activity the plaintiff claimed was not a protected activity under the act and, therefore, he had failed to establish a prima facie case of retaliation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In regard to count three, \u00a7 46a-60 (a) provided in relevant part: \"It shall be a discriminatory practice ... (5) [f]or any person, whether an employer or an employee or not, to aid, abet, incite, compel or coerce the doing of any act declared to be a discriminatory employment practice or to attempt to do so ....\" The court found that the plaintiff alleged that the defendant aided and abetted discriminatory conduct, but because the plaintiff failed to assert successfully a prima facie\n   case of employment discrimination, he could not successfully assert a claim of aiding and abetting. Furthermore, the defendant cannot discriminate against the plaintiff and at the same time aid and abet itself in discriminating against him. The court concluded that the plaintiff's allegations of aiding and abetting failed. Although the plaintiff mentioned the defendant's employee, he did not name the employee as a defendant. The case was commenced against the defendant only. The court, therefore, granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   We begin with the standard of review and the legal principles that guide our analysis of appeals from the granting of a motion for summary judgment. \"The law\n   governing summary judgment and the accompanying standard of review are well settled. Practice Book \u00a7 [17-49] requires that judgment shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, affidavits and any other proof submitted show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. A material fact is a fact that will make a difference in the result of the case....

The courts hold the movant to a strict standard. To satisfy his burden the movant must make a showing that it is quite clear what the truth is, and that excludes\n   any real doubt as to the existence of any genuine issue of material fact....

As stated in a footnote of its decision, the court elected to utilize the pretext/\n   <em>\n    McDonnell Douglas\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Burdine\n   </em>\n   model of analysis after finding that the plaintiff was not claiming that he was discharged from employment due to mixed motives of legitimate and illegitimate reasons.

The apartments are managed by the defendant's long-standing customer, WinnResidential, for whom it provided cleaning and maintenance services at numerous locations. At all relevant times, the defendant employed a five member \"crew\" to provide cleaning and maintenance services at the apartments. The\n   crew consisted of four cleaners/porters and one working supervisor, who reported to Cifuentes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   While he was employed by the defendant, the plaintiff was supervised by Martinez, a friend and colleague of the plaintiff from the church. Martinez referred and\n   recommended the plaintiff to Cifuentes to fill a vacant position on the crew. Martinez informed Cifuentes that the plaintiff was his friend and a leader of his church. Prior to hiring the plaintiff, Cifuentes cautioned Martinez that if the defendant hired the plaintiff, Martinez could not treat him any differently than Martinez treated other members of the crew. He instructed Martinez to treat all members of the crew fairly and equally and not to give preferential treatment to any of the members of the crew, even if the crew member was a friend outside of work. In addition, to ensure that the crew delivered efficient and reliable high quality services the defendant and its customers expected, the defendant's employees were trained and instructed to limit their interaction with tenants and its customers' employees at customer work locations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In May and early June, 2012, Cifuentes received complaints from members of Martinez' crew that Martinez was not distributing work assignments fairly. The members of the cleaning crew complained that Martinez frequently assigned \"easy\" jobs to the plaintiff while other members of the crew were assigned more demanding work. He also permitted the plaintiff to take extra breaks and to spend time talking and socializing with tenants of the apartments during working hours, instead of working. After he received the complaints from members of the crew, Cifuentes reminded Martinez of his responsibilities as a supervisor of the crew and of the importance of treating all members of the crew equally. Cifuentes informed Martinez that he had received several complaints from members of the crew that Martinez was giving the plaintiff preferential treatment and permitting him to socialize with tenants instead of working. Cifuentes reminded Martinez that, as supervisor, it was his responsibility to ensure that the plaintiff focused on work and minimized his interaction with tenants during working hours. Cifuentes reminded\n   Martinez that he should not treat the plaintiff more favorably than he treated other members of his crew.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In June, 2012, Cifuentes learned that Alejandro observed the plaintiff on many occasions standing in the lobby talking with tenants when he should have been working, frequently taking breaks from work to talk with tenants and to engage in conversations about God, religion and church. The plaintiff walked away from tenants with whom he was speaking when Alejandro got closer to him. Deming witnessed similar conduct on the part of the plaintiff. In addition, Cifuentes learned that Alejandro had received complaints from members of Martinez' crew that Martinez was assigning \"easy\" jobs to the plaintiff, while they were assigned more difficult and demanding tasks. According to Deming, the plaintiff and Martinez were not performing to WinnResidential standards and work was not being completed or timely done.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Also in June, Hagan, Alejandro and Deming discussed staff performance. It was at this time that Hagan learned that Martinez was giving preferential treatment\n   to the plaintiff. She believed that Martinez' treatment of the plaintiff was not conducive to a good working environment because Martinez, as supervisor, should have treated each member of the crew equally and fairly. The fact that Martinez was not treating them fairly and equally led other members of the crew to complain to Alejandro. Hagan reported Martinez' and the plaintiff's conduct to Cifuentes and requested that he address the complaints with them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   On June 14, 2012, Cifuentes met first with Martinez and then with both the plaintiff and Martinez. When he met with Martinez, Cifuentes expressed his concern about Martinez' performance as a supervisor and gave him a verbal warning. He admonished Martinez to treat all members of the cleaning crew equally and to limit\n   the plaintiff's nonwork interactions with the tenants of the apartments. When Cifuentes met with the plaintiff and Martinez together, he instructed the plaintiff to focus on work and to minimize his interaction with tenants of the apartments during work hours. Cifuentes issued a written warning to the plaintiff. The plaintiff refused to sign the warning or make comments in the space provided.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   On June 22, 2012, Hagan sent an e-mail message to Cifuentes concerning an incident involving the plaintiff and Martinez. It had come to Hagan's attention via complaints from tenants that, during a service at the church, the plaintiff had read the names of tenants who were going to be evicted from their apartments due to \"bad\" housekeeping, nonpayment of rent, and for being \"bad\" tenants. Hagan was concerned that someone had accessed this private and confidential information from the management office and was misusing it. She considered it a violation of WinnResidential's policy regarding professional conduct and its restrictions on the use of information viewed or obtained while performing job responsibilities.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   On or about June 26, 2012, Hagan requested that Cifuentes remove the plaintiff and Martinez from their positions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In his affidavit, Cifuentes attested that the defendant viewed WinnResidential's concerns as a serious issue because the defendant strove to provide the best possible service to its customers. It is the defendant's custom and practice to comply, as soon as practicable, with a customer's legitimate request for removal of its employees from a work site. Given WinnResidential's request, as well as his ongoing concern about the way in which the plaintiff and Martinez were performing, Cifuentes determined that it was necessary to replace them as\n   soon as the defendant was able to hire qualified replacements. As a result of the defendant's hiring requirements, which include drug testing and background checks, it took the defendant approximately six weeks to hire qualified replacements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Cifuentes further attested that it is very important to the defendant that WinnResidential be satisfied with the quality of workers the defendant assigns to properties WinnResidential manages. The defendant was concerned that failing to accommodate Hagan's request that the plaintiff and Martinez be removed would \"put the whole account in jeopardy,\" which could have cost five other people to lose their jobs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   On August 3, 2015, Cifuentes fired both the plaintiff and Martinez.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiff's\n   termination report states that he had \"been warned in the past regarding his conduct while at work, particularly keeping his interactions with residents to a minimum,\" and that \"due to ongoing conduct and performance issues,\" the plaintiff's employment was terminated. On a Department of Labor form titled \"Notice to Employer of Hearing and Unemployment Compensation Claim,\" and dated August 8, 2012, the plaintiff wrote: \"I was discharged for talking excessively to building residents.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The plaintiff opposed the defendant's motion for summary judgment by presenting facts that are for the most part consistent with those presented by the defendant. The plaintiff represented that at the time the defendant hired the plaintiff, Cifuentes was aware that the plaintiff was the pastor of the church and that Martinez was a chaplain. Cifuentes had told Martinez that while he was at work, Martinez could not refer to the plaintiff as \"pastor\" or give him the respect ordinarily given to\n   a pastor. In June, 2012, Hagan was advised by other members of the crew that Martinez was giving the plaintiff easier work. Consequently, Hagan met with the plaintiff and Martinez to address complaints she had received from tenants. Hagan warned the plaintiff about speaking to tenants and using terms such as \"God bless\" while he was at work. Hagan reported to Cifuentes \"what she heard about [the plaintiff] from [Alejandro] and the [Cintrons].\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   On June 26, 2012, Hagan requested that the plaintiff and Martinez be removed from their positions. Cifuentes fired the plaintiff on August 3, 2012. Martinez was present at the time the plaintiff was fired. When Martinez referred to the plaintiff as pastor, Cifuentes allegedly became angry and fired Martinez as well. The plaintiff also attested that during his term of employment he had no performance or conduct issues.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   In deciding the defendant's motion for summary judgment as to count one of the complaint, the court recited the evidence submitted by the parties and concluded that the pretext/\n   <em>\n    McDonnell Douglas\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Burdine\n   </em>\n   model of analysis applied. For purposes of the motion for summary judgment, the defendant assumed that the plaintiff met the first three prongs of employment discrimination under the model, i.e., that the plaintiff was a member of a protected class, he was qualified for the position,\n   and he suffered an adverse employment action by the defendant. The court agreed with the defendant that the plaintiff had not demonstrated that the termination of his employment occurred under circumstances giving rise to an inference of discrimination. The court found that the plaintiff simply alleged the conclusory statement that \"[b]ecause [the] [d]efendant disapproved of [the] plaintiff's use of religious terms while at work, and was\n   aware of his status as a pastor, [the] plaintiff has shown direct evidence of discriminat[ory] motive.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.) The court concluded, therefore, that the plaintiff did not satisfy a prima facie case of employment discrimination under \u00a7 46a-60 (a) (1), and that the defendant had met its burden of showing the absence of any genuine issue of material fact regarding the lack of circumstances giving rise to an inference of discrimination\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   On appeal, the plaintiff argues that the court erred in concluding that there were no genuine issues of material fact because the trial court should be cautious when granting a motion for summary judgment when an employer's motive is in question. See\n   <em>\n    Tryon\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    North Branford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1046309\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/58/702/#p707\">\n    58 Conn.

The plaintiff cites the affidavits of Hagan and Alejandro as the basis of his claim of having established a prima facie case of discrimination. Both Hagan\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Alejandro\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   attested that the plaintiff engaged tenants of the apartments in conversations about God and church; Hagan warned the plaintiff about using the term\n   \"God bless\" and engaging tenants in conversation. The plaintiff argues that the warning gives rise to an inference of discrimination against the plaintiff on the basis of his religion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \"[R]emarks made by someone other than the person who made the decision adversely affecting the plaintiff may have little tendency to show that the decision-maker\n   was motivated by the discriminatory sentiment expressed in the remark.\"\n   <em>\n    Tomassi\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Insignia Financial Group, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3781969\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/478/111/#p115\">\n    478 F.3d 111\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 115 (2d Cir. 2007), abrogated in part on other grounds by\n   <em>\n    Gross\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    FBL Financial Services, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3658005\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/167/#p177\">\n    557 U.S. 167\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 177-78,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3658005\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/167/#p177\">\n    129 S.Ct. 2343\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3658005\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/167/#p177\">\n    174 L.Ed.2d 119\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009). We first note that both Hagan and Alejandro were employed by WinnResidential; they were not employed by the defendant. Second, Cifuentes' job was to ensure that the defendant's employees performed services to the satisfaction of its customers. He received complaints from Hagan that the plaintiff was talking to tenants about church and God during working hours. Cifuentes warned the plaintiff that during working hours he was to keep his interaction with the tenants to a minimum. Cifuentes was motivated to fire the plaintiff in June, 2012, when Hagan informed him that WinnResidential did not want the plaintiff, or Martinez, to work at any of its properties because the plaintiff received preferential treatment from Martinez, he spent time socializing with tenants when he was supposed to be working, and he discussed God and church with the tenants during working hours. Also, tenants reported that during a church service, the plaintiff published a confidential list of names of tenants who were in danger of eviction. Cifuentes understood that, if WinnResidential was not happy with the manner in which the plaintiff was doing his job and wanted him dismissed, the defendant risked losing the account if it did not fire him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \"Circumstances contributing to a permissible inference of discriminatory intent may include [1] the employer's continuing, after discharging the plaintiff, to seek applicants from persons of the plaintiff's qualifications to fill that position ... or [2] the employer's criticism of the plaintiff's performance in ethnically degrading terms ... or its invidious comments about others in the employee's protected group ... or [3]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   the more favorable treatment of employees not in the protected group ... or [4] the sequence of events leading to the plaintiff's discharge ... or the timing of the discharge ....\" (Citations omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Chambers\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    TRM Copy Centers Corp.\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11301440\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/43/29/#p37\">\n    43 F.3d at 37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The plaintiff does not dispute that the defendant had a policy that its employees keep their interactions with tenants of the apartments to a minimum during working hours. He also does not dispute that his conversations with tenants were disfavored by WinnResidential and created a business problem for the defendant. He was warned about his behavior and knew that he was not to discuss church and God with tenants when he was to be working. Cifuentes attested that he had informed the plaintiff of the complaints that he had received from Hagan and others. The plaintiff does not take issue with the contents of Cifuentes' affidavit. The written warning the plaintiff received contains no references to religion or church. Cifuentes did not speak of the protected group in ethnically or religiously degrading terms. No matter what the topic, religion or otherwise, the defendant's policy was for its employees not to socialize with tenants during working hours. No discriminatory intent can be inferred from the defendant's policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   As to the third\n   <em>\n    Chambers\n   </em>\n   factor, the plaintiff has failed to point to any evidence\n   that the defendant treated other employees more favorably than it treated him. To the contrary, Martinez gave the plaintiff preferential treatment. This factor weighs against the plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The plaintiff claims that the sequence of events leading to his firing leads to an inference of discriminatory intent on the basis of religion. Significantly, we note that Cifuentes hired the plaintiff in March, 2012, upon the recommendation of Martinez. Cifuentes knew at that time that the plaintiff was the pastor of the church and that Martinez was chaplain in the church. At the\n   time he hired the plaintiff, Cifuentes warned Martinez that, as crew supervisor, he had to treat all members of the crew fairly. Within three months, Cifuentes received information from Hagan that Martinez was giving the plaintiff preferential treatment by assigning him less challenging tasks than he assigned to other members of the crew. Martinez gave the plaintiff breaks when he could talk to tenants about God and church. On June 14, 2012, Cifuentes warned both the plaintiff and Martinez that the plaintiff needed to focus on his work and not socialize with tenants during working hours. On June 26, 2012, Hagan informed Cifuentes that WinnResidential did not want the plaintiff to work at the apartments. Cifuentes decided that he would fire the plaintiff when he found a qualified replacement. Cifuentes met with the plaintiff on August 3, 2012, and discharged him from employment. The evidence presented by the defendant demonstrates that the plaintiff's discharge was not related to his religion but, instead, concerned his failure to comply with the defendant's policy of limiting his interaction with tenants during working hours. Moreover, WinnResidential, the defendant's customer, was dissatisfied with the plaintiff's performance and requested that he not work at any of the properties that it managed. The plaintiff failed to produce any concrete evidence to contradict the facts presented by the defendant. For the foregoing reasons, the plaintiff's claim fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The plaintiff's third clam is that the court improperly rendered summary judgment because the defendant failed to show the absence of any genuine issue of material fact as to whether he had engaged in a protected activity with regard to the plaintiff's claim of retaliation under \u00a7 46a-60 (a) (4). We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   In count two of the complaint, the plaintiff realleged his claim of employment discrimination and, among\n   other things, that he held a bona fide religious belief and that he was the pastor of the church. He also alleged that the defendant and its agents knew that he was the pastor of the church and that Martinez was the chaplain in the church. He also alleged that the defendant and its agents retaliated against him for practicing his religious beliefs, including, but not limited to, using the terms \"pastor\" and \"chaplain.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   In ruling on the defendant's motion for summary judgment, the trial court found that the plaintiff alleged that he had engaged in a protected activity when he \"openly used religious terms at work that he was legally permitted to use,\" \"spoke out against [the] defendant by communicating with Martinez, and referring to him as chaplain, contrary to what [the] defendant instructed him to do,\" and \"because of [the] plaintiff's engagement in this protected activity, [the] defendant retaliated against him by terminating his employment.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.) The court, however, concluded that the protected activity cited by the plaintiff is not protected under the act. The plaintiff, therefore, has not presented evidence that\n   he engaged in a protected activity and has failed to establish a prima facie case of retaliation. Thus, the defendant has met its burden of showing the absence of any genuine issue of material fact regarding its alleged retaliation against the plaintiff. The court, therefore, granted the motion for summary judgment with respect to the plaintiff's retaliation claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Section 46a-60 (a) provides in relevant part: \"It shall be a discriminatory practice in violation of this section ... (4) [f]or any ... employer ... to discharge ... or otherwise discriminate against any person because such person has opposed any discriminatory employment practice or because such person has filed a complaint or testified or assisted in any proceeding under section 46a-82, 46a-83 or 46a-84 ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   A prima facie case of retaliation requires a plaintiff to show (1) that he or she participated in a protected activity that is known to the defendant, (2) an employment action that disadvantaged the plaintiff and (3) a causal relation between the protected activity and the disadvantageous employment action.

On appeal, the plaintiff claims that his continuing to use religious terms during working hours in contravention of the defendant's\n   instructions that he not do so was a form of informal protest.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiff also claims that his refusal to sign the warning notice Cifuentes presented to him was an informal protest. The defendant points out, however, that the space provided on the warning notice provided the plaintiff with a means of protesting the defendant's alleged discrimination and would have been a protected activity, but the plaintiff did not take advantage of the opportunity. The form clearly states that the \"absence of any statement on the part of the EMPLOYEE indicates his/her agreement with the report as stated.\"\n   On the basis of the plaintiff's very own words in the record, we cannot conclude that he had a good faith belief that he was engaged in a protected activity by continuing to use religious terms as an informal protest. Cifuentes wrote on the warning form that he gave the plaintiff on June 14, 2012, \"[e]mployee has been seen several times spending too much time talking to residents instead of working.\" On his claim for unemployment compensation, the plaintiff stated as the reason for his termination: \"I was discharged for talking excessively to building residents.\" The record contains no facts presented by the plaintiff that he continued to use the terms \"pastor\" and \"chaplain\" as an informal means of complaint. We, therefore, conclude that the court properly granted the motion for summary judgment in favor of the defendant on the plaintiff's retaliatory discharge claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   In this opinion the other judges concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    See\n    <em>\n     Levy\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"392443\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/236/96/#p102\">\n     236 Conn. 96\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 104-109,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=671%20A.2d%20349\">\n     671 A.2d 349\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1996) (differentiating disparate employment treatment models).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    Hereinafter, unless otherwise indicated, all references to \u00a7 46a-60 in this opinion are to the 2011 revision of the statute.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    The record reflects that this statement was made in connection with the plaintiff's claim for unemployment compensation.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    Although the plaintiff claims on appeal that the court improperly determined that there were no genuine issues of material fact, he does not take issue with the court's summary of the facts at issue.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    Attached to its memorandum of law in support of the motion for summary judgment were numerous exhibits, including some of the plaintiff's employment records and affidavits from Cifuentes, Hagan, Alejandro and Deming.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    Cifuentes was responsible for ensuring that the defendant's employees delivered superior services to its customers.
