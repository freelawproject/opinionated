Fields and Davis contend that the post-conviction court lacked jurisdiction to vacate their sentences, and resentence them, at certain counts for which they had completed their sentences or received no further penalty. After careful review, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The facts of Fields' and Davis' underlying convictions are not pertinent to our disposition of their appeals. We only briefly note that both men were charged with various offenses stemming from robberies that they, and a third cohort, had committed at nine separate restaurants and convenience stores in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania. On August 29, 2012, Fields and Davis both pled guilty to all of the offenses with which they were charged. Specifically, Fields pled guilty to twenty-three counts of robbery, nine counts each of conspiracy and theft by unlawful taking, eight counts each of terroristic threats and recklessly endangering another person (REAP), six counts of aggravated assault, two counts of persons not to possess a firearm, and one count each of discharging a firearm into an occupied structure, firearms not to be carried without a license, and receiving stolen property. Davis pled guilty to six counts each of robbery, aggravated assault, REAP, and terroristic threats, as well as one count each of discharging a firearm into an occupied structure,\n   carrying a firearm without a license, theft by unlawful taking, receiving stolen property, and criminal conspiracy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On January 18, 2013, both men were sentenced, with Fields receiving an aggregate term of 25 to 50 years' incarceration, and Davis receiving an aggregate term of 22 to 44 years' incarceration. This Court affirmed their judgments of sentence on direct appeal.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v.

Counsel was appointed, and amended petitions were filed on their behalf arguing,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that Fields and Davis had received mandatory minimum sentences for several of their robbery convictions that were rendered illegal by\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Alleyne v.

At the resentencing proceeding, the court imposed an aggregate term of 17 to 40 years' incarceration. Davis filed a timely notice of appeal from his new judgment of sentence, and he complied with the court's order to file a Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b) concise statement of errors complained of on appeal. On April 11, 2016, the court filed a Rule 1925(a) opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In Fields' case, the PCRA court entered an order on March 11, 2016, granting his PCRA petition in part, to the extent that he challenged the legality of his mandatory-minimum sentences. That order vacated the entirety of Fields' original judgment of sentence, and scheduled his resentencing hearing for April 5, 2016. At the resentencing hearing, the court imposed an aggregate term of 17 to 50 years' incarceration.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Fields filed a timely notice of appeal, and he also complied with the trial court's order to file a Rule 1925(b) statement. The trial court issued a Rule 1925(a) opinion on October 21, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Ultimately, this Court consolidated Fields' and Davis' appeals and assigned their case to a three-judge panel. Before that panel, Fields and Davis presented the following issues, respectively:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Whether the sentencing court had jurisdiction to sentence [Fields] at count 29 ( [c]riminal [c]onspiracy) when the PCRA court had no jurisdiction to grant PCRA relief as to those counts because [Fields'] sentence had already been served as to [that] count[ ]?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Fields' Original Brief at 24.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Whether the sentencing court had jurisdiction to sentence [Davis] at count 5 ( [REAP] ) and count 23 (possession of a firearm) when the PCRA court had no jurisdiction to grant PCRA relief as to those counts because [Davis'] sentence had already been served as to those counts?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Davis' Original Brief at 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   After hearing oral argument, the three-judge panel requested that Fields' and Davis' case be certified for\n   <em>\n    en banc\n   </em>\n   review, which was unanimously granted by our\n   Court. Accordingly, their case was assigned to the present,\n   <em>\n    en\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    banc\n   </em>\n   panel, which heard oral argument by Fields and Davis on April 24, 2018. Fields and Davis also both filed substituted briefs, reiterating the identical, single issues set forth\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   .\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Fields' Substituted Brief (hereinafter, \"Fields' Brief\") at 22; Davis' Substituted Brief (hereinafter, \"Davis' Brief\") at 18. We will now address those claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Both Fields and Davis argue that under 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9543(a)(1)(i), discussed\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   , \"the PCRA court had no jurisdiction to grant PCRA relief as to those counts\" on which their original sentences had already been served, or on which they had received no further penalty.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Fields' Brief at 22; Davis' Brief at 18. More specifically, Davis takes issue with the PCRA court's vacating his no-further-penalty sentences for one count of REAP and one count of possession of a firearm, and then resentencing him to 1 to 2 year terms of incarceration for each of those convictions.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Davis' Brief at 30-31. The only sentence that Fields specifically identifies on appeal is his term of incarceration imposed for his conspiracy conviction at count 29.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Fields' Brief at 33. Fields maintains that at the time he was resentenced in 2016, he had completed his original sentence of 1 to 2 years' incarceration for that offense. Thus, Fields asserts that \"[t]he PCRA court lacked jurisdiction to vacate and impose a new sentence as to any counts where [he] had already served his sentence.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 33-34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   We begin by recognizing that \"[j]urisdiction is purely a question of law; the appellate standard of review is\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   and the scope of review is plenary.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v.

Section 9543, entitled \"Eligibility for relief,\" states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    (a) General rule.--\n   </strong>\n   <em>\n    To be eligible for relief\n   </em>\n   under this subchapter, the petitioner must plead and prove by a preponderance of the evidence all of the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   (1) That the petitioner has been convicted of a crime under the laws of this Commonwealth and is at the time relief is granted:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    (i)\n   </strong>\n   <em>\n    currently serving a sentence of imprisonment, probation or parole for the crime;\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   (ii) awaiting execution of a sentence of death for the crime; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   (iii) serving a sentence which must expire before the person may commence serving the disputed sentence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9543(a)(1)(i) (emphasis added). Fields and Davis essentially contend\n   that the 'currently serving a sentence' requirement of section 9543(a)(1)(i) constitutes a bar that petitioners must overcome before the PCRA court has jurisdiction to grant them relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   We disagree. The plain language of section 9543 does not mention the\n   <em>\n    jurisdiction\n   </em>\n   of the PCRA court, but instead sets forth the eligibility requirements a petitioner must meet in order to obtain post-conviction relief. Notably, the language, \"to be eligible for relief,\" implicates only the petitioner's ability to obtain a remedy through post-conviction proceedings, not the jurisdiction of the PCRA court to act on a petition. Moreover, reading the PCRA statute as a whole, as we must,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   supports our interpretation of the language of section 9543. Specifically, in drafting the PCRA, the General Assembly included 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9545, a separate provision addressing \"Jurisdiction and proceedings.\" Had the General Assembly intended the eligibility requirements of section 9543 to be jurisdictional prerequisites, it would have included that provision within section 9545.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Additionally, the cases on which both Davis and Fields rely do not convince us to adopt a different interpretation of section 9543 than that which its plain language conveys. Each of those decisions simply clarifies that section 9543 requires that a petitioner be serving a sentence of incarceration\n   <em>\n    at the time relief is granted\n   </em>\n   ; if they are not, they are ineligible for post-conviction relief.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v.

Contrary to their arguments, the relief granted by the PCRA court was\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   their resentencing; instead, it was the vacating of their original judgments of sentence, based on the illegality of their mandatory-minimum terms of incarceration. The PCRA court provided Davis this relief in its February 19, 2016 order granting his petition and scheduling resentencing for that same day. Additionally, Fields was afforded his post-conviction sentencing relief in the PCRA court's March 11, 2016 order granting his petition, in part, and scheduling his resentencing hearing for April 5, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Although it was with these orders that the PCRA court first acted on the at-issue counts by vacating them, thus exposing Fields and Davis to resentencing on those charges, neither Fields nor Davis appealed from those orders.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Instead, both men decided to appeal\n   <em>\n    from their judgments of sentence\n   </em>\n   . Because the essence of their issue is that\n   <em>\n    the PCRA court\n   </em>\n   lacked the ability to disturb their sentences on certain counts, which the court did in\n   <em>\n    the PCRA orders\n   </em>\n   vacating those sentences, we hold that Fields and Davis have waived their challenge by not appealing from those orders.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v.

At no point during their resentencing hearings did either Fields or Davis argue that the court lacked the authority to vacate their original sentences, and resentence them, on certain counts for which they were not 'currently serving' a term of incarceration. Moreover, Fields and Davis did not assert any such challenge in a post-sentence motion. Rather, both men waited until the present appeal from their judgments\n   of sentence to contend, for the first time, that the PCRA court lacked the authority to disturb their original sentences on certain convictions, framing that issue as a non-waivable challenge to the court's jurisdiction. Because we conclude that Fields' and Davis' claim does not implicate the PCRA court's jurisdiction, we also hold that they have waived this issue by presenting it for the first time on appeal.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Pa.R.A.P. 302(a) (\"Issues not raised in the lower court are waived and cannot be raised for the first time on appeal.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Lastly, we recognize that where this Court has jurisdiction, we may address the legality of a sentence.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v.

First, it was Fields and Davis who intentionally upset the finality of their judgments of sentence by challenging them collaterally through their PCRA petitions. In other words, \"by filing a petition for collateral relief, [Fields and Davis] assumed the risk that [their] sentencing on the various counts would be adjusted insofar as was necessary to preserve the integrity of the original sentencing scheme.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v.

I would conclude, however, that Appellants preserved their appellate arguments and, under a proper reading of section 9543, are entitled to relief. Hence, I respectfully concur in part and dissent in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   As the learned Majority notes, Appellants argue that the PCRA courts lacked jurisdiction to grant relief as to the counts on which their original sentences had already been served, or on which they had received no further penalty.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Majority Opinion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ante\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 1221. In support of this argument, Appellants cite to 42 Pa.

Thus, as this Court held in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Ahlborn\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   that section 9543(a)(1)(i) must be met in order to confer jurisdiction upon the PCRA court, that decision must be overruled. I write separately, however, as I believe it is important to clarify what the eligibility requirements in section 9543\n   <em>\n    do\n   </em>\n   implicate and why I believe that Appellants are entitled to relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In my view, the eligibility requirements do not implicate the PCRA courts' jurisdiction, nor do they implicate the petitioners' standing to bring a PCRA petition. I conclude that the eligibility requirements in section 9543 correspond more closely with the concept of judicial power. Judicial power is inextricably linked to eligibility requirements such that the PCRA court lacks the judicial power to alter sentences that have already been served.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In order to understand why I believe that section 9543 implicates a court's power, and not its jurisdiction nor a litigant's standing, it is necessary to understand the distinction between the three doctrines. \"The distinction between standing, ... subject matter jurisdiction, and judicial power is sometimes subtle; however, it is important.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Grimm v.

This differentiation in terms indicates that our General Assembly intended to strip courts of jurisdiction\n   when a petitioner fails to satisfy section 9545's requirements; however, it did not intend to strip a court of jurisdiction when a petitioner fails to satisfy the requirements of section 9543.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, this Court must explicitly overrule\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Ahlborn\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Moreover, section 9543 does not implicate standing. When properly construed, the eligibility requirements found in section 9543 more closely correlate to the concept of judicial power than standing. Pursuant to the traditional concept of standing, Appellants clearly have standing to pursue their claims. Appellants have a direct interest in this judicial matter because they have been \"adversely affected ... by the matter [they] seek[ ] to challenge.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Donahue\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6926288,4253614\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/98/1223/\">\n    98 A.3d at 1229\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Specifically, the judgments of sentence they challenged in their PCRA petitions adversely affected Appellants. That is the only traditional requirement necessary for standing under Pennsylvania law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   My conclusion that section 9543 does not implicate standing is further supported when the entirety of section 9543 is considered. The \"currently serving a sentence\" requirement appears at section 9543(a)(1). Section 9543 includes a second eligibility requirement, section 9543(a)(2). That section requires a petitioner to plead and prove that he or she is entitled to relief for one of several reasons including,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that he or she received an illegal sentence or that he or she entered an involuntary guilty plea.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 9543(a)(2). If a petitioner advanced a meritless illegal sentencing claim or challenge to a guilty plea, we would not say that the petitioner lacked standing. Instead, we would say that the petitioner is not entitled to relief because he or she failed to satisfy the PCRA's eligibility requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The doctrines of standing, subject matter jurisdiction, and judicial power are intertwined. Standing and subject matter jurisdiction are prerequisites to a trial court having the judicial power to issue a decision.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Donahue\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6926288,4253614\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/98/1223/\">\n    98 A.3d at 1247\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"a party seeking to invoke judicial power must ordinarily demonstrate that it has standing\");\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     In re Sheriff's Excess Proceeds Litig.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6925256\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/98/706/#p721\">\n    98 A.3d 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 721 (Pa.

This, however, does not imply that a court considering a dispute over which it has subject matter jurisdiction, and which the plaintiff has standing to pursue, can exercise unlimited judicial power. In other words, standing and subject matter jurisdiction are necessary, but insufficient, prerequisites for a court to exercise its judicial power.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   In this case, the necessary prerequisites for judicial power,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , jurisdiction and standing, are present.

First, throughout this litigation Appellants have argued that the PCRA court lacked the ability to resentence them on crimes for which they were not serving a sentence. This was sufficient to preserve the argument that the PCRA court lacked the judicial power to grant relief with respect to those judgments of sentence. Second, the Commonwealth agrees that we need to address this issue and does not advance a waiver argument. Thus, under our Supreme Court's\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Erie Insurance Exchange\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   decision, Appellants did not waive their claim under Rules 2116(a) and/or 2119(a).

Consequently, I would reach the merits of Appellants' claims, and in doing so, would affirm the resentencing orders of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Both Appellants filed Amended PCRA petitions contending they were entitled to be resentenced as a result of the ineffectiveness of their trial counsel who failed to challenge certain mandatory minimum sentences.

Upon resentencing, the trial court imposed lesser aggregate terms of 17 to 40 years' incarceration upon Davis and 17 to 50 years' incarceration upon Fields.

On the other hand, had the Commonwealth felt aggrieved by the PCRA orders vacating the Appellants' judgments of sentence, it would have had standing to appeal as it would have been aggrieved by the orders.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, it is my opinion Appellants properly appealed from the trial court's resentencing orders as aggrieved parties. It is from those orders that Appellants claim the trial court erred by resentencing them for crimes for which they already completed their time or for which no further penalty had been imposed under their original judgments of sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   I further disagree with the Majority's alternative waiver analysis that Appellants waived their claims because neither raised them during their resentencing hearings or asserted them in a post-sentence motion. In the Majority's view, both men waived their claims because they waited until the present appeal to contend for the first time that the PCRA court lacked authority to disturb their original sentences on certain convictions. Although not explicitly stated by the Majority, the basis for this alternative waiver conclusion implies that Appellants are seeking review of the discretionary aspects of their resentences.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v.

Super. 2011) (an appellant who challenges the discretionary aspects of his sentence must 1) file a timely notice of appeal, 2) preserve the issue at sentencing or in a motion to reconsider and modify sentence, 3) comply with Pa.R.A.P. 2119(f) and 4) demonstrate that the challenge raises a substantial question that the sentence appealed from is not appropriate under the Sentencing Code). To the contrary, Appellants maintain that the issue each raises concerns the legality of their resentences and therefore, the issue may be raised at any time, even for the first time on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The Majority examines whether Appellants have raised an illegal sentencing claim against the three narrow categories recognized as non-waivable for illegal sentencing claims, those being: (1) claims that the sentence fell outside of the legal parameters prescribed by the applicable statute, (2) claims involving merger/double jeopardy, and (3) claims implicating the rule in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Apprendi v.

Concluding that Appellants claims clearly do not fall within the first or third categories, the Majority examines whether the Appellants' claims concern sentencing illegality under principles of double jeopardy. The Majority concludes that because it perceives no double jeopardy violation (a\n   conclusion with which I agree) there is no need for this Court to\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   raise such a claim and vacate either of Fields' or Davis' at-issue sentences. Majority Opinion at p. 1224.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Since the Majority introduced this double jeopardy analysis as a segue to its alternate waiver conclusion, it is not clear to me whether the Majority believes the issues raised by Appellants do not raise legality claims or if they do, no relief is available under principles of double jeopardy. I certainly view Appellants' claims as invoking illegality, as the claims challenge the sentencing court's ability to impose punishment a second time for crimes Appellants claim their sentences already had been served.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v.

Super. 2010) (whether revocation of SIP sentence and resentencing violated double jeopardy where original sentence of incarceration already had been served at time of revocation). If the Majority's view is that the claims are illegality claims, but no relief is due under principles of double jeopardy, then I find the Majority's analysis does not fully address the issue raised by Appellants. The Majority does not reach the issue raised as to whether the court, after relief is granted under the PCRA, could resentence Appellants as part of an overall resentencing scheme on counts for which they already completed their sentences or for which they received no further penalty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   As I do not believe Appellants waived their claims and that the claims raise issues of sentencing illegality, it is my opinion this Court is obligated to address those claims on the merits. In doing so, I would conclude that the trial court did not err in resentencing Appellants. The Appellants sought and received relief that disrupted their original sentencing schemes. When the PCRA court vacated Appellants' original judgments of sentence, the effect of those orders was to vacate the sentences in their entireties and to render them null and void.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v.

In\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Bartrug\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , the sole issue presented was whether the PCRA court erred in vacating an entire sentence rather than addressing only that part of the appellant's sentence that was found to be illegal. The appellant questioned whether the PCRA court had jurisdiction\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   to vacate otherwise legal sentences which were not part of his PCRA petition. The appellant had pled guilty to burglary, theft by unlawful taking or disposition, and receiving stolen property. The trial court sentenced him to 7\u00bd to 15 years imprisonment for\n   <em>\n    theft by unlawful taking\n   </em>\n   . No further sentence was imposed on the other counts. Subsequently, the PCRA court found that the sentence for theft by unlawful taking was illegal, as the maximum term appellant could be sentenced for that conviction was 7 years. The appellant was subsequently resentenced to 7\u00bd to 15 years' incarceration again, but this time incarceration was imposed for the\n   <em>\n    burglary\n   </em>\n   charge, which would have permitted a maximum sentence of 20 years. No further sentence was imposed on the remaining counts, including the count for theft by unlawful taking.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   On appeal, this Court held that the trial court did not commit error in its resentencing because our case law held that when a trial court errs in it sentence on one count in a multi-count case, that all sentences for all counts will be vacated so the court can restructure its entire sentencing scheme. This is true even where an appellant limits his appeal to one particular illegal sentence based upon one bill of information and does not appeal sentences based upon other bills of information, where those sentences are part of a common sentencing scheme. We further stated that when a defendant appeals a judgment of sentence, he accepts the risk the Commonwealth may seek a remand for resentencing thereon if disposition in the appellate court upsets the original sentencing scheme of the trial court. In\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Bartrug,\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   there was no suggestion that the appellant completed serving any part of his sentence at the time relief was granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Matin\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   presents a completely different scenario from\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Bartrug\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   . In\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Matin\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , the appellant pled guilty to two counts of robbery, and one count each of criminal conspiracy and possessing a firearm without a license. He was sentenced to an aggregate term of imprisonment of 6 to 20 years, with all sentences running concurrently. The sentence imposed for the firearms violation was 2\u00bd to 5 years imprisonment. On initial appeal to this Court, we reversed and remanded the case to the PCRA court finding that one of the appellant's issues held arguable merit; that being whether trial counsel was ineffective for advising appellant to plead guilty to the firearms violation when appellant had not possessed any firearm during the robbery. Unfortunately, when the case returned to the PCRA court for consideration of this issue, appellant's sentence for the firearms conviction\n   had expired. Consequently, the PCRA court found appellant no longer was eligible for relief on any issue challenging his conviction and again dismissed his petition. On appeal again to this Court, we were constrained to agree with the PCRA court's analysis. Citing\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v. Ahlborn\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"960475,960471\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/548/544/\">\n    548 Pa. 544\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11909445,960457,11909386,11909357,960471,960475\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/699/718/\">\n    699 A.2d 718\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1997), we held that a petitioner is ineligible for relief under the PCRA once the sentence for the challenged conviction is completed. Since appellant completed serving his sentence on the firearms conviction that was the basis for his sentencing challenge when he appeared for the second time before the PCRA court, he no longer was eligible for relief.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 9543(a)(1) (eligibility for relief is determined at the time relief is granted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The result in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Bartrug\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   was driven by the fact that the court was entitled to resentence completely, since the sentencing challenge found to have merit upset the sentencing scheme. There was no suggestion the term of incarceration for the conviction upon which the sentence was challenged had expired when relief was granted. In contrast, the PCRA court in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Matin\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   did not possess the ability to grant relief because the appellant already completed serving his sentence for the conviction upon which his claim for relief was based. Simply stated,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Bartrug\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Matin\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   are distinguishable as\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Bartrug\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   concerned the court's power to fashion relief, whereas\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Matin\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   concerned whether the court was capable of granting relief.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Bartrug\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   and not\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Matin\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   controls the instant appeals. Here, there is no suggestion that either Fields or Davis completed their sentences for the convictions upon which the trial court illegally imposed mandatory minimum sentences that formed the basis for collateral relief when relief was granted. The PCRA court therefore, possessed the ability to resentence consistent with principles already stated herein governing that process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Appellants' argument that the PCRA court lacked\n   <em>\n    jurisdiction\n   </em>\n   to resentence them for counts where sentencing time already was completed or for which no further penalty was imposed under their original sentences likewise does not render\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Bartrug\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Matin\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   in conflict. As explained by the Majority, \u00a7 9543 of the PCRA that requires a petitioner to be currently serving a sentence to be eligible for relief, is not a jurisdictional provision. Rather, the conditions for establishing jurisdiction are set forth in section 9545 that require timely filed petitions. Since the convictions already completed or for which no further penalty was imposed, did not form the basis for PCRA jurisdiction, and those claims were not the basis upon which relief was granted, the trial court did not err by including those convictions in the new judgments of sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully concur and dissent from the Majority, would reach the merits of Appellants' issues, deny relief, and affirm the PCRA court orders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Judge Kunselman joins this opinion in support of affirmance.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    That same day, the PCRA court issued a second PCRA order denying the remainder of Fields' post-conviction claims.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1932(a) (\"Statutes or parts of statutes are\n    <em>\n     in pari materia\n    </em>\n    when they relate to the same persons or things or to the same class of persons or things.\").
