He was sentenced to a term of ten years at the Adult Correctional Institutions, with two years to serve and the balance suspended with probation. On appeal, the defendant contends that he is entitled to a new trial because the trial justice committed what the defendant submits were three evidentiary errors-two of which relate to the admissibility of certain testimony, and one of which relates to the trial justice's having allowed a specific line of questioning by the prosecution as to whether the defendant's wife had contacted the alleged victim or his family.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After considering the parties' written and oral submissions and reviewing the record, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that this case may be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    Facts and Travel\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On May 1, 2015, the state filed a criminal information charging defendant with one count of second-degree sexual assault in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 11-37-4 and 11-37-5. In due course, a jury trial was held in Kent County Superior Court over three days from October 17 through October 19, 2016. We summarize below the salient aspects of what transpired at that trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    A\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    The Testimony of the Complaining Witness\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The complaining witness, Jacob,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   testified that, on February 2, 2015, he and his\n   mother were driving home when they saw defendant, their neighbor, shoveling snow in his driveway. Jacob stated that he got out of the car to assist his neighbor in clearing the snow. Having been neighbors for a few months, Jacob and defendant knew each other. Jacob was then fifteen years old, and defendant was in his mid-seventies. It was further Jacob's testimony that, after the two finished shoveling the snow, they both entered the shed located in defendant's backyard so that Jacob could return the shovel which he had been using. According to Jacob, once they were both inside the shed, defendant shook Jacob's hand and then \"pulled [him] into a * * * two-handed hug * * * and kissed\" his cheek. Jacob testified that defendant then asked \"if he was moving too fast\" and that, when Jacob said no, defendant told him that \"he knew how [they] felt about each other.\" Jacob further testified that he had said no when defendant asked \"if he was moving too fast\" because defendant had \"recently\" told Jacob that \"his son had died and [Jacob] reminded him of his son, so [Jacob] thought he kissed [him] seeing [him] as a son figure.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Jacob proceeded to testify that defendant then \"cupped [Jacob's] penis with his hand\" over Jacob's jeans for five to seven seconds. According to Jacob, as defendant was acting in that manner, defendant asked if it felt good, to which Jacob responded in the negative. After the two of them left the shed, defendant asked for Jacob's cell phone number, which Jacob gave him. Jacob testified that he then returned home, told his parents what had happened, and they went to the police station to give a statement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   During his cross-examination of Jacob, defense counsel asked him: \"Now, did you seek professional help for any reaction that you might have had?\" The prosecutor objected, the trial justice sustained the objection, and defense counsel immediately requested a sidebar, which was granted. At sidebar, the trial justice asked defense counsel: \"How is that relevant to the elements?\" Defense counsel responded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \"Part of the discovery was whether he had gone for counseling and I was provided the name of a counselor that he went too [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ]. I got my notes, like one page. I just wanted to make sure I have all the correct information. It's important whether he was telling the truth and whether he gave the correct information to the prosecutor. I just wanted the name.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The trial justice then asked defense counsel: \"Do you want to ask him questions before the jury to make sure there's [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] no other medical providers[?]\" Defense counsel responded: \"I want to make sure there is no other person that he saw for counseling. That's all. I believe they asked him and his family.\" In response, the trial justice said: \"That was something under the rules you could have even compelled at deposition if you wanted to under the criminal rule. The Court will not allow that to play out in front of the jury.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    B\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    The Testimony of Defendant\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The defendant testified that, while he and Jacob were in the shed, defendant \"gave him a hug\" with \"[j]ust [his] left arm\" because elevating his right arm \"hurt so much from days of shoveling that it was hard to pick it up.\" He further testified that his right hand \"must have totally by accident brushed against [Jacob].\" Also, referring to the hug, he testified that he asked Jacob if he liked it. He testified that he did not kiss Jacob on the cheek or ask him if he was moving too fast.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    C\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    The Testimony of Defendant's Wife\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In her testimony, defendant's wife, Johanna MacNeil, indicated that, at her husband's request, she had given him money to pay Jacob for having assisted with the snow shoveling and that she told her husband to ask Jacob for his phone number in case they might need help again. In the course of his cross-examination of Mrs. MacNeil, the prosecutor asked her if she ever tried to go to speak to Jacob or his parents after February 2, 2015. She responded that she had not done so and that the MacNeils had been \"told not to have any contact\" with Jacob and that she \"assumed [they] were not allowed to\" talk to his parents. The prosecutor then asked: \"You live across from an elementary school; correct?\" Mrs. MacNeil responded, \"On the side.\" Defense counsel then objected on relevance grounds, and the trial justice overruled the objection, noting that the fact of the proximity of the elementary school was already in evidence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    D\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    The Verdict\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On October 19, 2016, the jury returned a guilty verdict, and Mr. MacNeil filed a timely notice of appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    II\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   This Court accords great \"latitude to a trial justice's rulings made during examination of witnesses at trial.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

The relevant portion of the trial transcript reads as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   \"[DEFENSE COUNSEL:] Now, did you seek professional help for any reaction that you might have had?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   \"[COUNSEL FOR THE STATE]: Objection, Judge.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   \"THE COURT: Sustained.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   \"[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: May we approach, Judge?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   \"THE COURT: Absolutely.

He argues that his attorney posed the question in order to challenge Jacob's credibility and that the trial justice's ruling was incorrectly based on the trial justice's view that counsel could have obtained that information by taking a deposition of Jacob. We note initially that defendant is correct in contending that the trial justice erred in stating that defense counsel could have\n   taken a deposition of Jacob before trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, after careful review of the record, we have determined that this error was not prejudicial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   We have stated that \"[i]nquiries that are potentially misleading or irrelevant, that offer little or no probative value, or that exceed the scope of the direct examination are objectionable, and may be restricted by the trial justice.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

That's all.\" There is no indication, either in the record or in defendant's presentation before this Court, that the state improperly withheld from defense counsel the names of any additional counselors from whom Jacob may have sought treatment, or that Jacob withheld the names of any such counselors from the state.

This issue is also waived; in\n   <em>\n    In re Jazlyn P.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7280428\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/31/1273/\">\n    31 A.3d 1273\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (R.I. 2011), we held that, \"if the introduction of evidence is objected to for a specific reason, other grounds for objection are waived and may not be raised for the first time on appeal.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Jazlyn P.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7280428\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/31/1273/\">\n    31 A.3d at 1280-81\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted). As noted above, at trial, the prosecutor asked Mr. MacNeil's wife: \"You live across from an elementary school; correct?\" Mrs. MacNeil responded: \"On the side.\" Defense counsel objected: \"Objection, relevance.\" The trial justice overruled the objection, stating: \"It's already in evidence. The answer will stand.\" At trial, defendant raised a relevance objection to the testimony, and the\n   trial justice overruled it. He may not now raise an objection based on improper inference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   In addition, the testimony that defendant and his wife lived near an elementary school had already been admitted into evidence without objection before Mrs. MacNeil testified to that fact;\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   therefore, the objection is unavailing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

At that point, defense counsel raised no objection. Therefore, the trial justice's decision to overrule the objection during Mrs. MacNeil's testimony three days later to the same fact was proper because that fact was already in evidence and had not been previously objected to.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Accordingly, we perceive no error on the part of the trial justice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    IV\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   For the reasons stated herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

Defense counsel sought this information through the motion to compel because, when the state had previously provided the requested information to defendant, \"the name and address of the counselor that the alleged victim has seen as noted\" was \"illegible.\" The state complied with the motion to compel on April 11, 2016. On April 18, 2016, the trial justice additionally granted defense counsel's oral motion to issue a subpoena to that counselor and ordered that the counseling records be returnable on April 27, 2016 for an\n    <em>\n     in camera\n    </em>\n    review by the court. However, the record indicates that defense counsel did not pursue the matter further before trial, which began six months later.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    In the course of his testimony on the first day of the trial, Jacob indicated that there was an \"[e]lementary school about a house away from him\" in response to a question asking him to describe defendant's neighborhood.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    A deposition would not have been appropriate because there had been no indication that Jacob would be unavailable to testify at trial.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Super.

However, defendant could have sought to compel further\n    <em>\n     discovery\n    </em>\n    before trial regarding additional counseling Jacob may have sought if he believed that the state had withheld pertinent evidence.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Super.
