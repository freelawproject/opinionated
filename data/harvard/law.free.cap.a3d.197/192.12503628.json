We affirm, and hold N.J.S.A. 2A:4A-26.1(c)(1), which does not authorize the waiver to adult court of a juvenile under the age of fifteen,\n   has no retroactive application where a defendant's conviction and sentence have been adjudicated with finality.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The following facts are taken from the record. In March 1983, defendant and two other minors were arrested for entering the home of an elderly man and fatally beating him with a wooden nail-studded board to near decapitation, while he lay in bed. Defendant was fourteen years and one month old at the time of the arrest. He was found in possession of the wooden board, as well as two color televisions and an eight-track player belonging to the victim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Following a competency hearing, the Family Part judge granted the State's motion to waive jurisdiction pursuant to N.J.S.A. 2A:4A-26. Subsequently, a jury convicted defendant of first-degree felony murder, N.J.S.A. 2C:11-3(a)(3) ; second-degree burglary, N.J.S.A. 2C:18-2(b)(2) ; first-degree robbery, N.J.S.A. 2C:15-1(b) ; second-degree aggravated assault, N.J.S.A. 2C:12-1(b)(1) ; fourth-degree unlawful possession of a weapon, N.J.S.A. 2C:39-5(d) ; and third-degree possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose, N.J.S.A. 2C:39-4(d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendant was sentenced to life imprisonment with thirty years of parole ineligibility for the first-degree felony murder\n   conviction, and ten years with five years of parole ineligibility for the second-degree burglary-which ran consecutively. Defendant was sentenced to eighteen months each on the fourth-degree unlawful possession of a weapon and third-degree possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose, which ran concurrently with the felony murder and burglary sentences. All other charges were merged. Defendant's aggregate sentence was life imprisonment with thirty-five years of parole ineligibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendant appealed from his conviction and sentence, and we affirmed.\n   <em>\n    State v. Bass\n   </em>\n   , No. A-0056-84 (App. Div. Sept. 26, 1986) (slip op. at 10). The Supreme Court denied certification.\n   <em>\n    State v.

He did not appeal from the denial, but filed a federal writ of habeas corpus, which was dismissed. Defendant's second PCR petition was denied, and we affirmed on appeal.\n   <em>\n    State v. Bass\n   </em>\n   , No. A-5963-95 (App. Div. Jan. 22, 1998) (slip op. at 2). The Supreme Court denied certification.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Defendant filed a second federal writ of habeas corpus, which was terminated on March 12, 1999.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In June 2011, defendant filed a third PCR petition, which was denied. He subsequently filed a third federal writ of habeas corpus, which was denied in October 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The matter currently on appeal arises from defendant's fourth PCR petition, filed in February 2017. In his petition, defendant argued the revised waiver statute, N.J.S.A. 2A:4A-26.1(c)(1), enacted in 2015, should be applied retroactively to his case. Defendant challenged his sentence and argued it was tantamount to a life sentence without parole, and thus, illegal. Defendant also argued his subsequent rehabilitation during incarceration refuted the sentencing judge's finding defendant was not amenable to rehabilitation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The PCR judge issued a written opinion denying defendant's petition without an evidentiary hearing. Reviewing the plain language of N.J.S.A. 2A:4A-26.1(c)(1), the PCR judge found no express language permitting the retroactive application of the statute. Referencing our decision in\n   <em>\n    State in Interest of J.F.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6775266\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/446/39/#p56\">\n    446 N.J.

His conviction and sentence were affirmed. He filed three PCR petitions which were denied and affirmed on appeal. He has filed three times\n   for a federal writ of habeas corpus which were then respectively dismissed, terminated, and denied.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The judge concluded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   While the majority in [\n   <em>\n    J.F.\n   </em>\n   ] makes a compelling argument for why N.J.S.A. 2A:4A-26.1 should apply retroactively in that particular case, its instruction to the lower courts is unclear as to how it would apply to an aged, [extensively] litigated case such as the one before this court. In light of that ambiguity, the preference for applying new laws prospectively must control, as should a plain language reading of the statute, which does not expressly mention retroactivity.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The PCR judge rejected defendant's arguments regarding his sentence. He concluded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   Defendant's sentence is not functionally equivalent to life without parole: his parole\n   disqualifier is [thirty-five] years. He is, in fact, currently scheduled for a parole board hearing on September 1, 2018, at which time he will be [forty-nine] years old. Pursuant to the life expectancy chart adopted for use in the New Jersey Courts, [defendant] is currently expected to live another 32.2 years.

Court Rules\n   </em>\n   , Appendix I-A, www.gannlaw.com(2017).]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The PCR judge rejected defendant's claim that his rehabilitation during incarceration warranted revisiting his sentence, because there was no means for the sentencing judge to consider defendant's rehabilitation as a factor. The judge concluded defendant's rehabilitation was a consideration for the parole board. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On appeal, defendant raises the following arguments:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    POINT I\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN DENYING THE DEFENDANT'S PETITION FOR POST-CONVICTION RELIEF SINCE N.J.S.A. 2A:4A-26.1(c)(1), WHICH PROVIDES THAT A JUVENILE CANNOT BE WAIVED TO THE LAW DIVISION UNLESS THE STATE CAN ESTABLISH THAT THE JUVENILE WAS 15 YEARS OF AGE OR OLDER AT THE TIME OF THE DELINQUENT ACT, APPLIED RETROACTIVELY TO THE DEFENDANT'S CASE, IN WHICH HE WAS 14 YEARS OLD AT THE TIME OF THE OFFENSE IN QUESTION.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    POINT II\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN DENYING THE DEFENDANT'S MOTION TO CORRECT AN ILLEGAL SENTENCE UNDER [\n   <em>\n    RULE\n   </em>\n   ] 3:21-10(b)(5) AS THE SENTENCE VIOLATES THE EIGHTH AMENDMENT PROHIBITION AGAINST [THE] CRUEL AND UNUSUAL PUNISHMENT CLAUSE, FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT DUE PROCESS CLAUSE OF THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION, AND THE NEW JERSEY CONSTITUTION'S\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   CRUEL AND UNUSUAL PUNISHMENT CLAUSE.

There is no evidence the Legislature intended the waiver statute to reach concluded cases which have already passed through the proverbial \"pipeline.\" Therefore, our application of the savings statute in\n   <em>\n    C.F.\n   </em>\n   -which we also relied upon in\n   <em>\n    J.F.\n   </em>\n   -has its limits, as demonstrated by this case, in which defendant's direct appeal has long since been concluded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   As the State notes, those limits are demonstrated by the prejudice that would be experienced by \"requiring new waiver hearings for an unknown number of individuals who had been waived up under the prior law, and the release of numerous other [individuals] who ... have now served more time than they could have under the juvenile system.\" The prejudice to the State is obvious, especially in cases where a defendant has begun, but not yet completed his sentence. For example, the result suggested by the retroactive application of the waiver statute where a defendant has served ten years of a thirty year sentence would require the State to re-assemble\n   its case to address the proper disposition under the juvenile docket a decade after the fact. We discern no evidence this was the Legislature's intent when it enacted N.J.S.A. 2A:4A-26.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   For these reasons, we affirm the PCR judge's decision not to retroactively apply N.J.S.A. 2A:4A-26.1(c)(1). To the extent we have not addressed defendant's other arguments for the retroactive application of N.J.S.A. 2A:4A-26.1(c)(1), it is because those arguments are without sufficient merit to warrant discussion in a written opinion.\n   <em>\n    R.\n   </em>\n   2:11-3(e)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   We reject defendant's argument that his sentence was illegal because it was the functional equivalent of life without parole, and thus, warranted review pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   3:21-10(b)(5).

Alabama\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/\">\n    567 U.S. 460\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/\">\n    132 S.Ct. 2455\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/\">\n    183 L.Ed.2d 407\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012) ).]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Moreover, the Court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   's command that a sentencing judge \"take into account how children are different, and how those differences counsel against irrevocably sentencing them to a lifetime in prison,\" applies with equal strength to a sentence that is the practical equivalent of life without parole. Defendants who serve lengthy term-of-years sentences that amount to life without parole should be no worse off than defendants whose sentences carry that formal designation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 446-47,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12306450\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/227/422/\">\n    152 A.3d 197\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/\">\n    567 U.S. at 480\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/\">\n    132 S.Ct. 2455\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Here, defendant's sentence and circumstances are quite different than the concerns outlined in\n   <em>\n    Zuber\n   </em>\n   . Defendant is now forty-nine years of age. As the PCR judge noted, defendant's parole disqualifier was thirty-five years and he is now eligible for parole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Defendant does not dispute the\n   judge's finding that he has a life expectancy of 32.3 years. Despite the lengthy sentence defendant has served, there are no similarities between his sentence and the sentences reviewed in\n   <em>\n    Zuber\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Finally, defendant's sentence is not illegal because he now claims to be rehabilitated as a result of his incarceration. We do not minimize defendant's efforts to rehabilitate himself, which include: defendant's role as president of the Lifers Group Juvenile Awareness Program, earning a GED high school equivalency diploma, and success in various institutional programs. However, consideration of these accomplishments is exclusively the province of the parole board and not a means of collateral attack on defendant's sentence-which has been affirmed on direct appeal.\n   <em>\n    State v. Bass\n   </em>\n   , Docket No. A-0056-84 (App. Div. Sept. 26, 1986) (slip op. at 10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Affirmed.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
