We do not agree with either argument and, therefore, affirm the judgments of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following factual findings of the trial court, which are not challenged, and procedural history are relevant to our consideration of the issues raised on appeal. Prior to the filing of the neglect petitions, the Department of Children and Families (department) had received numerous reports that the respondent and the children's mother were not acting as responsible parents. In 2011, the department substantiated separate instances in which the parents had failed to follow up on important medical appointments for Madison and Deanna. The next year, the department also substantiated a report that the parents had cancelled appointments for Emma Grace, only three months old at the time, against the advice of her doctor. Then, in 2013, Emma Grace missed multiple appointments with medical specialists, as well as appointments with her pediatrician.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The parents were arrested in September, 2014, on charges of risk of injury to a child; see General Statutes \u00a7 53-21 ; after Deanna, then six years old, was found wandering alone outside in a dirty and disheveled condition. Several months later, in April, 2015, the department received a report from Deanna's school that there was a six inch red mark on her backside. Deanna told school staff that the respondent had struck her with a knife and that he sometimes hits her with a belt. She also told school staff that \"it hurts\" when he hits her, but that she was \"not afraid to go home.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Following an investigation, however, \"the department decided not to substantiate either parent for neglect.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   During this time, the respondent was cooperative with the department's investigation. In May, 2015, he\n   informed the assigned investigative social worker that Madison had been exhibiting behavioral issues at school and scheduled a meeting to address her individualized needs. Then, on June 2, 2015, he contacted the department to notify officials that Emma Grace had been injured when the stroller she was in fell down a flight of stairs onto pavement. Two days later, on June 4, 2015, however, the department received reports that the respondent had been arrested on June 3, 2015, for breach of peace and interfering with a police officer, stemming from an incident at the family's home. The department's follow-up investigation revealed that the respondent had been drinking and acting \"nasty\" toward the mother. She told him to leave, but he refused. He later passed out in the backyard. When he woke up, he began ringing neighbors' doorbells and screaming. At some point, the mother called the police, and he was arrested. In connection with this incident, a protective order was issued, and the respondent moved out of the family's home.\n   The next day, June 5, 2015, the respondent attended an evaluation at Wheeler Clinic for mental health and substance abuse issues. It was recommended that he enroll in an intensive outpatient program at its facility. He agreed and successfully completed the program in July, 2015. The respondent was then referred to a relapse prevention group. Shortly after enrolling in this program, however, he was discharged \"unsuccessfully\" after he notified Wheeler Clinic staff that he was moving to New Haven.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In August, 2015, the respondent again was arrested, this time on motor vehicle charges. He failed to appear in court on these charges, as well as the criminal charges from the June 3, 2015 incident. Then, in October, 2015, police began an investigation into allegations made by the mother that the respondent had sexually assaulted Madison. Although the police eventually concluded that\n   there was insufficient evidence to charge him, it was at this time that the respondent's whereabouts became unknown to the department.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In December, 2015, department social worker Brenda Matta was assigned to the children's case. She attempted to contact the respondent by using phone numbers that the department had listed for him but was unsuccessful. She also contacted a friend of the respondent and left a message for him; her call was not returned. After searching the state Judicial Branch website, Matta found two addresses for the respondent and sent letters to these locations. She received no reply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On December 18, 2015, following a report that the mother and her new husband were consuming large amounts of alcohol while caring for the children, the department invoked a ninety-six hour hold on all three children. Four days later, petitions were filed alleging that the children were neglected. The same day, the petitioner, the Commissioner of Children and Families, also sought and obtained an ex parte order of temporary custody for each of the three children. In granting the orders of temporary custody, the court also ordered preliminary specific steps for the respondent and the mother. Matta testified that, at the time, the whereabouts of the respondent remained unknown, and notice of the orders of temporary custody was made by publication.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   A preliminary hearing on the ex parte orders of temporary custody was held on December 29, 2015; neither parent attended. At the preliminary hearing on the orders of temporary custody, the court found that abode service had been made on the mother and sustained the orders without prejudice to the respondent, as publication was still pending. On January 27, 2016, a preliminary hearing on the neglect petitions was held,\n   which neither parent attended. After finding proper service and compliance with Practice Book \u00a7 17-21, the court entered defaults against both parents for failing to appear, adjudicated the children to be neglected and ordered the petitioner to file a motion to review the permanency plan by September 13, 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The children were committed to the care of the petitioner and specific steps were again ordered for each parent.\n   Finally, in February, 2016, the department was able to speak with the respondent after an official from Deanna's school contacted Matta and informed her that they had received a phone call from an individual claiming to be Deanna's father. Matta called the number the school provided and spoke with an individual who identified himself as the respondent. During their conversation, the respondent said he wanted to see his children but refused to provide his address. He became loud, threatening, and verbally abusive, before hanging up. Sometime between March and July, 2016, Matta attempted to contact him again at the same number but was unsuccessful.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In July, 2016, after nearly a year of evading detection, the respondent was arrested and incarcerated. Two months later, Madison informed her therapist that the respondent had sexually abused her and her two sisters, and the therapist reported the allegations of sexual abuse to the department. On September 16, 2016, the petitioner, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 34a-23, filed a motion for emergency relief seeking an order suspending the respondent's visits with the three children\n   until the department completed an investigation into the allegations of sexual abuse.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court granted the petitioner's motion ex parte the same day it was filed. Following an investigation into the allegations, the respondent was arrested and charged with multiple felonies. The charges remained pending as of the date of the court's decision to terminate the respondent's parental rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Approximately one month after issuing the emergency ex parte order suspending the respondent's visitation rights, the court held a hearing on the petitioner's motion to review the permanency plan.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   At this hearing, the petitioner notified the court for the first time that the respondent was incarcerated. The hearing was continued until November 9, 2016, at which time the respondent appeared and was appointed counsel. Initially, the respondent, through counsel, objected to the petitioner's motion; however, at the evidentiary hearing on December 7, 2016, the respondent withdrew his objection. During the hearing, and in the presence of the respondent and his attorney, the petitioner introduced as an exhibit a social study in support of her motion to review the permanency plan, which included the specific steps ordered by the court on January 27, 2016. At the end of the hearing, the court approved the permanency plans of termination of parental rights and adoption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Upon learning that the respondent was incarcerated, Matta began sending letters to him once a month. The letters identified her as the social worker assigned to the family's case, requested the respondent's participation in the case, and provided him with her direct line. He did not respond to these letters. In December, 2016,\n   Matta was able to speak with the respondent over the phone, at which time he told her that he did not want the department to contact him anymore. Despite this statement, Matta continued to send him letters. She spoke with the respondent once more in May, 2017, this time seeking information for the termination of parental rights social study. During their conversation, the respondent became angry and stopped answering questions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On April 27, 2017, petitions were filed seeking to terminate the parental rights of the respondent. The petitions alleged grounds for termination pursuant to\n   \u00a7\u00a7 17a-112 (j) (3) (B) (i) and (C). On October 24 and 30, 2017, a trial was held on the petitions to terminate. Following the presentation of evidence and closing arguments, the court ordered posttrial briefs addressing the issue of whether the respondent had been provided the specific steps, as required by statute, and heard oral argument from the parties on December 6, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In a thorough and well reasoned memorandum of decision, dated February 7, 2018, the trial court granted the termination petitions with respect to all three children and rendered judgments accordingly.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   In its decision, the court found that there was clear and convincing evidence that the department had made reasonable efforts to locate the respondent, and that he had been unwilling or unable to benefit from reunification efforts. Further, the court found that the respondent had failed to achieve a degree of personal rehabilitation that would encourage a belief that, within a reasonable time, he could assume a responsible position in the lives of his children.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   See\n   General Statutes \u00a7 17a-112 (j) (3) (B) (i). Concomitantly, the court found that the respondent had been provided the specific steps as required by statute and, alternatively, in light of his absconding and refusal to cooperate with the department's investigation, failure to provide him with the steps was harmless error. This appeal followed. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The issue presented on appeal is whether the trial court erred in holding that the respondent had been \"provided\" specific rehabilitative steps in a manner that satisfies the requirements of \u00a7 17a-112 (j) (3) (B) (i) and, if so, whether failing to provide him with the steps was harmless. \"Our review of the court's interpretation of this statute is plenary.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Unique R.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489322\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/156/1/#p845\">\n    170 Conn.

Neither the statute nor our case law, however, establishes a definition of the term \"provided.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The respondent argues that \"provided,\" as it is used in the context of this statute, requires physical delivery of the specific steps to the parent. In this regard, the respondent contends that at some point following his appearance in this case at the November, 2016 hearing, the petitioner or the court should have given him a copy of the previously ordered specific steps or, at the very least, communicated those steps, and their significance, to him. He claims that failure to do so was tantamount to noncompliance with the requirements of \u00a7 17a-112 (j) (3) (B) (i), for which we must reverse the judgments of termination. We are not persuaded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   As our Supreme Court explained in\n   <em>\n    In re Elvin G.\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=310%20Conn.%20485\">\n    310 Conn. at 507-508\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=78%20A.3d%20797\">\n    78 A.3d 797\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the \"[s]pecific steps provide notice and guidance to a parent as to what should be done to facilitate reunification and prevent termination of rights.

For her part, the petitioner claims that this position is logically consistent with the plain meaning of \"provide,\" which is defined as \"to supply or make something available ....\" See Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary (11th Ed. 2003); see also\n   <em>\n    Vazquez\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Buhl\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=150%20Conn.%20App.%20117\">\n    150 Conn.

From this common definition, it is argued, one cannot necessarily infer that \"provide\" requires a direct conveyance from one person to another.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Although we find merit in this position, we are reluctant to graft into the statute a one-size-fits-all definition prescribing the efforts the petitioner must undertake in order to ensure that a respondent is apprised of the specific steps. Rather, it is more consistent with our jurisprudence in this area that this issue be addressed on a case-by-case basis in light of the particular facts before the court. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    In re Stanley D.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1158529\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/61/224/#p231\">\n    61 Conn.

In this regard, there might be some circumstances where\n   merely making the specific steps available in the court file would be inadequate given the respondent's involvement in the case and cooperation with the department. Conversely, where the respondent has evaded detection intentionally and/or refused to respond to the department's inquiries, we do not believe that physical delivery of the steps is a necessary measure. The upshot of this approach is that the court balances the respondent's willingness to participate in the proceedings against the petitioner's efforts to notify the parent of the actions needed to facilitate reunification and avoid termination.\n   Applying this approach to the unchallenged facts of this case, we conclude that the respondent was provided with the specific steps, as required by \u00a7 17a-112 (j) (3) (B) (i). In December, 2015, when the children were first placed in the custody of the petitioner, the respondent was on the run from the law. During the initial stages of these proceedings, the department attempted to contact him by calling several numbers on file, leaving a message with a friend, and sending letters to addresses associated with him. Further, once contact was made with the respondent in February, 2016, he refused to provide the department with his location, became argumentative, and eventually hung up on the department social worker. After he was incarcerated and appeared in court, the previously ordered steps were admitted as an exhibit during the December, 2016 evidentiary hearing. At this time, the steps would have been accessible to the respondent and his attorney, if they had not been already. Finally, in the months leading up to the October, 2017 trial, the department sent several letters to the respondent asking for his cooperation with the termination of parental rights social study, but received no reply. Accordingly, given the respondent's recalcitrance throughout this process, the petitioner's efforts were more than sufficient to ensure that he knew specific steps had been ordered and that those steps were important to preserving his parental rights. To require physical delivery of the steps in this circumstance would only encourage respondents to take a contentious or evasive posture during the pendency of their case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Even if we were to determine, however, that the respondent had not been provided the specific steps, such an omission simply would constitute harmless error in this context. As in\n   <em>\n    In re Elvin G.\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=310%20Conn.%20485\">\n    310 Conn. at 509-17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=78%20A.3d%20797\">\n    78 A.3d 797\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , where hindsight demonstrates that the respondent would have been unable or unwilling to\n   observe specific steps, had they been provided, the absence of such steps does not vitiate an otherwise valid judgment. Here, the steps ordered in December, 2015, and January, 2016, required the respondent to obtain adequate housing and income, avoid involvement with the criminal justice system, and maintain a safe, stable and nurturing home environment, all of which he could not accomplish given his incarceration. Moreover, following new allegations of sexual abuse, the respondent was no longer permitted to visit with the children, which in turn prevented him from developing a cohesive relationship with them, which was another required step. Finally, many of the steps mandated that the respondent cooperate and communicate regularly with the department, which as evidenced in the record, he failed to do repeatedly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   We find our conclusion of harmless error further supported by the fact that the respondent does not contest the trial court's finding that he failed to rehabilitate. In deciding to terminate his parental rights, the trial court found that the respondent was not ready to assume a responsible position in the lives of the children,\n   especially in view of the childrens' ages and particular needs. Additionally, the court noted that it was the respondent's untreated substance abuse issues and general criminality that initially led to his separation from the children. There was no indication from his conduct throughout the proceedings, even following his incarceration, that he had any intention of addressing these problems or becoming a stable and dependable figure in the lives of his children. As such, any physical delivery, if required, of specific steps would have been a futile endeavor in light of the respondent's attitude toward the department and reluctance to change for the better.
