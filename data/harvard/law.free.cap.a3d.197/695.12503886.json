Plaintiff Metro Commercial Management Service, Inc. (Metro) is a closely held real estate management company. In 1993, plaintiff Daniel Hughes (Hughes) incorporated Metro and became its president and sole shareholder. Defendant, an accountant, was a Metro employee at that time. As an incentive, in 2001 Hughes allowed her to become a twelve percent shareholder pursuant to a Stock Purchase and Transfer Restriction Agreement and Metro's Chief Financial Officer (CFO). In 2002, the parties and Nina Kilroy (Kilroy), a non-party to this action, entered into a Shareholders Agreement (Agreement) providing for Metro to issue stock options to defendant for the purchase of nine shares of common stock, paid through bonuses. Her salary was $125,040 for 2003, plus annual increases based upon the lesser value of a five percent increase or the annual increase set by the Consumer Price Index. In pertinent part, the Agreement contained in the shareholder's stipulation that they were \"employee[s]-at[-]will\" and that they could be \"terminated by [Metro] at any time for any reason.\" Each shareholder also agreed that upon termination of employment, the shareholder would be \"deemed to have made an offer to sell the shares to Hughes, the non-selling [S]hareholder and/or [Metro] in accordance with the time and conditions of section five,\" which sets forth the process for selling shares. Fair market value was to be determined by averaging the appraisals chosen by each party and a neutral appraiser. Metro was entitled to redeem the outstanding shares based upon the appraisal methodology described.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In September 2015, defendant was terminated; three months later, she instituted suit seeking reinstatement of her employment\n   with Metro and position as CFO. In her complaint, defendant alleged she was an \"oppressed shareholder\" under N.J.S.A. 14A:12-7(1)(c), based upon her reasonable expectation of continued employment, notwithstanding her at-will status. Her complaint\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   was dismissed, without prejudice, with the trial court finding that her termination did not constitute shareholder oppression because her termination was authorized under the Agreement, and she had no reasonable expectation of continued employment based, in\n   part, upon her at-will status. In April 2016, Metro filed the subject action to compel defendant to sell her shares in accordance with the appraisal method noted above.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant filed a counterclaim, again seeking reinstatement and alleging shareholder oppression by Hughes for:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   (1) making a third-party a [ten] percent shareholder of Metro without the knowledge and consent of [d]efendant;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   (2) unilaterally deciding to rebrand the company including a new logo and web[ ]site;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   (3) unilaterally deciding to terminate the director of operations and human resources director;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   (4) unilaterally revising the employee handbook;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   (5) unilaterally deciding to move the Pennsylvania office of Metro;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   (6) unilaterally negotiating the buyout of a retiring shareholder; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   (7) negligently and/or intentionally mismanaging Metro in an effort to devalue the shares of Metro to the detriment of [defendant].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   After thirteen years of employment with positive performance reviews, defendant asserted that \"her termination without cause violated her reasonable expectation of continued employment even though she was an at-will employee.\" Claims of breach of fiduciary duty and tortious interference were also pled. In her Statement of Reasons, dated March 10, 2016, relative to the first lawsuit, Judge Paula T. Dow found that \"the [Agreement] controls and [defendant] did not have a reasonable expectation of continued employment.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Accepting all of defendant's allegations as true, under\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   4:6-2(e), the judge could not \"glean the fundament of a cause of action\" by defendant, or that \"Hughes abused his authority as an officer and director of [Metro].\" Defendant \"did not have a reasonable expectation of continued employment\" and she was \"not without recourse since the [Agreement] provides a repurchase option for [her] stocks.\" The judge dismissed defendant's complaint without prejudice, and therefore she contends that her claims remain viable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Following discovery in the matter on appeal, Metro moved for summary judgment on defendant's counterclaim, on the grounds that: (1) defendant did not prove minority shareholder oppression; (2) Hughes did not mismanage Metro, but rather made \"routine business decisions;\" and (3) pursuant to the Agreement, Hughes's shares were not restricted, and he was not required to seek defendant's approval before transferring any of his shares.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In Judge Dow's Statement of Reasons dated August 4, 2017, she stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   The court finds conclusive Section [nine] (iii) of the [Agreement], which specifically states that [d]efendant was an at-will employee, and could be terminated \"at any time for any reason.\" In light of this provision, the court cannot find that [d]efendant had a reasonable expectation of continued employment. Accordingly, [d]efendant's reasonable expectations as a minority shareholder were not violated when her employment was terminated.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The motion was granted and the counterclaim was dismissed. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Defendant raises the following points on appeal:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   POINT I:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   THE CHANCERY DIVISION COMMITTED PLAIN ERROR BY HOLDING THAT THE DEFENDANT'S EMPLOYMENT AT[-]WILL STATUS, IN AND OF ITSELF, PRECLUDED A FINDING THAT SHE HAD NO CONTINUED EXPECTATIONS OF EMPLOYMENT.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   A.

Termination of an At[-]Will Employee Shareholder Without Cause [t]hat Frustrates the Shareholder's Continued Expectations of Employment Constitutes Oppression Under N.J.S.A. 14A:12-7(1)(c).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   C.

We review a grant of summary judgment de novo, observing the same standard as the trial court.\n   <em>\n    Townsend v.

The trial court must evaluate the corporation's need to manage its daily affairs, yet consider what \"frustrates the reasonable expectations of the minority shareholder.\"\n   <em>\n    Muellenberg v. Bikon Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"822953\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/143/168/#p179\">\n    143 N.J. 168\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 179,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"822953\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/143/168/#p179\">\n    669 A.2d 1382\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1996). Defendant argues that Hughes \"negligently and/or intentionally mismanage[d] Metro in an effort to devalue shares\" to her detriment. In evaluating the merits of defendant's counterclaim, the judge found defendant admitted that Hughes \"always served as President of Metro ... [and] [d]ecisions as to the basic, day[-]to[-]day operations of the company, particularly\n   those decisions concerning marketing, operations, and employment, clearly fall within the purview of Metro's president.\" Defendant's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Muellenberg\n   </em>\n   is unfounded since that case had nothing to do with an at-will employee status. The Agreement here is a clear example of \"the understanding of the parties concerning their roles in corporate affairs.\"\n   <em>\n    Muellenberg\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"822953\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/143/168/#p179\">\n    143 N.J. at 177\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"822953\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/143/168/#p179\">\n    669 A.2d 1382\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Supreme Court went on to state \"[t]he limited basis for statutory relief reflects an awareness that minority\n   shareholders know the limitations of their power at the time they make their investment in a close corporation.\"\n   <em>\n    Muellenberg\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"822953\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/143/168/#p179\">\n    143 N.J. at 180\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"822953\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/143/168/#p179\">\n    669 A.2d 1382\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As CFO, the judge concluded that defendant did not have \"a reasonable expectation that her opinion would be taken into account with respect to these decisions.\" As to the buy-out of Kilroy's shares, the judge found that defendant executed a Redemption Agreement approving same without demanding an appraisal of Kilroy's interest. This does not speak of shareholder oppression. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   We next address defendant's contention that her at-will status implied a continued expectation of employment with Metro. The judge duly recognized that there is no statute, case law, or rule in New Jersey that addresses whether an employee's at-will status is a relevant consideration in analyzing whether an employee has a reasonable expectation of continued employment. Here, the record contains ample evidence to support the judge's conclusion that the parties entered into the Agreement and stipulated that defendant was an at-will employee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   N.J.S.A. 14A:12-7(1)(c) sets forth the circumstances under which a shareholder oppression action may be brought:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   [where] the directors or those in control have acted fraudulently or illegally, mismanaged the corporation, or abused their authority as officers or directors or have acted oppressively or unfairly toward one or more minority shareholders in their capacities as shareholders directors, officers, or employees.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Oppression in the context of an oppressed minority shareholder action, however, does not require illegality or fraud by majority shareholders or directors.\n   <em>\n    Brenner v.
