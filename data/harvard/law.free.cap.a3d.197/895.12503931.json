On appeal, the petitioner claims that the second habeas court,\n   <em>\n    Fuger, J.\n   </em>\n   , (1) abused its discretion by denying his petition for certification to appeal, and (2) improperly concluded that he was not denied the constitutional right to due process because the jury was not instructed pursuant to\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Salamon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5734708\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/287/509/\">\n    287 Conn. 509\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=949%20A.2d%201092\">\n    949 A.2d 1092\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2008), to the effective assistance of trial counsel and to the effective\n   assistance of first habeas counsel. Although we agree that the second habeas court abused its discretion by denying the petitioner certification to appeal, we disagree that the court improperly denied his second petition for a writ of habeas corpus and, therefore, affirm the judgment of the second habeas court.\n   The present appeal has its factual roots in the brutal murder of the victim, James Connor, in the early morning hours of August 23, 1998.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   See\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Britton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5730402\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/283/598/#p600\">\n    283 Conn. 598\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 600,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=929%20A.2d%20312\">\n    929 A.2d 312\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2007). Pursuant to our plenary review of the petitioner's claims, we have reviewed the entire record, which includes the transcript of the petitioner's criminal trial that was held in November and December, 2004. On the basis of the evidence in the record, we conclude that the jury reasonably could have found that on the night of August 22, 1998, the victim visited his parents on their boat in the Essex Marina and left at approximately 11:30 p.m. to go the Black Seal, an Essex restaurant and bar. Sometime after midnight, he drove his father's Saab to Lucky's Caf\u00e9 (Lucky's) in New London in search of cocaine. The petitioner, Gregory Pierre, Jeffrey Smith (perpetrators) and their friend, Junito Jarvis, were present at Lucky's when the victim arrived. The victim approached the petitioner and asked him if he had any crack cocaine. The petitioner did not have any crack \"on [him],\" but he knew where to get some. The victim drove himself and Pierre to a New London apartment complex where Pierre lived and parked in the parking lot. Jarvis drove the petitioner and Smith to a spot on Michael Road that was adjacent to the parking lot. Jarvis was able to see the Saab and observe the perpetrators from where he was parked.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The victim remained in the Saab, but Pierre went to his apartment. When he returned, Pierre walked to the driver's side of the Saab, where the petitioner and Smith joined him some minutes later. Thereafter, all three of the perpetrators got into the Saab where a struggle\n   ensued. The perpetrators got out of the Saab, and pulled the struggling victim out of the vehicle and beat him until he lay motionless on the ground. Jarvis remained in his car, witnessed the beating and saw the petitioner pick up the victim and put him on the backseat of the Saab. The petitioner told Norman L. Carr that the victim was still alive when he put him in the Saab. The perpetrators got back into the Saab and drove to a parking lot in Bates Woods, a New London park.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   At Bates Woods, the perpetrators removed the victim from the Saab and beat him again. The petitioner took a pipe from the Saab, rammed it into the victim's mouth and twisted it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The perpetrators dragged\n   the victim's body into Bates Woods and covered it with dirt and plastic bags. During the incident, the perpetrators took an imitation Rolex watch and $90 from the victim.\n   At approximately 6:30 a.m. on August 23, 1998, the Waterford police discovered the Saab partially submerged in a duck pond behind the police station. They used the license plate number to identify the Saab's owner, the victim's father, Donald Connor. Members of the New London Police Department impounded the Saab, and, along with the state police, conducted an investigation. During their investigation, the police discovered two palm prints on the door posts of the Saab. The windshield of the Saab was cracked and the rear-view mirror was missing. In addition, investigators found red and brown stains inside the Saab, including on the rear seat, the door panels, and the visor over the driver's seat, which led the police to believe that someone had been injured.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In January, 1999, a badly decomposed human body was found in Bates Woods. Harold Wayne Carver II, the state's chief medical examiner, identified the remains as those of the victim and classified the manner of his death as a homicide.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The police identified the petitioner, Pierre and Smith as suspects. At the request of the police, the petitioner accompanied the New London police to the station, provided them with his palm prints and gave them a statement regarding his involvement in the victim's death. He subsequently was arrested, as were Smith and Pierre, and charged in connection with the victim's murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On July 10, 2001, the state filed a substitute information, charging the petitioner with six crimes: capital felony in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54b (5), murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a (a), felony murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54c, kidnapping in the first degree in violation of\n   General Statutes \u00a7 53a-92 (a) (2) (A), kidnapping in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-92 (a) (2) (B), and robbery in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Following the presentation\n   of evidence,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   a jury of twelve found the petitioner guilty of one count of felony murder, one count of manslaughter in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-55 (a) (1), two counts of kidnapping in the first degree, and one count of robbery in the first degree.

The three men then put the victim into the backseat of the Saab and brought him to a nearby parking lot abutting Bates Woods, a park in New London. They pulled the victim out of the car once more, and this time beat him to death. Pierre, Smith and the [petitioner] then dragged the victim's body into Bates Woods, where they covered the body with dirt and plastic bags.

The prosecutor stated, in relevant part: \"Now, the kidnapping in the first degree; there's actually two counts, the fourth and fifth\n   counts [of the substitute information]. One kidnapping is distinguished from the other because one is that [the victim] was restrained with the intent, that is, the intent from not letting him [get free], and they restrained him with the intent to inflict physical injury upon him. The state asserts that this actually happened on several occasions, this kidnapping. The [perpetrators] restrained [the victim] when they got into his Saab, when they got into his car at Michael Road, he was restrained there. In fact, the evidence is as [Jarvis] told us, that he was pulled out of the car and, as he was being pulled [out of the car, he was kicking as if he was trying to stay in] the car. The state would assert that the evidence says that that's one particular kidnapping. Then [the victim] is put back into his own car and driven to Bates Woods....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \"Now, the other kidnapping ... is that a kidnapping, which is, as I indicated, a restraining with ... the intent of a felony, and the felony, the state would assert in this case, was robbery, and the evidence of the robbery in this case actually comes from several sources, two of which come from the [petitioner].\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The second habeas court noted that the trial court charged the jury extensively with respect to kidnapping, both as a predicate for the capital felony\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   and felony\n   murder charges,\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   as well as for the\n   separate kidnapping\n   counts,\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   and robbery in the first degree,\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   but that the\n   instructions did not comport with\n   <em>\n    Salamon\n   </em>\n   . The second habeas court stated that it was not disputed that the jury found that the victim was moved or restrained at least two separate times, as alleged in the kidnapping counts: once to facilitate injury to the victim and once to rob him. According to the second habeas court, these movements or restrictions of the victim had a clearly defined and distinct significance\n   from each other and from the other charged offenses. The court also concluded that \"a reasonable fact finder could clearly determine that the restraint and/or movement of the victim [were] not merely incidental to the other offenses. That is, the movements and/or confinements had independent criminal significance.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court, therefore, denied the petitioner's\n   <em>\n    Salamon\n   </em>\n   claim because the underlying facts would not have warranted a\n   <em>\n    Salamon\n   </em>\n   instruction. Moreover, the court stated, even if the petitioner were entitled to a\n   <em>\n    Salamon\n   </em>\n   instruction, the absence of such an instruction was harmless error.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   We agree with the second habeas court that the failure to give a\n   <em>\n    Salamon\n   </em>\n   instruction was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In addition to the two kidnapping charges, the petitioner was charged with capital felony, murder, felony murder and robbery.

The petitioner's argument assumes that the robbery occurred in the Saab or parking lot where the victim was first beaten. He analyzed the\n   <em>\n    Salamon\n   </em>\n   risk factors as follows: With respect to the events that took place in the parking lot, the petitioner contends that the state did not allege that the perpetrators confined the victim at any time during which they were not attacking him. He argues that the perpetrators restrained the victim only when they were attacking him. As a matter of law and as recited in the court's instruction on robbery,\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   the use or threatened use of\n   physical force is inherent in the crime of robbery. The evidence, however, demonstrates that the petitioner moved the victim when he was not being attacked. Jarvis testified that the perpetrators dragged the victim from the Saab and beat him motionless. The state contended that the robbery occurred at that point. The petitioner picked up the motionless victim, put him on the backseat of the Saab, transported him to Bates Woods, beat him again and murdered him. Putting the victim back into the Saab, transporting him to Bates Woods, and the ensuing violence was not necessary to the crime of robbery.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   Simply put, abducting and moving the motionless body of the victim exceeded what was necessary to commit the crime of robbery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Moreover, it does not matter at exactly which point in time the perpetrators took the victim's money and watch. The taking could have occurred at any number of points: during the struggle inside the Saab; when the victim was lying motionless on the ground of the parking lot; while he was lying on the backseat of the Saab; after he was driven to Bates Woods; or when he was again pulled from the Saab at Bates Woods. Each of those potential points of taking are separated in time and by distinct movements. If the taking occurred during the struggle inside the Saab, at a minimum, pulling the victim from the Saab, beating him, putting him back in the\n   Saab after he had been beaten motionless was not incidental to or necessary to the taking. If the taking occurred when the victim was placed on the backseat of the Saab after he had been beaten motionless, the initial struggle in the Saab preceded the taking and was not incidental or necessary to it, nor was the asportation to Bates Woods. If the taking occurred after the victim was dead, restraining the victim in and pulling him from\n   the Saab on two occasions was not incidental to or necessary to the commission of the taking. Under any scenario, no reasonable juror could conclude that the restraint or movement imposed on the victim after he was beaten and lying motionless on the ground of the parking lot was\n   <em>\n    necessary\n   </em>\n   for the commission of robbery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   With respect to the kidnapping charge alleging that the petitioner restrained the victim with the intent to inflict physical injury upon him, the evidence demonstrated that the perpetrators restrained the victim in the Saab and assaulted him, causing him physical injury. The victim's blood was detected in the blood splatters on the visor above the driver's seat. After restraining the victim and causing him physical injuries, the perpetrators exceeded what was necessary to commit assault with the intent to cause physical injury by removing the struggling victim from the Saab and beating him motionless. As to the kidnapping charge that the petitioner abducted and restrained the victim in order to inflict physical injury, the evidence demonstrates that the victim was placed in the backseat of the Saab, after he had been beaten and rendered motionless, transported to Bates Woods, beaten and murdered. Driving the victim to Bates Woods was not necessary to inflict physical injury on the victim. That was accomplished initially during the struggle in the Saab and again when he was beaten while he was lying motionless on the parking lot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    White\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Correction\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489078\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/154/1054/#p428\">\n    170 Conn.

The petitioner requested that the first habeas court vacate his conviction and sentence, and remand the matter to the criminal court for further proceedings. The claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel in the petitioner's second habeas petition is identical to the one in the first habeas petition. The court stated that unless the petitioner presented newly discovered evidence that was not reasonably available at the time of the first habeas trial, the petitioner is barred from relitigating a claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel. In addition, the court found that all of the witnesses at the second habeas trial either testified at the first habeas trial or were available to testify at that trial. Moreover, the documentary evidence the petitioner offered at the second habeas trial contained no new evidence, let alone evidence that was not reasonably available at the time of the first habeas trial.

Werner's report indicates that when she spoke with Carr, he had no recollection of the conversation with the petitioner or its contents. At the criminal trial, Carr testified that he had no memory of Werner's interview of him. At the second habeas trial, the petitioner argued that Werner's report should have been offered into evidence as Carr's prior consistent statement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   At the second habeas trial, the petitioner argued that his trial counsel's performances were deficient because they failed to place the facts regarding Werner's interview with Carr before the jury or to call her as a witness to substantiate his lack of memory regarding his conversation with the petitioner. The petitioner claims that trial counsel should have called Werner to testify. The\n   second habeas court, however, found that the petitioner's claim was based on the same legal ground asserted in his first habeas petition. Moreover, Werner's report was known to trial counsel, and Werner was available to testify at the first habeas trial. The court concluded, therefore, that the petitioner's claim was successive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \"The doctrine of res judicata provides that a former judgment serves as an absolute bar to a subsequent action involving any claims relating to such cause of action which were actually made or which might have been made....

The petitioner told Duby that he believed that he was in custody and not free to leave when the police were questioning him. Duby interviewed some of the police officers involved. The first habeas court concluded that even if the\n   petitioner had testified at the suppression hearing as he testified at the habeas trial, the trial court would not have granted the motion to suppress and, therefore, the petitioner was not prejudiced by counsel's decision not to offer his testimony. In resolving the habeas appeal, this court stated that the petitioner's testimony at the first habeas trial did not establish any credible new or additional facts for a court to find that the petitioner was in custody, thus triggering his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   rights.\n   <em>\n    Britton\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Correction\n   </em>\n   , supra, 141 Conn.

This court thus affirmed the finding of the habeas court that the petitioner was not prejudiced by his attorney's failure to offer his testimony at the suppression hearing. On the basis of the foregoing history of litigation and appeals, the second habeas court found that the petitioner failed to demonstrate that Duby was ineffective with respect to his investigation of ineffective assistance of trial counsel regarding the suppression of the petitioner's statement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   With regard to the petitioner's claim that Duby provided ineffective assistance because he failed to investigate and subpoena witnesses to demonstrate that first responders to the crime scene mishandled the victim's body, the second habeas court found that Duby spoke with Carver and hired a medical expert because he was not convinced that the cause of death was accurate, and that the petitioner believed that the victim's body had been moved by the police. The expert's testimony\n   was not particularly helpful to the petitioner because the expert was of the opinion that if the victim's body had been moved, it did not affect the autopsy results, and his opinions were consistent with Carver's. The second habeas court concluded that the evidence the petitioner presented failed to demonstrate that Duby's performance was ineffective to demonstrate that first responders at the crime scene mishandled the victim's body.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   As to the petitioner's claim that Duby failed to introduce adequate exculpatory evidence to show the contradiction between Carr's statement to the police and his statement to Werner, and his trial testimony, DeCaprio testified that Carr's testimony at the criminal trial was adverse to the statement he gave to the police on February 16, 1999. After he gave the statement to the police, but prior to testifying at the petitioner's criminal trial in 2004, Carr testified at Pierre's criminal trial. Werner testified at the second habeas trial that she interviewed Carr on June 27, 2001, and prepared a summary of the interview. Carr's interview with Werner, and his testimony at Pierre's criminal trial and at the petitioner's criminal trial were consistent, but contradicted his February 16, 1999 statement to the police. At both criminal trials, Carr testified that he could not remember anything he said to the police. His police statement was admitted at both criminal trials as a prior inconsistent statement pursuant to\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Whelan\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"559597\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/200/743/#p753\">\n    200 Conn. at 753\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=513%20A.2d%2086\">\n    513 A.2d 86\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The second habeas court reviewed all of Carr's criminal trial testimony and found that he repeatedly testified that he had no memory of what he said to the police.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although the trial court admitted Carr's police statement pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Whelan\n   </em>\n   , the petitioner did not challenge the evidentiary ruling on direct appeal.

The second habeas court stated that it failed to see how a similar claim raised at the petitioner's first habeas trial would have reached a different outcome. The petitioner presented no evidence at the second habeas trial that the court considered exculpatory. The jury was apprised of the contradiction between Carr's statement to the police and his trial testimony. The second habeas court, therefore, concluded that the third alleged basis of ineffective assistance of first habeas counsel failed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The petitioner also alleged that Duby was ineffective for failing to raise a\n   <em>\n    Salamon\n   </em>\n   jury instruction claim in the first habeas petition. On the basis of Duby's testimony at the second habeas trial, the court found that Duby was aware of\n   <em>\n    Salamon\n   </em>\n   and its progeny at the time he was filing the amended petition, but that\n   <em>\n    Luurtsema\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Correction\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4344353\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/299/740/\">\n    299 Conn. at 740\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20A.3d%20817\">\n    12 A.3d 817\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , had not yet been decided. Duby had considered raising a\n   <em>\n    Salamon\n   </em>\n   claim but ultimately decided that the trial court's jury instructions on kidnapping were not defective.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   In considering this claim of ineffective assistance of first habeas counsel, the second habeas court cited the relevant law. \"[A] defendant may be convicted of both kidnapping and another substantive crime if, at any time prior to, during or after the commission of that other crime, the victim is moved or confined in a way that has independent criminal significance, that is, the victim was restrained to an extent exceeding that which was necessary to accomplish or complete the other crime.

It also examined the prosecutor's closing argument and the relevant portions of the trial court's jury instruction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The second habeas court found that the parties did not dispute that the jury found that the victim had been moved and/or restrained on at least two separate occasions as alleged in the two kidnapping counts: \"[o]nce to facilitate injury to him, another time to rob him.\" The movements and/or restrictions had a clearly defined and distinct significance from each other, and exceeded that which was necessary to commit assault and robbery. In other words, the movements or restraints had independent criminal significance. The court, therefore, concluded that the underlying facts would not have warranted a jury instruction pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Salamon\n   </em>\n   , but that if such a charge were warranted, the absence of a\n   <em>\n    Salamon\n   </em>\n   charge was harmless.

Physical force or the threat of its immediate use is a common, readily understandable expression having its ordinary meaning. It means the application or threat of external physical power to another person. Physical force or its immediate threat must be for the purpose of committing the larceny. Such physical force must be used or threatened for the purpose of preventing or overcoming resistance to the taking of the property or to the retention thereof immediately after the taking or for the purpose of compelling the owner of the property to deliver up the property or to engage in other conduct which aids in the commission of the larceny.

The restraint and movement that occurred after the petitioner beat the victim at the apartment parking lot was unnecessary to complete the crimes of assault and robbery and, therefore, had independent significance. The crimes could have been completed prior to returning the victim to the Saab and driving him to Bates Woods. The petitioner's restraint and movement of the badly injured victim from the apartment parking lot to Bates Woods prevented the victim from summoning assistance. The petitioner's moving the victim obviously reduced the petitioner's risk of detection. Finally, the petitioner's restraint and movement of the victim greatly increased the risk of harm to the victim, who was murdered. Under the circumstances of this case, we conclude that the jury was not misled by the failure to give the\n    <em>\n     Salamon\n    </em>\n    charge and, therefore, the failure was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"26\">\n   <p id=\"p-114\">\n    See\n    <em>\n     Miranda\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Arizona\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12046400\" index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/384/436/#p478\">\n     384 U.S. 436\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 478-79,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12046400\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/384/436/#p478\">\n     86 S.Ct. 1602\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12046400\" index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/384/436/#p478\">\n     16 L.Ed.2d 694\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1966).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"27\">\n   <p id=\"p-115\">\n    Carr died and was not available to testify at the second habeas trial.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
