Because we hold the workers' compensation carrier can obtain reimbursement from the tortfeasors in this subrogation action, we reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff New Jersey Transit Corporation (NJ Transit) appeals from the grant of summary judgment dismissing its subrogation action against defendants Sandra Sanchez and Chad Smith for reimbursement of the workers' compensation benefits paid to employee, David Mercogliano, for wage loss and medical expenses resulting from a work-related automobile accident. NJ Transit alleges defendants negligently caused the accident and are thereby liable for reimbursement of the workers' compensation benefits pursuant to N.J.S.A. 34:15-40(f) (Section 40) of the Workers' Compensation Act (WCA), N.J.S.A. 34:15-1 to -146. Defendants claim NJ Transit's claims are barred by the limitation on lawsuit option (the verbal threshold), N.J.S.A. 39:6A-8(a), of the Automobile Insurance Cost Reduction Act (AICRA), N.J.S.A. 39:6A-1 to - 35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The motion judge, relying primarily on\n   <em>\n    Continental Insurance Co. v.

Therefore, the workers' compensation carrier is entitled to reimbursement from the negligent tortfeasors, even though the injured employee could not recover the medical expenses and wage loss from his own automobile insurer or noneconomic damages from the tortfeasors. Accordingly, we reverse and remand for entry of partial summary judgment in favor of NJ Transit.\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The facts relating to the cross-motions are not in dispute. On December 2, 2014, Mercogliano was involved in a motor vehicle collision during the course of his employment. The vehicle driven by Mercogliano was owned by NJ Transit. Sanchez was the driver and Smith was the owner of the other vehicle involved in the accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At the time of the collision, Mercogliano, Sanchez, and Smith maintained personal automobile insurance policies compliant with AICRA. Mercogliano's policy provided $250,000 in Personal Injury Protection (PIP) benefits and the verbal threshold applied. The parties stipulate Mercogliano's injuries do not vault the verbal threshold because he did not sustain a permanent injury as defined by N.J.S.A. 39:6A-8(a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   As a direct result of Mercogliano's injuries and lost wages, NJ Transit's workers' compensation carrier paid him $33,625.70 in workers' compensation benefits, comprised of $6694.04 in medical benefits, $3982.40 in temporary indemnity benefits, and $22,949.26 in permanent indemnity benefits. Mercogliano did not sue defendants directly. Instead, NJ Transit has initiated this subrogation action pursuant to Section 40, which gives workers' compensation carriers the right to institute proceedings against third-party tortfeasors for recovery of damages paid to injured employees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   NJ Transit and defendants filed cross-motions for summary judgment on stipulated facts. The motion judge, relying primarily on\n   <em>\n    Continental\n   </em>\n   and language in\n   <em>\n    Lefkin v. Venturini\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"290755\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/229/1/\">\n    229 N.J.

Mercogliano was fully compensated by the workers' compensation carrier for his medical expenses and wage loss; he suffered no uncompensated economic loss. The motion judge held NJ Transit's claim must be dismissed because AICRA bars claims for compensated economic damages. In reaching that conclusion, the judge quoted the following language from\n   <em>\n    Lefkin\n   </em>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   N.J.S.A. 39:6A-6 places the primary obligation for the payment of benefits covered both by workers compensation and PIP on the employer rather than the PIP carrier. This policy decision may be presumed to have been based on the legislative perception that in terms of societal distribution of the burden of loss resulting from automobile-accident injury, the primary cost of work-related injuries\n   should continue to be borne by the ultimate consumers of the goods and services in whose production they are incurred. Thus, the automobile-owning public, whose insurance rates are proportionally related to the PIP claims experience of the insurance industry, is relieved of that portion of the overall burden.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   [\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"290755\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/229/1/\">\n    229 N.J.

He distinguished\n   <em>\n    Lambert\n   </em>\n   , determining those plaintiffs were not subject to the verbal threshold or presumptively vaulted it; thus, \"each of the three plaintiffs could prove a viable cause of action against the tortfeasor.\" Each of the three plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    Lambert\n   </em>\n   reached settlements with the tortfeasors. Therefore, the judge deemed it \"appropriate that the lien on economic damages paid by the workers' compensation carrier [was] satisfied\" by the plaintiffs' respective recoveries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Finally, the judge concluded the workers' compensation carrier does not have an independent right to subrogate against a tortfeasor when the injured employee is unable to establish a cause of\n   action against the tortfeasor. Regarding the interplay of the WCA and AICRA as to final responsibility for medical expenses incurred by workers who are injured in work-related motor vehicle accidents, the judge reasoned:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   It is the public policy of the state to have injured persons secure prompt medical attention with assurances the bills will be paid if they are in the course of their employment or if they are involved in an automobile accident. If the injured person's no-fault carrier pays PIP benefits, it can seek reimbursement from the injured person's workers' compensation carrier once it is established the injured person was in the course of his or her employment when the accident occurred. If plaintiff's view here were accepted, the workers' compensation carrier would pay the PIP carrier, and then seek reimbursement from the tortfeasor who is insured under an AICRA policy. The Legislature specifically sought to eliminate the expensive and complicated claims process by creating the \"no-fault\" automobile insurance statute in the first place. Said public policy, a significant underpinning to the automobile no-fault scheme, would be thwarted if the automobile PIP carriers secure reimbursement from the injured person's workers' compensation carrier, and then that workers' compensation carrier subrogates the economic loss against a motor vehicle tortfeasor who is part of the no-fault insurance system. Such a result would be contrary to a goal of AICRA, i.e. to reduce the cost of automobile insurance by reducing the number of litigated claims.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   [ (Citations omitted).]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The judge granted summary judgment to defendants and dismissed the complaint with prejudice.
