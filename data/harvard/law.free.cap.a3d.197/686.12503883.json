N.J.S.A. 12A:3-309(b). The Legislature did not require the person enforcing the note to prove its possession as it provided in subsection (a).

The common-law principles of assignment are not preempted by our version of the UCC which makes no specific mention of the assignability of a lost note. In order to permit the widely-practiced assignment of\n   obligations - especially those secured by mortgages - gap-filler provisions such as the doctrine of assignment are appropriate under N.J.S.A. 12A:1-103.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In construing the statutes, we heed the Legislature's mandate that our UCC \"be liberally construed and applied to promote its underlying purposes and policies,\" N.J.S.A. 12A:1-103(a), one of which is \"to permit the continued expansion of commercial practices through custom, usage, and agreement of the parties,\" N.J.S.A. 12A:1-103(a)(2). Permitting the transfer of a lost note promotes the UCC's purpose of expanding commercial practices of contract-parties such as Citi and plaintiff, which intended the transfer of rights to enforce the lost note along with the assignment of defendant's mortgage. Application of common-law assignment principles to the protections afforded obligors by the requirements of 3-309, therefore, properly supplements the UCC provisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Our reading of both sections of 3-309 is also consistent with equitable principles that guard against unjust enrichment. \"[T]he doctrine of unjust enrichment ... rests on the equitable principle that a person shall not be allowed to enrich himself\n   unjustly at the expense of another.\"\n   <em>\n    Callano v.

It would be unjust to preclude enforcement of the obligations defendant has disregarded since February 2010. Like the common-law assignment principles, the doctrine of unjust enrichment does not displace 3-309 or any other provision of our UCC. It supplements those provisions in the same manner as do the assignment principles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   We also reject defendant's argument that 3-309 precludes plaintiff's enforcement of the note because such argument produces an absurd result - allowing the defaulted defendant to remain in possession of a house obligation-free.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Turner v.

The affidavit sets forth: the actions taken to find the lost note; Citi's status as the note's lawful owner; and that Citi, as the note's seller, did not cancel, alter, assign or hypothecate the note. There was no reason for a representative of Citi - considering the terms of 3-309 - to make the statements set forth in the affidavit, if said statements were not true. If Citi did not lose the note, it would have been easier to attach it. Instead, it admitted the note was lost, leaving the door ajar for defendant's arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The lost-note affidavit was also properly qualified as a business record. A Citi vice-president reviewed the lost-note affidavit, a standard document effectively required by 3-309, and, as a person familiar with the business records Citi maintained, certified that the pre-requisites under N.J.R.E. 803(c)(6) to qualify it as a business record were met.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

When asked to set forth the location of the note, the processor then answered that plaintiff was not in possession of the original note and referred to the lost-note\n   affidavit. These arguably disputed facts are insubstantial in nature. Defendant has not offered any evidence that the note was not lost.
