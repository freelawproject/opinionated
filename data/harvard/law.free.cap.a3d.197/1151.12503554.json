Inmate Anthony Malacow appeals from the DOC finding that he was guilty of\n   prohibited act *.259, when he failed to comply with an order to submit a thirty-milliliter urine sample within two hours. Malacow argues that he provided a urine sample of the requisite amount, his due process rights were violated before and during his hearing, the hearing officer (HO) ignored potential video evidence, and his counsel substitute was ineffective. Malacow's concerns with regard to a fair hearing and the effectiveness of his counsel substitute are without sufficient merit to require further discussion in a written opinion.\n   <em>\n    R.\n   </em>\n   2:11-3(e)(1)(E). We reject these meritless claims, but remand for reconsideration of sanctions, and suggest the DOC amend its regulations so that particularized reasons for sanctions are provided in future disciplinary matters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The HO found Malacow guilty and sanctioned him to fifteen days of loss of recreational privileges, ninety-one days in administrative segregation, loss of ninety days commutation time, 365 days of urine monitoring and permanent loss of contact visits. She also referred him for a mental health follow-up. The findings and sanctions were reviewed and affirmed by the DOC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Malacow is serving a six-year sentence for burglary and resisting arrest. On November 19, 2017, at 8:45 a.m., while incarcerated in the Southern State Correctional Facility, Malacow was ordered to submit a urine sample after officers discovered \"a quart sandwich bag [one-fourth] full of suspected tobacco, a brillo pad and brillo pad wires with burnt ends, and [three] batteries with the\n   wrapping peeled off\" in his wall locker. At 10:45 a.m., he had failed to provide a thirty-milliliter urine sample. Malacow was initially charged with: (1) *.201, \"[p]ossession or introduction of an explosive, incendiary device or ammunition\"; (2) .554, \"[p]ossession of tobacco products or matches where prohibited\"; and (3) *.259, \"failure to comply with an order to submit a specimen for prohibited substance testing.\" N.J.A.C. 10A:3-5.11(f) and (i) require an inmate to provide a thirty-milliliter urine sample within a two-hour period or face a disciplinary charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On November 22, 2017, a disciplinary hearing began, but was postponed so Malacow could receive a psychological evaluation, as required by a federal settlement in 1999.\n   <em>\n    Mejia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6775852\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/446/369/#p378\">\n    446 N.J.

The evaluation revealed that while Malacow was suffering from a mental illness, it did not \"contribute to [his] behavior manifesting itself in the alleged infraction\"; and Malacow was responsible for his actions. The evaluation also concluded that Malacow was \"mentally competent to defend [himself] and understand the [disciplinary] proceeding,\" and placement in detention or administrative segregation would not likely \"lead to an exacerbation of mental health problems ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Five days later, the disciplinary hearing resumed.

An inmate facing disciplinary action must be provided with the following limited protections: (1) written notice of the charges, provided at least twenty-four hours before the hearing, so the inmate can prepare a defense; (2) an impartial tribunal, consisting of either one HO or a three-member adjustment committee; (3) the assistance of a counsel substitute if the inmate is illiterate or unable to collect or present evidence; (4) the right to call witnesses and present documentary evidence, provided it is not \"unduly hazardous to institutional safety or correctional goals\"; (5) the right to confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses; and (6) quoting the Standards on the Inmate Discipline Program section 254.283, \"a written statement of the fact-findings is given to the inmate by the [HO] or by the adjustment committee chairman as to the evidence\n   relied upon, decision and the reason for the disciplinary action taken unless such disclosure would jeopardize institutional security.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 525-33,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=341%20A.2d%20629\">\n    341 A.2d 629\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Reviewing the six\n   <em>\n    Avant\n   </em>\n   factors, other than the lack of a valid statement of reasons for the sanctions, Malacow's due process rights were not violated. First, he signed and dated the entry on the adjudication of disciplinary charge form which stated that he waived the twenty-four hours' notice requirement. Second, Malacow's case was heard before a HO. Third, Malacow requested and was granted a counsel substitute. Fourth, Malacow was given the opportunity to call witnesses. Fifth, he was given the opportunity to cross-examine any adverse witnesses. Finally, Malacow was given a written statement of the evidence the HO relied upon, and the HO's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The reasons for the sanctions imposed, however, were lacking. The HO provided the following reason for imposing these sanctions: \"[Inmate] was ordered to void and was unable to provide a sample within the allotted time.\" Of course, an inmate will not be sanctioned unless he or she committed an infraction. That does not explain why these particular sanctions were imposed instead of different permissible sanctions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Although not initially raised by Malacow in his pro se appellate brief, we asked for supplemental briefing on the lack of articulation of valid reasons for the sanctions. The DOC argued that because the sanctions were relatively lenient, no reasons were required. The DOC asked us\n   to remand the matter if we disagreed with that argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Prohibited act *.259 is a Category B offense. N.J.A.C. 10A:4-4.1(a)(2)(xxvi).

Therefore, if found guilty of any drug or alcohol-related prohibited act, an inmate \"shall have their contact visit privileges terminated while housed in New Jersey State prisons and correctional facilities ....\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=341%20A.2d%20629\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   A *.259 prohibited act is one that calls for termination of contact visit privileges. N.J.A.C. 10A:4-5.1(o)(6). Malacow was therefore subject to mandatory \"permanent\" loss of contact visits under the zero tolerance drug and alcohol policy. N.J.A.C. 10A:1-2.2.

Before the administrative segregation was imposed, a psychologist found after evaluation that placement in detention or administrative segregation would not \"likely lead to an exacerbation of mental health problems within [twenty-one] days that will significantly reduce [Malacow's] ability to adapt to that setting.\" Because he was placed in administrative segregation, which\n   is essentially solitary confinement,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   for ninety-one days rather than twenty-one days, the evaluation was arguably of limited utility.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   As we\n   stated in\n   <em>\n    Mejia\n   </em>\n   , a DOC August 14, 2015 \"Request for Rule Exemption\" pointed out the negative impact administrative segregation may have on the mentally ill.\n   <em>\n    Mejia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6775852\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/446/369/#p378\">\n    446 N.J.
