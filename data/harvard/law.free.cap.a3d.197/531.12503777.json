After having had his motion denied, the judge proceeded to hear evidence regarding Steck's Motion to Suppress, which was also subsequently denied. About two months later, but prior to trial, after receiving additional material from the State, Steck successfully filed a Motion to Reopen his Motion to Suppress, which was, again, ultimately\n   denied. Before us, Steck presents the following questions for our review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   1. Did the lower court err in denying Mr. Steck's Motion to Suppress?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   2. Did the lower court err in denying Mr. Steck's Motion to Dismiss?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   Finding no error or abuse of discretion, we affirm, for the reasons set forth below.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In the early morning of August 7, 2016, while working bicycle patrol in the area of First Street and St. Louis Avenue in Ocean City, Officer Dan McBride, of the Ocean City Police Department, observed a \"2008 black Chevy Impala\" with a \"Delaware registration\" stop at a stop sign and then make a left-hand turn, crossing over\n   one lane of the roadway. At the suppression hearing, Officer McBride testified that when the \"vehicle went to make a left-hand turn, it pulled out in front of a taxicab, which caused the taxicab [driver] to ... slam on his brakes to avoid a collision with the vehicle.\" Believing that the driver had committed a traffic violation, Officer McBride, according to his testimony, \"broadcast a description of the vehicle and the occupants\" over a radio network used by the Ocean City Police Department. The vehicle was subsequently stopped by Officer Neshawn Jubilee of the Ocean City Police Department. Officer McBride testified further that after broadcasting this information, he immediately began riding his bicycle to the area of the traffic stop, arriving within three or four minutes after witnessing the \"unsafe lane change.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Upon arriving on the scene of the traffic stop, Officer McBride confirmed that the vehicle stopped was the Chevy Impala he witnessed nearly get into an accident with the taxicab and identified Etoyi Roach\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   as the driver, Steck in the\n   backseat, and another passenger in the front seat. After speaking with the vehicle's occupants, Officer McBride testified that he walked to Officer Jubilee's patrol car, sat inside it, and \"began issuing Mr. Roach a written warning [for the unsafe lane change] and then requested a K-9 unit to respond to the scene.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   At the suppression hearing, Officer McBride informed the court that he chose to request a canine unit \"based on the behavior of the occupants, which [was] noted in [his] report, as well as the information that Officer Jubilee had relayed[,]\" including that \"it took a little longer to pull over than usual ... [the Impala] almost ran a red light when it pulled over and kind of coasted to a stop. And [Officer Jubilee] said that as he approached the vehicle, the driver - the occupants were making some furtive movements around the vehicle.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Similarly, Officer Jubilee testified that, the Impala \"did not stop until the ocean block of 8th street, which is three city blocks further than where I initiated the traffic stop.\" As he pulled up to the vehicle, he noticed that, \"the occupants were looking around. Their hands were moving about the car. I did not know exactly what they were doing, but they were looking around at each other and their hands were also moving.\" The occupants of the vehicle provided Officer Jubilee their licenses upon request, and at that point, Officer McBride arrived on the scene and took control of the traffic stop. Officer McBride further testified that after he made his request for the canine unit, it took a \"couple minutes\" for a team to arrive, and he was still in the process of writing Roach's warning when it arrived.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   At the suppression hearing, Deputy Christopher Larmore, of the Worcester County Sheriff's Office Patrol Division, testified, also, that he was in the area of Third Street and Atlantic Avenue when he received a request for canine support. He further testified that it took him and his canine partner, Simon, a \"couple of minutes\" to travel from the location wherein they received the request to the scene of the traffic stop. Upon the K-9 team's arrival, Deputy Larmore requested\n   that Officer McBride and the other officers remove the occupants from the vehicle for safety reasons. Shortly thereafter, Deputy Larmore and Simon conducted a scan of the vehicle, at which time Roach, Steck, and the other passenger were all seated on a nearby curb. Deputy Larmore further related:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   So I get up to scan the vehicle with my K-9 partner. I give him his command to scan the vehicle.... And at that point in time, I notice a change of his breathing and posture and his general behavior. And it's consistent with when he's in the odor of narcotics....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   When he got in the area of the rear passenger door, Your Honor, he began to go back and forth between sniffing the vehicle and sniffing the gusts of wind that were blowing from the general direction of the occupants. So, basically, at this point in time, he is showing the signs of behavior of being in odor, but he's actually going back and forth, trying to pull me in different directions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Deputy Larmore explained through his testimony that since Simon was\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   kind of, fighting two different odors here, he won't actually go into what's called a final alert, which is his sit. That's his trained response. All of the other responses that he's giving me are involuntary responses. Those are the responses that he gives when he's in the odor of the five odors I just mentioned.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   When asked by Officer McBride whether Simon provided an alert at the scene, Deputy Larmore testified that he informed the lead officer that he \"believed that the odor was mostly coming from the occupants and that's why [Simon] kept trying to pull me to them.\" Deputy Larmore further testified that Simon's behavior was \"consistent with odor coming from the vehicle\" and \"odor coming from the individuals sitting on the curb.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Deputy Larmore also testified on direct examination that he believed the odor to have originated from the occupants, but explained that, perhaps, Simon was also indicating to the car because \"of the odor having been recently in the vehicle from the occupants who obviously had gotten out just before.\" At the end of his direct examination, Deputy Larmore concluded that, at the time of the scan, he considered there to be \"two sources\" of the odor - the vehicle and the occupants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Detective Corey Gemerek, of the Criminal Investigation Division, Ocean City Police Department, testified that after the scan was complete, he approached Steck and \"asked if he had any drugs and/or illegal weapons on his person.\" According to Detective Gemerek, Steck replied \"that he had a blunt inside his pocket.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Detective Gemerek then asked Steck to remove it from his pocket; Steck, in turn, \"retrieved a clear plastic bag containing marijuana and handed it to\" Detective Gemerek.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Detective Gemerek then handed Officer McBride the marijuana.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   After the seizure of the marijuana, the officers searched the vehicle and, discovered one thousand bags of what turned out to be heroin.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    Motions to Suppress\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Steck filed two motions to suppress the seizure of the heroin, both of which were denied. All of the testimony discussed herein relates solely to that which was developed at the suppression hearings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    \"\n   </strong>\n   When reviewing the denial of a motion to suppress evidence,\" appellate courts \"ordinarily consider only the information contained in the record of the suppression hearing, and\n   not the trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Lewis v.

He first argues that the initial traffic stop was unlawful, as it was not supported by reasonable articulable suspicion that a traffic violation had occurred. Specifically, he contends that neither Sections 21-309(b)\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   nor 21-402(a)\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   of the Transportation (\"TR\") Article, Maryland Code (1977, 2012 Repl. Vol.), was violated by the driver of the vehicle, Etoyi Roach, and as a result, the stop was illegal from its inception. Steck further avers that the traffic stop was \"prolonged beyond the time necessary to effectuate the purpose of the stop, to write a warning ticket, in order to permit a K-9 unit to arrive and conduct a scan of the car.\" He next argues that\n   there was no probable cause to search the vehicle, as the drug detection dog failed to provide \"a positive alert\" and that the dog handler failed \"to explain why Simon did not positively alert to the car.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The State conversely avers that, \"[t]he facts testified to by Officer McBride, which were credited by the suppression court, were sufficient to support a traffic stop based on a reasonable suspicion of a violation of TR \u00a7 21-403(b) or (c),\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   for a failure to yield the right-of-way to a vehicle on a through highway.\" The State also argues that Steck's contention that the traffic stop was unnecessarily prolonged or abandoned\n   to allow the canine unit to arrive and scan the vehicle is waived on appeal, because it was not preserved. In the alternative, if not waived, the State contends that there \"was no unnecessary delay or abandonment of the original traffic stop[.]\" The State next avers that \"the canine's detection and indication of both the vehicle and the vehicle occupants as separate sources of the odor of drugs provided probable cause for police to conduct a warrantless search of the vehicle.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, made applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment, protects individuals against unreasonable searches and seizures by the government.\n   <em>\n    Whren v.

Unlike\n   <em>\n    Lewis\n   </em>\n   , therefore, where police officers grounded their\n   decision to stop a vehicle on an alleged traffic violation which was not one-the vehicle used its turn signal, began to pull into the street from a parallel parking space, and \"nearly\" struck the back of a police car-the behavior observed by Officer McBride and credited by the Circuit Court, in the present case, provided the officers reasonable suspicion to stop Mr. Roach's Impala.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Steck next contends that, even if \"the traffic stop was lawful, it was nevertheless prolonged beyond the time necessary to effectuate the purpose of the stop, to write a warning ticket, in order to permit a K-9 unit to arrive and conduct a scan of the car.\" Steck further contends that Officer McBride \"ceased writing the warning ticket so as to help focus on the dog sniff[,]\" hence, abandoning the original purpose of the stop. The State counters that \"there is no evidence that Officer McBride unnecessarily prolonged the original traffic stop, or abandoned\" its original purpose because he was \"still in the process of preparing the warning when the scan occurred, and aside from briefly speaking to [Deputy] Larmore when he arrived, there is no evidence that he suspended his activities in preparing a warning for Roach.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   While the reasonableness of a \"traffic-based detention is not measured by the clock alone,\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

A formal discovery request for the material, however, was not made until January 3, 2017, when Steck's counsel entered his appearance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The State's Attorney, however, informed Steck's counsel that Emergency Services of Worcester County \"only keep[s] their radio communications for 90 days after the event.\" The radio recordings requested by Steck had been destroyed on November 6, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Steck, before us, contends that the trial court abused its discretion in denying his motion to dismiss the charges against him because the exculpatory value of the police recordings \"was of such a nature that no comparable evidence could be obtained.\" Had the recordings been properly preserved, he argues, they \"could have established that [he] was illegally arrested after an unlawful search of the car .... [that a]ll of the evidence against [him] emanated from the unlawful search of the car and thus, without this evidence, the state could not have obtained a conviction.\" Steck further avers that, \"at the very least,\" the evidence sought was \"potentially useful\" and \"destroyed in bad faith.\" Steck proffers that the State acted in bad faith because it received the letter requesting the preservation of the recordings, the request was \"acknowledged by the State[,]\" but the State \"did nothing to prevent the destruction of the tapes by the police department and gave the defense no warning that, after 90 days, it would be destroyed.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The State counters that it was under no duty to preserve the evidence and that the recordings possessed no exculpatory quality. The State argues that \"Steck presented nothing to support a claim that the recordings contained apparently exculpable evidence\" that was not otherwise reflected in the\n   event reports obtained by him, which reflect the timing of the radio calls. Furthermore, the State claims that \"there is no evidence that even if the [police] recordings were improperly destroyed, that Steck was so prejudiced as to justify the extreme sanction of dismissal.\" Finally, the State alleges that because the recordings were destroyed in accordance with police policy, no bad faith existed to support Steck's due process challenge.\n   Although dismissal could be envisioned for discovery violations under Rule 4-236(d), it is \"well-settled ... that the sanction of dismissal should be used sparingly, if at all.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.
