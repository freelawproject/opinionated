Section 10-910(b)(1) provides that \"[w]ithin 30 days after receipt of\" the hearing board's recommended penalty, \"the appointing authority shall ... issue a final order.\" Section 10-910(b)(6) states that \"the appointing authority may increase the recommended penalty\" if, among other things, the appointing authority \"meets with the [charged] correctional officer and allows\" the officer \"to be heard on the record.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The ultimate question posed here is whether \u00a7 10-910(b)(1) precludes remanding a case to the appointing authority to cure a procedural defect that occurred at the penalty-increase\n   meeting. Specifically, we must decide whether the appointing authority should have the opportunity to hold another penalty-increase meeting after the thirty-day deadline for issuing a final order when, as happened here, recording equipment malfunctioned during the initial meeting, preventing the substance of that meeting from being captured \"on the record.\" A three-member panel of the Court of Special Appeals, in a split decision, held that the appointing authority's failure to satisfy the \"on the record\" requirement is incurable after the\n   thirty-day deadline.\n   <em>\n    Foy v.

Laws 1425\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1448. Prior to that date, the disciplinary process for state correctional officers was governed by Title 11 of the Maryland Code (1993, 2015 Repl. Vol), State Personnel and Pensions (\"SPP\") Article. The intent of the then-new COBR was \"to establish exclusive procedures for the investigation and discipline of a correctional officer for alleged misconduct.\" \u00a7 10-902. The General Assembly modeled the COBR after the Law Enforcement Officers' Bill of Rights (\"LEOBR\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    Ellsworth v.

Courts therefore look to the LEOBR as an informative source for interpreting the COBR's provisions.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Kearney v. France\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4183800\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/222/542/#p544\">\n    222 Md.

After receiving a notice of charges recommending termination, a correctional officer has the option to file an appeal with the Secretary of the Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services (\"Secretary\") or request a hearing before a hearing board. \u00a7 10-908(c). The hearing board is composed of correctional officers holding varying ranks within the Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services (\"Department\"). \u00a7 10-909(c)(1)(i). After facilitating a hearing, the hearing board issues a finding of guilty or not guilty and produces a written penalty recommendation. \u00a7 10-910(a)(1)-(7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The hearing board must deliver this report to the \"appointing authority of the correctional facility.\" \u00a7 10-910(a)(9)(ii). The \"appointing authority\" is defined under \u00a7 10-901(b) as \"an individual ... that has the power to ... terminate employment.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The appointing authority of the Baltimore City Detention Center is the Commissioner of the Division of Pretrial Detention and Services (\"Commissioner\"). \u00a7 5-202(c)(4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   After receiving the hearing board's decision, the Commissioner has thirty days to issue a final order. \u00a7 10-910(b)(1)(ii). The Commissioner is not bound by the hearing board's recommended penalty. \u00a7 10-910(b)(3). If the Commissioner determines that termination of the employee is appropriate, then the Commissioner \"shall obtain approval from the Secretary.\" \u00a7 10-910(b)(5). The Commissioner may also increase the hearing board's recommended penalty, with the Secretary's permission, if the Commissioner: (1) reviews the record\n   of the\n   hearing board's proceedings; (2) meets with the correctional officer and allows the officer an opportunity to be heard on the record; (3) provides the officer with any items not included in the hearing board's record that the Commissioner relied on; and (4) describes, in writing, the evidence supporting his decision to increase the recommended penalty. \u00a7 10-910(b)(6). Once the Commissioner issues a final order, the correctional officer has a right to seek judicial review. \u00a7 10-911.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    The Present Case\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Lieutenant Michael Foy (\"Foy\"), Respondent here, sought judicial review of the decision of Acting Commissioner of the Baltimore City Detention Center, John Wolfe (\"Commissioner Wolfe\") to terminate him for reasons we next explain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    A. The Underlying Incident\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On January 12, 2014, Foy and Sergeant Jeremiah Green (\"Green\"), both correctional officers at the Baltimore City Detention Center (\"BCDC\"), Petitioner, were conducting security rounds at the facility. At some point during their rounds, an altercation ensued between Green and an inmate, during which Green struck the inmate in the face. The inmate then charged at Green, but Green restrained him. Although the inmate posed no further threat, Foy stepped on his neck, placing the inmate in need of medical care. After the incident, Foy did not report his use of force. Foy ultimately submitted a report, but he omitted material facts about the incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    B. The Disciplinary Proceedings\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On April 10, 2014, the Department's Human Resources Services Division served Foy with a Notice of Disciplinary Charges (\"Notice\"). The Notice charged Foy with violating twelve Department policies, as enumerated by various statutes, regulations, and internal guidelines and recommended his termination. On April 16, 2014, Foy exercised his right to a hearing, as provided by the COBR. \u00a7 10-908(c)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The hearing board conducted a three-day hearing (on September 14, October 5, and October 12, 2015), during which it heard testimony from witnesses called by both BCDC and Foy. On November 16, 2015,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   the hearing board issued a written decision finding Foy guilty of ten of the twelve disciplinary charges. The hearing board recommended that he be transferred to Baltimore City Booking and Intake Center and demoted to Sergeant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On November 23, 2015, Commissioner Wolfe received the hearing board's recommendation and, as authorized by \u00a7 10-910(b)(6), elected to increase the recommended penalty. On December 9, 2015, Commissioner Wolfe conducted a penalty-increase meeting, as required by \u00a7 10-910(b)(6)(ii), with Foy and his attorney. During the meeting, Foy's counsel argued that Commissioner Wolfe should not increase the hearing board's recommended penalty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   After the meeting, Commissioner Wolfe learned that the audio recording equipment had failed; consequently, the meeting was not \"on the record,\" as per \u00a7 10-910(b)(6)(ii). The next day, December 10, 2015, Commissioner Wolfe informed Foy's\n   counsel about the recording issue and requested that the parties reconvene for another meeting. That same day, Commissioner Wolfe created a memorandum for the Secretary of Public Safety and Correctional Services, Stephen T. Moyer, memorializing what transpired at the December 9th meeting. The memorandum noted, among other things, that Foy asked for his ten years of service to be considered. Foy also requested leniency and an opportunity for a second chance, stating, as recounted by the Commissioner, that \"if he was given the opportunity to do it all over again, he would have made different choices.\"\n   The parties were set to meet again on December 17, 2015, but Commissioner Wolfe canceled without explanation on December 16, 2015. Thereafter, Commissioner Wolfe, with Secretary Moyer's approval, issued a final order terminating Foy, effective December 16, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Foy filed a petition for judicial review in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. There, he argued that Commissioner Wolfe violated his rights under the COBR because the Commissioner increased the hearing board's recommended punishment without properly recording the penalty increase meeting. Foy requested that the court vacate the termination order and reinstate him with back pay. After a hearing, the court issued an order remanding the case to Commissioner Wolfe to conduct another penalty-increase meeting \"so that a complete record of the administrative proceeding is available for ... [j]udicial [r]eview.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    C. The Appeal\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Foy noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. A panel of the Court of Special Appeals, in a 2-1 decision, reversed the circuit court's remand order and \"reinstate[d] the Hearing Board's penalty recommendation as the final administrative action.\"\n   <em>\n    Foy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12491653\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/174/916/\">\n    235 Md.

Foy argues that every pre-condition is mandatory-\"[e]very step must be taken\" before a penalty is increased. Foy cites to the Court of Special Appeal's decision in\n   <em>\n    Hird\n   </em>\n   to support his assertion.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1292451\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/121/496/#p504\">\n    121 Md.

It highlights the contrast between the language describing the LEOBR's penalty-increase process and the COBR's analogous provision. The LEOBR states that the head of the law enforcement agency (\"the chief\") \"may increase the recommended penalty of the hearing board\n   <em>\n    only if\n   </em>\n   the chief\n   <em>\n    personally\n   </em>\n   \" satisfies four requirements. Md. Code, (2003, 2011 Repl. Vol), \u00a7 3-108(d)(5) of the Public Safety (\"Pub. Safety\") Article (emphasis added). The corresponding COBR section is phrased identically, except that the words \"only\" and \"personally\" are omitted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 10-910(b)(6). This exclusion, BCDC contends, is \"consequential\" because it demonstrates the legislature's \"rejection of LEOBR's strict, restrictive language.\" BCDC concludes that, unlike the LEOBR, the COBR does not mandate strict compliance with the penalty-increase process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   We agree with Foy. The canons of statutory construction lead to the same result under both statutes: the appointing authority must satisfy all the procedural steps before issuing a penalty increase.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The omission in \u00a7 10-910(b)(6) of the word \"personally\" is insignificant. The statute provides that only the appointing authority has the power to increase a correctional officer's penalty, \u00a7 10-910(b)(2), and only the Commissioner of the Division of Pretrial Detention Services is designated as the appointing authority for BCDC, \u00a7 5-202(c)(4). Because there is only one Commissioner, it follows that only he or she can \"personally\" increase a penalty under the COBR. \u00a7 5-202(a) (stating that the \"Secretary shall appoint\n   <em>\n    a\n   </em>\n   Commissioner of Pretrial Detention Services\") (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   We are similarly unconvinced that exclusion of the word \"only\" has any significance. What matters in statutory construction is not the uniformity of similarly-worded statutes, but rather the plain language of the statute before us.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fisher\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3707226\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/425/699/#p706\">\n    425 Md. at 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3707257,3707226\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/43/338/\">\n    43 A.3d 338\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

First, the legislature's use of the word \"if\" restricts the Commissioner's ability to issue a penalty increase until certain conditions have occurred.\n   <em>\n    See If\n   </em>\n   , OXFORD ENGLISH DICTIONARY ,\n   <em>\n    http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/91152\n   </em>\n   [https://perma.cc/7LWU-7KLT] (last visited Nov. 19, 2018) (defining \"if\" as \"[i]ntroducing a clause of condition\"). Second, that restriction is followed by a colon, which introduces a list, meaning the list specifies the preconditions for increasing a penalty.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   THE CHICAGO MANUAL OF STYLE \u00b6 6.63 (15th ed. 2003). Finally, that list is connected by an \"and,\" signifying that the Commissioner must satisfy each item in the list to issue a penalty increase.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MARYLAND STYLE MANUAL FOR STATUTORY LAW , Department of Legislative Services (July 2008) at 19.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The items in the list therefore together constitute a condition precedent for increasing the hearing board's recommended penalty, and only when that condition precedent is satisfied, does the Commissioner possess the authority to increase the penalty.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fraternal Order of Police, Montgomery Cty.

Relationship Between the Obligatory Penalty-Increase Process and the Thirty-Day Deadline\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   BCDC and Foy additionally dispute whether the thirty-day deadline and the penalty-increase process are interrelated. BCDC asserts that the thirty-day limit for issuing a final order and the penalty-increase process are separate and should not be read together as requiring the Commissioner to complete the penalty-increase process within thirty days. To support this claim, BCDC notes that \"[t]he 30-day limit appears\n   in a separate subparagraph ... \u00a7 10-910(b)(1), which precedes the penalty-increase process and pertains exclusively to the issuance of the final [order].\" The relevant subsection, \u00a7 10-910(b)(6), pertaining to penalty increases does not include any time constraints for completing that process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Foy counters that all aspects of the penalty-increase process must be satisfied within thirty days. Foy directs us to the statute's structure. He notes that \u00a7 10-910(b) specifies what the appointing authority must do before issuing a final order, which includes satisfying the penalty-increase prerequisites, if the Commissioner elects to increase the hearing board's recommend penalty. It would be peculiar, Foy claims, to read these provisions separately, as it would result in the Commissioner issuing a final order that he can then change, at his discretion, through the penalty-increase process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   We again agree with Foy. When reading the COBR, the story it seeks to tell speaks for itself. Its sections flow naturally together. There is no disconnect. Interpreting it requires nothing more than a careful reading.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   These principles run true for the sections at issue here. They cannot be read in isolation; they must be read together as part of the overall process for issuing a final order.\n   <em>\n    Emps.' Ret. Sys. v.

The subsection starts by prescribing the timeline, thirty days, \u00a7 10-910(b)(1)(ii), and then proceeds to outline what the Commissioner can or must do within that timeframe. For example, before issuing a final order, the Commissioner must review the hearing board's report, \u00a7 10-910(b)(1)(i); consider the officer's past job performance, \u00a7 10-910(b)(4); and, if the Commissioner seeks to terminate an officer or otherwise increase the penalty recommended by the hearing board, obtain approval from the Secretary, \u00a7 10-910(b)(5)-(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Section 10-910(b)(6) fits naturally within this scheme.

Logically, then, the procedural prerequisites prescribed therein must occur within thirty days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The legislative history of the COBR further illustrates that the General Assembly intended for the thirty-day deadline to apply to the penalty-increase process.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Morris v.

These changes-allowing thirty days for a final order to be issued, not five, and including a penalty-increase process in the same section that lists all the tasks the appointing authority must complete before issuing a final order-demonstrate that the legislature intended to give the appointing authority time to contemplate the proper sanction, including whether an increase was warranted, although such time was not to exceed thirty days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   We hold, based on the plain language of the COBR and the supporting legislative history, that upon receipt of the hearing board's recommendations, the appointing authority has thirty days to render a final disciplinary decision. \u00a7 10-910(b)(1)(ii).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   In rendering that decision, the appointing authority has discretion to adopt the hearing board's penalty recommendations or to deviate from them. \u00a7 10-910(b)(3).

All of those procedures must be completed within thirty days. Had the General Assembly sought to extend the timeline for issuing a final order when the Commissioner invokes his or her penalty-enhancement authority, it would have included such an exception in the statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gomez v.

BCDC further contends that the malfunction of the recording equipment is inconsequential because the COBR does not require the penalty-increase meeting to be audio recorded.

In the absence of any indication to the contrary, we are satisfied that Commissioner Wolfe reasonably believed, especially given the lack of a clear definition for \"on the record,\" that his memorandum satisfied \u00a7 10-910(b)(6)(ii) and, accordingly, he did not seek a waiver.

On the contrary, the statute's purpose makes clear that the appointing authority must protect the due process rights of a charged correctional officer by adhering to all the enumerated procedures. Nor should this case be construed by the appointing authority as license to disregard intentionally one or more of the required procedures, as doing so\n   <em>\n    could be\n   </em>\n   grounds for precluding a remand to cure a defect outside the thirty-day timeframe, but that is not before us in this case. Here, we hold, based on the record before us, that the proper remedy for the unforeseen technological glitch, which occurred at the initial penalty-increase meeting and resulted in no prejudice to Foy, is that the parties must reconvene for another meeting to be held on the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED, WITH THE INSTRUCTION THAT THE JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY BE AFFIRMED.
