L.H. presents two issues for this Court's review: (1) whether DHS erred by denying\n   <em>\n    nunc pro tunc\n   </em>\n   relief; and (2) whether using the mailbox rule violated L.H.'s statutory and due process rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On April 13, 2016, Beaver County Children and Youth Services (CYS) filed a\n   Child Protective Services Investigation Report (CY-48) naming L.H. as a perpetrator in an indicated report of child abuse. CYS identified the subject child as E.K., and stated the report was being indicated for sexual abuse. On April 13, 2016, CYS sent L.H. a letter notifying him it had concluded its investigation of the report of sexual abuse of E.K. and determined the report to be indicated (April 13, 2016 Letter). The April 13, 2016 Letter was sent to L.H. On April 14, 2016, ChildLine and Abuse Registry (ChildLine)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   allegedly mailed L.H. a letter notifying him that he is listed on the statewide central register of child abuse as a perpetrator in an indicated report of child abuse against E.K. (E.K. Notice).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The E.K. Notice advised L.H. of his right to request that the indicated report be amended or destroyed, and instructed L.H. that the request must be made within 90 days of the E.K. Notice date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On March 9, 2017, L.H. appealed from the E.K. Notice. L.H.'s appeal was postmarked 314 days after the E.K. Notice was purportedly mailed. On May 4, 2017, ChildLine issued a letter notifying L.H. that it had received his appeal, but could not review it because the appeal was not received within 90 days of the E.K. Notice mailing date. The May 4, 2017 letter notified L.H. that if he believed the appeal should be considered even though it was not received within the time required by law, L.H. must request that the BHA review the indicated finding of child abuse, and the request must be received within 90 days of the date of the May 4, 2017 letter. On August 2, 2017, L.H. filed a response to the May 4, 2017 letter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   An ALJ held a hearing on September 7, 2017 to address whether L.H.'s appeal was timely filed and, if not, whether sufficient grounds exist to allow the appeal to proceed\n   <em>\n    nunc pro tunc.\n   </em>\n   On September 14, 2017, the ALJ recommended that L.H.'s appeal be dismissed as untimely. On September 20, 2017, the BHA adopted the ALJ's recommendation. L.H. filed a Motion for Reconsideration (Motion) which DHS received on October 6, 2017. On October 12, 2017, notwithstanding that the Motion was untimely filed, having been received one day late,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   DHS granted the Motion. On February 26, 2018, DHS upheld the BHA's September 20, 2017 order. On March 28, 2018, L.H. appealed to this Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   At the outset, because the Motion was untimely filed, DHS was without jurisdiction to grant the Motion.\n   <em>\n    Ciavarra v. Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7333685\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/970/500/#p503\">\n    970 A.2d 500\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 503 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2009) (\"[T]he fifteen-day period is mandatory and [ ] the failure to request reconsideration within that period deprives an agency of jurisdiction to consider the request.\"). Further, because DHS did not have jurisdiction to grant the Motion, its order upholding the BHA's September 20, 2017 order is null and void.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7333685\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/970/500/#p503\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Consequently, L.H. had 30 days to appeal from the BHA's September 20, 2017 order, rather than DHS' February 26, 2018 order. However, because DHS granted the Motion before the 30-day appeal period expired, L.H. reasonably could have believed that no appeal from the September 20, 2017 order was necessary. Thus, L.H.'s failure to timely appeal was caused by an administrative breakdown,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , DHS' inadvertent granting of the Motion. Accordingly, this Court will treat L.H.'s instant appeal as a petition for leave to appeal\n   <em>\n    nunc pro tunc\n   </em>\n   from the September 20, 2017 order and grant the petition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    H.D. v.

Notice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Initially, Section 6341(a)(2) of the Child Protective Services Law (CPSL) provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Any person named as a perpetrator ... in an indicated report of child abuse may, within 90 days of being notified of the status of the report, request an administrative review by, or appeal and request a hearing before, the secretary to amend or expunge an indicated report on the grounds that it is inaccurate or it is being maintained in a manner inconsistent with this chapter. The request shall be in writing in a manner prescribed by [DHS].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   23 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6341(a)(2). It is undisputed that L.H. did not appeal from the indicated report within 90 days. Thus, the appeal was untimely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \"An appeal\n   <em>\n    nunc pro tunc\n   </em>\n   may be allowed where the delay in filing the appeal was caused by extraordinary circumstances involving fraud or some breakdown in the administrative process, or non-negligent circumstances related to the appellant, his or her counsel or a third party.\"\n   <em>\n    H.D.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11514720\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/751/1216/#p1219\">\n    751 A.2d at 1219\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (italics added). L.H. contends that there was an administrative breakdown because he never received the E.K. Notice. DHS rejoins that, under the mailbox rule, there is a presumption that L.H. received the E.K. Notice. Specifically, \"[u]nder the mailbox rule, evidence that a letter was mailed ordinarily will be sufficient to permit a fact-finder to find that the letter was, in fact, received by the party to whom it was addressed.\"\n   <em>\n    Douglas v.

To that end, [C]ounsel argued that [L.H.] received three notices of another indicated report of child abuse [ (S.H.

A review of the record reveals that DHS did not present any evidence that the E.K.

Notice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.R. at 3a-7a. It is uncontested that L.H. appealed from the S.H. Notice upon receipt. L.H. offered the S.H. Notice into evidence for the inference that if he had received the E.K. Notice, he would have appealed therefrom as well. Thus, L.H. maintains that he did not assert a mere denial of receipt but, rather, he presented circumstantial evidence that he did not receive the E.K. Notice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   By way of background, as set forth in the September 7, 2017 hearing transcript submitted by DHS as part of its Supplemental Reproduced Record (S.R.R.),\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   S.R.R. at 30b-37b, L.H. has cognitive difficulties, thus L.H.'s mother (Mother) is the person who contacted Counsel for purposes of the appeals. L.H.'s Counsel revealed that he was alerted of the E.K. Notice during the week of February 12, 2017, when he reviewed the transcript with Mother in the S.H appeal. Apparently, the transcript was redacted in connection with any material related to E.K. Counsel asked Mother about the redactions and she reported that there was a second accusation by E.K. When Counsel inquired whether Mother had received any documentation pertaining to the second matter, Mother described an April 13, 2016 Letter,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   R.R. at 11a, stating it was an indicated report but they never received an official appealable notice. At some point thereafter, Mother read the April 13, 2016 Letter to Counsel over the phone. On March 9, 2017, Counsel filed the instant appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Notwithstanding, the ALJ did \"not find there is sufficient evidence to show there was a breakdown in the administrative process in this case\" because \"pursuant to the mailbox rule, it is presumed that [L.H.] received the [E.K.

As there was no\n   evidence of mailing, no presumption of receipt was created and, thus, \"the adjudication [to the contrary was not] supported by substantial evidence, ... [and] the decision [was not] in accordance with the applicable law[.]\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Support Ctr. for Child Advocates v.

Here, [DHS] sent a letter to [L.H.] on April 13, 2016 informing [L.H.] that they have concluded their investigation of a report of sexual abuse involving E.K., and they determined the report to be indicated [ (April 13, 2016 Letter) ]. While the letter does not provide a report number, the letter identifies the subject child as E.K. and states that it involves a report of sexual abuse. Likewise, the [April 13, 2016 Letter] identified E.K. as the subject child, and the report was indicated for sexual abuse. Additionally, the April 13, 2016 [L]etter was sent the same day as [DHS] filed the above-captioned indicated report of child abuse. Thus, if [L.H.] actually did not receive the [E.K. N]otice, I find that [L.H.] was aware of the above-captioned indicated report of child abuse since April 2016, but [L.H.] did not file an appeal until almost a year later on March 9, 2017. Therefore, I do not find [L.H.] acted within a short time of having an opportunity to address the untimeliness.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   R.R. at 19a. However, a review of the April 13, 2016 Letter (which L.H. offered at the hearing and was accepted into evidence), and the S.H.
