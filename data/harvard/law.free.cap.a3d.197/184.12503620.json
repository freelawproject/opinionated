The parties submitted a stipulation of dismissal on November 5, 2018, in accordance with\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   2:8-2, advising that they have settled the matter. The Court determined on November 5, 2018, to accept the stipulation for filing, to dismiss the appeal, and to issue this order memorializing the dismissal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   I dissent because the issue raised is one of paramount public importance and because the failure to address it now will have grave social consequences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   In this case, a distracted health club trainer negligently dropped a dumbbell on the head of Maria Pulice, a patron he was instructing, causing serious and permanent injuries. If you thought that the innocent victim of the health club's negligence had a right to recover for her injuries, you would be mistaken. The victim in this case, Ms. Pulice, is without a remedy on her negligence claim because the health club, Eclipse Fitness, required her to sign an exculpatory clause as a condition of membership admission, immunizing the health club from its own negligence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The exculpatory clause signed by Ms. Pulice is part of a standard-form contract in the health club industry. Such contracts are called contracts of adhesion because they are offered on a take-it-or-leave it basis, because the public has no bargaining power to alter the contract's terms, and because the price of admission to a health club is to surrender one's right to insist that the club provide a safe environment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The trial court dismissed Ms. Pulice's negligence action, and the Appellate Division affirmed because of\n   <em>\n    Stelluti v.

In\n   <em>\n    Stelluti\n   </em>\n   , this Court upheld a similar contract of adhesion with a similar exculpatory clause that permitted a health club to operate negligently, and through its negligence to maim or kill its patrons without consequence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4146542\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/203/286/\">\n     ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In that case, Gina Stelluti signed an exculpatory clause on the day she joined a fitness club and immediately went to a spin class.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4146542\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/203/286/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4146542\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/203/286/\">\n    at 293-94\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4146542\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/203/286/\">\n    1 A.3d 678\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
