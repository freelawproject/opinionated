The defendant also appeals from the judgment revoking his probation after the trial court found him to be in violation of his probation in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-32. On appeal, the defendant\n   claims that (1) he was denied his right to due process and trial by a fair and impartial jury when the court denied his request for a mistrial after a bullet hole was discovered in the jury room during deliberations, and (2) the trial court abused its discretion in concluding that drive test survey data is admissible under the test for admissibility of scientific evidence set forth in\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Porter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"72601\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/241/57/\">\n    241 Conn. 57\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=698%20A.2d%20739\">\n    698 A.2d 739\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1997), cert. denied,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11526881,11527011,11527046,11526795,11526930,11527155,11526835,11526966,11527099\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/523/1058/\">\n    523 U.S. 1058\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=118%20S.%20Ct.%201384\">\n    118 S.Ct. 1384\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=140%20L.%20Ed.%202d%20645\">\n    140 L.Ed.2d 645\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1998). We affirm the judgments of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. At the defendant's request, Jesus Gonzalez contacted the victim, Ernesto Reyes-Santos, on April 7 or 8, 2014, to ask him to bring heroin from New York to Bridgeport. Gonzalez knew the victim through their heroin sales together. The victim would supply Gonzalez with heroin, and Gonzalez would bring customers to the victim. Gonzalez had also known the defendant for a long time, and the defendant became involved with Gonzalez and the victim's heroin business. The defendant told an acquaintance, Valerie Gomez-Delavega, with whom he socialized daily, that Gonzalez had someone coming from New York with drugs that the defendant needed her to try. He also told her that they were going to rob the person from New York and that they would have to kill him so that no one would retaliate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On April 9, 2014, Gonzalez agreed to meet the victim in Bridgeport on Davis Avenue, near where Gonzalez lived. Gonzalez drove his white Jeep Cherokee to the meeting spot at about 9 p.m., and the defendant walked from around the corner and got into the Jeep's front passenger seat. The victim arrived and got into the Jeep's backseat, sitting behind the passenger seat. The victim then \"had words with the defendant.\" The defendant wanted to bring the heroin somewhere to have someone try it. The victim refused and exited the Jeep.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The defendant also exited the Jeep and shot the victim, who later died of the gunshot wound at a hospital.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Gonzalez then drove home and, at 9:24 p.m., called the defendant, who came to\n   Gonzalez' house. When he arrived, the defendant pointed a gun at Gonzalez and said that if Gonzalez told anyone what happened he would kill him. The defendant also took Gonzalez' cell phone. The day after the victim was shot, the defendant asked Gomez-Delavega whether she had heard about the killing. He told her that they robbed the victim and that he had shot and killed him. The defendant said that he pulled the trigger and shot the victim as the victim reached for the gun, and that the victim fell out of the Jeep.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   A couple of days later, the defendant told Gonzalez to get rid of the Jeep and said that he would pay Gonzalez for it. Gonzalez parked it somewhere with the key in it and never saw it again. When Gonzalez asked the defendant why he did it, the defendant responded that \"he was mad.\" Gonzalez told his girlfriend, Latasha Vieira, that the Jeep had been stolen, and Vieira reported it stolen to the police on May 8, 2014. Sometime after that date, the defendant went to the Walmart pharmacy where Vieira worked to find out whether Gonzalez had told her anything, and he asked her to leave with him after work. Vieira said no, and the defendant grabbed her as she walked away. She pushed him back and told him to leave and not come back.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The defendant was arrested on July 14, 2014.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thereafter, the defendant was tried before a jury and found\n   guilty of murder, conspiracy to commit a violation of the dependency-producing drug laws, and carrying a pistol without a permit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court sentenced the defendant to a total effective term of fifty-two and one-half years of incarceration, followed by seven and one-half years of special parole. This appeal followed. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The defendant first claims that he was denied his right to a fair trial by an impartial jury after his motion for a mistrial was denied. Specifically, he claims that jurors, during deliberations, \"discovered bullet holes in the jury room\" and that \"there was no conceivable cure for the potential bias that may have developed in jurors' minds as a result of this interference into the required solemnity of the trial process.\" The state responds that \"the jurors were not in the deliberation room when the hole was created, and ... there was no evidence that the incident was related to this case. Moreover, the trial court's thorough canvass of the jurors confirmed that they could continue deliberations without any prejudice to the defendant.\" Accordingly, the state argues that the court acted within its discretion in denying the motion for a mistrial. We agree with the state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The following additional facts and procedural history are relevant to the defendant's claim. On the afternoon of January 28, 2016, the jury's second day of deliberations, the jury delivered a note to the court requesting to go home for the day. The court agreed to release the jury for the day, and when the jury entered the courtroom, the court released the jury for the evening. At that time, the court asked: \"Is there a question?\" One of the jurors responded, stating: \"There's a bullet\n   hole in our window and the ceiling, and it's\n   really disconcerting, and it wasn't there yesterday.\" The court responded: \"All right. So, the maintenance has been notified. I know that you had asked to see a marshal, and maintenance has been notified. They're going to check it out. I'll give you an update tomorrow when we figure out exactly what it is, okay?\" After the jurors were released for the day and exited the courtroom, the court addressed counsel: \"Nobody has seen it yet. We'll have maintenance take a look. I'm not saying that it's a bullet hole; I don't know what it is, but let's have somebody look at it and then we'll give them an update. They're obviously concerned about it; they've mentioned it to the marshals; they've mentioned it here. The only question is whether we use a different room, then, for purposes of deliberation. If it's bothering them, I certainly don't want to distract them or-the word disconcerting, you know, you just don't want that. But I think it might make them feel better if we at least tell them what it is, one way or the other; so, we'll address that tomorrow, okay?\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The next morning, defense counsel made an oral motion for a mistrial pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 42-43. He argued, in part: \"The Practice Book says that upon motion of a defendant, the judicial authority may declare a mistrial at any time during the trial if there occurs during the trial an error or legal defect in the proceedings, or any conduct inside or outside the courtroom which results in substantial and irreparable prejudice to the defendant's case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \"And it's very concerning that this incident could cause irreparable damage. The jurors have not been interviewed yet, and I don't think we're going to interview them one by one, but there has to be a natural concern here that a young man was on trial for a shooting death is now being-his guilt or innocence is going\n   to be determined by a group of twelve that believed possibly that someone is firing a gun into the jury room.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The state opposed the motion, arguing that there was no connection between the bullet hole incident and the case before the jury. It further contended that any potential prejudice could be avoided by an instruction to the jury that it should not hold the incident against the defendant and should decide the case only on the basis of what it heard in court. In its ruling, the court stated: \"I am going to deny the motion as it stands right now. We haven't inquired of the jury. The jurors brought it to our attention, and we addressed it immediately. I'm going to give them an instruction now. I'm going to inquire in terms of whether they're able to follow that instruction. I think that perhaps based on their response to that, that may warrant further discussion on this motion. But right now, on the four corners of the evidence that we have, the motion is denied. Now, I do want to put some things on the record in terms of how this occurred and the surrounding circumstances. But I think that perhaps first we'll address the jury and then just so that the record's very clear, let's put some things on the record so it's there for any further review, okay?\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   After the jury entered the courtroom, the court gave the following instruction: \"So, in response to where we ended yesterday, I obviously was concerned with what you had brought to my attention. We brought that to the attention of the police department, both the local and the state police. It is being reviewed and investigated by them right now, which is one of the main reasons that we are not in that courtroom right now. We also obviously don't want that to be a distraction to you at all. It is, as I said, being reviewed, and they\n   will look into that fully, and I appreciate your bringing that to our attention.\n   \"Now, in terms of this case itself, I'm giving you this instruction. The fact that obviously you brought this issue to our attention, and that it is being reviewed and investigated right now, is completely and totally unrelated to the case at hand, all right? There is zero suggestion that it relates to this case, and it is certainly not part of the evidence in this case. So, I am instructing you that you must keep that out of your mind as you're deliberating.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \"The defendant is entitled to his presumption of innocence and to the fact that you can impartially look at and review all of the evidence that has been presented in this case. That also means that you may infer no negative inference upon the defendant in any way in relation to this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \"The deliberation process must continue based only on the evidence that was presented here in this courtroom while the court was in session. And you must not concern yourself with this issue at all in your deliberations. So, having said that, I'm going to ask all members of the jury to go back and report to me whether or not, and you don't have to do this individually, this can be done as a whole, whether or not you feel that you could follow that instruction; whether you could at this point continue to deliberate on this matter based only on the evidence presented in this courtroom while the court was in session, and not concern yourself in any manner whatsoever with this other issue and not hold it in any way against the defendant, all right? So, I'm going to ask that you all retire and write that in a note to me if you could. Thank you.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   After the jury exited, the court inquired of counsel whether there was \"[a]nything else that you'd like me to indicate to them ....\" Both counsel responded in the negative, and defense counsel replied: \"I think you\n   covered it.\" The court followed up with defense counsel, remarking: \"I know it's your motion right now. If there's a specific inquiry that you think I didn't make, then obviously you could let me know.\" Defense counsel responded: \"No, I think what you did is sufficient because the ultimate question at this moment in time is whether they can continue to serve and follow the court's instructions, and disregard yesterday's incident. That is the ultimate question. So, I think what you did is sufficient.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The court then placed the following on the record: \"So, one thing I wanted to address was really just the sequence of events that the jury brought to the court's attention at the end of the day; the fact that they believed that there was in fact a bullet hole through the window; that I asked counsel to remain present so that we could all see it for ourselves. We all did, I think both state's attorneys, defense, myself, went back into the jury room. We went back into the jury room, and I wanted to make this clear for the record. After the clerk had gone in and taken out all of the exhibits, had taken out the notebooks, and had been able to secure what was a chalkboard in a situation where nobody could view or see the chalkboard. Ultimately, that chalkboard had to be transported down to this jury room, and what the clerks did was, they put large paper that was secured and taped around both sides of the chalkboard, and it was transported in that fashion. I certainly did not see anything, counsel did not see anything, and all of the evidence remains secure and away from anybody's ability to review it.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   At this point, the jury delivered a note, which the court read aloud and marked as the court's exhibit seven. The note, signed by the foreperson, stated: \"We are fine with continuing our deliberations without any\n   prejudice.\" The court then indicated\n   that it would continue making a record of the incident before hearing any further argument from counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The court continued: \"So, the marshals were there for the viewing. At that point, we called in the state police, as they do have jurisdiction. As circumstance had it, the Bridgeport police crime scene unit came in to have a warrant signed, and they were able to inquire as to whether there had been any reports of shots fired or any complaints that had occurred last night or in the immediate vicinity to the trial. And they had indicated that they did not, and so the state police took over the investigation and they continued to do that throughout the night. It is my understanding that they are in the courtroom now. I believe the major crime squad is here. They have blocked off the courtroom so that they can try to secure the evidence and complete the investigation. I know that we have additional presence in the building today in terms of just making sure that security is okay as they continue this investigation. There is an article that apparently just hit the [news]papers relating to this incident.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The court then discussed with counsel the newspaper articles describing the incident, and the court indicated that the jury would be instructed that it may not review any media reports. The court further noted that the articles had been released after the jurors had reported for the day, and thus, they would not have seen them. After agreeing with the court that the record should reflect that \"it would likely be impossible for the jurors to see\" a particular article that included the defendant's name, defense counsel stated: \"Other than that, I don't have anything else that needs to be added. I think the court covered it well, and your review is accurate.\" The jury continued its deliberations until it returned with a question regarding proximate cause. The court further instructed the jury regarding proximate cause, and the\n   jury recommenced deliberations. That afternoon, January 29, 2016, the jury returned its verdict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On February 1, 2016, the defendant filed a motion for a new trial, arguing in part that the court had improperly denied his motion for a mistrial because the bullet hole incident had resulted in \"substantial and irreparable prejudice to the defendant's case.\" During oral argument on the motion for a new trial, defense counsel represented that he became aware that the jurors had tried to determine the direction from which the bullet may have been shot and that the jurors had requested a state trooper escort to their cars after returning their verdict. The state responded by repeating that the jury was not in the room when the bullet was fired, and that the jury \"satisfying an itch of curiosity\" in looking at the building could not \"fairly be said to have affected the determination on the verdict in this case.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The court addressed defense counsel's argument by remarking that no one knew when the \"small hole\" discovered by the jurors\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   was made, but that \"there was no suggestion\" that it was made while the court was in session or while the jurors were there. The court further stated that once it was brought to the court's attention, the jurors were released for the day and that they returned to deliberations the next day in a different room. The court had inquired of the jury and instructed it that \"the hole, whatever it turned out to be, had no bearing upon this case or upon\n   the defendant, [and] that they cannot consider it for purposes of their deliberations.\" The court stated that it had asked the jury to \"go back and, in fact, deliberate, so to speak, as to whether they could continue to deliberate without any prejudice to the defendant and with incorporating the\n   court's instructions that that bullet hole had-if, in fact, it is a bullet hole-but that hole that was found had nothing to do with this case or with the defendant or with anybody associated with the defendant.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The court continued: \"The jurors did come out and provided a note to the court in which they not only indicated that, yes, they could continue to deliberate, but, just to make it clear that they fully understood the instructions, said that they could continue-that they understood the court's instructions and could continue to deliberate. And they used ... the word, to my memory right now, without any prejudice to the defendant. So, you know, that-that certainly, one, shows that-that they could follow the court's instructions and, two, that they understood that it could not have any bearing against the defendant in terms of their deliberations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \"I will also indicate that the jurors had deliberated for a period of time. So, it's not as if they just came in and they were only deliberating for forty-five minutes. They, in fact, had asked for some playback, they received that playback both the day before and on the day in question. So, there was more to their deliberations than just that one moment in time certainly. That, additionally, with regard to whether or not the jurors had-had gone out to see the-the window from the outside of the courthouse, I agree with the state that there's no suggestion that-that there's any misconduct involved. They certainly didn't go and do any investigation with regard to an issue that they needed to deliberate on. I'm going to say this because I'm not sure that it-that this is clear for the record, that where the jurors park in Bridgeport requires them to walk outside by the area where you would see the window that is in question here. So, again, I don't think that there's anything on the record to suggest that the jurors said, let's go meet and look at the window, but that the record would be that they, in fact, need to walk by it in order\n   to get to their cars. So, whether or not they were looking at the window in conjunction with walking to their car, you know, I-I can't speak to that. But I just want it clear for the record that that's the way that they would need to go.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \"And in terms of requesting the escort to their cars, I think we all know, from having done cases and certainly on some of the more serious cases, that after the verdicts are rendered, sometimes the juries do not appreciate having to walk on their own outside where there is some attention, both by way of media or family. And so that request was-was certainly agreed to and accommodated. But again, in no way was there ever a suggestion by any party or any side that there was any misconduct or any concern that related to that specific bullet hole if, in fact, it is a bullet hole. So, with that factual understanding on the record for any appellate purposes, I am denying the motion for a new trial.\" The state also placed on the record that the layout of the courthouse required the jurors to use the public entrances and corridors, a fact with which the court agreed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   We begin with our standard of review. \"In our review of the denial of a motion for mistrial, we have recognized the broad discretion that is vested in the trial court to decide whether an occurrence at trial has so prejudiced a party that he or she can no longer receive a fair trial. The decision of the trial court is therefore reversible on appeal only if there has been\n   an abuse of discretion.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Berrios\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=320%20Conn.%20265\">\n    320 Conn. 265\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 274,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=129%20A.3d%20696\">\n    129 A.3d 696\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \"[J]ury impartiality is a core requirement of the right to trial by jury guaranteed by the constitution of Connecticut, article first, \u00a7 8, and by the sixth amendment to the United States constitution....

We conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The following additional facts and procedural history are relevant to the defendant's claim. On January 18,\n   2016, the state disclosed that it intended to proffer the expert testimony of Special Agent James J. Wines of the New Haven bureau of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) regarding cell site location information and drive test survey data. The next day, the defendant filed a motion to preclude Wines' testimony and a request for a\n   <em>\n    Porter\n   </em>\n   hearing as to Wines' testimony regarding the drive test survey data, arguing that such testimony was neither generally accepted nor relevant to the case. Specifically, the defendant argued that the drive test was not conducted until December, 2015, approximately twenty months following the shooting in April, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The court held a hearing outside of the presence of the jury on January 25, 2016. Defense counsel represented at the outset that the defendant was not challenging the use of cell site technology evidence. Rather, the motion solely challenged the drive test survey data. The court granted the defendant's request for a\n   <em>\n    Porter\n   </em>\n   hearing, and the state proffered Wines' testimony. Wines, a member of the FBI's cellular analysis survey team (CAST), explained the drive test he conducted. After placing a scanner in his car, Wines conducted the test by driving around the Black Rock\n   area where the crime occurred and surrounding areas while the tool is \"scanning the environment and taking measurements of all of the signals from the different cell phone towers that it sees as it's driving around.\" The measurements were then \"plotted using a mapping software program to give the actual coverage area of a particular tower.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Wines testified that he believed a drive test would produce \"an accurate representation of the coverage area of the particular sectors\" in which he was interested because \"the towers, the sectors, the orientation technology and the azimuths of the particular towers ... had not changed from April of 2014 until December of 2015.\" Using one Sprint tower as an example, he testified that \"the tower itself was the same, the sectors were the same, and the azimuths were the same, and the technology was the same. So, based upon that and based upon my training and experience, I would expect that the ... radio frequency [RF] footprint of that particular tower or that particular sector would be the same in December of 2015 as it was in April of 2014.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   For purposes of the hearing only, the state marked an exhibit containing seven slides that Wines prepared depicting the drive test survey data. The slides illustrated the dominant and possible coverage areas for one Sprint cell sector, one AT &amp; T cell sector, and one T-Mobile cell sector. The first slide showed the dominant and possible coverage area of Sprint tower 533, sector 3, azimuth 205. Wines testified that a handset making a call registering on that sector likely would be in the dominant coverage area, which has the \"strongest clearest signal ....\" Within the possible coverage area, Wines stated that \"there are other towers and sectors which would have dominant coverage,\" which creates \"an overlap area.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Wines testified that the cell phone industry routinely relies on drive test analysis, conducted in the same manner that he conducted his drive test, to \"design, maintain and optimize their network so that they can provide the best coverage to their customers.\" He stated that drive test analysis was not developed solely for\n   purposes of litigation but rather for carriers to optimize and maintain their cell networks. He testified: \"[T]he cell phone industry is a multibillion-dollar industry, and there's a lot of competition between carriers. So, for example, if I had a Sprint phone and I kept dropping calls when I moved from one area to another, I would likely port my number over to another carrier, say, Verizon or T-Mobile, with the expectation I would get better cell phone coverage. So, the carriers don't want to lose customers. They don't want to lose their revenue stream, so they spend a considerable amount of time, effort, and resources to optimize their networks to provide the best coverage possible.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   On cross-examination, Wines testified that although he was not aware of any scientific publications or scholarly articles addressing drive test analysis, he was aware that \"radio frequency theory has been in existence for 150 years; cell phones\n   have been [in] existence ... since the 1980s, and the way that cell phones communicate with towers has been generally accepted. All the drive test is, is a measurement of signal and plotting that signal on a map. I don't know of a scientific review; it's simply a collection or measurement of signal and then plotting that signal on a map.\" He further testified that \"on a daily basis around the country, myself and other members of my team use drive test data ... to locate fugitives, recover evidence, find victims; it works in a real world setting on a daily basis.\" In response to questioning regarding a rate of error, Wines stated: \"I don't know about a rate of error, but in my own personal experience the handset has never not been where the record said it would be.\" With respect to the factors affecting whether a cell phone would connect with the closest tower, Wines testified that although topography could be a factor, \"in this particular case there's a clear line of sight from the tower to the location where the incident occurred, so topography would not be an issue\n   in this particular case.\" Wines stated that \"day-to-day weather has negligible effect on cell service,\" but that a \"catastrophic weather event\" that physically damaged the tower could play a role. He further testified that call overload to a tower would not send a handset to a different tower-if the tower was at capacity, the call would not go through.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Wines testified that he would not have conducted a drive test analysis in this case if something was different as to a tower.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Regarding signal strength between April, 2014, and December, 2015, Wines testified: \"I could not say that they are exactly the same, but I would expect them to be very similar.\" Wines testified that he reviews the status of the towers through lists provided by the carriers, and that although he did not specifically know whether any improvements were made to the equipment, some of the technology from the Sprint and AT &amp; T towers were 2G and 3G, and that is \"not a technology that undergoes a lot of change because it's an older technology.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The court issued an oral ruling, finding that Wines' drive test analysis satisfied the first prong of\n   <em>\n    Porter\n   </em>\n   , in that it was \"a procedure rooted in science,\" and was \"supported and followed by police, law enforcement, FBI as well as the phone companies ....\" It further found that \"it has been used for many years in a whole variety of means and methods,\" and that it was \"not based on any subjective or speculative analysis.\" Turning to the second prong, the court found, for purposes of the initial inquiry, that the proffered evidence was relevant. The court noted: \"I am not saying that everything that was addressed here or that the state indicated\n   that they intended to question this witness on are necessarily permissible. I think we have to see what is objected to and what's not objected to.\" The court further found that \"the issues of its effectiveness or its reliability go more to weight than it does to admissibility; but again, anytime that the defense deems it appropriate with regard to each individual question, they should in fact object if they think that the evidence is not properly admissible.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Following the court's ruling, the jury returned to the courtroom, and the state began its direct examination of Wines. Wines testified as to the historical cell site analysis and drive test he conducted. The state introduced a PowerPoint presentation created by Wines, which depicted the\n   cell site analysis and drive test survey data.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defense counsel did not object to the introduction of the presentation, nor did he object to any of the state's questions to Wines.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   According to the defendant, Wines \"claimed to be able to eliminate the possibility that the cellular handset associated with the defendant was anywhere other than within the coverage area of a cell tower near the location of the shooting during the relevant time period.\" Through Wines' drive test survey data, the state posits that it was able to show that Gonzalez' phone \"was located somewhere in the coverage area of the BJ's [Wholesale Club] tower just before the shooting and that the crime scene was also in that coverage area.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to the state, \"[t]he drive test results further showed that both [Gonzalez'] and the defendant's phones were located somewhere in the coverage area\n   of the BJ's tower minutes after the shooting, and that the crime scene was also in that coverage area.\" Wines testified that while \"the call detail record reflects which tower the handset selected ... the drive test results reflect the RF footprint of that particular tower and sector, and the handset could not have been anyplace else except within that RF footprint in order to make or receive a call.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Before addressing the merits of the defendant's argument, we begin with the applicable legal principles and standard of review governing our analysis.
