Vol., 2015 Supp.), Family Law Article (FL) \u00a7 5-701.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The underlying facts are not in dispute. In July 2015, I.B. took his children to church, unintentionally leaving his infant daughter in her car seat in the back of the car, on a hot day with the front windows slightly open. Authorities were called, who removed the child from the car. I.B. acknowledged that, while attending to the other children, he had forgotten that his daughter was in the car. The incident was reported to DSS, which initiated an investigation, ultimately making a finding of indicated\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   child neglect.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   I.B. requested a contested case hearing pursuant to FL \u00a7 5-706.1(b)(1), but, as provided by the statute, that proceeding was stayed pending the outcome of the pending criminal case, in which I.B. was charged with neglect of a minor\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and confinement of a minor in an unattended\n   vehicle.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The State\n   <em>\n    nol prossed\n   </em>\n   the child neglect charge and I.B. pleaded guilty to confinement of a minor, a misdemeanor, subjecting the offender to both a monetary fine and imprisonment. He was afforded probation before judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Following disposition of the criminal charges, the stay was lifted in the family law proceeding. DSS moved for summary decision to dismiss the request for hearing based on the finding of guilt in the criminal proceeding, pursuant to FL \u00a7 5-706.1(b)(3)(ii). I.B. opposed the summary decision on the ground that the criminal charge was not similar to the family law neglect offense and that the criminal court did not find him guilty of neglect. The ALJ issued a summary decision granting DSS's motion, relying on the fact that I.B. (1) failed to dispute any evidence that the finding of indicated neglect was based on the same incident as the guilty plea charge,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (2) the provisions of\n   FL \u00a7 5-706.1(b)(3)(ii).\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    ALJ's Findings and Decision\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The ALJ's decision on the motion for summary decision was fully developed and supported in its written decision, but did not detail the sufficiency of the DSS's finding of \"indicated neglect.\" Rather, the ALJ focused on what was undisputed\n   and relevant to the question of whether dismissal of the administrative appeal was appropriate. The ALJ found:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   1. On July 27 [sic], 2015, the Local Department [DSS] received a report of an unattended child found alone within a car at 9:30 a.m. The car with the unattended child inside was parked at [I.B.'s] family church parking lot.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   2.

On August 12, 2015, the Local Department notified [I.B.] that it made a finding of indicated child neglect of the unattended child.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   5. On September 22, 2015, the District Court for Frederick County, Maryland found [I.B.] guilty and convicted him for confining an unattended child, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Md.%20Code%20Ann.%2C%20Family%20Law%20%C2%A7%205-801\">\n    Md.

[I.B.] was sentenced to probation before judgment, with supervised probation ending on September 22, 2016.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Based on those factual findings and the lack of evidence to the contrary, the ALJ determined that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   the undisputed evidence shows that [I.B.] was found guilty of a criminal charge that arose out of the incident of July 26, 2015. The undisputed evidence also shows that the Local Department's finding of indicated neglect was based upon the same incident. Family Law section 5-801 ; Family Law 5-706.1(b)(3)(ii) (2012 Rpl. Vol.). I find, therefore, as a matter of law, that the Local Department's motion for summary decision must be granted.

First, I.B. challenges the sufficiency of the factual record to support the ALJ's grant of the summary decision. Second, he questions whether Maryland law requires a hearing to be held when one of the requisite elements for a finding of abuse or neglect is contested, and when the element in question was not adjudicated in the related criminal proceeding. Finally, I.B. asks this Court to determine whether an implied element of intent or scienter, found by case law in the related child abuse statute of the Family Law Article, exists in the neglect statute of that same article.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   We have recently explained the appropriate standard for reviewing agency decisions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   It is \"[b]ecause an appellate court reviews the agency decision under the same statutory standards as the circuit court,\"\n   <em>\n    Consumer Prot.

Factual Support\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   I.B. first argues that the factual record does not support the ALJ's decision to enter a summary decision to dismiss the appeal. He contends that the exhibits relied upon by DSS to support its motion to dismiss were \"wholly deficient regarding the conviction, and contain inconsistencies and inaccuracies that require a contested hearing[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   DSS responds, first, that I.B.'s dispute of material fact argument was not addressed in his response to the DSS's motion for summary decision, hence, it was not preserved. It avers that the requirements of COMAR 28.02.01.12D, governing motions for summary decision, require a responding party to identify all disputed material facts at issue. Since I.B. failed to identify a dispute of material fact in his response, DSS argues, he has waived the ability to assert it later on judicial review. Alternatively, DSS argues that even had I.B. not waived this argument, the disputed facts he proffers were not material to the ALJ's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The COMAR motion for summary decision provisions are clear that a response to such a motion \"\n   <em>\n    shall\n   </em>\n   identify the material facts that are disputed.\" COMAR 28.02.01.12D(2) (emphasis added). I.B. did not present any dispute of material facts before the ALJ; rather, he focused on how the criminal\n   charge was not based on neglect and did not share the same elements. Judicial review of an agency decision is\n   limited to evidence and issues presented from the record before it.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   Md. Code, State Gov't \u00a7 10-214(a) (providing that, on judicial review \"[f]indings of fact must be based exclusively on the evidence of record in the contested case proceeding and on matters officially noticed in that proceeding\"). Therefore, I.B.'s belated attempt to challenge the previously uncontested facts and evidence presented to the ALJ, for the first time in his petition and memorandum in support of judicial review, is without merit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Allmond v.

In his generic response, without particularity, to the DSS motion to dismiss, I.B. failed to assert the existence of any evidence to controvert that which was presented by DSS and cannot now challenge the sufficiency of the evidence relied on by the ALJ.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    2.
