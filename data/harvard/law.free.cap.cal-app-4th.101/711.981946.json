(Health Net) appeals from the denial of its petition to compel arbitration of the claims of respondent Mount Diablo Medical Center (Mt. Diablo) and to stay the litigation in which Mt. Diablo asserts those claims. The trial court denied the petition under Code of Civil Procedure section 1281.2, subdivision (c) (hereafter section 1281.2(c)), finding that the arbitration would create a risk of rulings that conflict with rulings in pending litigation involving third parties. Health Net contends the clause choosing California law in the contract between the parties does not evince an intention to render their agreement to arbitrate subject to the terms of the California Code of Civil Procedure, so that section 1281.2(c) has been preempted by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 United States Code section 1 et seq. (FAA), and that the federal statute requires that the arbitration agreement be enforced despite the potential for conflicting results. The trial court read the choice-of-law provision more broadly and therefore rejected this contention. We interpret the authorities on the subject to require the court to look first to the language of the contract to determine what portions of state law the parties intended to incorporate, and then, if any ambiguity exists, to determine whether the provision in question conflicts with the objectives of the FAA. Under this approach, we conclude that the parties intended to incorporate California procedural law governing the enforcement of their agreement to arbitrate, and that these provisions are not preempted. Therefore we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">\n<em>Factual and Procedural Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b628-9\">The relevant facts are not controverted. Mt. Diablo is an acute care hospital located in Concord, California. As of June 1, 1995, it entered into a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>\u201cfee-for-service\u201d agreement, entitled the \u201cHealth Net Per Diem Hospital Agreement for Mt. Diablo Medical Center\u201d (Health Net/Mt. Diablo Agreement), with Health Net, a health care service plan,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> under which Health Net agreed to pay Mt. Diablo specified fees for providing health care services to plan members.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As contemplated by the Health Net/Mt. Diablo Agreement, effective January 1, 1998, Health Net entered into a \u201cthird party payor capitation agreement\u201d with Alta Bates Medical Center (Alta Bates) (the Health Net/Alta Bates Agreement), under which Alta Bates agreed to be responsible for providing medical services to Health Net plan members on the basis of capitated or prepaid rates, as distinguished from fee-for-service rates, with the understanding that Alta Bates would subcontract its obligations to individual providers or hospitals such as Mt. Diablo. Alta Bates in turn had a preexisting \u201cHospital Participation Agreement\u201d with Mt. Diablo, under which Mt. Diablo agreed to provide covered services at the capitated rates to Health Net members who selected the Alta Bates network of providers. As of May 1, 1999, Mt. Diablo purported to terminate its Hospital Participation Agreement with Alta Bates.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">The underlying controversy relates to who is responsible and in what amounts for services that Mt. Diablo rendered to Health Net members after the termination of the Hospital Participation Agreement. Mt. Diablo\u2019s complaint asserts several causes of action against Health Net and Alta Bates, and also against East Bay Medical Network (EBMN), which is the processing agent for Alta Bates, and against PacifiCare of California (PacifiCare), another health care service plan with which Mt. Diablo and Alta Bates had contractual arrangements similar to those with Health Net and with which a similar controversy exists. The complaint alleges, among other things, that Health Net breached the Health Net/Mt. Diablo Agreement by failing to pay Mt. Diablo at the fee-for-services rate for hospital services rendered Health Net members between May 1 and December 31, 1999, and it also alleges that Alta Bates and EBMN breached an oral agreement to pay these same amounts to Mt. Diablo. The complaint alleges breach of implied contract, open book account, quantum meruit, and unjust enrichment claims against all of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">The Health Net/Mt. Diablo Agreement contains a broad arbitration agreement, which unquestionably encompasses the present controversy between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>these two parties.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The agreement also contains a separate provision concerning choice of law, which reads in relevant part: \u201cThe validity, construction, interpretation and enforcement of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of California.\u201d The Health Net/Alta Bates Agreement and the Hospital Participation Agreement also contain arbitration provisions, but no party other than Health Net has attempted to resolve any aspect of the present controversy through arbitration, nor has any attempt been made to arbitrate Mt. Diablo\u2019s similar claim against PacifiCare.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">After being served with Mt. Diablo\u2019s complaint, Health Net filed a petition to compel arbitration of the dispute. Mt. Diablo opposed the petition on the ground that its claim against Health Net overlapped its claims against Alta Bates and EBMN, and that the court should exercise its discretion under section 1281.2(c) to refuse to compel arbitration because of the potential for inconsistent rulings if the controversy were adjudicated in multiple forums. Mt. Diablo argued that because its agreement with Health Net provided for the application of California law, section 1281.2(c) rather than the FAA, which gives the court no discretion to deny arbitration on this ground, applies. <em>(Volt Info. Sciences </em>v. <em>Leland Stanford Jr. U. </em>(1989) 489 U.S. 468 [109 S.Ct. 1248, 103 L.Ed.2d 488] <em>(Volt).) </em>The trial court denied the petition on this basis, ruling that \u201c(a) the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>[Volt] </em>is controlling; (b) the parties to the arbitration agreement expressed a clear intent to incorporate the California Rules of Arbitration (Code of Civil Procedure section 1281, et. seq.) into their agreement through a general California choice-of-law clause; and (c) allowing arbitration to proceed would create a risk of conflicting rulings as described in . . . section 1281.2(c).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">Health Net has timely appealed the denial, as it may do under Code of Civil Procedure section 1294, subdivision (a). On appeal, it does not dispute the manner in which the trial court exercised its discretion under section 1281.2(c), but it contends that the choice-of-law provision in the Health Net/Mt. Diablo Agreement should not be interpreted to call for the application of section 1281.2(c). Therefore, it argues, the FAA has preempted this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>provision of California law and the court was required to enforce the arbitration provision. As the parties agree, this issue presents a question of law subject to de novo review by the appellate court. <em>(24 Hour Fitness, Inc. v. Superior Court </em>(1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1199, 1212 [78 Cal.Rptr.2d 533].)</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">Section 1281.2(c) authorizes the court to refuse to enforce a contractual arbitration provision if arbitration threatens to produce a result that may conflict with the outcome of related litigation not subject to arbitration. Section 1281.2 provides that on petition of a party to an arbitration agreement, the court shall order the parties to arbitrate the controversy \u201cunless it determines that. . . [f] . . . ffl] (c) A party to the arbitration agreement is also a party to a pending court action . . . with a third party, arising out of the same transaction or series of related transactions and there is a possibility of conflicting rulings on a common issue of law or fact,\u201d in which case \u201cthe court (1) may refuse to enforce the arbitration agreement and may order intervention or joinder of all parties in a single action . . . ; (2) may order intervention or joinder as to all or only certain issues; (3) may order arbitration among the parties who have agreed to arbitration and stay the pending court action . . . pending the outcome of the arbitration proceeding; or (4) may stay arbitration pending the outcome of the court action . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b631-8\">The FAA, however, contains no similar provision,  The federal statute was enacted in 1925 to \u201coverrule the judiciary\u2019s longstanding refusal to enforce agreements to arbitrate\u201d <em>(Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc. </em>v. <em>Byrd </em>(1985) 470 U.S. 213, 219-220 [105 S.Ct. 1238, 1242, 84 L.Ed.2d 158]), and to place arbitration agreements \u201c \u2018upon the same footing as other contracts ....\u2019\u201d <em>(Scherk v. Alberto-Culver Co. </em>(1974) 417 U.S. 506, 511 [94 S.Ct. 2449, 2453,41 L.Ed.2d 270].)  It provides for the enforcement of arbitration provisions in any contract evidencing a transaction involving interstate commerce. (9 U.S.C. \u00a7 2.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n                   The modem era of Supreme Court interpretation of the FAA begins with <em>Moses H. Cone Hospital v. Mercury Constr. Corp. </em>(1983) 460 U.S. 1, 24-25 [103 S.Ct. 927, 941-942, 74 L.Ed.2d 765], in which the court held that the FAA \u201cestablishes that, as a matter of federal law, any doubts concerning the scope of arbitrable issues should be resolved in favor of arbitration, whether the problem at hand is the construction of the contract language itself or an allegation of waiver, delay, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>or a like defense to arbitrability.\u201d However, the FAA leaves room for states to enact some rules affecting arbitration. <em>(Volt, supra, </em>489 U.S. at p. 476 [109 S.Ct. at p. 1254]; Hayford &amp; Palmiter, <em>Arbitration Federalism: A State Role in Commercial Arbitration </em>(2002) 54 Fla. L.Rev. 175 (Hayford &amp; Palmiter).) State laws that apply to contracts generally can be applied to arbitration agreements, but \u201c[cjourts may not . . . invalidate arbitration agreements under state laws applicable <em>only </em>to arbitration provisions.\u201d <em>(Doctor\u2019s Associates, Inc. v. Casarotto </em>(1996) 517 U.S. 681, 687 [116 S.Ct. 1652, 1656, 134 L.Ed.2d 902].) And the FAA \u201cpreempts a state law that withdraws the power to enforce arbitration agreements.\u201d <em>(Southland Corp. v. Keating </em>(1984) 465 U.S. 1, 16, fn. 10 [104 S.Ct. 852, 861, 79 L.Ed.2d 1].) The FAA gives the courts no discretion to refuse to order arbitration that has been agreed to by the parties. <em>(Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. </em>v. <em>Byrd, supra, </em>470 U.S. 213.)</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">Despite the apparent inconsistency between section 1281.2(c) and the FAA, the United States Supreme Court gave its blessing to section 1281.2(c) in <em>Volt. </em>After pointing out that \u201c[t]he FAA contains no express pre-emptive provision, nor does it reflect a congressional intent to occupy the entire field of arbitration\u201d <em>(Volt, supra, </em>489 U.S. at p. 477 [109 S.Ct. at p. 1255]), the court concluded that \u201c[arbitration under the [FAA] is a matter of consent, not coercion, and parties are generally free to structure their arbitration agreements as they see fit. Just as they may limit by contract the issues which they will arbitrate [citation], so too may they specify by contract the rules under which that arbitration will be conducted. Where ... the parties have agreed to abide by state rules of arbitration, enforcing those rules according to the terms of the agreement is fully consistent with the goals of the FAA, even if the result is that the arbitration is stayed where the [FAA] would otherwise permit it to go forward.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 479 [109 S.Ct. at p. 1256].) The choice-of-law provision at issue in <em>Volt </em>specified that the contract \u201c \u2018. . . shall be governed by the law of the place where the Project is located,\u2019 \u201d which was California. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 470 [109 S.Ct. at p. 1251].) By this choice-of-law provision, the California court had concluded that \u201cthe parties had incorporated the California rules of arbitration, including \u00a7 1281.2(c), into their arbitration agreement.\u201d <em>(Volt, supra, </em>at p. 472 [109 S.Ct. at p. 1252].) The Supreme Court held that the parties had thereby \u201cagreed that arbitration would not proceed in situations which fell within the scope of [section 1281.2(c)]\u201d <em>(Volt, supra, </em>at p. 475 [109 S.Ct. at p. 1253]) and that the FAA did not prevent application of this provision to stay the arbitration. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 477 [109 S.Ct. at p. 1255].) \u201c[Application of the California statute is not pre-empted by the [FAA] in a case where the parties have agreed that their arbitration agreement will be governed by the law of California.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 470 [109 S.Ct. at p. 1251].)</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>The parties are in essential agreement with these general propositions. Where they part company, however, is with respect to the interpretation of the choice-of-law provision in the Health Net/Mt. Diablo Agreement. Mt. Diablo points out that <em>Volt </em>itself arose out of an agreement subject to California law, but Health Net correctly observes that the United States Supreme Court did not express an opinion concerning the manner in which the choice-of-law clause should be interpreted, but felt itself bound to accept the interpretation of the California court that by the provision in that contract, the parties had agreed to arbitrate in accordance with California law. (See <em>Volt, supra, </em>489 U.S. at p. 474 [109 S.Ct. at p. 1253].) Health Net urges this court to construe the present agreement differently. Relying on the Supreme Court\u2019s subsequent decision in <em>Mastrobuono </em>v. <em>Shearson Lehman Hutton, Inc. </em>(1995) 514 U.S. 52 [115 S.Ct. 1212, 131 L.Ed.2d 76] <em>(Mastrobuono), </em>and federal cases that have followed it, Health Net argues that the \u201cgeneric\u201d choice-of-law provision was not intended to designate California arbitration law in preference to federal arbitration law for the interpretation and enforcement of the arbitration agreement. Absent an explicit choice of California law for this purpose, Health Net argues that federal law must apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">The circumstances in <em>Mastrobuono </em>were very different from those involved in the present case. The issue there was whether to apply New York decisional law, which permitted punitive damages to be awarded by courts but not by arbitrators (the <em>Garrity </em>rule).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The plaintiffs argued that the <em>Garrity </em>rule was preempted by the FAA, while the defendants relied on <em>Volt </em>for the proposition that because the parties\u2019 arbitration agreement provided that the entire agreement \u201c \u2018shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York,\u2019 \u201d the <em>Garrity </em>rule should apply to the dispute. <em>(Mastrobuono, supra, </em>514 U.S. at pp. 53, 58 [115 S.Ct. at pp. 1214, 1216-1217].) The court observed that \u201c[t]he choice-of-law provision, when viewed in isolation, may reasonably be read as merely a substitute for the conflict-of-laws analysis that otherwise would determine what law to apply to disputes arising out of the contractual relationship\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 59 [115 S.Ct. at p. 1217]), that it \u201cmight include only New York\u2019s substantive rights and obligations, and not the State\u2019s allocation of power between alternative tribunals,\u201d and that it was not \u201cin itself, an unequivocal exclusion of punitive damages claims\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 60 [115 S.Ct. at p. 1217]). The court reiterated that the FAA was designed to overcome the refusal of many state courts to enforce arbitration agreements (i<em>d. </em>at pp. 55-56, 58, 62 [115 S.Ct. at pp. 1215, 1216-1217, 1219-1220]) and found that because the arbitration provision there did not specifically address the powers to be conferred on the arbitrator or the availability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>of punitive damages, \u201c[a]t most, the choice-of-law clause introduces an ambiguity into an arbitration agreement that would otherwise allow punitive damages awards\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 62 [115 S.Ct. at p. 1218]). Relying on the federal policy favoring arbitration, as well as the common law rule that a court should construe ambiguous contract language against the interest of the party that drafted it, the court concluded that the parties did not intend to incorporate the <em>Garrity </em>rule, so that punitive damages could be awarded by an arbitrator to the same extent they could be awarded by a court. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 62-63 [115 S.Ct. at pp. 1218-1219].) \u201cWe think the best way to harmonize the choice-of-law provision with the arbitration provision is to read \u2018the laws of the State of New York\u2019 to encompass substantive principles that New York courts would apply, but not to include special rules limiting the authority of arbitrators.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 63-64 [115 S.Ct. at p. 1219].)</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">The decisions in <em>Volt </em>and <em>Mastrobuono </em>have given rise to a good bit of commentary as well as criticism.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Volt </em>was criticized because it ceded to the states authority to regulate the meaning and effect of contractual provisions concerning arbitrability that many had assumed was provided on a uniform national basis by the FAA. (See, e.g., Becker, <em>Choice of Law and the Federal Arbitration Act: The Shock of Volt </em>(1990) 45 Arb. J. 32.) <em>Mastrobuono </em>has been regarded by some as a first step in returning to the pre- <em>Volt </em>jurisprudence of \u201cnot allowing the inclusion of a choice-of-law provision to undermine the federal policy favoring arbitration.\u201d (Micheletti, <em>supra, </em>21 Del. J. Corp. L. at p. 1058.) Others have questioned the precedential value of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number><em>Mastrobuono </em>(see <em>Mastrobuono, supra, </em>514 U.S. at pp. 71-72 [115 S.Ct. at pp. 1222-1223] (dis. opn. of Thomas, J.), Appel, <em>supra, </em>12 Ohio St. J. on Disp. Resol. 233; Trainor, <em>Mastrobuono v. Shearson Lehman Hutton, Inc. </em>(1996) 56 La. L.Rev. 1015, 1027-1028). All the while, lower courts have been struggling with the extent to which and the manner by which the incorporation of state law may be effectively accomplished. (Appel, <em>supra, </em>at pp. 239-240; Micheletti, <em>supra, </em>at p. 1057; see also <em>Wolsey, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Foodmaker, Inc. </em>(9th Cir. 1998) 144 F.3d 1205; <em>Roadway Package System, Inc. v. Kayser </em>(3d Cir. 2001) 257 F.3d 287, cert. den. <em>(Roadway Package); Gateway Technologies v. MCI Telecommunications </em>(5th Cir. 1995) 64 F.3d 993, 999 <em>[.Mastrobuono </em>stands for the proposition that arbitrators have the power to award punitive damages unless the parties unequivocally state otherwise]; <em>Lanier </em>v. <em>Old Republic Ins. Co. </em>(M.D.Ala. 1996) 936 F.Supp. 839, 844 [\u201cThe court must admit the difference between the two cases, while there, is difficult to grasp\u201d].)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">Among the numerous federal decisions that have considered the meaning of <em>Mastrobuono </em>and its relationship to <em>Volt, </em>the case that undoubtedly is most helpful to Health Net\u2019s position is <em>Wolsey, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Foodmaker, Inc., supra, </em>144 F.3d 1205. Pointing out that the United States Supreme Court in <em>Volt </em>felt constrained to accept the interpretation of the California court that the choice-of-law provision in that agreement was intended to incorporate section 1281.2(c), the court in <em>Wolsey </em>stated that in the diversity case before it, the federal court was required to interpret the agreement for itself. Purporting to apply <em>Mastrobuono, </em>the <em>Wolsey </em>court felt that the \u201crelevant question is whether section 1281.2(c) is a \u2018substantive principle that [California] courts would apply\u2019 or is instead \u2018a special rule[] limiting the authority of arbitrators.\u201d <em>(Wolsey, supra, </em>at p. 1212.) The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals concluded that \u201c[b]ecause <em>Mastrobuono </em>dictates that general choice-of-law clauses do not incorporate state rules that govern the allocation of authority between courts and arbitrators, the district court erred in applying ... \u00a7 1281.2(c) to deny Foodmaker\u2019s motion to compel arbitration.\u201d <em>(Wolsey, supra, </em>at p. 1213.)</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">The court in <em>Roadway Package, supra, </em>257 F.3d 287, 288, also a diversity case, interpreted another choice-of-law provision, this one reading that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>agreement \u201c \u2018shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.\u2019 \u201d A divided panel of the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, in the interests of simplicity and uniformity, formulated a \u201cdefault rule\u201d that \u201ca generic choice-of-law clause, standing alone, is insufficient to support a finding that contracting parties intended to opt out of the FAA\u2019s default standards.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 295-296.)</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">In our view, the starting point in the interpretation of the choice-of-law clause, like any contractual provision, is with the language of the contract itself. While Health Net attempts to group all choice-of-law clauses that make no explicit reference to arbitration under the rubric \u201cgeneric,\u201d the term has no precise definition. If by that term is meant a choice-of-law provision that states that the agreement will be governed by the law of a particular state without elaborating the specific provisions of state law to which it applies (see <em>Roadway Package, supra, </em>257 F.3d at p. 303, fn. 2 (conc. opn. of Ambro, J.)),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and if such a \u201cgeneric\u201d provision is insufficient to incorporate the state\u2019s laws concerning the enforcement of arbitration agreements, requiring such a redundancy before the provision will have any effect \u201cleads logically to the conclusion that other provisions . . . may also need to contain that redundant choice, <em>e.g., </em>provisions treating indemnification rights or termination events in contracts involving the interstate transportation of products.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 308.) We agree with the observation of the concurring judge in <em>Roadway Package, </em>who rejected the approach that the FAA controls absent \u201cextrinsic evidence of an intent to contract out of the FAA\u2019s default regime\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 300) in favor of the traditional attempt to discern the intention of the parties, that \u201c[t]he choice of law almost invariably is meant to encompass the entire agreement\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 308).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">The choice-of-law provision in the present case may be \u201cgeneric\u201d in the sense that it does not mention arbitration or any other specific issue that might become a subject of controversy, but it is nonetheless broad, unqualified and all-encompassing. It provides that \u201c[t]he validity, construction, interpretation and enforcement of this Agreement\u201d shall be governed by California law. The explicit reference to enforcement reasonably includes such matters as whether proceedings to enforce the agreement shall occur in court or before an arbitrator. Chapter 2 (in which \u00a7 1281.2 appears) of title 9 of part III of the California Code of Civil Procedure is captioned \u201cEnforcement of Arbitration Agreements.\u201d An interpretation of the choice-of-law provision to exclude reference to this chapter would be strained at best.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>In contrast, the agreement in <em>Mastrobuono </em>provided only that it \u201c \u2018shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Mastrobuono, supra, </em>514 U.S. at p. 53 [115 S.Ct. at p. 1214].) In <em>Wolsey, </em>the contract provided that it \u2018\u201c. . . shall be interpreted and construed under the laws of the State of California, U.S.A.\u2019\u201d <em>(Wolsey, Ltd. v. Foodmaker, Inc., supra, </em>144 F.3d at p. 1209.) The breadth of the provision in the Health Net/Mt. Diablo Agreement is emphasized by comparison with the provision that was involved in <em>Warren-Guthrie v. Health Net </em>(2000) 84 Cal.App.4th 804 [101 Cal.Rptr.2d 260] <em>(Warren-Guthrie). </em>In that case, the contract containing an arbitration agreement provided only that \u2018\u201c[a]ll Arbitration shall be <em>conducted </em>in accordance with the California Code of Civil Procedure, commencing with Section 1280\u2019\u201d <em>(Warren-Guthrie, supra, </em>at p. 815, italics added), and the court therefore held that the parties had not agreed that the enforceability of the arbitration agreement would be determined by California law. The court pointed out that there was \u201cno express language indicating that California law shall . . . apply for all purposes,\u201d and that the agreement \u201climits the scope of California law to that law pertaining to the manner in which the arbitration is to be conducted.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Thus, although reaffirming that under <em>Volt </em>a petition to compel arbitration may be denied under section 1281.2 if the parties have agreed to the application of California law for this purpose <em>(Warren-Guthrie, supra, </em>at pp. 813-814), the court found that the limited purpose for which California law had been designated under that contract did not constitute such an agreement <em>(id. </em>at p. 816).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">Several of the federal cases following <em>Mastrobuono </em>contain choice-of-law provisions that use language similar to that in <em>Mastrobuono </em>and <em>Wolsey, </em>to the effect that the agreement would be governed by the law of a particular jurisdiction, without reference to enforcement. (E.g., <em>Nat. Union Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Belco Petroleum Corp. </em>(2d Cir. 1996) 88 F.3d 129, 132 [\u201c \u2018The construction, validity and performance of this policy shall be governed by the law of the State of New York, U.S.A.\u2019 \u201d]; <em>Porter Hayden Co. v. Century Indem. Co. </em>(4th Cir. 1998) 136 F.3d 380 382 [\u201c \u2018All disputes concerning the validity, interpretation and application of the Agreement . . . and all disputes concerning issues within the scope of the Agreement shall be determined in accordance with applicable common law of the states of the United States\u2019 \u201d]; <em>UHC Management Co. </em>v. <em>Computer Sciences Corp. </em>(8th Cir. 1998) 148 F.3d 992, 994, 997 [\u201c \u2018To the extent not preempted by ERISA or other federal law, this Agreement shall [be] governed by and construed under the laws of the State of Minnesota.\u2019 \u201d \u201c[T]the choice-of-law clause itself specifically provides that Minnesota law must yield whenever preempted by federal law, which cuts against the argument that the parties intended that the FAA not apply\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b638-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>The significance of this difference in language is also reflected by the decision of the Court of Appeals of New York in <em>Smith Barney, etc. v. Luckie </em>(1995) 85 N.Y.2d 193 [623 N.Y.S.2d 800, 647 N.E.2d 1308], In holding that the governing choice-of-law clause, which made no explicit reference to arbitration rules, nonetheless should be interpreted to include New York arbitration law rather than the FAA, the court emphasized that \u201cthe parties\u2019 choice that New York law would govern \u2018the agreement <em>and its enforcement\u2019 </em>(emphasis added) indicates their \u2018intention to arbitrate to the extent allowed by [this State\u2019s] law,\u2019 even if application of the State law . . . would relieve the parties of their responsibility under the contract to arbitrate.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1313.) The chief judge concurred, also emphasizing that \u201cbecause the form arbitration agreements at issue plainly provide that New York law governs \u2018the agreement <em>and its enforcement\u2019 </em>(emphasis added), the parties can fairly be understood to have agreed that all of New York arbitration law . . . would apply.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1316 (conc. opn. of Kaye, C. J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">Health Net suggests that the clause in the arbitration provision of the present agreement that \u201cthe arbitrator shall be bound by applicable state and federal law\u201d somehow qualifies the reference to California law in the choice-of-law provision. However, there is no inconsistency between these two paragraphs. The arbitration provision merely confirms that the arbitrator must adhere to applicable state and federal substantive law in resolving the merits of the controversy. The choice-of-law paragraph provides that issues of contract validity, interpretation and enforcement shall be governed by California law. Whether the court should compel compliance with the arbitration provision is a question of enforcement to be resolved under this agreement under California law. The reference to federal law in the arbitration provision does not indicate otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">If the language of the choice-of-law clause is broad enough to include state law on the subject of arbitrability, as it unquestionably is in this case, the second step in the court\u2019s analysis, under <em>Mastrobuono, </em>must be to determine whether the particular provision of state law in question is one that reflects a hostility to the enforcement of arbitration agreements that the FAA was designed to overcome. If so, the choice-of-law clause should not be construed to incorporate such a provision, at least in the absence of unambiguous language in the contract making the intention to do so unmistakably clear. In <em>Mastrobuono </em>itself, the state law in question would have denied an arbitrator the ability to award the same relief as a court, and the Supreme Court held that the ambiguity in the contract should be resolved by reading the choice-of-law clause \u201cnot to include special rules limiting the authority of arbitrators.\u201d <em>(Mastrobuono, supra, </em>514 U.S. at p. 64 [115 S.Ct. at p. 1219].)</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>Many of the cases cited by Health Net involved provisions which, like the New York rule in <em>Mastrobuono, </em>tended to restrict rather than to facilitate the use of arbitration, which was the reason the courts concluded that application of state law would contravene the FAA. (E.g., <em>Ferro Corp. v. Garrison Industries, Inc. </em>(6th Cir. 1998) 142 F.3d 926, 928, 936 [unlike California\u2019s \u00a7 1281.2(c), \u201cthe Ohio law does not relate to the efficient order of the proceedings, but rather determines conclusively which forum\u2014arbitration or judicial\u2014should entertain Ferro\u2019s defense of fraudulent inducement of the contract. As in <em>Doctor\u2019s Associates, </em>the application of Ferro\u2019s construction of the Ohio state law would lead the Court to effectively abrogate the arbitration agreement, <em>in toto, </em>rather than simply establish the efficient order of proceedings\u201d]; <em>PaineWebber, Inc. </em>v. <em>Elahi </em>(1st Cir. 1996) 87 F.3d 589, 592, 601-602 [provision that \u201c \u2018[t]his agreement and its enforcement shall be construed and governed by the laws of the State of New York\u2019 \u201d was not an expression of intent to adopt the New York law requiring the court, rather than the arbitrator, to apply time bar contained in the rules of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.]; cf. <em>Nat. Union Fire Ins. Co. v. Belco Petroleum Corp., supra, </em>88 F.3d at p. 135; <em>Porter Hayden Co. v. Century Indem. Co., supra, </em>136 F.3d at p. 382.)</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">On the other hand, where the state arbitration provision is not inconsistent with the FAA policy of enforcing arbitration procedures chosen by the parties, choice-of-law clauses making no explicit reference to arbitration commonly have been interpreted to incorporate the state\u2019s law governing the enforcement of arbitration agreements. (E.g., <em>ASW Allstate Painting &amp; Const. v. Lexington Ins. </em>(5th Cir. 1999) 188 F.3d 307, 310 [Texas choice-of-law clause required application of \u201cTexas arbitration rules [that] do not undermine the federal policy of the FAA\u201d]; <em>Ekstrom v. Value Health, Inc. </em>(D.C. Cir. 1995) 68 F.3d 1391, 1396 [under Connecticut choice-of-law provision, Connecticut arbitration rules that were consistent with goals of FAA applied]; <em>Flight Systems </em>v. <em>Paul A. Laurence Co. </em>(D.D.C. 1989) 715 F.Supp. 1125, 1127 [Virginia rules for vacating arbitration award applied because \u201c[t]he parties contracted under the laws of Virginia, agreed to arbitration under the laws of Virginia, and the application of Virginia law does not directly conflict with the goals of the FAA.\u201d]; <em>Flexible Mfg. Systems PTY </em>v. <em>Super Products </em>(E.D.Wis. 1994) 874 F.Supp. 247, 249 [same re Wisconsin law].)</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">We disagree with the implicit determination in <em>Wolsey </em>that section 1281.2(c) is \u201c \u2018a special rule[] limiting the authority of arbitrators\u2019 \u201d <em>(Wolsey, Ltd. v. Foodmaker, Inc., supra, </em>144 F.3d at p. 1212), as was the New York rule involved in <em>Mastrobuono. </em>This view contradicts the characterization of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>section 1281.2(c) by the Supreme Court itself not only in <em>Volt (Volt, supra, </em>489 U.S. at p. 476, fn. 5 [109 S.Ct. at p. 1254]) but in the subsequent decision in <em>Doctor\u2019s Associates, Inc. </em>v. <em>Casarotto, supra, </em>517 U.S. 681. In rejecting a Montana statute requiring arbitration agreements to contain a particular form of notice in order to be enforceable, the Supreme Court contrasted that statute with section 1281.2(c): \u201cThe state rule examined in <em>Volt </em>determined only the efficient order of proceedings; it did not affect the enforceability of the arbitration agreement itself. We held that applying the state rule would not \u2018undermine the goals and policies of the FAA,\u2019 [citation], because the very purpose of the Act was to \u2018ensur[e] that private agreements to arbitrate are enforced according to their terms.\u2019 \u201d (517 U.S. at p. 688 [109 S.Ct. at pp. 1656-1657]; see also, e.g., <em>Ferro Corp. </em>v. <em>Garrison Industries, Inc., supra, </em>142 F.3d at pp. 928, 937.)</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">Section 1281.2(c) is not a provision designed to limit the rights of parties who choose to arbitrate or otherwise to discourage the use of arbitration. Rather, it is part of California\u2019s statutory scheme designed to enforce the parties\u2019 arbitration agreements, as the FAA requires. Section 1281.2(c) addresses the peculiar situation that arises when a controversy also affects claims by or against other parties not bound by the arbitration agreement. The California provision giving the court discretion not to enforce the arbitration agreement under such circumstances\u2014in order to avoid potential inconsistency in outcome as well as duplication of effort\u2014does not contravene the letter or the spirit of the FAA. That was the explicit holding in <em>Volt </em>and nothing in <em>Mastrobuono </em>casts doubt on that conclusion. Thus, there is no reason why the broad language of the choice-of-law clause in this case, calling for the enforcement of the agreement under California law, should not be read to invoke the provisions of section 1281.2(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">Finally, we quickly dispose of Health Net\u2019s ultimate argument that even if section 1281.2(c) applies, that section does no more than authorize a stay of the arbitration proceedings, and does not authorize an order \u201cto force Health Net to submit to litigation.\u201d In the first place, as the trial court\u2019s order quoted above makes clear, the order included no such compulsory provision. It merely denied Health Net\u2019s application to compel arbitration and to stay the litigation. Indeed, the court added a provision making the denial without prejudice in the event that Mt. Diablo settled its claims with Alta Bates and EBMC. The statute expressly authorizes the court, if the prescribed conditions apply, to \u201crefuse to enforce the arbitration agreement,\u201d which is exactly what the trial court did. <em>Warren-McGuthrie </em>explicitly rejected Health Net\u2019s contention that section 1281.2 \u201cdoes not support the proposition that denial of arbitration is also permissible where the parties agree to apply California <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>law.\u201d <em>(Warren-McGuthrie, supra, </em>84 Cal.App.4th at p. 813.) Since the litigation will proceed, Health Net, having been brought within the court\u2019s jurisdiction, presumably will be bound by the outcome and undoubtedly will find it in its best interests to defend the litigation. However, that is not because the trial court has ordered anything beyond what the statute authorizes. Rather, it is the natural corollary of the reasons for which section 1281.2(c) has been included in the California statute, so that common issues of fact and law will be resolved consistently, and only once.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">\n<em>Disposition</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">The order denying Health Net\u2019s petition is affirmed.
