In this appeal, we clarify that the kidnapping for carjacking statute (Pen. Code, \u00a7 209.5) does not require that the movement of the victim \u201csubstantially\u201d increase the risk of harm to the victim; it requires only that the movement create a risk of harm greater than that inherent to carjacking. As we explain, the trial court correctly instructed on this point. Accordingly, and rejecting appellant\u2019s other arguments, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">Procedural and Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">Jose Moneada was filling his car at a gas station in Lynwood after dark on November 26, 2000. When he finished, he got into his car. Appellant Michael Ortiz approached Moneada, said he had a gun, and ordered him to move over. Warning Moneada he would kill him if he looked his way or tried \u201cto do anything,\u201d appellant got into the driver\u2019s seat and the two men drove from the gas station.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-9\">As they drove, appellant demanded Moneada\u2019s wallet. Fearing appellant would kill him if he resisted, Moneada handed it over. Appellant repeated his earlier threat, telling Moneada, \u201cDon\u2019t do anything, otherwise, I\u2019ll kill you. . . . If I don\u2019t, my friends are right behind us and they can also kill you.\u201d The threat merited credence because Moneada had seen appellant\u2019s purported accomplice following them from the gas station.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b349-10\">Appellant stopped the car in a dark street or alley. He told Moneada \u201cwe\u2019re going to kill you and we\u2019re going to put you in the trunk.\u201d Warning Moneada he knew where he lived, appellant cautioned him not to go to the police, promising \u201cIf you want to live, shut up. . . . If you want to die, speak.\u201d Appellant then resumed driving toward Atlantic Boulevard in Lynwood, where he stopped and deposited Moneada. As he drove away in Moneada\u2019s car, appellant reiterated \u201csomething would happen\u201d to Moneada if he called the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>The People charged appellant with kidnapping for carjacking (\u00a7 209.5, subd. (a)), caijacking (\u00a7215, subd. (a)), second degree robbery (\u00a7211), making a terrorist threat (\u00a7 422), and dissuading a victim from reporting a crime (\u00a7 136.1, subd. (c)(1)). The People also specially alleged appellant had served two prior prison terms for possession of controlled substances (\u00a7 667.5, subd. (b)). Appellant pleaded not guilty and denied the special allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">Appellant was tried by jury, which convicted him of all counts. He admitted his prior prison terms. The court sentenced him to life in prison with the possibility of parole plus eight years and eight months. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">\n<em>\u201cSubstantial\u201d Increase in Risk of Harm</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">The court instructed the jury that one element of kidnapping for caijacking was that appellant\u2019s movement of Moneada increased the risk to Moneada beyond that inherent to carjacking. Appellant contends the court erred by not telling the jury the increase must be \u201csubstantial.\u201d In support of his contention, he relies on <em>People </em>v. <em>Rayford </em>(1994) 9 Cal.4th 1 [36 Cal.Rptr.2d 317, 884 P.2d 1369] <em>(Rayford), </em>and <em>People v. Daniels </em>(1969) 71 Cal.2d 1119 [80 Cal.Rptr. 897, 459 P.2d 225, 43 A.L.R.3d 677] <em>(Daniels). </em>Appellant\u2019s contention, which mistakenly melds physical movement and risk of harm, overlooks changes in the law of kidnapping since <em>Rayford </em>and <em>Daniels.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">For simple kidnapping (\u00a7 207), the kidnapper\u2019s physical movement of the victim must be \u201csubstantial in character\u201d\u2014the so-called asportation element. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Caudillo </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 562, 571 [146 Cal.Rptr. 859, 580 P.2d 274], overruled on another point by <em>People v. Martinez </em>(1999) 20 Cal.4th 225, 237, fn. 6 [83 Cal.Rptr.2d 533, 973 P.2d 512]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Stanworth </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 588, 600-601 [114 Cal.Rptr. 250, 522 P.2d 1058].) For aggravated kidnapping for ransom, robbery, or rape (\u00a7 209), however, our Supreme Court noted in <em>People v. Martinez, supra, 20 </em>Cal.4th 225 <em>(Martinez), </em>that the asportation element encompasses not only physical movement, but also the manner of the crime\u2019s execution. \u201cWith respect to asportation, aggravated kidnapping requires movement of the victim that is not merely incidental to the commission of the underlying crime [but that also] increases the risk of harm to the victim over and above necessarily present in the underlying crime itself.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 232.)</p>\n<p id=\"b350-9\">In 1997, the Legislature added to the aggravated kidnapping statute <em>Rayford\u2019s </em>and Daniels\u2019s requirement of an \u201cincrease of risk of harm.\u201d (See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>\u00a7 209, subd. (b)(2).) As the Supreme Court in <em>Martinez </em>noted, \u201c[the aggravated kidnapping statute] thus codifies both <em>Rayford . . . </em>and a modified version of the <em>People v. Daniels . . . </em>asportation standard.\u201d <em>(Martinez, supra, </em>20 Cal.4th at p. 232, fn. 4.) As such, the movement of the victim in an aggravated kidnapping must increase the risk of harm beyond that inherent to the underlying crime, but \u201cdoes not require that the movement \u2018substantially\u2019 increase the risk of harm to the victim.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>When the Legislature added the risk of harm element to section 209, it tracked identical language employed four years earlier when it enacted the kidnapping for carjacking statute. (\u00a7 209.5, subd. (b).) It follows that the Legislature intended that the risk of harm element have the same meaning in both statutes, and it follows that the <em>Martinez </em>rule applies with equal force here. Accordingly, we hold that kidnapping for carjacking (\u00a7 209.5), like aggravated kidnapping (\u00a7 209), does not require that the physical movement of the victim <em>substantially </em>increase the risk of harm; it is enough that commission of the offense creates a risk of harm greater than that incidental to simple carjacking. And, indeed, that is what the statute states: \u201cThis section shall only apply if the movement of the victim is beyond that merely incidental to the commission of the carjacking . . . and the movement of the victim increases the risk of harm to the victim over and above that necessarily present in the crime of carjacking itself.\u201d (\u00a7 209.5, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">The trial court correctly instructed the jury on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">\n<em>Dismissal of Carjacking Conviction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">Appellant was convicted of both carjacking and kidnapping for carjacking (\u00a7\u00a7 213, subd. (a), 209.5, subd. (a).) The court sentenced him for both offenses, but stayed the carjacking sentence under section 654, which provides that the same criminal conduct, even if constituting more than one offense, may be punished only once. Appellant observes, and respondent concedes, carjacking is a necessarily included offense of kidnapping for carjacking. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Jones </em>(1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 616, 624-625 [89 Cal.Rptr.2d 485]; <em>People v. Contreras </em>(1997) 55 Cal.App.4th 760, 765 [64 Cal.Rptr.2d 233].) Appellant further notes, and respondent further concedes, a court must dismiss, instead of stay the sentence for, a necessarily included offense. <em>(People v. Pearson </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 351, 355 [228 Cal.Rptr. 509, 721 P.2d 595]; <em>People v. Contreras, supra, </em>55 Cal.App.4th at p. 765.) The court thus erred in merely staying the carjacking sentence. Accordingly, we will correct the court\u2019s mistake by ordering dismissal of appellant\u2019s carjacking conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">\n<em>Threat of Force to Dissuade Victim from Reporting a Crime</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b351-9\">Section 136.1 criminalizes trying to dissuade a victim from reporting a crime. The offense can be either a misdemeanor or felony; if the perpetrator <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>tried to dissuade by using force or the threat of force, it is a felony. (\u00a7 136.1, subd. (c).)</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">The People charged appellant with felony dissuasion, but the court mistakenly instructed the jury with only the misdemeanor version of the crime. The court told the jury, \u201cIn order to prove this crime, each of the following elements must be proved: (1) Jose Moneada was a victim; (2) Another person, with the specific intent to do so, attempted to prevent or dissuade Jose Moneada from making a report of such victimization to any peace officer; and (3) That person acted knowingly and maliciously.\u201d The court did not tell the jury that felony dissuasion additionally involved force or the threat of force against the victim. (See CALJIC No. 7.15.)</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">The court erred by omitting the force element. <em>(People v. Wims </em>(1995) 10 Cal.4th 293, 303 [41 Cal.Rptr.2d 241, 895 P.2d 77] [court has sua sponte duty to instruct on all elements of a crime].)  Such an error ordinarily requires reversal of a conviction unless the error was harmless. But, if no rational jury could have found the missing element unproven, the error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt and the conviction stands. <em>(Neder v. United States </em>(1999) 527 U.S. 1, 19 [119 S.Ct. 1827, 1838, 144 L.Ed.2d 35]; accord, <em>People </em>v. <em>Flood </em>(1998) 18 Cal.4th 470, 506 [76 Cal.Rptr.2d 180, 957 P.2d 869].)</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">In convicting appellant of misdemeanor dissuasion, the jury necessarily accepted Moneada\u2019s testimony that appellant told him not to report his victimization to the police. The difference between misdemeanor and felony dissuasion\u2014and the only element on which the court failed to instruct\u2014is whether force or the threat of force accompanied the dissuasion. Here, the uncontradicted testimony was appellant dissuaded Moneada from going to the police by warning him, \u201cIf you want to live, shut up. . . . If you want to die, speak.\u201d Appellant repeated this warning when he dropped Moneada off, telling him \u201csomething would happen\u201d to him if he called the police. We hold that no reasonable jury could have decided appellant uttered such statements and yet have viewed the statements, which foretold misfortune or even death if Moneada talked to the police, as not threatening force. Hence, the court\u2019s failure to instruct on the force element was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">\n<em>Terrorist Threat</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">The People argued appellant made a terrorist threat when he stopped in a dark street or alley and told Moneada \u201cwe\u2019re going to kill you and we\u2019re going to put you in the trunk.\u201d Appellant contends there was insufficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>evidence to support his conviction for making a terrorist threat because there was no evidence his statement frightened Moneada. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">One element of making a terrorist threat is Moneada feared for his safety. (\u00a7 422; <em>People </em>v. <em>Toledo </em>(2001) 26 Cal.4th 221, 228 [109 Cal.Rptr.2d 315, 26 P.3d 1051].) The element has both an objective and subjective component; Moneada\u2019s fear must have been reasonable, and it must have been real. <em>(In re Ricky T. </em>(2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 1132, 1140 [105 Cal.Rptr.2d 165].) We do not doubt, and appellant does not argue otherwise, that the objective component was met, in that an average reasonable person would be fearful if a caij acker threatened to kill the person and stuff him in the trunk. Appellant notes, however, that Moneada never testified the statement put him in actual fear\u2014the subjective component. We nevertheless conclude that the only reasonable inference from the evidence is Moneada had such fear. Appellant\u2019s threat was part of an uninterrupted series of crimes, beginning at the gas station, continuing as appellant drove along darkened streets to take Moneada to places unknown, and ending only when appellant deposited him on a street comer. The record contains no evidence that at any time during the kidnapping and carjacking the danger to Moneada diminished or his fear dissipated. It is thus unreasonable to conclude appellant\u2019s threat did not put Moneada in actual fear. Therefore, there was sufficient evidence to convict appellant of making a terrorist threat.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">Appellant\u2019s conviction for caqacking (\u00a7215, subd. (a)) is dismissed. In all other respects the judgment is affirmed. The clerk of the superior court is directed to prepare an amended abstract of judgment reflecting dismissal of the caijacking conviction and to forward a copy to the Department of Corrections.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">Cooper, P. J., and Boland, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-9\">A petition for a rehearing was denied September 4, 2002, and appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied November 13, 2002. Kennard, J., was of the opinion that the petition should be granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b349-11\">All further statutory references are to the Penal Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b349-12\">Lamour Clark was charged and tried as an accomplice, but the jury acquitted him of all counts.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
