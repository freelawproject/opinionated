He appeals the trial court\u2019s orders dismissing individual defendants, sustaining demurrers to five of his seven causes of action without leave to amend, and his own dismissal of the remainder of the complaint. Gutkin also appeals the trial court\u2019s orders compelling further responses to discovery and production of documents and for monetary sanctions, denying his ex parte application for modification and postponement of the discovery orders, and denying his motion for leave to amend the complaint. We affirm the judgment. We hold that the trial court properly sustained respondents\u2019 demurrers, and did not abuse its discretion in denying leave to amend because Gutkin failed to challenge the University\u2019s tenure and grievance procedure by way of administrative mandamus. We further hold that Gutkin is not entitled to appellate review of his voluntary dismissal of the action or the trial court\u2019s postdemurrer orders compelling further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"971\">*971</page-number>production of documents and awarding monetary sanctions against Gutkin, denying his ex parte application, and denying his motion for leave to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b859-7\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b859-8\">Gutkin\u2019s complaint alleged that he was a tenured professor of mathematics at the University. In the wake of a dispute over the University\u2019s requirement that Gutkin teach extra classes to \u201cmake up\u201d for classes he had not been able to teach in the fall 1995 semester, the University initiated dismissal proceedings against Gutkin in October 1996. But Gutkin\u2019s dismissal hearing was not scheduled to take place until early December 1998, because, according to Gutkin, \u201c[i]t took [the University] longer than anticipated to effectuate the deceptive alterations to the [faculty] [h]andbook\u201d that would govern the \u201crigged [dismissal] procedures,\u201d and the University \u201cdragged its feet.\u201d Gut-kin further alleged that by December 1998, \u201c[the University] had not finished its tampering, so the deceptively altered [h]andbook was not ready for posting on the Internet by the time of the scheduled hearing. . . . Consequently, [the University] unilaterally postponed the hearing until February 26, 1999.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b859-9\">The dismissal procedure outlined in the faculty handbook required a hearing before a panel of Gutkin\u2019s faculty peers. According to Gutkin, the panel selection process set out in the revised faculty handbook constituted a \u201ccharade of impartiality\u201d that resulted in a \u201csham dismissal procedure.\u201d In March 1999, the faculty panel issued a recommendation to the president of the University that found that Gutkin had engaged in \u201cserious neglect of duty,\u201d a ground for termination in the faculty handbook. The president of the University terminated Gutkin in March 2000 for \u201cserious neglect of duty,\u201d as found by the faculty panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-10\">A. <em>The complaint.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b859-11\">Gutkin filed his complaint on January 31, 2001, naming as defendants the University and four individuals: Dr. Joseph Aoun, Dr. Robert Guralnick, Dr. Susan Montgomery, and Dr. Wayne Raskind. The complaint set forth seven causes of action: (1) fraud and deceit; (2) breach of contract; (3) wrongful termination in violation of public policy; (4) age discrimination; (5) defamation; (6) intentional infliction of emotional distress; and (7) intentional interference with prospective economic advantage.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-12\">Gutkin asserted all seven causes of action against the University. In addition, he alleged his fifth cause of action for defamation and his seventh <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"972\">*972</page-number>cause of action for intentional interference with contract and prospective economic advantage against Aoun, Montgomery, and Guralnick; his sixth cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress against all four individuals; and his seventh cause of action for intentional interference with contract and prospective economic advantage against Aoun, Montgomery, and Guralnick.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">B. <em>The demurrers.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">Respondents demurred, requesting dismissal of the first, second, fifth, sixth, and seventh causes of action in the complaint on the ground that Gutkin\u2019s exclusive judicial remedy as to those claims was administrative mandamus under <em>Pomona College v. Superior Court </em>(1996) 45 Cal.App.4th 1716 [53 Cal.Rptr.2d 662] <em>(Pomona College). </em>Gutkin, they argued, had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies, and all of those claims were barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-7\">On May 1, 2001 the trial court ruled on the demurrers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b860-8\">(1) The University\u2019s demurrers to the first cause of action for fraud and deceit, the second cause of action for breach of contract, the sixth cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress, and the seventh cause of action for intentional interference with prospective economic advantage were sustained without leave to amend.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b860-9\">(2) Raskind\u2019s demurrer to the sixth cause of action (the only one asserted against him) was sustained without leave to amend.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b860-10\">(3) The University and Aoun\u2019s demurrers to the fifth cause of action for defamation were sustained without leave to amend.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b860-11\">(4) Montgomery and Guralnick\u2019s demurrers to the sixth and seventh causes of action were sustained without leave to amend. As to the fifth cause of action for defamation, Montgomery and Guralnick\u2019s demurrers were sustained with leave to amend the allegations of the complaint relating to the alleged false and defamatory statements Montgomery and Guralnick made to Gutkin\u2019s peers at other universities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b860-12\">Gutkin filed a writ petition on May 17, 2001, seeking review of the trial court\u2019s ruling on the demurrers, which we summarily denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-13\">Gutkin did not amend his complaint, and the trial court granted respondents\u2019 subsequent motion to dismiss all of the individual defendants on June 22, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-14\">Following the trial court\u2019s rulings on the demurrers, only two claims remained against the University: Gutkin\u2019s cause of action for wrongful termination in violation of public policy and his claim of age discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"973\">*973</page-number>C. <em>The discovery order.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">On June 20, 2001 the trial court granted respondents\u2019 motion to compel further responses to their request for production of documents. The court ordered Gutkin to produce a privilege log and to produce all nonprivileged documents responsive to particular demands in the document request. The court also granted respondents\u2019 request for sanctions in the amount of $2,700.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b861-7\">Gutkin did not produce the privilege log as ordered by the trial court. Instead, on July 10, 2001, Gutkin filed an ex parte application seeking to modify the court\u2019s June 20, 2001 discovery order and delay further production of documents. The trial court found that Gutkin had failed to show good cause and denied the application. Gutkin then sought leave to amend his complaint to delete the allegations of fraud and deceit so as to render discovery of documents the court had ordered him to produce irrelevant. The trial court denied the motion on August 8, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-8\">D. <em>Gutkin\u2019s voluntary dismissal.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b861-9\">On July 12, 2001, Gutkin produced some of the documents the court had ordered produced, but indicated that he was continuing to withhold additional responsive documents, which he did not intend to produce. The University threatened to move for an award of further sanctions, including terminating sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-10\">The University noticed Gutkin\u2019s deposition to take place in mid-August. On August 10, 2001, prior to the scheduled date for Gutkin\u2019s deposition, Gutkin filed a voluntary request for dismissal of his complaint \u201cwithout prejudice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b861-11\">Gutkin filed a notice of appeal on August 17, 2001. He then twice sought entry of judgment of dismissal on the basis of the trial court\u2019s orders sustaining the demurrers to five of the seven causes of action and dismissal of the individual defendants, as well as his own voluntary dismissal of the action. The court clerk rejected Gutkin\u2019s proposed judgment of dismissal because a dismissal of the complaint had been entered and notice of dismissal given. Gutkin then followed with a \u201csupplemental notice of appeal\u201d on October 4, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"974\">*974</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">With respect to the trial court\u2019s sustaining of the demurrers, Gutkin contends that he has a constitutional right to a jury trial of his claims against the University and the individual defendants. He maintains that this court\u2019s holding in <em>Pomona College, supra, </em>45 Cal.App.4th 1716, does not apply to the revocation of tenure. Gutkin also contends that the conduct underlying his tort claims falls outside the employment relationship, and these claims should not be subject to administrative mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-7\">Gutkin challenges the trial court\u2019s discovery order and sanction award and the denial of his ex parte application to modify the discovery order. He contends that the trial court abused its discretion in ordering further production of documents that were subject to attorney work product protections; the trial court\u2019s imposition of sanctions was unjust and failed to recognize the substantial justification for the work product objection; and the trial court abused its discretion in denying Gutkin\u2019s ex parte application for modification of the discovery order.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-8\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b862-9\">Appealability</p>\n<p id=\"b862-10\">A. <em>The ruling on the demurrers.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b862-11\">Gutkin correctly observes that after the trial court sustained respondents\u2019 demurrer to five of his seven causes of action without leave to amend, \u201cthe plaintiff\u2019s power to voluntarily dismiss those five causes of action was terminated.\u201d Those counts had been effectively \u201ctried\u201d by the court, and a voluntary dismissal cannot be taken after \u201ctrial\u201d commences. <em>(Wells v. Marina City Properties, Inc. </em>(1981) 29 Cal.3d 781, 789 [176 Cal.Rptr. 104, 632 P.2d 217].) Gutkin further contends that even though the trial court refused to enter judgment following his voluntary dismissal of the complaint, the court\u2019s order sustaining the demurrers without leave to amend, combined with the dismissal of the action, had the legal effect of a final, appealable judgment. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-12\">In <em>Ashland Chemical Co. v. Provence </em>(1982) 129 Cal.App.3d 790 [181 Cal.Rptr. 340], the plaintiff dismissed the complaint with prejudice after the trial court had sustained a defendant\u2019s demurrer without leave to amend. The plaintiff expressly dismissed the complaint \u201c \u2018only for the purpose of expediting appeal,\u2019 \u201d to obtain a final judgment to enable it to contest the court\u2019s ruling. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 792.) On appeal the court rejected the defendant\u2019s contention that the plaintiff may not appeal after voluntarily dismissing its complaint, noting, \u201cmany courts have allowed appeals by plaintiffs who dismissed their complaints after an adverse ruling by the trial court, on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"975\">*975</page-number>theory the dismissals were not really voluntary, but only done to expedite an appeal.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 793; see also <em>Stewart v. Colonial Western Agency, Inc. </em>(2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 1006, 1012 [105 Cal.Rptr.2d 115]; <em>Casey v. Overhead Door Corp. </em>(1999) 74 Cal.App.4th 112, 116, fn. 1 [87 Cal.Rptr.2d 603].)</p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">B. <em>The interim orders.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b863-7\">The effect of Gutkin\u2019s voluntary dismissal of the action on the appealability of other interim orders in this case is another matter. It is well established that a voluntary dismissal under Code of Civil Procedure<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> section 581 is not appealable. \u201cThe entry [of a request for dismissal] is a ministerial, not a judicial, act, and no appeal lies therefrom.\u201d <em>(Associated Convalescent Enterprises </em>v. <em>Carl Marks &amp; Co., Inc. </em>(1973) 33 Cal.App.3d 116, 120 [108 Cal.Rptr. 782].) \u201cA wilful dismissal terminates the action for all time and affords the appellate court no jurisdiction to review . . . motions made prior to the dismissal.\u201d <em>(Cook v. Stewart McKee &amp; Co. </em>(1945) 68 Cal.App.2d 758, 760-761 [157 P.2d 868].) Because Gutkin dismissed his remaining claims in this case <em>without prejudice, </em>the voluntary dismissal could not have the legal effect of a final judgment, and could not serve to expedite an appeal. By voluntarily dismissing the action <em>without prejudice </em>Gutkin lost his ability to challenge the trial court\u2019s interim orders. Accordingly, no appeal lies from the trial court\u2019s discovery order and denial of the ex parte application in this case. <em>Ashland Chemical Co. v. Provence, Stewart v. Colonial Western Agency, Inc., </em>and <em>Casey </em>v. <em>Overhead Door Corp., </em>all of which involved voluntary dismissals <em>with prejudice, </em>are therefore inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-8\">Gutkin\u2019s appeal of the trial court\u2019s discovery order, monetary sanction order, and orders denying his ex parte application and motion for leave to amend the complaint, as well as the voluntary dismissal of the action is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-9\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b863-10\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b863-11\">\u201c \u2018On appeal from a judgment dismissing an action after sustaining a demurrer without leave to amend, the standard of review is well settled. The reviewing court gives the complaint a reasonable interpretation, and treats the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded. [Citations.] The court does not, however, assume the truth of contentions, deductions or conclusions of law. [Citation.] The judgment must be affirmed \u201cif any one of the several grounds of demurrer is well taken. [Citations.]\u201d [Citation.] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"976\">*976</page-number>However, it is error for a trial court to sustain a demurrer when the plaintiff has stated a cause of action under any possible legal theory. [Citation.] And it is an abuse of discretion to sustain a demurrer without leave to amend if the plaintiff shows there is a reasonable possibility any defect identified by the defendant can be cured by amendment. [Citation.]\u2019 \u201d <em>(Payne v. National Collection Systems, Inc. </em>(2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 1037, 1043 [111 Cal.Rptr.2d 260], quoting <em>Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital Dist. </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 966-967 [9 Cal.Rptr.2d 92, 831 P.2d 317].) Nevertheless, if no liability exists as a matter of law, we must affirm that part of the judgment sustaining the demurrer, and if the plaintiff cannot show an abuse of discretion, the trial court\u2019s order sustaining the demurrer without leave to amend must be affirmed. <em>(Traders Sports, Inc. v. City of San Leandro </em>(2001) 93 Cal.App.4th 37, 44 [112 Cal.Rptr.2d 677].) \u201cThe burden is on the plaintiff ... to demonstrate the manner in which the complaint might be amended. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Hendy </em>v. <em>Losse </em>(1991) 54 Cal.3d 723, 742 [1 Cal.Rptr.2d 543, 819 P.2d 1].)</p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b864-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b864-7\">A. <em>Gutkin\u2019s claims fail under Pomona College, and the trial court properly sustained respondents \u2019 demurrer.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b864-9\">Our analysis is governed by our decision in <em>Pomona College, </em>which is dispositive of all but Gutkin\u2019s discrimination claims in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-10\">In <em>Pomona College, </em>an assistant professor brought a civil action seeking damages for wrongful termination and breach of contract and implied covenants after the college denied him tenure. <em>(Pomona College, supra, </em>45 Cal.App.4th at p. 1720.) The plaintiff claimed that the college had promised him tenure as long as his performance was acceptable, in accordance with the policies outlined in the college\u2019s faculty handbook. <em>(Ibid.) </em>He alleged that the college had breached his employment agreement by failing to follow its policies and procedures during the tenure review process. <em>(Ibid.) </em>We ordered the college\u2019s demurrer sustained without leave to amend on the basis of our conclusion that administrative mandamus under section 1094.5<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> provides the exclusive remedy to a professor in a private university for any procedural defects which he believes existed in the tenure review or in the grievance process. <em>(Pomona College, </em>at pp. 1720, 1729.)</p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"977\">*977</page-number>We concluded that the case law supported application of section 1094.5 to private as well as public universities, and observed: \u201c[Cjourts have been reluctant to review the merits of a tenure decision\u201d because academic \u201cpeers, unlike nonacademics, are equipped to evaluate the candidate\u2019s teaching and research according to their conformity with methodological principles agreed upon by the entire academic community. They also have the knowledge to meaningfully evaluate the candidate\u2019s contributions within his or her particular field of study as well as the relevance of those contributions to the goals of the particular institution.\u201d <em>(Pomona College, </em>supra, 45 Cal.App.4th at p. 1726, fn. omitted.) For this reason, we concluded that \u201c \u2018courts must be vigilant not to intrude into that determination, and should not substitute their judgment for that of the college with respect to the qualifications of faculty members for promotion and tenure. Determinations about such matters as teaching ability, research scholarship, and professional stature are subjective, and unless they can be shown to have been used as the mechanism to obscure discrimination, they must be left for evaluation by the professionals, particularly since they often involve inquiry into aspects of arcane scholarship beyond the competence of individual judges.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1725.) \u201c[A]bsent discrimination, judicial review of tenure decisions in California is limited to evaluating the fairness of the administrative hearing in an administrative mandamus action.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1726.)</p>\n<p id=\"b865-6\">Gutkin attempts to distinguish <em>Pomona College </em>on the ground that it involved the decision to deny tenure whereas his case involves the revocation of tenure. But our holding in <em>Pomona College </em>applies equally to the revocation of tenure as to the denial of tenure. It goes without saying that the decision of who should have tenure and represent a university is inextricably connected to the \u201cessential freedoms\u201d of a university to \u201c \u2018 \u201cdetermine for itself on academic grounds who may teach, what may be taught, how it shall be taught, and who may be admitted to study.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Pomona College, supra, </em>45 Cal.App.4th at p. 1726, quoting <em>Sweezy v. New Hampshire </em>(1957) 354 U.S. 234, 263 [77 S.Ct. 1203, 1218, 1 L.Ed.2d 1311].) Indeed, Gutkin himself acknowledges the importance of the role of academic peers in making tenure determinations: \u201cA faculty position, held with tenure, . . . [is] the ticket to full membership in the academic community. The decision to promote the scholar to a tenured position is driven, primarily, by the evaluation of the scholar\u2019s peers in the field of expertise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b865-7\">Our holding in <em>Pomona College </em>did not turn on whether the plaintiff already held tenure or was challenging the denial of tenure. Nor did we conclude that the plaintiff could not state a contract claim because he lacked tenure. Rather, we held: \u201cCalifornia law provides to those who feel wronged by procedural defects in the tenure process\u2014as opposed to those who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"978\">*978</page-number>disagree with substantive evaluations\u2014a remedy. That remedy is administrative mandamus.\u201d <em>(Pomona College, supra, </em>45 Cal.App.4th at p. 1727.) If a college or university has the \u201cessential freedom\u201d to determine for itself \u201cwho may teach\u201d\u2014as both this court and the United States Supreme Court have held\u2014that necessarily includes the determination whether a faculty member who has tenure should be dismissed. <em>(Sweezy v. New Hampshire, supra, </em>354 U.S. at p. 263 [77 S.Ct. at p. 1218].)</p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">In his attempt to distinguish <em>Pomona College, </em>Gutkin appears to contend that once the initial decision to grant or deny tenure has been made, the judgment of the professor\u2019s academic peers falls by the wayside, and a lay jury may then step in to determine whether he or she remains entitled to \u201cfull membership in the academic commxmity.\u201d But such a determination still requires an assessment of whether the professor\u2019s conduct is consistent with or contrary to academic norms, which only academic peers, not lay jurors, are qualified to determine. Gutkin\u2019s claim that \u201cacademic expertise\u201d was not implicated in the revocation of his tenure is simply wrong: Gutkin refused to teach a class the University required him to teach, thus raising a question of compliance with academic norms.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-6\">Throughout his complaint and briefs, Gutkin decries a University dismissal process he calls the \u201cDismissal Machinery,\u201d which he claims is rife with procedural and due process deficiencies. At the heart of his claims lies the assertion that the University \u201cmade unilateral and surreptitious changes\u201d to the faculty handbook, which contained the key terms of the tenure employment contract. But Gutkin cannot circumvent administrative mandamus review by seeking redress for alleged procedural and due process deficiencies in the dismissal process. That is precisely the purpose of mandamus review\u2014to ferret out such flaws and rectify them. As we held in <em>Pomona College, </em>\u201c[Plaintiff] asserts . . . that \u2018the procedure set forth in the . . . Handbook regarding the \u201chearing\u201d is so vague as to deny a grievant due process.\u2019 fl|] Section 1094.5, subdivision (b) provides that the scope of inquiry in reviewing a petition for administrative mandate \u2018shall extend to the questions whether the respondent has proceeded without, or in excess of jurisdiction; whether there was a <em>fair trial', </em>and whether there was any prejudicial abuse of discretion. Abuse of discretion is established if the respondent has not proceeded in the manner required by law, the order or decision is not supported by the findings, or the findings are not supported by the evidence.\u2019\u201d <em>(Pomona College, supra, </em>45 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1729-1730; \u00a7 1094.5, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b866-7\">Finally, Gutkin concedes that \u201c[administrative mandamus is appropriate where an underlying hearing is required by law,\u201d but then contends that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"979\">*979</page-number>University\u2019s faculty handbook did not satisfy this \u201cby law\u201d requirement. Just as we rejected this argument in <em>Pomona College, </em>so we reject it here: \u201c[Plaintiff] also suggests . . . that Pomona was not required \u2018by law\u2019 to hold a hearing. Because the Handbook governed [plaintiffs] employment relationship with Pomona, the college was required by law to provide the hearing described therein. (See <em>Cubic Corp. </em>v. <em>Marty </em>(1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 438, 454 [229 Cal.Rptr. 828, 66 A.L.R.4th 1115] [an employer is required by law to give its employees the benefit of existing company policies and procedures].) Mandamus is available if a hearing is required by statute, an organization\u2019s internal rules and regulations, or due process. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Pomona College, supra, </em>45 Cal.App.4th at p. 1727, fn. 10.)</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">In this case, it is undisputed the University\u2019s faculty handbook requires a hearing before a tenured faculty member can be dismissed, and further, that Gutkin had such a hearing. It is precisely the faculty handbook\u2019s requirement of a hearing that renders the hearing \u201crequired by law,\u201d for purposes of administrative mandamus. <em>(Pomona College, supra, </em>45 Cal.App.4th at p. 1727.)</p>\n<p id=\"b867-7\">B. <em>The conduct underlying Gutkin\u2019s tort claims was strictly confined to the employment relationship; these claims are therefore subject to administrative mandamus.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b867-8\">Despite the tort labels, the gravamen of Gutkin\u2019s tort claims before us is that the University employed a procedure to dismiss him that was not sanctioned by the 1987 faculty handbook pursuant to which he had been given tenure. The central allegation of the first cause of action for fraud and deceit is that \u201c[the University] represented that it supported the tenure system and the legal rights conferred by the promotion to a tenured position. These representations were false. Behind the scenes, [the University] altered the Faculty Handbook, set [Gutkin] up for termination, and attempted to cover up its wrongful acts with a <em>rigged dismissal </em>proceeding.\u201d (Italics added.) Gutkin also describes his fraud claim in his opening brief by reference to the University\u2019s dismissal proceedings: \u201cProf[essor] Gutkin relied upon the University\u2019s representations that it supported tenure and would fulfill its obligations under the employment contract. <em>Even holding the hearing was a manifestation of that </em>[sic] <em>false and misleading representations.\u201d </em>(Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b867-9\">In the fifth cause of action for defamation, Gutkin alleges he was \u201cdefamed\u201d by the very fact that he was charged with \u201cserious neglect of duty,\u201d by testimony adduced at the hearing, and by being dismissed \u201con false and fabricated grounds.\u201d Gutkin further alleges that the University falsely and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"980\">*980</page-number>maliciously asserted that there was adequate cause to terminate him from a tenured position on the faculty. Moreover, \u201c[the University] deliberately waited beyond a fair and equitable time to schedule a dismissal hearing in order to assert, improperly, that the procedure set out in the 12/98 Handbook should apply. [The University] knowingly imposed the rigged methods for selecting a diminished panel upon [Gutkin], and falsely represented that the process adhered to national standards of academic due process. [The University] engaged in this wrongful and deceptive conduct in order to represent that [Gutkin\u2019s] termination was justified. [The University] knew that this action was false and malicious, [\u00b6] [The University] knowingly and deliberately commenced dismissal proceedings against [Gutkin] without adequate cause. The proceedings were commenced and continued with malice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">Similarly, the causes of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress and intentional interference with contract and with prospective economic advantage are based on the cancellation of a graduate level math class and the order to teach a lower division class, \u201cthe commencement of dismissal proceedings,\u201d \u201cthe delay in commencing those proceedings,\u201d the \u201cpursuit of the dismissal proceedings with total disregard of University procedures and principles of fundamental fairness,\u201d and simply his \u201cwrongful termination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b868-6\">Thus, despite the tort labels, the substance of these claims is strictly confined to the employment relationship and the University\u2019s dismissal proceedings: precisely the type of claims that administrative mandamus is designed to address. It is manifest that our decision in <em>Pomona College </em>finally disposes of Gutkin\u2019s four causes of action in tort as well as his contract claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-7\">We reject Gutkin\u2019s contention that his so-called institutional fraud claim is actionable under <em>Lazar </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1996) 12 Cal.4th 631 [49 Cal.Rptr.2d 377, 909 P.2d 981]. <em>Lazar </em>involved fraudulent inducement to enter into an employment contract (the employer fraudulently induced the plaintiff to move from the East Coast to California)\u2014not a fraudulent inducement \u201cto remain at [the University]\u201d as Gutkin would have it. <em>Lazar </em>thus has no application to the facts of this case. As the Supreme Court stated in <em>Hunter v. Up-Right, Inc. </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 1174, 1184-1185 [26 Cal.Rptr.2d 8, 864 P.2d 88]: \u201c[I]t is difficult to conceive cf a wrongful termination case in which a misrepresentation made by the employer to effect termination could ever rise to the level of a separately actionable fraud. In essence, such misrepresentations are merely the means to the end desired by the employer, i.e., termination of employment. They cannot serve as a predicate for tort damages otherwise unavailable under <em>Foley </em>[v. <em>Interactive Data Corp. </em>(1988) 47 Cal.3d 654 [254 Cal.Rptr. 211, 765 P.2d 373]].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"981\">*981</page-number>Finally, the gravamen of Gutkin\u2019s defamation claim is that it is inherently defamatory to pursue dismissal of a tenured professor such as himself. This is obviously not the law. In any event, the trial court\u2019s order sustaining the demurrer was proper on the ground that the University was privileged under Civil Code section 47, subdivisions (b) and (c) to invoke its dismissal procedures. <em>(Deaile </em>v. <em>General Telephone Co. of California </em>(1974) 40 Cal.App.3d 841, 846 [115 Cal.Rptr. 582].) Moreover, despite leave to amend the defamation claim against defendants Montgomery and Guralnick, Gutkin failed to do so, thus admitting he could allege no additional facts to support his claim against these defendants.  When a plaintiff elects not to amend after the court sustains a demurrer with leave to amend, we assume the complaint states as strong a case as possible, and we will affirm the judgment if the unamended complaint is objectionable on any ground raised by the demurrer. <em>(Soliz v. Williams </em>(1999) 74 Cal.App.4th 577, 585 [88 Cal.Rptr.2d 184].)  Since Gutkin\u2019s unamended complaint alleged <em>no </em>facts to support a defamation claim against Montgomery and Guralnick, the trial court properly sustained the demurrer and dismissed these defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b869-7\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b869-8\">The judgment is affirmed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Appellant is ordered to bear respondents\u2019 costs of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-9\">Nott, Acting P.
