(Elementis or defendant). The appeals, and a cross-appeal by Elementis, present numerous questions of eminent domain law. We have concluded that the judgment must be reversed. Specifically, we hold that (1) the Agency\u2019s own purchases of neighboring properties were inadmissible to establish the value of the condemned property; (2) the jury could not consider, and the appraisal witnesses could not rely upon, a recital in a contract for the purchase of a neighboring property, which purported to \u201capportion\u201d the overall price for the property between two segments divided by a political boundary; (3) it was error to admit, over objection, evidence concerning specific development plans for the property, since no one disputed the highest and best use for it and no other materiality was shown; (4) because it was undisputed that the property must inevitably be adapted to a higher and more valuable use, and because there was no proper ground for finding a qualifying period of \u201cinterim use,\u201d the trial court properly withheld from the jury Elementis\u2019s claim for loss of goodwill; (5) for the same reasons, however, defendant cannot recover for the value of equipment or fixtures \u201cin place, in use.\u201d Our reversal of the judgment, coupled with intervening external events, makes it unnecessary or improper to address other issues, notably whether the trial court erred by excluding evidence of soil remediation costs and staying a corresponding portion of the judgment pending resolution of a federal cost-recovery action, and whether the court erred by awarding Elementis its attorneys fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1092\">*1092</page-number>Background</p>\n<p id=\"b968-5\">The property in question was originally occupied by a Native American midden, or shellmound, rising to a height of at least 40 feet. In the late 1800\u2019s the property held an amusement park known as Shellmound Park. Sometime in the 1920\u2019s it was leveled and developed for industrial use. At one time part of the property included a pesticide manufacturing operation. In 1987 the property was designated for inclusion in a 270-acre redevelopment project. In 1990, it was acquired by Elementis, which manufactured iron oxide pigments on the property. In 1992 Elementis notified the City of Emeryville (City) that it was permanently laying off 70 of its 85 employees. After that time it apparently continued to manufacture, or at least to blend, iron oxide pigments on a small part of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-6\">In January 1996 Elementis indicated to the Agency that it was willing to sell the property to the Agency for fair market value. The Agency expressed interest but stated that \u201cthe existence of hazardous materials is of concern and will greatly impact [the property\u2019s] fair market value,\u201d and \u201cat this time the Agency has little understanding as to the extent of contamination on the site and the cost of remediation.\u201d Almost a year later the parties negotiated two right-of-entry agreements permitting the Agency to conduct activities relating to appraisal and environmental testing. Ultimately the soil on the property was found to contain significant levels of contaminants including lead and arsenic. A dispute thereafter arose between the parties concerning, at least ostensibly, who would control the \u201cremediation\u201d (cleanup) of the property and what methodology would be employed.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-7\">On February 19, 1998, the Agency filed this action in eminent domain.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In May of 1998, the Agency deposited probable compensation of $1,062,000 with the State Treasurer and applied to the court for prejudgment possession and an order for entry. The court ultimately authorized the Agency to take possession of the most contaminated portions of the property by September 30,1998, and the remainder by December 31, 1998. Around the end of 1998, Elementis relocated what remained of its operation to Colton in Southern California. The parties later stipulated that the \u201cvaluation date\u201d for purposes of this matter would be November 1, 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-8\">On January 11, 1999, after a trial limited to the \u201cright to take,\u201d the court found that the Agency had the right to acquire the property by eminent domain.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1093\">*1093</page-number>In 1999, during demolition and soil remediation, extensive remnants of the original Emeryville shellmound were discovered on the subject property along with the remains of well over 100 humans. These materials constituted a cultural resource protected under the California Environmental Quality Act, Public Resources Code sections 21000 et seq. (CEQA) and triggered certain statutory requirements governing the treatment and disposition of such remains. (Pub. Resources Code, \u00a7 5097.98.) The Agency proceeded to take various steps to comply with these provisions. Defendant contended at trial that the Agency\u2019s actions exceeded statutory requirements and, thus, the reasonable cost of such compliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-5\">On August 4, 1999, the Agency and the City filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, seeking monetary damages and other relief from Elementis, its predecessors, and others, based on the contamination of the subject property and neighboring properties, the necessity of remediating those properties, and the costs incurred in doing so. <em>(City of Emeryville v. Elementis Pigments, Inc. </em>(N.D.Cal., Aug. 6, 1999) No. C 99-03719 BZ.) The complaint invoked a variety of federal and state laws, most notably the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, title 42 United States Code section 9601 et seq. (CERCLA).</p>\n<p id=\"b969-6\">On November 8, 1999, with the federal action still pending, trial commenced in this action on the issue of the \u201cjust compensation\u201d to be awarded to Elementis. On December 20, 1999, the jury returned a verdict fixing the fair market value of the property at $12,493,283. The trial court entered a judgment condemning the property to the Agency. However the court stayed a portion of the award, equal to the soil remediation costs claimed to have been incurred by the Agency, pending further developments in the federal lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-7\">The Agency filed a timely appeal from the judgment (case No. A090932), in which Elementis filed a cross-appeal. The Agency appealed separately from postjudgment orders allowing, and fixing the amount of, costs and attorneys fees. (Case Nos. A091716, A093126.) We have already consolidated the first two appeals, and have implicitly granted the plaintiffs unopposed request that all three appeals be considered together.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-8\">While the appeals were pending, both parties requested judicial notice of a written settlement agreement reached by them and approved by the court in the federal lawsuit. In the agreement, Elementis promised to compensate the City with (1) \u201ccash consideration\u201d of $3,850,000, and (2) \u201cforbearance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1094\">*1094</page-number>consideration\u201d in the form of the relinquishment of claims against the City for over $2,450,800 in relocation benefits. It was further agreed that the cash consideration (plus interest) would \u201cbe a credit in Emeryville\u2019s favor against any sums Emeryville may be required to pay Elementis in satisfaction of a final judgment resulting from the Eminent Domain Appeal or subsequent proceeding resulting from that Appeal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b970-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-6\">\n<em>Agency\u2019s Purchases of Neighboring Properties</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b970-7\">The state\u2019s power to take property by eminent domain is conditioned on its obligation to pay \u201cjust compensation\u201d to the owner. (U.S. Const., 5th Amend.; Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 19.) \u201cJust compensation\u201d is defined as \u201cfair market value\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1263.310), which in turn is defined as \u201cthe highest price on the date of valuation that would be agreed to by a seller . . . and a buyer . . . each dealing with the other with full knowledge of all the uses and purposes for which the property is reasonably adaptable and available\u201d <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 1263.320).  The constitutional guarantee of \u201cjust compensation\u201d is obviously intended to protect the landowner, but it also protects the public by limiting its liability to losses that can fairly be attributed to the taking. \u201c \u2018A landowner is not entitled to be placed in a better position financially than he was before the condemnation; neither is the state required to pay more than land is worth merely because of some theoretical, intangible concept.\u2019 \u201d <em>(San Diego County Water Authority v. Mireiter </em>(1993) 18 Cal.App.4th 1808, 1817 [23 Cal.Rptr.2d 455] <em>(Mireiter), </em>quoting <em>City of Fresno v. Cloud (1912) </em>26 Cal.App.3d 113, 123 [102 Cal.Rptr. 874].)</p>\n<p id=\"b970-9\">Here both parties sought to establish the fair market value of the subject property through analyses, by expert appraisers, of \u201ccomparable sales.\u201d (See Evid. Code, \u00a7 816; cf. <em>id., </em>\u00a7 819 [capitalized income approach].) Under this method, the appraiser identifies sales of properties deemed to resemble the condemned property in relevant respects, and then derives a market value for the condemned property from the prices paid for these \u201ccomparables,\u201d typically adjusting the price to reflect such matters as material differences between the properties and differences in market forces between the time and location of the comparable sale and that of the property being valued.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-10\">Prior to trial the Agency moved in limine to bar Elementis from using, as comparables, any \u201csales of property to the Redevelopment Agency.\u201d The motion asserted that six of the 15 transactions disclosed prior to trial as a basis for the appraisal by defendant\u2019s witness Clevenger were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1095\">*1095</page-number>purchases by the Agency, for public use, of property it could have condemned, and were therefore inadmissible under Evidence Code section 822, subdivision (a)(1) (section 822(a)(1)). The court denied the motion. At trial, Clevenger relied on 12 comparables, of which three were purchases by the Agency of properties neighboring the Elementis land.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-5\">This evidence should have been excluded under section 822(a)(1), which at the time of trial provided as follows: \u201c(a) In an eminent domain or inverse condemnation proceeding, ... the following matter is inadmissible as evidence and shall not be taken into account as a basis for an opinion as to the value of property: [\u00b6] (1) The price or other terms and circumstances of an acquisition of property or a property interest if the acquisition was for a public use for which the property could have been taken by eminent domain, except that the price or other terms and circumstances of an acquisition of property appropriated to a public use or a property interest so appropriated shall not be excluded under this section if the acquisition was for the same public use for which the property could have been taken by eminent domain.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b971-6\">We first reject Elementis\u2019s assertion that the decision whether to admit the evidence in question, over an objection based on the foregoing statute, is subject to deferential review as a matter entrusted to the trial court\u2019s discretion. Whatever section 822(a)(1) means, it does not confer a discretionary power on the trial court. It categorically excludes evidence of a specified character, subject to a stated exception.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\n                   Nor is there any dispute as to the relevant facts. Accordingly we must exercise our independent judgment in reviewing the ruling at issue. \u201cThe interpretation of a statute ... is a question of law . . . .\u201d <em>(California Teachers Assn. v. San Diego Community College Dist. </em>(1981) 28 Cal.3d 692, 699 [170 Cal.Rptr. 817, 621 P.2d 856].) \u201cA trial court\u2019s interpretation of a statute is reviewed de novo,\u201d and \u201cthe application of a statutory standard to undisputed facts is reviewed de novo.\u201d <em>(Harustak </em>v. <em>Wilkins </em>(2000) 84 Cal.App.4th 208, 212 [100 Cal.Rptr.2d 718].)</p>\n<p id=\"b971-7\">We also reject any suggestion that the statute was intended only, or primarily, for the protection of property owners, and thus should have little or no effect where, as here, the <em>condemnee </em>offers evidence of other acquisitions for a public use. The only support offered for such a view is a dictum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1096\">*1096</page-number>in <em>County of Los Angeles v. American Sav. &amp; Loan Assn. </em>(1972) 26 Cal.App.3d 7, 13 [102 Cal.Rptr. 439], that the purpose of section 822(a)(1) is \u201cto preclude use of the price or other terms that may have been acceded to by the transferor only because of the threat of condemnation.\u201d This statement cannot justify a departure from the language of the statute, which on its face embodies the former court-made rule that \u201cit is not competent for <em>either </em>party in a condemnation proceeding to put in evidence the amount paid by a condemning party to the owners of adjacent lands, however similar they may be to that in controversy, because the price paid under such circumstances \u2018is not a reasonable or fair test of market value.\u2019 \u201d <em>(City of Los Angeles v. Cole </em>(1946) 28 Cal.2d 509, 517-518 [170 P.2d 928], italics added; see <em>Ventura County Flood Control Dist. v. Campbell </em>(1999) 71 Cal.App.4th 211, 222 [83 Cal.Rptr.2d 725]; cf. <em>County of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>Faus </em>(1957) 48 Cal.2d 672, 680 [312 P.2d 680] [arguably overruling <em>Cole </em>on this point, but itself abrogated to that extent by \u00a7 822(a)(1)].) As discussed more fully in the following section, the price distortions in such a transaction are at least as likely to favor the seller as the buyer. (See discussion at p. 1107, <em>post.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b972-5\">We turn to the question whether the Agency\u2019s purchases here fall within the rule declared by the statute, i.e., that evidence of an acquisition of property is categorically inadmissible \u201cif the acquisition was for a public use for which the property could have been taken by eminent domain . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 822(a)(1).) It is undisputed that the evidence here fit this description. The Agency purchased these properties for redevelopment, a public use. Accordingly those purchases were inadmissible unless they came within an <em>exception </em>to the statutory rule of inadmissibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-6\">As in effect at trial, the statute\u2019s single exception exempted evidence of \u201can acquisition of <em>property appropriated to a public use </em>... if the acquisition was for the same public use for which the property could have been taken by eminent domain.\u201d (Former \u00a7 822(a)(1); Stats. 1987, ch. 1278, \u00a7 1, p. 4548, italics added.) Elementis has never attempted to show that the purchases here fall within this exception, and we are satisfied that they do not. The exception applies only to acquisitions of \u201cproperty appropriated to a public use,\u201d which generally means property <em>already in public use. </em>This phrase is most commonly used where an entity seeks to condemn property already put to a public use by another entity charged with a public function. (See Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1235.180 [defining \u2018\u201c[property appropriated to public use\u2019 \u201d as \u201cproperty either already in use for a public purpose or set aside for a specific public purpose with the intention of using it for such purpose within a reasonable time\u201d]; <em>id., </em>\u00a7 1240.510 [one authorized to exercise power of eminent domain may take property \u201cappropriated to public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1097\">*1097</page-number>use\u201d where taking will not unduly interfere with existing use]; <em>id., </em>\u00a7 1240.610 [entity may take property where new use is \u201ca more necessary public use than the use to which the property is appropriated\u201d]; <em>id., </em>\u00a7 1240.650, subd. (a) [new use is deemed more necessary than existing use where second taker is public entity and current holder is not]; Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 33395 [redevelopment agency may take \u201cproperty already devoted to a public use,\u201d but \u201c[property of a public body shall not be acquired without its consent\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b973-5\">That the exception applies only to property already in public use is also evident from the legislative history. Prior to 1986, the statute excluded all evidence of acquisitions for a purpose for which the property could have been taken by eminent domain. (Stats. 1980, ch. 381, \u00a7 5, p. 758.) Toward the end of the 1986 session, the Legislature amended the statute, by negative qualification, so that the statute only barred evidence of acquisitions of \u201cproperty not appropriated to a public use.\u201d (Stats. 1986, ch. 1238, \u00a7 2, p. 4349.) In 1987, the Legislature restated this qualification as an affirmative exception and <em>further qualified the exception </em>so that it only applied \u201cif the acquisition was for the same public use for which the property could have been taken by eminent domain.\u201d (Former \u00a7 822(a)(1); Stats. 1987, ch. 1278, \u00a7 1, P- 4548.)</p>\n<p id=\"b973-6\">Contemporaneous evidence of legislative intent establishes that (1) the 1986 amendment was never intended to apply to acquisitions of private property, but was aimed at a very specific category of public utility property; and (2) the 1987 amendment was an attempt to <em>correct a perceived over-breadth </em>in the 1986 amendment by further limiting the class of transactions which would be admissible.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> An undated \u201cAuthor\u2019s Statement,\u201d addressed to an unidentified committee (presumably the Assembly Committee on the Judiciary), states that the 1986 amendment \u201csought to correct a problem for <em>water districts </em>in that the only comparables were other water districts.<footnotemark>[4]</footnotemark> The intent was to provide comparables, but <em>the language is too broad . . </em>. . [\u00b6] [This bill] will allow the purchase price of a <em>public property </em>to be used as a \u2018comparable\u2019 only when <em>the same public use </em>will be continued . . . .\u201d (Assemblyman Harris, Author\u2019s Statement on Assem. Bill No. 616 (1987-1988 Reg. Sess.), p. 1, italics added.) An Assembly committee analysis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1098\">*1098</page-number>reports the view of the originating agency that the 1986 amendment permitted evidence of \u201cacquisition^] of comparable property that is <em>already in public use </em>.... [\u00b6] ... [\u00b6] . . . [T]he exception ... is too broad because <em>it permits the use of a price paid for public property . </em>. . without regard [to] whether the acquisition was for a purpose for which the acquiring agency had the power to condemn the property.\u201d (Assem. Com. on Judiciary, Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 616 (1987-1988 Reg. Sess.), for hearing of May 13j 1987, pp. 1-2, italics added.) Similarly, a Senate committee analysis noted that under the 1986 exception, \u201cthe admission and use of ... an acquisition of property that is <em>already in public use </em>is permitted .... [T]he price paid by a public entity to a <em>private owner </em>is generally inadmissible but the price paid for <em>public property between public entities </em>may be admissible \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 [\u00b6] This bill <em>narrows the exception </em>to the general rule . . . .\u201d (Sen. Com. on Judiciary, Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 616 (1987-1988 Reg. Sess.), as amended July 1, 1987, for hearing of July 7, 1987, pp. 1-2, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b974-5\">In sum, the statute as in effect at trial prescribed (1) a rule of excluding acquisitions for public use, which rule plainly applied to the purchases in question; (2) an <em>exception </em>for property <em>already </em>in public use, which exception plainly did <em>not </em>apply; and (3) a <em>limitation on the exception, </em>which was irrelevant because the exception was inapplicable by its core terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-6\">Elementis makes no attempt to explain how the purchases here could be admitted consistent with the statutory language or history. Instead it cites <em>City and County of San Francisco v. Golden Gate Heights Investments </em>(1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 1203 [18 Cal.Rptr.2d 467] <em>(Golden Gate). </em>In that case another division of this court affirmed a judgment despite the trial court\u2019s admission of evidence, over the condemnee\u2019s objection, of a city\u2019s purchase of neighboring properties. The condemnee contended that the 1987 amendment to section 822(a)(1) applied only to utility property. The court seemed to dismiss this interpretation, stating, \u201cWe do not read the statute as so limited. Nor does [the condemnee\u2019s] cited authority so state.\u201d <em>(Golden Gate, </em>at p. 1210, citing 1 Matteoni &amp; Veit, Condemnation Practice in Cal. (Cont.Ed.Bar supp. 1992) \u00a7 9.49, p. 161.) But the court offered no interpretation of its own. Instead it held that any error in the admission of the evidence was harmless. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b974-7\">We are uncertain that <em>Golden Gate </em>is properly understood to <em>hold </em>that the evidence there was admissible. Certainly no supporting analysis or rule of decision is provided. So far as we can tell, any attempt to follow that case would read section 822(a)(1) right out of the code. In any event, the matters <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1099\">*1099</page-number>we have already discussed compel us to conclude that the evidence here fell squarely within the general rule of inadmissibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-5\">We also note that in 2000 the Legislature again amended the statute. As amended, the statute continues to declare the general inadmissibility of \u201can acquisition of property ... for a public use for which the property could have been taken by eminent domain.\u201d (\u00a7 822(a)(1).) In place of the confusingly qualified 1987 exception, the statute now provides, \u201cThe price or other terms and circumstances shall not be excluded pursuant to this paragraph if the proceeding relates to the valuation of all or part of a <em>water system </em>as defined in Section 240 of the Public Utilities Code.\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b975-6\">A Senate floor analysis indicates that the California Law Revision Commission, which sought the 2000 amendment, considered the prior language \u201cconfusing,\u201d and believed that the court in <em>Golden Gate </em>had \u201cmisconstrued this poorly drafted exemption . . . [by] allowing evidence of prices paid by the same condemnor to acquire adjacent private property for public use.\u201d (Sen. Com. on Judiciary, Office of Floor Analyses, Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 321 (1999-2000 Reg. Sess.) as amended Aug. 16, 1999, pp. 3, 4, at &lt;http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/bilinfo.html&gt; [as of Aug. 9, 2002].) According to the bill\u2019s author, the 1986 and 1987 amendments were \u201ccreated for the acquisition of property by water districts.\u201d <em>(Ibid.; </em>see also Assem.

But while the interpretation of existing laws is a quintessentially judicial function, courts may and must give due consideration to the Legislature\u2019s stated views on \u201cthe prior import of its statutes.\u201d <em>(Western Security Bank </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th 232, 244 [62 Cal.Rptr.2d 243, 933 P.2d 507], quoting <em>California Emp. etc. Com. </em>v. <em>Payne </em>(1947) 31 Cal.2d 210, 213-214 [187 P.2d 702] [\u201c \u2018[A] subsequent expression of the Legislature as to the intent of the prior statute, although not binding on the court, may properly be used in determining the effect of a prior act\u2019 \u201d]; <em>Hunt v.

In adopting the 2000 amendment the Legislature confirmed that the statute does not authorize the admission of evidence of acquisitions of property privately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1100\">*1100</page-number>held for private use. To this extent, at least, we believe that amendment both declared, and accurately characterized the effect of, existing law.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-5\">In sum, section 822(a)(1) has always barred evidence of acquisitions for public use of purely private property. The purchases at issue here fell squarely within this ban, and were inadmissible. Accordingly, it was error to admit evidence of these purchases over the Agency\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-7\">\n<em>Contractual Recital in Comparable Sale</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b976-8\">The expert appraisal witnesses for both sides accepted as a comparable sale, and relied for their valuations upon, the 1997 sale of the \u201cIkea property,\u201d which straddled the boundary between the cites of Emeryville and Oakland. The purchase price for the property was stated in the governing contract as \u201c$21.00 per foot, which equals $14,148,592.92.\u201d However, in pretrial discovery it emerged that Elementis\u2019s appraiser Clevenger set a per-square-foot value of $27.64 on <em>the Emeryville portion </em>of the property. Asked in deposition how he arrived at this <em>figure, he </em>alluded to a contract provision purporting to \u201callocate]]\u201d specified proportions of the purchase price between the Emeryville and Oakland portions of the property.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> When pressed by counsel to explain his reasoning, he merely cited this provision, saying, \u201cThat\u2019s what it says. You didn\u2019t read it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b976-9\">Based on these facts the Agency moved in limine \u201c[t]o preclude evidence contesting the purchase price of. . . the Barbary/Ikea sale at $21 per square foot, or, in the alternative for judicial determination of the purchase price of that sale as intended by the purchase agreement.\u201d The Agency cited, among other things, the rule against \u201cappraising the comparable,\u201d as codified in Evidence Code section 822, subdivision (a)(4) (see p. <em>1102, post). </em>Plaintiff asserted that the cited provision of the contract was probably intended to minimize the seller\u2019s liability for Oakland\u2019s real estate property transfer tax, which had no parallel in Emeryville.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-10\">The trial court denied the motion, writing: \u201cThe plain language of the contract. . . allocates the purchase price between two zones of the property. The trier of fact is entitled to hear and weigh the expert opinions regarding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1101\">*1101</page-number>the allocation and whether there is a fair market value difference between the portion of the [Ikea] property located in Emeryville versus the property located in Oakland.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b977-5\">This was error. The recital as to the \u201callocation\u201d between the two \u201czones\u201d of the property was inadmissible both as direct evidence and as a basis for Clevenger\u2019s expert opinion. To begin with, it was inconsistent with the purpose for which comparable sales are admitted, which is to \u201cgiv[e] the jury the benefit of some <em>\u2018objective \u2019 </em>market evaluation against which to check an appraiser\u2019s valuation [citation].\u201d <em>(People ex rel. Dept. Pub. Wks. v. Reardon </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 507, 515 [93 Cal.Rptr. 852, 483 P.2d 20], italics added.) The <em>objective </em>datum in a real estate sale is the <em>consideration actually given </em>for the <em>property purchased. </em>It is this <em>exchange of values </em>which defines the market and provides an objective benchmark for other exchanges of comparable properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-6\">The only objectively determinable market price in the Ikea contract was the sum agreed to be paid for the property as a whole, i.e., $14,148,592.92. The \u201callocation\u201d provision had no effect on the exchange of values between the parties and carried no assurance that it accurately reflected market forces. Nor did it have any discernible effect on the <em>legal </em>relations of the contracting parties. It was not a contractual undertaking, but a declaratory statement on a matter of no apparent consequence as between the signatories. The law has long distinguished between a \u201ccovenant\u201d which creates legal rights and obligations, and a \u201cmere recital\u201d which a party inserts for his or her own reasons into a contractual instrument. Recitals are given limited effect even as between the parties.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b977-7\">The recital here does not even concern a matter of <em>fact </em>but states at most the <em>opinion </em>of one or both parties that one part of the property is more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1102\">*1102</page-number>valuable than another. Statements of opinion are admissible in evidence only when they satisfy the requirements of Evidence Code section 800 et seq. Evidence Code section 822, subdivision (a)(4) (section 822(a)(4)) renders inadmissible \u201c[a]n opinion as to the value of any property or interest other than that being valued.\u201d The \u201callocation\u201d provision recited an opinion concerning the relative value of two portions of the Ikea property. Since each such portion was a \u201cproperty or property interest other than that being valued\u201d (i.e., other than the Elementis property), the recital was an appraisal of the comparable (or a part thereof) and was inadmissible under section 822(a)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b978-5\">Elementis contends that the allocation provision was admissible on a \u201c \u2018zone of value\u2019 \u201d theory under <em>Mireiter, supra, </em>18 Cal.App.4th 1808, 1818. The question there was whether an appraiser could permissibly derive a value by dividing <em>the condemned property </em>into three \u201czones\u201d and analyzing comparable sales for each. The court\u2019s analysis has no bearing on an attempt, such as the one here, to divide a <em>comparable </em>property into \u201czones\u201d and allocate a purchase price between them. Such an attempt is a patent appraisal of the comparable barred by section 822(a)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b978-6\">Similarly unavailing is Elementis\u2019s citation of <em>People v. University Hill Foundation </em>(1961) 188 Cal.App.2d 327, 333 [10 Cal.Rptr. 437]. The court there found \u201cno prejudicial error\u201d in connection with an appraiser\u2019s testimony purporting to allocate a comparable sale between land and buildings. From the opinion we cannot ascertain the nature of the objection in the trial court or of the point being urged on appeal. In any event the case, like <em>Mireiter, supra, </em>18 Cal.App.4th 1808, fails to mention the rule against appraising the comparable.  \u201cCases are not authority for propositions not considered.\u201d <em>(City of Oakland v. Public Employees \u2019 Retirement System </em>(2002) 95 Cal.App.4th 29, 57 [115 Cal.Rptr.2d 151].)</p>\n<p id=\"b978-7\">Section 822(a)(4) was duly invoked here. It operated not only to bar direct evidence of the \u201callocation\u201d recital, but also to prevent its being \u201ctaken into account as a basis\u201d for appraisal testimony. (\u00a7 822(a)(4).) The trial court erred by permitting the recital to be admitted in evidence and relied upon by the witness Clevenger.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-9\">\n<em>Evidence of Project</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b978-10\">Plaintiff moved in limine to exclude evidence of a development project, generally referred to below as the Emeryville Town Center project, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1103\">*1103</page-number>in which it planned, and had agreed with a developer, to include the subject property. Plaintiff cited the rule that evidence of a specific plan or project is inadmissible to show the value of the subject property. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1263.330 [\u201cThe fair market value of the property taken shall not include any increase or decrease in the value of the property that is attributable to \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 [\u00b6] (a) The project for which the property is taken . . . .\u201d]; <em>Merced Irrigation Dist. v.

Citing <em>City of Los Angeles v. Decker </em>(1977) 18 Cal.3d 860 [135 Cal.Rptr. 647, 558 P.2d 545] <em>(Decker), </em>the court wrote that \u201cevidence of the Emeryville Town Center project\u201d was admissible \u201cto help demonstrate the highest and best use of the property,\u201d and \u201cto rebut plaintiff[\u2019]s contentions that the property is stigmatized and not suitable for development.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b979-6\">This ruling cannot be sustained. In <em>Decker, supra, </em>18 Cal.3d 860, a city sought to condemn land near an airport. The \u201cprincipal valuation issue at trial\u201d was the highest and best use for the property. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 864.) The landowner\u2019s appraiser testified that the highest and best use was airport-related purposes, \u201cespecially parking.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The city\u2019s appraisers testified that the highest and best use was residential. <em>(Ibid.) </em>In argument to the jury, the city\u2019s attorney denied that there was demand for airport parking. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 864-865.) The jury found a value based on residential use. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 865.) Shortly after entry of judgment, the city approved an environmental impact report recommending construction of a parking facility on the property. <em>(Ibid.) </em>It was assumed that the city knew, at the time of trial, that the property was going to be used for a parking lot. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 866.)</p>\n<p id=\"b979-7\">The court considered the \u201cintersection of. . . two rules\u201d <em>(Decker, supra, </em>18 Cal.3d 860, 867), i.e., (1) that \u201ccondemned property is not to be valued as part of the proposed improvement\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 866), and (2) that \u201c \u2018[i]f. . . the condemnor\u2019s proposed use is one of the highest and best uses of the property, the adaptability of the property for that purpose may be shown by the property owner\u2019 \u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 867, quoting 12 Cal. Law Revision Com. Rep. (1974) \u00a7 1263.330, p. 1834). The court reasoned that \u201c[t]he city\u2019s determination as to the adaptability of the property for airport parking purposes was relevant to show that the property in the hands of defendant and not as part of the project could have been used for airport parking.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1104\">*1104</page-number><em>(Decker, </em>at p. 869, italics omitted.) Thus \u201cthe evidence of the city\u2019s determinations as to the need for airport parking and the suitability of defendant\u2019s property for such purpose would have been admissible to show the highest and best use of the property in the hands of defendant.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The court held that the city, through its attorney, committed misconduct warranting reversal. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 871-872.)</p>\n<p id=\"b980-5\">The present case bears virtually no resemblance to <em>Decker, supra, </em>18 Cal.3d 860. There the question of highest and best use was disputed, with the condemnor \u201cden[ying] that the use which it was in fact going to make of the property was the highest and best use,\u201d and \u201ceven conceal[ing] such fact from defendant.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 867.) Here it was undisputed that the highest and best use for the property was mixed commercial use. Nor did the Agency suggest, as the condemner did in <em>Decker, </em>that there was no \u201cneed\u201d for mixed commercial property. Rather counsel for the Agency said, in her opening statement, \u201cNo one disagrees about the highest and best use of this property. Everyone agrees that ultimately this property can be used for some sort of mixed-use commercial/retail development.\u201d Counsel for Elementis said the same thing in his closing jury argument, referring to the property\u2019s \u201chighest and best use, which everyone is agreeing is a mixed-use shopping center.\u201d The court itself, in ruling on another motion in limine, noted that one of defendant\u2019s experts \u201cagree[d] that the highest and best use of the subject property is mixed commercial uses encompassing retail, food and beverage and entertainment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b980-6\">Because these matters were undisputed, the rationale for admitting the evidence in <em>Decker </em>was inapplicable. Other cases cited by defendant are likewise inapposite. In <em>People ex rel. Dept. of Transportation v. Tanczos </em>(1996) 42 Cal.App.4th 1215 [50 Cal.Rptr.2d 70], it was error to exclude evidence of the condemnees\u2019 building plans, because the condemnor made feasibility \u201cthe central issue\u201d by contending that the property could not accommodate a use of the type depicted in the plans. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1219.) Excluding the evidence prevented the condemnees from \u201cdefend[ing] their position [or] challenging] the State\u2019s.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1220.) In <em>People v. La Macchia </em>(1953) 41 Cal.2d 738 [264 P.2d 15], an unspecified \u201cportion\u201d of testimony concerning the condemnees\u2019 plans was properly admitted \u201cas a description of the uses to which the properties were adaptable,\u201d but the majority of the testimony was objectionable as falling \u201csquarely within the rule which prohibits the admission of evidence concerning an owner\u2019s purposes with regard to his property.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 752.) The prejudicial effect of the latter evidence, however, was \u201coffset\u201d by other similar evidence received without objection. <em>(Ibid.) </em>In <em>San Diego Metropolitan Transit Development Bd. v. Cushman </em>(1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 918, 929 [62 Cal.Rptr.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1105\">*1105</page-number>121], evidence of certain diagrams showing where an existing building might be expanded was held admissible in support of a claim for severance damages where it did not constitute evidence of \u201ca specific plan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b981-5\">We believe the lesson of <em>Decker </em>and similar cases is that evidence of specific project plans is inadmissible in the absence of specific facts or points of contention that demonstrably enhance the probative value of the evidence to a point where it outweighs the inherent potential for prejudice. That test is not satisfied merely because the plans \u201cillustrate\u201d or \u201cdemonstrate\u201d an undisputed potential use for the property. If evidence of project plans could be introduced on that rationale, it would seem to be admissible in <em>every </em>case, and the rule to which <em>Decker </em>is an exception would cease to exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-6\">The trial court also indicated that evidence of the Agency\u2019s plans was admissible to rebut the Agency\u2019s evidence that development of the property would encounter <em>barriers </em>such as \u201cstigma\u201d and the costs and risks of hazardous substance remediation and archaeological mitigation. Thus the court said, \u201cI expect there is going to be some expert testimony from the Agency or offered by the Agency that suggests that this is very difficult property, a person or an entity going into the negotiation process for the acquisition of this property would be very concerned about all the downside risks to this property, and it seems to me that it is relevant, [f] And I think <em>Decker </em>permits the defendants in this instance to say, Yes, those are factors to be considered, but it\u2019s also true that good things have happened from the development of similarly situated property in this area or in this vicinity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b981-7\">The court thus concluded that evidence of the Agency\u2019s plans, and apparently of its dealings with the proposed developer, had sufficient probative value with respect to the <em>feasibility of development </em>to outweigh the risk that the jury would improperly consider those plans and dealings in determining value. In fact, however, the <em>Agency\u2019s </em>expectation that <em>it </em>(or a developer aided by it) could surmount obstacles to development had little tendency to show how a hypothetical buyer in the open market would have viewed those obstacles. Almost <em>any </em>property <em>can </em>be developed; the question is at what cost. (See <em>Roemer v. Pappas </em>(1988) 203 Cal.App.3d 201, 210 [249 Cal.Rptr. 743] (conc. opn. of Poch\u00e9, J.) [\u201cAside from the crater of an active volcano, there is probably no piece of land that cannot be developed, given a big enough investment of money and effort.\u201d (Italics omitted.)].) The very function of a redevelopment agency is to restore to productive use properties suffering from \u201cblight,\u201d which can only be developed to productive use with public assistance. (See Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 33030, 33031.) It is thus the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1106\">*1106</page-number>declared policy of the state \u201c[t]hat whenever the redevelopment of blighted areas <em>cannot be accomplished by private enterprise alone, </em>without <em>public participation and assistance </em>in the acquisition of land, in planning and in the <em>financing </em>of land assembly, in the work of clearance, and in the making of improvements necessary therefor, it is in the public interest to employ the power of eminent domain, to <em>advance or expend public funds for these purposes, </em>and to provide a means by which blighted areas may be redeveloped or rehabilitated.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 33037, subd. (b), italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b982-5\">The function and powers of redevelopment agencies, as well as the prescribed conditions for exercising those powers, militate distinctly against the supposition that such an agency\u2019s plans for a property tend to show what a buyer on the open market would expect to pay for developing that same property. Agency counsel here asserted that the project was \u201ctaking such enormous public subsidies that it could never be built by the private market.\u201d If the landowner were free to rely on evidence of the Agency\u2019s intentions to show economic feasibility, it would seem equally logical for the agency to respond with evidence of all the direct and indirect subsidies and other forms of assistance it and other public entities expected to provide in support of the project. The landowner would presumably counterattack with criticism of the Agency\u2019s decisions, perhaps presenting a sample of unguarded comments from records of agency proceedings. The jury would be drawn into something approaching a referendum on the condemnor\u2019s conduct. When the smoke cleared the jury might be prejudiced in any number of ways for or against either party. The surest outcome is that it would have been grossly distracted from the issue at hand, which is the market value of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-6\">The Agency\u2019s plans for the property are admissible only if, and to the extent, they are shown to possess a distinct and substantial probative value <em>other </em>than to establish points on which there is no controversy. Since no such value was ever identified here, it was error to admit evidence of those plans.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-8\">\n<em>Prejudice</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b982-9\">We are satisfied that the foregoing errors require reversal in that, had they not been made, the jury would probably have fixed the fair market value at a figure more favorable to the Agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-10\">Elementis argues that the evidence of Agency purchases was harmless because, of the 25 sales cited by the appraisal witnesses, only three were Agency purchases. Those three purchases, however, seem to have played a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1107\">*1107</page-number>central role in Elementis\u2019s trial strategy. They were the first comparables discussed by counsel in his opening jury summation. They also formed a primary basis for a complex network of prejudicial insinuations concerning the Agency\u2019s conduct before and during trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-5\">One such insinuation, conveyed through questioning of a member of the Agency\u2019s governing board and a member of its staff, suggested that if the price paid for these properties exceeded fair market value, it constituted a \u201cgift\u201d of \u201ctaxpayer funds\u201d or \u201cpublic funds.\u201d This suggestion was inaccurate at best. California law encourages a condemner to make a generous settlement offer before taking any condemnation case to trial, and exposes the condemner to adverse consequences if the offer is found to be unreasonable.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Under the statutory constraints thus imposed, one would expect a prudent condemner to offer its best estimate of fair market value <em>plus </em>some reflection of its own savings from avoiding trial, with a further upward adjustment for elimination of potential liability for the condemnee\u2019s litigation expenses. The chances seem good that such an offer would exceed the fair market value of the property. Indeed courts have recognized that a prospective condemner may well pay a price in lieu of condemnation \u201cmore generous than is required under the Constitution.\u201d <em>(Klopping </em>v. <em>City of Whittier </em>(1972) 8 Cal.3d 39, 51-52, fn.. 4 [104 Cal.Rptr. 1, 500 P.2d 1345]; see <em>South Bay Irr. Dist. </em>v. <em>California-American Water Co. </em>(1976) 61 Cal.App.3d 944, 984 [133 Cal.Rptr. 166] [\u201ca public agency may agree upon a price more favorable to the seller than a private investor would agree upon\u201d]; <em>ibid., </em>quoting the trial judge [\u201c \u2018historically governmental agencies have paid a premium over earnings when acquiring utility properties\u2019 \u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b983-6\">Counsel\u2019s contrary suggestion apparently rests on the concurring opinion in <em>Redevelopment Agency v. Gilmore </em>(1985) 38 Cal.3d 790, 809 [214 Cal.Rptr. 904, 700 P.2d 794], which Elementis quotes in its brief on appeal. There Justice Mosk wrote that \u201cto <em>assess </em>more than just compensation runs the risk of violating the prohibition against making a gift of public funds. (Art. XVI, \u00a7 6.)\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>italics added.) But he was not speaking of purchases in lieu of condemnation; he was speaking of judicial rules awarding excessive compensation in <em>litigated </em>cases. <em>(Ibid) </em>Indeed it was also Justice Mosk who wrote the opinion in <em>Klopping v. City of Whittier, supra, </em>8 Cal.3d 39, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1108\">*1108</page-number>which a unanimous court flatly contradicted the premise that the price paid in lieu of condemnation cannot lawfully exceed fair market value.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-5\">Counsel\u2019s suggestion to the contrary was not only inaccurate but also highly damaging to the Agency\u2019s position. It created obvious impediments to any inference setting a fair market value below what the Agency had paid for neighboring properties. The denials by Agency witnesses of any \u201cgift of public property\u201d strengthened the inference that the prices paid for these properties were in fact at or below fair market value\u2014the very inference proscribed by section 822(a)(1). Counsel sought to reinforce this inference by arguing that these purchases were \u201cAgency-controlled transactions,\u201d presumably meaning that the prices paid must be low because of \u201cwhat happens when you go to fight City Hall.\u201d And should the jurors conclude that any of the sums paid <em>exceeded </em>fair market value, they were faced with the unsavory spectacle of a \u201cgift of public funds.\u201d Counsel also suggested that the price paid for these properties, whether above or below market value, should set a minimum level for the jury\u2019s verdict because otherwise the Agency would have succeeded in perniciously discriminating against Elementis by treating it differently from its neighbors.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-6\">The evidence of Agency purchases also played an implicit role in counsel\u2019s attempts to paint Elementis as the victim of an Agency strategy to suppress evidence of the subject property\u2019s true value. In this context, the Agency\u2019s failure to itself present evidence of its purchases of neighboring properties\u2014a failure reflecting its correct belief that the evidence was categorically inadmissible\u2014supported the overall attack on the credibility of the Agency\u2019s evidence, and that of its appraiser.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-7\">We note that even without these prejudicial inferences, the jury\u2019s finding of fair market value probably rested in significant part on at least one <em>of </em>the subject purchases: the \u201cSepulveda Property,\u201d which was immediately adjacent to the Elementis property. Elementis\u2019s appraiser Clevenger testified that the Sepulveda sale took place in \u201cNovember \u201998, almost right exactly on [the] valuation date\u201d of the Elementis property. He said that the purchase reflected a negotiated \u201cagreement of the market value.\u201d He said that he understood the purchase documents to reflect a belief by the \u201cparties to that transaction . . . that ... a <em>fair market value </em>was being paid.\u201d He also asserted that the Sepulveda property was \u201chighly contaminated with the same kind of material or chemical that the subject property is contaminated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1109\">*1109</page-number>with.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Agency paid $28.50 per square foot for the Sepulveda property. The jury fixed the value of the Elementis property at $29 per square foot. These nearly identical values strongly suggest that the jury weighed the Sepulveda property heavily in its calculations.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-5\">The inference of prejudice that rises from the admission of the Agency purchases takes on added weight from the other errors we have noted. The evidence of the \u201callocation\u201d provision in the Ikea purchase contract was likely to encourage the jury to fix a higher value by providing a seemingly \u201chard\u201d number of $27.64 per square foot\u2014much closer to the found value of the Elementis property ($29) than the actual $21 price, which was the only figure properly drawn from the Ikea contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-6\">Likewise the evidence concerning the Agency\u2019s plans for the condemned property contributed significantly to the overall likelihood that the jury fixed a higher value than it would have allowed in the absence of the errors. In jury argument counsel accused the Agency of using the condemnation of the Elementis property case as a \u201ccost recovery vehicle ... to <em>subsidize its shopping </em>center.\u201d He later returned to this point: \u201cAt the end of the day, they\u2019re trying to undercompensate this property owner in order to <em>subsidize their property, </em>pure and simple, and it\u2019s an end-justifies-the-means mentality which ignores the rights of the property owner, which are the only thing at issue here. The question isn\u2019t whether or not <em>they get to build their shopping center </em>on that property. The question is should we get paid the fair market value.\u201d (Italics added.) Elsewhere counsel cited the intended use to trivialize the Agency\u2019s decontamination efforts, referring to \u201cthe remediation efforts that the City wanted to pursue for its shopping center . . . .\u201d Similarly counsel mocked an offer to purchase the property as \u201cessentially\u201d saying, \u201c\u2018Do our demolition, indemnify us, if there\u2019s any <em>cost overruns in our shopping center project, </em>that\u2019s your responsibility.\u2019 \u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b985-7\">In sum, the improperly admitted evidence had a natural tendency to adversely affect the verdict in a number of respects. Evidence of Agency purchases provided the foundation for raising the issue of a \u201cgift of public funds,\u201d and for all but compelling an inference that the price paid for those properties was no higher than their market value. The Agency\u2019s own failure to rely on those purchases raised an appearance that it was attempting to hide relevant evidence. Those purchases also provided the sole basis for the inflammatory suggestion that Elementis was the victim of unwholesome <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1110\">*1110</page-number>discrimination which the jury ought to remedy with a generous award. Evidence of the \u201callocation\u201d of the Ikea purchase price provided an inflated starting point for the comparison of that purchase to the hypothetical sale of the Elementis property. And the evidence of the Agency\u2019s intended plans for the Elementis property provided a foundation for trivializing the Agency\u2019s performance of its f\u00fcnction and the very substantial hurdles it faced in preparing the subject property for redevelopment. At least in combination, these effects were prejudicial, requiring reversal for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-5\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-6\">\n<em>Fixtures and Equipment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b986-7\">Plaintiff contends that the trial court erred by permitting Elementis to seek compensation of $1,657,148 for fixtures and equipment situated on the condemned property at the time of the taking. Elementis contends that the issue was properly submitted to the jury and that plaintiff suffered no prejudice because the jury only awarded $466,000. We believe any recovery exceeding the salvage value of the equipment violated the principle of \u201cconsistent use,\u201d which was not rendered inapplicable by defendant\u2019s claim of a compensable \u201cinterim use.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b986-8\">Where condemned property includes fixtures or other improvements, they must be \u201ctaken into account in determining compensation.\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1263.210, subd. (a) (section 1263.210(a)).) \u201cTaken into account,\u201d however, does not mean\u2014as defendant\u2019s selective quotation would suggest\u2014that improvements must always be \u201cpaid for by the condemnor.\u201d (Legis. Com. com., 19A West\u2019s Ann. Code Civ. Proc. (1982 ed.) foil. \u00a7 1263.205, p. 24.) Rather, under section 1263.210(a), \u201c[i]f the improvements serve to enhance the value of the property over its unimproved condition, the property receives the enhanced value; if the improvements serve to decrease the value of the property below its unimproved condition, the property suffers the decreased value.\u201d (Cal. Law Revision Com. com., 19A West\u2019s Ann. Code Civ. Proc., <em>supra, </em>foll. \u00a7 1263.210, p. 26.)</p>\n<p id=\"b986-9\">Although we know of no case so stating, we have little doubt that California law incorporates the principle of \u201cconsistent use,\u201d i.e., \u201cthat land cannot be valued based on one use while improvements are valued based on another.\u201d (Appraisal Institute, The Appraisal of Real Estate (12th ed. 2001), p. 324; see <em>Spano </em>v. <em>State of New York </em>(1964) 22 A.D.2d 757 [253 N.Y.S.2d 730] [\u201cIt was error ... to award anything for the value of the buildings while at the same time fixing the land value for commercial usage since the two bases are entirely inconsistent\u201d].) Thus a landowner cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1111\">*1111</page-number>recover compensation based on a use more valuable than the existing one while simultaneously claiming recovery under section 1263.210(a) for existing improvements that are incompatible with that use. This principle would seem inherent in the Law Review Commission\u2019s recognition that improvements can \u201cdecrease the value of the property below its unimproved condition.\u201d (Cal. Law Revision Com. com., 19A West\u2019s Ann. Code Civ. Proc., <em>supra, </em>foil \u00a7 1263.210, p. 26; see also 1 Matteoni &amp; Veit, Condemnation Practice in Cal. (Cont.Ed.Bar 2d ed. through June 2002 update) \u00a7 4.18, p. 109 [\u201cOften, when property is ready for immediate development, the presence of older improvements may actually reduce the property\u2019s value because of the cost of removal.\u201d]; 2 Smith et al., Cal. Civil Practice Real Property Litigation (1994) \u00a7 15:92, p. 115.)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b987-5\">Elementis does not dispute the soundness of this general principle, nor that its factual premise was established here, i.e., the fixtures for which defendant sought compensation were incompatible with the highest and best use on which both parties predicated their appraisals of the property. As defense expert Clevenger conceded, the property could not \u201cbe developed for its highest and best use with the equipment in place.\u201d However, Elementis contends that the rule of consistent use does not bar recovery for the fixtures and equipment here because the existing use could have continued <em>temporarily </em>until the property was ready for development. This prospect of \u201cinterim use,\u201d Elementis contends, enhanced the overall value of the property. For this proposition defendant quotes another section of the same text on which plaintiff relies: \u201cThe use to which a site or improved property is put until it is ready for its highest and best use is called an <em>interim use. </em>Thus, interim use is a <em>current highest and best use </em>that is likely to change in a <em>relatively short time\u2014say, five to seven years.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark><em> </em>(Appraisal Institute, The Appraisal of Real Estate, <em>supra, </em>pp. 323-324, first italics in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b987-6\">Elementis\u2019s claim for the \u201cinterim use\u201d value of the fixtures and equipment runs afoul of the basic proposition that \u201cin eminent domain actions, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1112\">*1112</page-number>\u2018elements affecting value which, while possible, are not reasonably probable, should be excluded.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Humphries Investments, Inc. v. Walsh </em>(1988) 202 Cal.App.3d 766, 772 [248 Cal.Rptr. 800], quoting <em>People v. Ocean Shore Railroad </em>(1948) 32 Cal.2d 406, 426 [196 P.2d 570, 6 A.L.R.2d 1179]; <em>State of Cal. ex rel. State Pub. Wks. Bd. v. Wherity </em>(1969) 275 Cal.App.2d 241, 246 [79 Cal.Rptr. 591].) Thus, in order to justify a finding in Elementis\u2019s favor\u2014or submission of the issue to the jury\u2014there must be substantial evidence that a period of interim use was not only possible, but probable\u2014 probable enough, at any rate, to support an inference that a hypothetical buyer and seller on November 1, 1998, would have added something to the price to reflect this supposed value. Neither the evidence of record nor any offer of proof or argument of counsel contains a sufficient basis for such a finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-5\">A finding of compensable \u201cinterim use\u201d will ordinarily require <em>concrete evidence </em>of circumstances that could reasonably cause a buyer of the <em>particular property at issue </em>to view the presence of incompatible improvements as a net economic benefit rather than a net cost. The facts on which Elementis relied did not approach such a showing. Elementis never identified any concrete physical, legal, or economic obstacle, or other particular cause, that would have been reasonably likely to prevent or deter a developer from entering the property on the day title transferred and commencing the physical process of development. At most, defense counsel and witnesses offered generic assertions that the property\u2019s transition to its highest and best use <em>could </em>be delayed by demolition and remediation and by routine steps in development such as planning the project, obtaining \u201centitlements\u201d (i.e., permits), and financing. Thus when defense expert Gimmy was asked \u201chow would one go about\u201d continuing the existing use while \u201cstill pursuing] a shopping center,\u201d he replied, \u201c[Y]ou have to get entitlements and get the property clean.\u201d But in the absence of some showing to the contrary, \u201cgetting the property clean\u201d would be <em>incompatible </em>with the continued presence of existing improvements. As for \u201centitlements,\u201d defendant made no attempt to show the actual duration or likelihood of any regulatory delay that might reasonably be expected to attend a development of this kind. Gimmy\u2019s testimony only established a <em>maximum </em>delay of three years, with an equally possible <em>minimum </em>delay of <em>one </em>year, or perhaps less. (See fn. 10, <em>ante.) </em>Defense expert Clevenger testified that \u201c[i]n a normal course of events, a developer would buy the property and take <em>two, three years to make the plans, </em>get his plans in shape, to <em>get them </em>approved\u2019 (italics added), but he said nothing about why (or for how long) such a developer would delay in entering and clearing the property in order to be ready to carry those plans into effect. Indeed he never explicitly linked these generic periods of delay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1113\">*1113</page-number>to the \u201cinterim use\u201d claim. His testimony elsewhere cast serious doubt on the substance of that claim by seeming to contemplate a period of interim use intended, at least in part, as an <em>accommodation to the seller, </em>i.e., to permit the orderly shutdown of the existing operation. Nothing in this record supports a belief that such a factor is something for which <em>the buyer </em>would be reasonably likely to pay $1.6 million, or $466,000, or any amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-5\">Moreover, apart from the ultimate conclusion that a buyer would contemplate a period of interim use, Clevenger like Gimmy failed to identify any reasonably probable <em>reason </em>for the buyer of <em>this </em>property to do so. Indeed none of his testimony asserted that a buyer would be <em>likely </em>to do so; instead he spoke in terms of mere possibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-6\">Defense counsel argued to both the court and the jury that a finding of \u201cinterim use\u201d was supported by various periods of time <em>preceding </em>the valuation date. These arguments appear facially unsound, if only because during the cited periods the property was not in the possession of anyone with the power and inclination to undertake immediate development. It would seem far more telling that as soon as the Agency acquired the right to possession, it set about the demolition and removal of all improvements and the radical remediation of the soil, such that by the time of trial the property was apparently almost clean and ready for construction. It is conceivable that some obstacle would have prevented a hypothetical purchaser from proceeding with similar alacrity, but we are directed to no <em>evidence </em>to that effect, and our review of the record has discovered none.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-7\">We conclude that the vague generalities offered by defendant\u2019s experts did not constitute substantial evidence on which to predicate a finding that it was <em>reasonably probable </em>that the prospect of such use would have enhanced, rather than diminished, the value of the land in the eyes of the hypothetical buyer and seller.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-8\">We note other dubieties in the claim for interim use. As defendant\u2019s equipment appraiser freely admitted, the figure he gave for the fixtures, and which was adopted in the appraisals of the property as a whole, was predicated on the supposed value of the fixtures \u201cin place, in use\u201d\u2014the same measure that would have applied if the \u201cinterim\u201d operation were expected to continue <em>for the life of the fixtures.</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Gimmy justified his adoption of this figure only by stating that in his opinion, the equipment appraiser\u2019s \u201caverage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1114\">*1114</page-number>depreciation of 80 percent represented the actual value of <em>that property </em>and <em>its remaining </em>usability.\u201d (Italics added.) But the \u201cinterim value\u201d of the fixtures to the buyer of the property would be a reflection not of their \u201cremaining life\u201d as fixtures, but of their remaining usefulness as a source of income <em>from the underlying real property. </em>We see no evidence from which the jury could have derived this latter value. It is therefore no answer to plaintiffs objection to say that the jury reduced defendant\u2019s claim by nearly three-quarters. There was no basis in this record for the jury to calculate <em>any </em>\u201cinterim use\u201d value for the fixtures and equipment. On the evidence submitted, the verdict necessarily rested on sheer guesswork.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-5\">If defendant\u2019s approach to \u201cinterim use\u201d were sustained, such a claim could apparently be submitted in <em>every case </em>where property with existing business-related improvements is taken for redevelopment to a higher and better use. After eliciting generalizations from its experts about possible delays in development, a landowner could recover the value of the real estate at a higher and better use than the one he has made, while adding in a claim for fixtures and improvements which are incompatible with that use.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-6\">At its core the concept of interim use is intended for situations where property is <em>in the process of transition </em>from a less valuable to a more valuable use, e.g., from agricultural to residential development. The property is worth more because of its <em>future </em>use, but market forces may not yet have reached the point where it is economical to make the transition. The property is essentially held as an <em>investment </em>for eventual development to the higher use. During this period the continuation of the past, soon-to-be-displaced use is valuable for helping to defray the carrying costs that would otherwise be incurred by the buyer. (See Matteoni &amp; Veit, Condemnation Practice in Cal., <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 4.18, p. 106 [\u201cAlthough the highest and best use may be reasonably near, development to that use may not be immediate.\u201d]; <em>id. </em>at p. 107, [\u201cIncome generated by property that is in a <em>state of transition </em>to a higher use is sometimes referred to as <em>carrying value </em>because it permits a developer to pay his <em>holding costs </em>(e.g., taxes, purchase loan, interest) during the interim period\u201d (italics added)]; <em>In re Moceo </em>(Bankr. D.N.J. 1998) 222 B.R. 440, 457-458 [under New Jersey law, \u201cinterim use\u201d means period during which property destined for higher use is \u201ch[e]ld for future development\u201d until \u201cdemolition and re-development is economically feasible\u201d (italics added)]; <em>Woods v. State </em>(1971) 36 A.D.2d 572 [317 N.Y.S.2d 782, 783] [where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1115\">*1115</page-number>condemned acreage was surrounded by developed land and was served by utilities, agricultural use on which condemner\u2019s expert based valuation was \u201cproperly rejected by the court except as an interim use\u201d]; <em>Pascack Motel, Inc, v. State </em>(1972) 40 A.D.2d 919, 920 [338 N.Y.S.2d 204, 206] [award for interim use allowed, though reduced to reflect \u201cincome approach,\u201d where appraisers agreed that highest and best use was <em>\u201cfuture </em>development as a shopping center or modem high rise motel\u201d (italics added)].)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> This policy would not be served by permitting a landowner to assert a claim for \u201cinterim use\u201d based on the mere suggestion that development to a higher and better use <em>might </em>or \u201ccould\u201d be delayed by routine steps in the development process, without a concrete showing that the delay would probably appear, to a hypothetical buyer and seller, sufficiently likely and lengthy to support a price enhancement based on \u201cinterim use.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b991-5\">Defendant also asserts that an award for fixtures and equipment was authorized by <em>Redevelopment Agency v. First Christian Church </em>(1983) 140 Cal.App.3d 690 [189 Cal.Rptr. 749] and <em>City of Los Angeles v. Hughes </em>(1927) 202 Cal. 731 [262 P. 737]. Neither of these cases has any discernible relevance to the issues before us. Nor do we perceive any inequity in rejecting defendant\u2019s claim for the supposed value of fixtures. Defendant received compensation in the form of a valuation predicated on higher and better use than it had ever seen fit to make of the property. It was not entirely deprived of the value of the fixtures; only of their value to a use which would inevitably be discontinued because it was incompatible with the property\u2019s economic destiny. Plaintiff\u2019s demolition contractor testified that he received about $30,000 in salvage for electrical equipment, which was the only salvageable equipment on the site, and about $138,000 for \u201cscrap material,\u201d the exact origins of which are unclear. On this record, this was all the value the improvements possessed, and all the value defendant was entitled to claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-6\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-7\">\n<em>Goodwill</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b991-8\">In its cross-appeal, Elementis contends that the trial court erred by refhsing to permit it to present evidence of, and seek an award for, loss of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1116\">*1116</page-number>goodwill. Elementis contends it presented evidence from which the jury could have found that it sustained such losses. In response the Agency asks us to adopt a rule under which the trial court determines threshold issues governing the <em>entitlement </em>to goodwill, and only if it finds those conditions present, submits to the jury questions of <em>amount. </em>The Agency further argues that whether or not we prescribe such a rule, the trial court acted properly in excluding the claim for goodwill. We hold that the trial court properly withheld this element of compensation from the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-5\">Prior to the enactment of Code of Civil Procedure section 1263.510, subdivision (a) (section1263.510(a)), loss of goodwill was not recoverable in eminent domain proceedings. <em>(Chhour </em>v. <em>Community Redevelopment Agency </em>(1996) 46 Cal.App.4th 273, 278 [53 Cal.Rptr.2d 585]; <em>Community Development Com. v. Asaro </em>(1989) 212 Cal.App.3d 1297, 1301-1302 [261 Cal.Rptr. 231].) The statute changed that rule to allow recovery, provided that the property owner demonstrates the presence of four threshold conditions, including that \u201c[t]he loss is caused by the taking of the property or the injury to the remainder\u201d (\u00a7 1263.510(a)(1)) and that \u201c[c]ompensation for the loss will not be duplicated in the compensation otherwise awarded to the owner\u201d (\u00a7 1263.510(a)(4)). The court below concluded that defendant\u2019s claim satisfied neither of these requirements, i.e., that any loss of goodwill was caused not by the taking, but by the property\u2019s transition to a higher use, and that to allow recovery for loss of goodwill would duplicate the valuation of the property for such higher use.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-6\">The first question is whether the trial court properly determined defendant\u2019s entitlement to goodwill rather than submitting that issue to the jury.  The question arises because the general rule in eminent domain actions is that \u201c \u2018[t]he right to a jury trial . . . goes <em>only </em>to the <em>amount </em>of compensation.\u2019\u201d <em>(Redevelopment Agency v. Contra Costa Theatre, Inc. </em>(1982) 135 Cal.App.3d 73, 80 [185 Cal.Rptr. 159]; see Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 19; <em>People v. Ricciardi </em>(1943) 23 Cal.2d 390, 402 [144 P.2d 799] <em>(Ricciardi).) </em>\u201cAll other questions of fact, or mixed fact and law, are to be tried . . . without reference to a jury.\u201d <em>(Ricciardi, </em>at p. 402; see <em>Pacific Gas &amp; E. Co. v. Peterson </em>(1969) 270 Cal.App.2d 434, 438 [75 Cal.Rptr. 673] [\u201cthe issue of the defendant\u2019s damages\u201d goes to the jury, and \u201call other issues of law <em>or fact </em>must be decided by the court\u201d (italics added)].)</p>\n<p id=\"b992-7\">Consistent with this rule, the court, rather than the jury, typically decides questions concerning the preconditions to recovery of a particular type of compensation, even if the determination turns on contested issues of fact. Perhaps most analogous for present purposes is the rule applicable to claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1117\">*1117</page-number>for \u201cseverance damages,\u201d i.e., harm caused to the landowner\u2019s remaining property when only a part of the property is condemned. <em>(City of San Diego v. Neumann </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 738, 741 [25 Cal.Rptr.2d 480, 863 P.2d 725].) As codified in Code of Civil Procedure section 1263.410, subdivision (a), the right to such damages is conditioned on a determination that \u201cthe property taken is part of a larger parcel.\u201d The determination whether this condition is present in a particular case is entrusted to the trial court. <em>(Neumann, supra, </em>6 Cal.4th at p. 745; <em>People ex rel. Dept. Pub. Wks. </em>v. <em>L. A. County Flood etc. Dist. </em>(1967) 254 Cal.App.2d 470, 477 [62 Cal.Rptr. 287]; <em>City of Stockton v. Marengo </em>(1934) 137 Cal.App. 760, 765 [31 P.2d 467].) Although the question has often been described as one of \u201claw\u201d (see <em>Neumann, supra, </em>6 Cal.4th at p. 745; <em>People ex rel. Dept. Pub. Wks. v. L. A. County Flood etc. Dist., supra, </em>254 Cal.App.2d at p. 477; cf. <em>Marengo, supra, </em>137 Cal.App. at p. 765 [\u201cessentially a question of law\u201d]), it is decided by the court even if it involves issues of fact (see <em>People ex rel. Dept. Pub. Wks. v. Nyrin </em>(1967) 256 Cal.App.2d 288, 292 [63 Cal.Rptr. 905] [\u201cWhat constitutes a single parcel of land in the contemplation of section 1248 is essentially a question of law [citation] but may involve issues of fact. [Citations.] .... Insofar as the evidence is subject to opposing inferences, it must upon a review thereof, be regarded in the light most favorable to the ruling of the trial court.\u201d]; <em>People ex rel. Dept. Pub. Wks. </em>v. <em>International Tel. &amp; Tel. Corp. </em>(1972) 22 Cal.App.3d 829, 833-834 [99 Cal.Rptr. 836] [trial court ruled \u201cas matter of law\u201d that property taken and property remaining did not possess \u201cunity of use\u201d; reviewing court found \u201cample evidence to support the court\u2019s findings of fact with regard to the use of the property\u201d]). The same is true of at least some other issues touching on the threshold entitlement to severance damages. Thus, where a landowner seeks compensation for impairment of access to a remaining easement, \u201cthe question of whether access rights are impaired is a question for the court.\u201d <em>(People ex rel. Dept. Pub. Wks. v. L. A. County Flood etc. Dist., supra, </em>254 Cal.App.2d at p. 477; <em>Ricciardi, supra, </em>23 Cal.2d at pp. 402-403; see <em>Pacific Gas &amp; E. Co. v. Peterson, supra, </em>270 Cal.App.2d 434 at pp. 437-438 [after finding on substantial evidence that landowner had no prescriptive avigation easement over neighbor\u2019s fields, trial court properly withheld claim from jury].)</p>\n<p id=\"b993-6\">Apparently seeking to counterbalance this weighty body of authority, defendant cites <em>Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority v. Continental Development Corp. </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 694, 718 [66 Cal.Rptr.2d 630, 941 P.2d 809], for the proposition that \u201cthe question of whether a property owner is <em>entitled </em>to compensation for severance damages presents a question of fact for the jury.\u201d (Defendant\u2019s italics.) An examination of that opinion reveals that it involved no issue of threshold \u201centitlement\u201d as considered here and in the cases cited above. Rather it was solely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1118\">*1118</page-number>concerned with the correct <em>measure </em>of damages\u2014in particular, the extent to which the condemnor was entitled to a <em>setoff </em>against severance damages based on evidence that the taking would ultimately enhance the value of the remaining property. (See <em>id. </em>at p. 702 et seq.) It was in this context that the court issued its holding, a fragment of which is quoted by defendant: \u201cWe hold that in determining a landowner\u2019s <em>entitlement to severance damages, </em>the fact finder henceforth shall consider competent evidence relevant to any conditions caused by the project that affect the remainder property\u2019s fair market value, insofar as such evidence is neither conjectural nor speculative.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 718, italics added.) It is clear that this use of the term \u201centitlement\u201d was less than precise, and that the only issue actually considered was the <em>amount </em>of severance damages when the statutory conditions for recovery are present.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-5\">Similarly, Elementis cites a number of decisions in which, it asserts, the issue of entitlement to lost goodwill was submitted to the jury. <em>(Redevelopment Agency v. Thrifty Oil Co. </em>(1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 469 [5 Cal.Rptr.2d 687] <em>(Thrifty Oil); People ex rel. Dept. of Transportation v. Salami </em>(1991) 2 Cal.App.4th 37 [2 Cal.Rptr.2d 833] <em>(Salami); People ex rel. Dept. of Transportation v. Muller </em>(1984) 36 Cal.3d 263 [203 Cal.Rptr. 772, 681 P.2d 1340]; <em>Redevelopment Agency v. Arvey Corp. </em>(1992) 3 Cal.App.4th 1357, 1364-1365 [5 Cal.Rptr.2d 161].) None of these cases addressed, or even acknowledged the existence of, the issue before us. In <em>Thrifty Oil, supra, 4 </em>Cal.App.4th at pages 476-477, the closest question addressed was whether the evidence at trial required a larger award than was made by the jury. The particular sentence quoted by defendant alludes in passing to \u201centitlement,\u201d but is not even <em>dictum </em>on the point in question because no question was raised or acknowledged as to whether the jury should decide that issue. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 476.)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In <em>Salami, supra, </em>2 Cal.App.4th at pages 40-41, 45-46, the parties <em>stipulated </em>that the statutory conditions for recovery of goodwill were present; the question on appeal was whether the trial court erroneously placed upon the landowner the burden of proving the <em>amount </em>of goodwill lost. In <em>Muller, supra, </em>36 Cal.3d at pages 269-271, the only question considered was whether loss of excess income was a form (or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1119\">*1119</page-number>proper measure) of \u201cgoodwill\u201d under section 1263.510. And in <em>Arvey, supra, </em>3 Cal.App.4th at pages 1364-1365, the question was how to treat elements of goodwill that were compensable under the Relocation Assistance Act (Gov. Code, \u00a7 7260 et seq.). We again note that cases are not authority on points they do not consider. <em>(City of Oakland v. Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System, supra, </em>95 Cal.App.4th at p. 57.)</p>\n<p id=\"b995-5\">Elementis also notes that BAJI No. 11.91 contemplates submission to the jury of the issue of entitlement to goodwill, and that the instruction was cited approvingly in <em>Thrifty Oil, supra, 4 </em>Cal.App.4th at page 478, and <em>Redevelopment Agency v. Metropolitan Theatres Corp. </em>(1989) 215 Cal.App.3d 808, 810 [263 Cal.Rptr. 637]. But again, neither of those cases presented any issue of whether the instruction accurately reflected the law. The latter case, like <em>Salami, supra, </em>2 Cal.App.4th 37, concerned the allocation of the burden of proof on the question of the <em>amount </em>of lost goodwill. <em>(Redevelopment Agency v. Metropolitan Theatres Corp., supra, </em>215 Cal.App.3d at p. 811.)</p>\n<p id=\"b995-6\">Given that the conditions in section 1263.510(a) go to the entitlement to recover a <em>type </em>of compensation, we see no reason to treat them differently from the preconditions for the recovery of severance damages. We therefore hold that where the presence of these conditions is disputed, the determination of that dispute, including the resolution of any disputed factual issues, is for the trial court. Only upon proving to the court\u2019s satisfaction that the statutory conditions are satisfied may the landowner present evidence of lost goodwill to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-7\">Here no error appears in the trial court\u2019s determination that the statutory conditions were not present. Section 1263.510(a)(1) requires a finding that the claimed loss of goodwill was \u201ccaused by the taking of the property.\u201d Plaintiff contended below, and the trial court found, that any loss of goodwill here was caused not by the taking but by the inevitable transition of the property to the higher and better use to which both sides agreed it was destined, and with which the continued operation of defendant\u2019s business was incompatible. The court also found that since the defendant was being compensated for the land at a value predicated on this higher and better use, rather than at a lower value consistent with continued operation of its business, any award of goodwill would be incompatible with the property valuation, would amount to a windfall, and would duplicate \u201ccompensation otherwise awarded to the owner.\u201d (\u00a7 1263.510(a)(4).)</p>\n<p id=\"b995-8\">Defendant does not comprehensibly dispute the general soundness of this reasoning but asserts that it was inapplicable here because there was evidence to the effect that in a private sale, the business would have continued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1120\">*1120</page-number>for some unspecified period as an \u201cinterim use\u201d of the property while defendant made an orderly transition to its new location. No authority is offered for this theory, which we have already rejected in another context. (See pt., V., <em>ante) </em>We also note that any such negotiated temporary extension would seem to constitute an accommodation to the seller, which would presumably be reflected in some corresponding shift of values in favor of the buyer. Since defendant\u2019s appraisers made no attempt to include any such adjustment in their valuation of the property, we agree with plaintiff and the trial court that allowance of the goodwill claim, even if otherwise sound, would on its face have effected a windfall incompatible with defendant\u2019s theory of value.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-5\">No error appears in the denial of damages for lost goodwill.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-6\">VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-7\">\n<em>Assessment Lien</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b996-8\">Defendant\u2019s second contention on cross-appeal is that the trial court erred by deducting $332,228 from the verdict on account of an unpaid special assessment lien. Defendant\u2019s argument on this point is without merit. It rests largely on the fact that the Agency failed to join the City, as lienholder, in this action. This was undoubtedly a failure to comply with Code of Civil Procedure section 1250.250, subdivision (b), which provides that \u201c[t]he holder of a lien that secures a special assessment or a bond representing the special assessment shall be named as a defendant, regardless of the nature of the special assessment and the manner of collection of the special assessment.\u201d It hardly follows from this mandate, however, that if the lienholder is not joined in the action, the balance of the lien goes <em>to the landowner. </em>Such a result would violate a clear statutory mandate, as well as basic principles of logic and fairness.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-9\">Code of Civil Procedure section 1265.250, subdivision (b) (section 1265.250(b)), provides, \u201cIf property acquired by eminent domain is encumbered by the lien of a fixed lien special assessment or of a bond representing the fixed lien special assessment. [\u00b6] (1) <em>The amount of the lien shall be paid to the lienholder from the award or withheld from the award for payment </em>pursuant to Section 1265.220.\u201d (Italics added.) Code of Civil Procedure section 1265.220 provides, \u201cWhere property acquired by eminent domain is encumbered by a lien and the indebtedness secured thereby is not due at the time of the entry of judgment, <em>the amount of such </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1121\">*1121</page-number><em>indebtedness may be, at the option of the plaintiff, deducted from the judgment and the lien shall be continued until such indebtedness is paid', </em>but the amount for which, as between the plaintiff and the defendant, the plaintiff is liable under Article 5 (commencing with Section 1268.410) of Chapter 11 may not be deducted from the judgment.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b997-5\">Defendant\u2019s only comment on section 1265.250(b) is that it cannot \u201cpreempt\u201d the requirement of Code of Civil Procedure section 1250.250, subdivision (b) that the lienholder be joined as a party. Of course there is no issue of \u201cpreemption.\u201d Nor is there a statutory conflict or ambiguity on which to predicate an exercise in interpretation. Code of Civil Procedure section 1250.250 requires joinder of the lienholder, but it does not remotely suggest that noncompliance is penalized by requiring the condemner to pay the condemnee a windfall. Rather, the effect of noncompliance is that the condemnor takes the property subject to the lien. (Cal. Law Revision Com. com., 1980 Amendment, 19 West\u2019s Ann. Code Civ. Proc. (1982 ed.) foll. \u00a7 1250.50, p. 647 [failure to join lienholder \u201cleaves the lien unimpaired\u201d].) Since the condemner or its transferee must thus eventually pay the lien (or suffer its satisfaction by foreclosure), it would be irrational to require that the condemner also pay the balance of the lien to the condemnee. This would amount to the imposition of a forfeiture on the public fisc with no discernible basis in statutory language, legal principle, or policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-6\">If Elementis is concerned about the nonjoinder of the lienholder, it is free to seek appropriate relief based on that fact. (See Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 389 [joinder of indispensable parties].) We also observe that on remand, the Agency may seek to remedy its noncompliance with Code of Civil Procedure section 1250.250, subdivision (b) and that upon its failure to do so, the trial court may be empowered to craft appropriate relief on its own motion, if necessary to effect complete justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-7\">VIII.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-8\">\n<em>Archaeological Mitigation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b997-9\">The Agency contends that the trial court erred by allowing Elementis to challenge the measures adopted by the Agency to mitigate damage to the archaeological resources on the property, which consist of a Native <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1122\">*1122</page-number>American shellmound and human remains. The Agency contends that these measures cannot be challenged in this proceeding because they were adopted pursuant to an environmental impact report (EIR) of which Elementis, or any other interested party, could have sought judicial review under CEQA. We find this objection unsound. The question before the jury was not whether the environmental impact report complied with CEQA, but how much the hypothetical buyer and seller would have deducted from the price on November 1, 1998, had they known the facts available at trial. (See <em>Mireiter, supra, </em>18 Cal.App.4th 1808, 1812.) Elementis\u2019s argument, as we understand it, was that the Agency\u2019s treatment of archaeological resources <em>exceeded </em>the requirements of CEQA\u2014a point which could well have evaded judicial review had the EIR been challenged. It also seems likely that the Agency itself had the dominant role in formulating the EIR and approving its terms. The Agency\u2019s argument could effectively empower it to adopt any measures it chose and then seek de facto reimbursement from a condemnee while withholding from the jury any question whether its expenditures actually reflect what a reasonable buyer and seller would have anticipated.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-5\">We recognize that evidence of this kind poses an obvious, risk of consuming excessive time and judicial resources. The remedy for that risk must be sought in such provisions as Evidence Code section 352.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-6\">IX.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-7\">\n<em>Other Issues</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b998-8\">The Agency contends that the trial court abused its discretion by refusing to assign this case to a single judge for all purposes. While we believe that the size and complexity of this case make it a suitable candidate for such treatment, we cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion in concluding otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-9\">In case Nos. A091716 and A093126 the Agency contends that the trial court erred by awarding attorney fees and costs to Elementis. The Agency concedes that reversal of the judgment renders these issues moot. Since they are unlikely to recur in exactly the same way on remand, no purpose would be served by further analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-10\">Also moot is the Agency\u2019s contention that the trial court erred by excluding evidence of the Agency\u2019s expenditures in \u201cremediating\u201d the contaminated soil on the subject property, and by staying a portion of the judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1123\">*1123</page-number>pending disposition of a federal action by the Agency to recover such costs from Elementis and others. We are far from satisfied that this objection was preserved for appeal, but in any event it cannot arise in the same form on remand because, as the parties have apprised us, they have reached a settlement in the federal lawsuit on which the trial court\u2019s ruling was predicated. The effect of this settlement and other posttrial events on the determination of just compensation appears to depend, at least potentially, on extrinsic evidence as well as legal questions of first impression which have not been tried or briefed. These questions therefore cannot be usefully addressed on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b999-6\">In case No. A090932, the judgment is reversed for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. Case Nos. A091716 and A093126 are dismissed as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-7\">Kay, P. J., and Reardon, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-8\">Respondent\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied November 13, 2002.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b968-9\">A month earlier Elementis had sued the Agency and the City for inverse condemnation, breach of contract, and deprivation of civil rights.
