The drawing was displayed as part of a year-end exhibition of student art in CalArts\u2019s main gallery for approximately 24 hours. Herberg, along with her daughter Bobette Heuer and her granddaughter Deborah Dutro (also CalArts employees), sued CalArts for sexual harassment under the California Fair Employment and Housing Act, Government Code section 12940 et seq. (FEHA),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> alleging the display of the drawing created a hostile working environment. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of CalArts. We affirm the judgment of the trial court because the undisputed facts establish the alleged harassment was not sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the plaintiffs\u2019 employment and create a hostile work environment.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">CalArts is a private, postsecondary educational institution offering degree programs in the fine and performing arts. In May 1999, Herberg was 82 years old and worked as a cashier in the accounting office at CalArts. Her daughter, Heuer, was the director of financial aid at CalArts. Heuer\u2019s daughter, Dutro, was the purchasing and production manager at CalArts\u2019s office of public affairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">CalArts\u2019s policy on censorship is contained in its administrative manual: \u201cA. CalArts does not censor <em>any </em>work on the basis of content; nor is <em>any </em>work at the Institute subject to prior censorship, [\u00b6] B. If any person objects to any exhibit or presentation, that person should convey the objection in writing to the student\u2019s dean. The person will receive a written answer to the objection within 48 hours of its receipt. If the person is dissatisfied with the decision, he/she may appeal it to the [Exhibit Review] Committee. The decision of the Committee is final.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">CalArts\u2019s staff handbook, student handbook and administrative manual all state that it is CalArts\u2019s \u201cofficial policy\u201d to maintain a workplace free of all forms of unlawful harassment. The policy is also contained in a separate booklet titled \u201cPolicy on Sexual Harassment.\u201d The booklet, the student handbook and the administrative manual also state, \u201cThe content of artistic and intellectual property is protected by the constitutional right to free speech. It is not the intention of the sexual harassment policy to intrude on that right.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b119-8\">CalArts requires its first year art students to take an introductory course known as Foundation Art Class. During the 1998-1999 academic year, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>students in the Foundation Art Class were permitted to exhibit their own creative work as part of an end-of-the-year show at CalArts\u2019s main gallery. Pursuant to CalArts\u2019s policy, Foundation Art Class students were not required to obtain approval from anyone before exhibiting their work in the main gallery.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">In the early morning hours of May 13, 1999, two students in the Foundation Art Class, Jeremy Ringermacher and Ariel Rosenberg, exhibited a piece they titled The Last Art Piece. The Last Art Piece is a pencil drawing, about 25 by 40 inches, depicting Herberg and other CalArts faculty, staff and students engaged in various sexual acts. Herberg appears in the center of the drawing, bare-breasted and facing the viewer. She is depicted sitting on top of a nude male faculty member, straddling his groin as though the two were engaged in sexual intercourse.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">Soon after she arrived at work on May 13,1999, Dutro was approached by her supervisor, Anita Bonnell. Bonnell was upset and told Dutro there was a display in the main gallery that depicted Dutro\u2019s grandmother and Dutro should go see it. As Dutro made her way to the main gallery to see the drawing, she met Lynn Rosenfeld, the secretary of CalArts\u2019s president Steve Lavine. Rosenfeld told Dutro \u201c \u2018the Institute was aware of it and that it was being taken care of.\u2019\u201d Dutro was quite upset when she saw the drawing. Dutro returned to her office and complained to her supervisor.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">Heuer found out about The Last Art Piece at 11:00 that morning when she was called into the office of CalArts\u2019s provost, Beverly O\u2019Neill. Myma Saltzberg, director of human resources, was also present. O\u2019Neill told Heuer that a student drawing had been displayed that depicted Heuer\u2019s mother in a \u201cvulgar\u201d way. O\u2019Neill and Saltzberg suggested that Heuer take her mother out of town for the weekend so her mother would not see the drawing. Heuer was embarrassed and left the meeting in tears.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">After her meeting with O\u2019Neill and Saltzberg, Heuer went to the main gallery and saw the drawing for the first time. She was \u201chorrified and embarrassed.\u201d Others present in the gallery also appeared to be outraged by the drawing, including a person who told Heuer, \u201c \u2018If it were my mother, I would tear that painting off the wall.\u2019\u201d Heuer returned to her office and called her husband in tears. He promised to consult an attorney about trying to have The Last Art Piece removed from the gallery.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b120-8\">After lunch, CalArts\u2019s vice-president of administration, Dean Houchin, came to Heuer\u2019s office, told her he felt \u201cvery badly\u201d about what had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>happened and explained the proper procedure for objecting to the display of The Last Art Piece. In Houchin\u2019s presence, Heuer wrote down her objections to the drawing and a request that it be removed. Houchin promised to present the objection to the dean of the art school and to ask that the process be expedited. Heuer also personally protested the display of The Last Art Piece to CalArts\u2019s provost and human resources director.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\">About 1:00 p.m., Heuer and Dutro called Herberg and asked her to come to Heuer\u2019s office, where they told her about The Last Art Piece.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Herberg did not see the drawing; nevertheless, she was so upset by the information about the drawing that she left work immediately. Herberg suffered an asthma attack later that afternoon and subsequently developed problems with eating and sleeping. She never returned to her job at CalArts.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">Later in the afternoon of May 13, 1999, Heuer returned to the main gallery and saw 10 to 15 students and faculty members viewing The Last Art Piece. Heuer was again upset to the point of weeping. By this time, The Last Art Piece had provoked a substantial controversy among CalArts\u2019s faculty, students and staff. Two members of the staff wrote to the dean of the art school asking that the drawing be removed. Throughout the day, the student artists participated in formal and informal critique sessions about The Last Art Piece and its effect on Herberg and the rest of the CalArts community.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">A reception held in the main gallery that evening was attended by about 100 people. Heuer, her husband and Dutro returned to the main gallery in the late evening to see if The Last Art Piece had been removed. It had not.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">About 4:00 a.m. on May 14, 1999, Rosenberg voluntarily removed the drawing from the main gallery because he and cocreator Ringermacher \u201cfelt that our point had been made and the sketch had served its purpose.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Rosenberg wrote a letter of apology to Herberg several days later. Despite the fact that the drawing had been removed, the committee met on May 17, 1999 to address Heuer\u2019s complaint. The committee held an open forum to address the situation on May 21, 1999, with CalArts\u2019s president Lavine presiding. The committee subsequently reconvened and determined that CalArts had acted in accordance with its policy regarding censorship and in furtherance of its educational goals. The Last Art Piece has not been displayed since, and a student who tried to display it at the May 21 forum was prevented from doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>Herberg, Heuer and Dutro, as well as Sharon Yeates, another staff member depicted in The Last Art Piece, filed suit against CalArts on January 24, 2000.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Their complaint alleged \u201cInvasion of Privacy-Misappropriation of Image or Likeness\u201d and employment discrimination under FEHA.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">On December 19, 2000, the trial court granted CalArts\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Judgment was entered in favor of CalArts on January 10, 2001. This appeal followed.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">\n<em>Standard of Review.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">The standard of review on appeal after an order granting summary judgment is well settled. \u201cA trial court properly grants summary judgment where no triable issue of material fact exists and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subd. (c).) We review the trial court\u2019s decision de novo, considering all of the evidence the parties offered in connection with the motion (except that which the court properly excluded) and the uncontradicted inferences the evidence reasonably supports. <em>(Artiglio </em>v. <em>Corning Inc. </em>(1998) 18 Cal.4th 604, 612 [76 Cal.Rptr.2d 479, 957 P.2d 1313].) In the trial court, once a moving defendant has \u2018shown that one or more elements of the cause of action, even if not separately pleaded, cannot be established,\u2019 the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show the existence of a triable issue; to meet that burden, the plaintiff \u2018may not rely upon the mere allegations or denials of its pleadings . . . but, instead, shall set forth the specific facts showing that a triable issue of material fact exists as to that cause of action . . . .\u2019 (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subd. (o)(2); see <em>Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 854-855 [107 Cal.Rptr.2d 841, 24 P.3d 493].)\u201d <em>[Merrill v. Navegar, Inc. </em>(2001) 26 Cal.4th 465, 476-477 [110 Cal.Rptr.2d 370, 28 P.3d 116].)</p>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">In reviewing the evidence, we strictly construe the moving party\u2019s evidence and liberally construe the opposing party\u2019s and accept as undisputed only those portions of the moving party\u2019s evidence that are uncontradicted. \u201cOnly when the inferences are indisputable may the court decide the issues as a matter of law. If the evidence is in conflict, the factual issues must be resolved by trial.\u2018Any doubts about the propriety of summary judgment. . . are generally resolved <em>against </em>granting the motion, because that allows the future development of the case and avoids errors.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Binder v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number><em>Aetna Life Ins. Co. </em>(1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 832, 839 [89 Cal.Rptr.2d 540]; see also <em>Katz </em>v. <em>Chevron Corp. </em>(1994) 22 Cal.App.4th 1352, 1365 [27 Cal.Rptr.2d 681] [\u201cdoubts as to the propriety of granting the motion should be resolved in favor of the opposing party\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">\n<em>The Trial Court Correctly Granted Summary Judgment on Plaintiffs \u2019 Sexual Harassment Claim Under FEHA Because the 24-hour Display of The Last Art Piece Did Not Constitute \u201cSevere or Pervasive \u201d Harassment.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">Section 12940, subdivision (j)(l), makes it unlawful for \u201can employer ... or any other person, because of . . . sex ... to harass an employee.\u201d Section 12940, subdivision (k), provides an employer must \u201ctake all reasonable steps necessary to prevent discrimination and harassment from occurring.\u201d Herberg, Heuer and Dutro contend CalArts violated those provisions by permitting two of its students to display The Last Art Piece in the main gallery for approximately 24 hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-9\">Both FEHA and the parallel provisions of title VII of the federal Civil Rights Act of 1964 recognize two theories of liability for sexual harassment claims. <em>(Kohler </em>v. <em>Inter-Tel Technologies </em>(9th Cir. 2001) 244 F.3d 1167, 1172; <em>Fisher </em>v. <em>San Pedro Peninsula Hospital </em>(1989) 214 Cal.App.3d 590, 606 [262 Cal.Rptr. 842] (Fisher) [in analyzing sexual harassment claims under FEHA, California courts look to federal decisions regarding sexual harassment claims under title VII of the federal Civil Rights Act of 1964].) \u201cThe first is quid pro quo harassment, where a term of employment is conditioned upon submission to unwelcome sexual advances. The second is hostile work environment, where the harassment is sufficiently pervasive so as to alter the conditions of employment and create an abusive work environment.\u201d <em>(Mogilefsky v. Superior Court </em>(1993) 20 Cal.App.4th 1409, 1414 [26 Cal.Rptr.2d 116]; see also <em>Kohler </em>v. <em>Inter-Tel Technologies, supra, </em>244 F.3d at p. 1172.)  This case deals solely with \u201chostile work environment\u201d sexual harassment. Plaintiffs contend the display of The Last Art Piece constituted such severe and pervasive harassment because of sex that it substantially altered the conditions of their employment and created an abusive work environment. (See <em>Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson </em>(1986) 477 U.S. 57, 67 [106 S.Ct. 2399, 2406, 91 L.Ed.2d 49] [\u201cFor sexual harassment to be actionable, it must be sufficiently severe or pervasive \u2018to alter the conditions of [the victim\u2019s] employment and create an abusive working environment.\u2019 \u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b123-10\">\u201cWhether the sexual conduct complained of is sufficiently pervasive to create a hostile or offensive work environment must be determined from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>the totality of the circumstances. [Citation.] The plaintiff must prove that the defendant\u2019s conduct would have interfered with a reasonable employee\u2019s work performance and would have seriously affected the psychological well-being of a reasonable employee and that she was actually offended. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Fisher, supra, </em>214 Cal.App.3d at pp. 609-610, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">Factors to be considered in evaluating the totality of the circumstances include (1) the nature of the unwelcome sexual acts or words (with physical touching generally considered more offensive than mere words); (2) the frequency of the offensive acts or encounters; (3) the total number of days over which all the offensive conduct occurred; and (4) the context in which the sexually harassing conduct occurred. <em>(Fisher, supra, </em>214 Cal.App.3d at pp. 609-610; <em>Etter </em>v. <em>Veriflo Corp. </em>(1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 457, 465 [79 Cal.Rptr.2d 33].)  Applying these factors to the undisputed facts in the present case, the display of The Last Art Piece in the main gallery for 24 hours did not constitute severe or pervasive harassment because of sex as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">\n<em>Liability for Sexual Harassment May Not Be Imposed Based on a Single Incident That Does Not Involve Egregious Conduct Akin to a Physical Assault or the Threat of Physical Assault.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">Plaintiffs\u2019 hostile work environment claim rests on a single incident: the display of The Last Art Piece in the main gallery for a period of about 24 hours. The trial court properly found that this incident, although doubtless upsetting to the plaintiffs, did not create a workplace that was \u201cso discriminatory and abusive that it unreasonably interfere[d] with the job performance of those harassed.\u201d <em>(Brooks v. City of San Mateo </em>(9th Cir. 2000) 229 F.3d 917, 923.)</p>\n<p id=\"b124-9\">In <em>Brooks v. City of San Mateo, supra, </em>229 F.3d 917, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed a summary judgment in favor of the defendant where the alleged harassment consisted of the plaintiffs supervisor forcing his hand under her sweater and bra to fondle her bare breast. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 921.) As in this case, the plaintiff \u201crequired psychological help and even then was unable to successfully return to her job.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 924.) The Ninth Circuit held, \u201cIf a single incident can ever suffice to support a hostile work environment claim, the incident must be extremely severe. ... In <em>Al-Dabbagh </em>[v. <em>Greenpeace, Inc. </em>(N.D.Ill. 1994) 873 F.Supp. 1105], a single incident was held to be sufficient where the assailant \u2018slapped [the plaintiff], tore off her shirt, beat her, hit her on the head with a radio, choked her with a phone cord and ultimately forced her to have sex with him.\u2019 [Citation.] The perpetrator held the victim captive overnight; when she finally managed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>escape, she had to be hospitalized for her injuries. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 926.) The court concluded, \u201cThe brief encounter between [the plaintiff] and [the harasser] was highly offensive, but nothing like the ordeal suffered by the unfortunate young woman in <em>Al-Dabbagh, </em>who was held captive from evening until early the next morning. Utilizing the . . . factors of frequency, severity and intensity of interference with working conditions, we cannot say that a reasonable woman in Brooks\u2019s position would consider the terms and conditions of her employment altered by [the harasser\u2019s] actions.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">Although plaintiffs argue that \u201ceven a single incident of severe harassment may be sufficient\u201d to establish liability by an employer for sexual harassment, a review of the cases they cite reveals that such a single incident must be severe in the extreme and generally must include either physical violence or the threat thereof. (See <em>Ellison v. Brady </em>(9th Cir. 1991) 924 F.2d 872, 877-878 [dictum: a single incident of forcible rape might be sufficiently severe to create a hostile working environment]; <em>Department of Corrections </em>v. <em>State Personnel Bd. </em>(1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 131, 134, 156 [69 Cal.Rptr.2d 34] [hostile work environment liability may exist for a single incident of rape, but no such liability attached for single incident in which corrections officer used profane language and shook a female Hispanic fellow officer by her collar to emphasize his point]; <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Capital Cities </em>(1996) 50 Cal.App.4th 1038, 1042 [58 Cal.Rptr.2d 122] [plaintiff permitted to proceed on hostile work environment harassment claim based on allegations he was drugged and gang-raped]; <em>Little v. Windermere Relocation, Inc. </em>(9th Cir. 2001) 265 F.3d 903 [summary judgment in favor of defendant reversed where the plaintiffs hostile work environment claim was based on a rape]; <em>Vance v. Southern Pacific Tel. and Tel. Co. </em>(11th Cir. 1989) 863 F.2d 1503, 1510, abrogated on other grounds by <em>Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc. </em>(1993) 510 U.S. 17, 20 [114 S.Ct. 367, 369, 126 L.Ed.2d 295] [actionable race-based harassment included two incidents where a noose was hung over African American employee\u2019s work station]; <em>King </em>v. <em>Board of Regents of Univ. of Wis. System </em>(7th Cir. 1990) 898 F.2d 533, 537 [\u201cAlthough a single act can be enough [citation] generally, repeated incidents create a stronger claim of hostile environment, with the strength of the claim depending on the number of incidents and the intensity of each incident\u201d];<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Radtke v. Everett </em>(1993) 442 Mich. 368, 395 [501 N.W.2d 155, 168] [under Michigan law, \u201c[although rare, single incidents <em>may </em>create a hostile environment\u2014 rape and violent sexual assault are two possible scenarios\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">In support of their position, plaintiffs heavily rely on a Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals case, <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>Corroon &amp; Black Corp. </em>(5th Cir. 1988) 845 F.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>104 <em>(Bennett), </em>in which the alleged harassment consisted of the posting of obscene cartoons bearing the plaintiffs name in the men\u2019s room at her workplace. Plaintiffs cite the court\u2019s statement that \u201c[a]ny reasonable person would have to regard these cartoons as highly offensive to a woman who seeks to deal with her fellow employees and clients with professional dignity and without the barrier of sexual differentiation and abuse. This is a perfect matrix to grow the hostile environment subjecting a woman to the discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult which Title VII protects against.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 106.)  However, the court of appeals\u2019 observation quoted by plaintiffs was not directed to the question whether the harassment was \u201csevere or pervasive,\u201d but toward the entirely separate question whether the harassment was \u201cbased upon the sex of the plaintiff.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>(Bennett, </em>at p. 106.)</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">In fact, the Fifth Circuit in <em>Bennett affirmed </em>summary judgment in favor of the defendants on other grounds, noting that \u201cthis summary judgment record presents meager proof of the conditions required\u201d to establish severe or pervasive harassment. The court specifically declined to rule whether posting the cartoons was \u201c \u2018sufficiently severe or pervasive \u201cto alter the conditions of [the victim\u2019s] employment and create an abusive environment\u201d [citation].\u2019 \u201d <em>(Bennett, supra, </em>845 F.2d at p. 106.)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Thus, <em>Bennett </em>does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>not aid plaintiffs in establishing the conditions of their employment were substantially altered by the brief display of The Last Art Piece.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">Indeed, other courts have found that even unwelcome sexual touching is insufficient to constitute severe or pervasive harassment when the incidents are isolated and there is no violence or threat of violence. (E.g., <em>Candelore </em>v. <em>Clark County Sanitation Dist. </em>(9th Cir. 1992) 975 F.2d 588, 590 (per curiam) [affirming summary judgment for defendant where \u201cisolated incidents of sexual horseplay alleged by Candelore took place over a period of years and were not so egregious as to render Candelore\u2019s work environment \u2018hostile\u2019\u201d]; <em>Del Valle Fontanez </em>v. <em>Aponte </em>(D.P.R. 1987) 660 F.Supp. 145, 146-147, 149 [incident where defendant \u201cpressed [plaintiff] against the door with his body\u201d and plaintiff \u201cfelt defendant\u2019s erect sexual organ against her body\u201d twice in a five-minute period was not severe or pervasive enough to create a hostile working environment]; <em>Saxton v. American Tel. &amp; Tel. Co. </em>(7th Cir. 1993) 10 F.3d 526, 528, 534 [affirming summary judgment in favor of defendant where plaintiff was rubbed and kissed on one occasion and resisted an attempted groping on another].)</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">The nature of the alleged harassment in this case does not begin to approach the severity of rape or violent sexual assault or even milder forms of unwanted physical contact. None of the plaintiffs were physically touched or subjected to any sort of verbal abuse. Heuer and Dutro were not depicted in The Last Art Piece, and Herberg did not see the drawing until long after it had been taken down. Although Herberg and her relatives were understandably embarrassed and upset about the drawing, it is undisputed that the drawing was not intended to harass plaintiffs, but rather to make a point about representational art.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Moreover, CalArts\u2019s administrative personnel were uniformly mindful of plaintiffs\u2019 feelings, and made efforts to ameliorate the impact of the drawing during the time it was on display. Quite simply, no reasonable jury could conclude that the presence of The Last Art <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>Piece in the main gallery for 24 hours constituted severe harassment within the meaning of FEHA.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.

In other words, sexual harassment creating a hostile work environment is unlawful because it subjects its victims to <em>\u201cdiscriminatory </em>intimidation, ridicule, and insult . . . .\u201d <em>(Bennett, supra, </em>845 F.2d at p 106, italics added.) Because the record before us seemed to lack evidence of any <em>discriminatory </em>harassment, we asked the parties for additional briefing as to whether plaintiffs were subjected to hostile work environment harassment \u201cbecause of. . . sex,\u201d as required by FEHA.

The court declined to decide whether posting sexually provocative photos constituted harassment \u201cbased on [plaintiffs] sex,\u201d but held that \u201ca jury could not reasonably find the existence of a severe, pervasive atmosphere of sex-based hostility at the Met. These pictures and the one instance of sexual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>banter alleged by the plaintiff, while they were arguably inappropriate in a work setting, do not rise to the level of actionable conduct.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 319.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b127-7\">In their declarations submitted in support of CalArts\u2019s motion for summary judgment, student artists Ariel Rosenberg and Jeremy Ringermacher explained the motivation for The Last Art Piece: \u201cAt CalArts, there is a tendency when art is critiqued to categorize a work as representational or conceptual. Representational artwork is an actual representation of the item depicted. Conceptual artwork goes beyond the actual item depicted and communicates additional ideas and concepts. During the time that I have attended CalArts, faculty and students have debated the impact of representational art versus conceptual art, and some people have characterized representational art as pass\u00e9 and incapable of provoking a strong response. Ringermacher and I decided to create a piece of art that mixed and confused these two concepts and evoked a critical response.\u201d In his letter of apology to Herberg, Rosenberg stated \u201cI never intended to harm anyone.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b128-8\">The context in which the alleged harassment took place also supports our decision. (See <em>Fisher, supra, </em>214 Cal.App.3d at pp. 609-610.) We see a vast difference between posting obscene cartoons in a men\u2019s room, as was done in <em>Bennett, supra, </em>845 F.2d 104, and the display of The Last Art Piece in the designated gallery area at an art school. CalArts\u2019s noncensorship policy was widely distributed to both students and employees. In our view it was reasonable to expect that exhibitions of student artwork would, from time to time, include sexually explicit material. Although we reject CalArts\u2019s contention that its anticensorship policy and the First Amendment exempt it from the laws against sexual harassment, in this case the context of the display further militates against a finding of severe or pervasive harassment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
