Defendant has filed no brief in opposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">Defendant was charged with speeding. The State\u2019s case was based upon the testimony of Trooper Toth, who saw defendant\u2019s automobile while in his own vehicle at the side of the road. He testified as to the excessive speed from a reading of a VAS CAR device in his vehicle. The witness was certified as a VAS CAB operator and described his testing of the accuracy of the equipment by a process of calibration.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-9\">After noting defendant\u2019s speed on the VAS CAR the trooper pursued defendant\u2019s vehicle and, while retaining a constant distance behind him, observed a speedometer reading of 70 miles an hour in a 55-mile zone. A certificate of the accuracy of his speedometer was also introduced in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-10\">Defendant produced Dr. Glueck as an expert witness on VASCAR and, after much colloquy as to his qualifications, the judge permitted him to testify in a limited area. Counsel for defendant interposed requests to interrupt the trial by engaging in discovery relating to the inspection of the VAS CAB equipment and the physical examination of the trooper. The judge denied the application for inspection but granted an order compelling the trooper to undergo a medical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>examination \u201cto determine his perceptual ability and reaction time.\u201d The propriety of that order is before us for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">We need spend little time in discussing the admissibility of the VAS CAR reading. It has been settled in this State that the court can take judicial notice of the reliability and accuracy of the VASCAR reading, subject to the development at trial of facts relating to the weight of the evidence because of any defects in the instrument or the qualifications, physical or mental capacities of the operator. <em>State v. Finkle, </em>128 <em>N. J. Super. </em>199 (App. Div.), aff\u2019d 66 <em>N. J. </em>139 (1974), <em>cert. </em>den. 423 <em>U. S. </em>836, 96 <em>S. Ct. </em>61, 46 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 54 (1975); <em>State v. Salup, </em>128 <em>N. J. Super. </em>209 (App. Div.), certif. den. 65 <em>N. J. </em>571 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">However, the right to attack at trial the qualifications and capacity of the operator does not warrant an order in the midst of trial to compel him to undergo a medical examination for that purpose. In fact, there was nothing before the trial judge to establish a prima facie justification for such an examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">Furthermore, such an order is not consonant with the summary nature of the trial of a traffic offense. Procedural diversions of that type would tend to produce chaos in the prosecution of speed violators in the municipal courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">Even in the analogous area of pretrial discovery the court rules, as they presently exist, do not permit any type of discovery in cases involving traffic violations. Municipal court discovery is narrowly limited to \u201ccriminal actions\u201d only. See <em>R. </em>7:4 \u2014 2(g); <em>R. </em>7:1; see also separate treatment of traffic offenses in <em>R. </em>7:6.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">The court\u2019s order constitutes a mistaken exercise of discretion. The order is therefore set aside and the matter remanded for final determination on the merits.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
