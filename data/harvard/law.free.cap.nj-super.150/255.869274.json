While the motion sought much more, including \u201cequitable distribution,\u201d the only ground asserted on this appeal is a charge of error on the part of the trial judge in refusing this relief in view of plaintiff\u2019s allegations that her husband \u201cintentionally and wilfully withheld material information as to the value <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>of his holding during negotiations of the said property settlement agreement.\u201d It is to be observed that defendant died on June 18, 1973 and his -will was admitted to probate on July 5, 1973.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">While the procedure below, lacking an evidential hearing and ending in a determination in which the judge\u2019s findings had to be elicited by inference from his colloquy with counsel, left much to be desired, we are satisfied, as was the trial judge, that plaintiff set forth no substantial circumstances justifying the reopening of this judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">Moreover, it is noteworthy that the motion to reopen was not made for more than a year after probate of defendant\u2019s .will and some 36' months after entry of the judgment sought to be set aside. We believe that nothing appears to invoke the relief available in <em>R. </em>4:50, either by way of the specifics of <em>B. </em>4:50-1 (a), (b) or (c) (outlawed in this ease by <em>B. </em>4:50-3), or by the generality of the \u201cother reason\u201d provision in (f). See <em>Doyle v. Chase Manhattan Bank, </em>80 <em>N. J. Super. </em>105, 125 (App. Div. 1963), certif. den. 40 <em>N. J. </em>508 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">We observe that plaintiff has enjoyed the advantage of defendant\u2019s fully executed covenant, incorporated in the judgment and now beyond modification, to leave unchanged a will executed prior to their agreement. In less compelling circumstances than these we have formulated and honored the \u201cimportant policy that litigation must have an end.\u201d <em>Hartford Ins. Co. v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>68 <em>N. J. </em>430, 434 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">The matter of relief from a judgment or order under our rules is one addressed to the sound discretion of the trial judge, whose decision will be upheld absent an abuse of that discretion. <em>Greenberg v. Owens, </em>31 <em>N. J. </em>402, 405 (1960). In the circumstances here present, we are unwilling to characterize the determination below as an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b279-10\">Seidman, J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"Afx-\">(dissenting). I disagree with the conclusion reached by my colleagues. The issue here, as I perceive it, is not whether plaintiff set forth \u201csubstantial circumstances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>justifying the reopening of the judgment.\u201d It is whether, on the record before him, the trial judge should have set the matter down for a plenary hearing and taken oral testimony. <em>Cf. Hallberg v. Hallberg, </em>113 <em>N. J. Super. </em>205, 207 (App. Div. 1971). I think such hearing should have been held, followed by requisite findings of fact, and leading to a determination of whether the motion should be granted. I would therefore reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">My colleagues acknowledge that \u201cthe procedure below, lacking an evidential hearing and ending in a determination in which the judge\u2019s findings had to be elicited by inference from his colloquy with counsel, left much to be desired * * I thoroughly agree with this appraisal. But their affirmance of the order dismissing the motion reflects a misconception of the real issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">Yema May Palko was married to Daniel Palko on April 19, 1953. Three children, two of whom are now adults, were born of the marriage. The parties were divorced by judgment entered May 16, 1973. Annexed to the judgment was a detailed settlement agreement which the trial judge found \u201cwholly suitable and adequate in Plaintiff\u2019s favor and in favor of the infant children born of the marriage,\u201d and which he \u201capproved, sanctioned and allowed as a settlement in gross of Plaintiff\u2019s right to alimony present and future.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">The agreement, among other things not pertinent here, (1) divided certain household goods between the parties, (3) required the husband to purchase the wife\u2019s one-half equity in the marital domicile, based upon an agreed valuation of $38,000; (3) obligated the husband not to change his will, a copy of which was annexed, in which the two younger children were the primary beneficiaries, and (4) provided for the support of the three children, until emancipation, in weekly amounts totalling $70.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">\u25a0 On June 18, 1973 Daniel Palko died testate. His will, naming his brother as executor, was admitted to probate on July 5, 1973. Plaintiff\u2019s motion, filed July 33, 1974, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>sought (1) to reopen the divorce judgment and set aside the portion dealing with the separation agreement, (2) an accounting of the estate, (3) equitable distribution, (4) an increase in support for the remaining infant child, (5) counsel fees and costs, and (6) such further relief as the court might deem equitable and just.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">In her supporting affidavit Mrs. Palko alleged that after the death of her former husband, she was \u201castounded to learn he left a personal estate in excess of $175,000\u201d; that during their marriage they led a frugal life and her husband \u201cnever divulged his salary, but always led me to believe we were just making it financially\u201d; that at the time of the divorce he was unemployed because of a coronary attack and was collecting disability benefits, and for these reasons she agreed not to accept support; that \u201cit appears now that the defendant maintained accounts in ten to fifteen different banks and had stocks\u201d; that all during the pretrial negotiations and conferences she relied upon the representations which defendant made as to poverty, and had no reason to doubt them because of the way they had lived during the marriage; that she felt she \u201cwas totally defrauded by the defendant and tricked into submission.\u201d She also claimed that she was unable to support her daughter on the weekly amount she received.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">The attorney who represented Mrs. Palko in the divorce proceedings averred in his affidavit that the agreement and the financial provisions therein</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-9\">* * * were predicated upon representations made, to me by Mr. G\u00ediardiello [Mr. Palko\u2019s attorney] as to Defendant\u2019s financial status and prospects, among which were Defendant\u2019s heart condition which allegedly prohibited him from seeking further employment on a full- or part-time basis; income consisting solely of interest on a bank account of approximately $20,000.00, dividends from a small stock portfolio and permanent disability collected on account of his heart condition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b281-10\">The attorney stated further that these facts were discussed at length with his client, who \u201cconceded these state-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>meats to be true to the best of her knowledge and information.\u201d He said that information \u201cwhich has subsequently come to my attention as recently as three weeks ago relative to the financial condition of Mr. Palko and discovered as a result of probate proceedings were apparently not disclosed during the divorce proceedings either to Mrs. Palko or to me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">Ho answering affidavits were submitted by or on behalf of decedent\u2019s personal representative, who, I note parenthetically, should have been substituted as the party defendant in the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">During a hearing consisting solely of colloquy with counsel, the trial 'judge expressed his disbelief of plaintiff\u2019s allegations. He observed that she \u201chad the right to become involved with the appropriate discovery,\u201d and had plenty of time and legal advice; that she had lived with the man for over 20 years and had signed joint tax returns (the latter comment unsupported by anything in the record), and that \u201c[s]he is not an idiot\u201d and had \u201ca pretty fair idea of what the man was doing.\u201d The judge brushed aside counsel\u2019s argument that decedent had a duty of full disclosure and that it would be unconscionable to permit the agreement to stand. He said that he saw \u201cno basis on which anybody could expect this Court to vacate their judgment and nullify the agreement with the objective of now considering equitable distribution.\u201d He concluded that there was nothing in the affidavits to indicate any misrepresentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">There is no doubt whatever in my mind that the trial judge\u2019s comments were wide of the mark, considering the uneontradicted affidavits. The summary manner in which he disposed of the matter overlooked the fact that the averments in the affidavits, if true, created a genuine and substantial issue which might well have warranted the intervention of the court, in the absence of other countervailing reasons. The issue raised was whether there was an undue concealment by decedent of a material fact to the prejudice of his wife, which he was bound in conscience and duty to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>disclose and in respect to which he could not innocently be silent; and, if so, whether this constituted equitable fraud in connection with the negotiated property settlement sufficient to entitle plaintiff to relief. See <em>Nicholson v. Janeway, </em>16 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>285, 287 (Ch. 1863); <em>Hansen v. Janitschek, </em>57 <em>N. J. Super. </em>418, 422 (App. Div. 1959). The resolution of that issue, in my view, required a plenary hearing in the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">I do not say that plaintiff will or must prevail at such hearing. I am fully aware of the obstacles in her path, not the least of which is the length of time that had elapsed since the entry of the judgment. My colleagues properly point to the restrictive provisions of <em>R. </em>4:50-1, but I am not persuaded that they are applicable here, especially to the extent that the relief sought is from the negotiated property settlement agreement, rather than the judgment itself, a significant distinction which seems to have escaped the attention of my colleagues. In any case, \"the very essence of [subparagraph (f) of <em>R. </em>4:50-1] is its capacity for relief in exceptional situations. And in such exceptional cases its boundaries are as expansive as the need to achieve equity and justice.\u201d <em>Court Invest. Co. v. Perillo, </em>48 <em>N. J. </em>334, 341 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">While my colleagues correctly point out that decedent's agreement to leave unchanged his will executed prior thereto was carried out, I fail to see what particular personal advantage \"plaintiff has enjoyed\u201d therefrom, since no provision was made for her therein, although, quite understandably, the children were the principal beneficiaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">I thoroughly agree that relief from a judgment or order is a matter addressed to the sound discretion of the trial judge, whose decision should not be disturbed except for an abuse of that discretion. But, as I have emphasized, my concern here is not with the merits of plaintiff's assertions; rather, it is that she be given a fair opportunity to establish by competent and credible evidence the existence of a sufficient basis for the exercise by the trial judge of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>discretion. After all, plaintiff was married to decedent for 20 years. She bore and reared their three children. Her life was not one of luxury. She received very little recompense for her labors by virtue of the property settlement agreement. I venture to suggest that a modicum of compassion in this case will not cause the heavens to fall.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
