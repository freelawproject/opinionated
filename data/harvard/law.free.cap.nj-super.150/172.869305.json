After a four-day trial the jury returned a 10-2 verdict finding no cause of action in favor of defendant dentist. Thereafter the trial judge granted plaintiff\u2019s motion for a new trial. During the second trial the judge ruled certain expert testimony offered by plaintiff inadmissible. Thereafter, upon stipulated facts, the judge entered a judgment for defendant. Plaintiff appealed the latter judgment of the second trial judge, while defendant appealed the first trial judge\u2019s grant of a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">We consider, first, defendant\u2019s cross-appeal from the order granting plaintiff a new trial. The evidence presented at the first trial tended to show, among other things, the following: Plaintiff went to defendant\u2019s dental office for an examination on October 30, 1970. As a result of the findings of this examination, plaintiff returned to defendant on December 11 for repair work on an extensively decayed molar. During the course of this appointment defendant unsuccessfully attempted to insert artificial pins into the tooth as supports for a filling. The resulting failure of this technique left plaintiff with only part of a filling in the molar.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">Plaintiff\u2019s expert witness testified at the first trial that one of the pins inserted into the molar by defendant to support the filling migrated into the nerve cavity or pulp chamber of the tooth, causing infection and the lockjaw condition. Plaintiff\u2019s expert identified the failure to take X-rays of the molar after inserting the pins as defendant\u2019s most glaring deviation from accepted standards of dental practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">Defendant himself testified that he had in fact taken X-rays of the molar on December 11 after inserting the pins into plaintiff\u2019s molar in order to ascertain whether they had \u201cperforated\u201d from the tooth structure into the bone, and he produced the purported photographs for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>first time at trial. Neither plaintiff nor his attorney knew of the existence of these X-rays prior to defendant\u2019s testimony, and counsel extensively cross-examined defendant about his failure to mention in his answers to plaintiff\u2019s interrogatories or in his deposition testimony that he had taken the office X-rays. Plaintiff\u2019s counsel then made a motion to strike all testimony regarding the X-rays. Before the trial judge could rule on the motion, counsel for both parties reached an agreement in which plaintiff consented to withdraw his motion to strike, and defendant agreed that no further questions about the X-rays could be asked of any witness. This settlement did permit counsel to comment on the X-rays in summation.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">Defendant\u2019s expert testified that a dentist could not discern from an X-ray whether any of the pins had migrated into the cavity. The expert stated that, in his opinion, defendant had no reason to suspect that Sacawa was developing the lockjaw condition until he observed plaintiff\u2019s swollen jaw on December 21. According to this expert, defendant complied with accepted dental practice by referring plaintiff to an oral surgeon, and the witness concluded that at no time did defendant deviate from accepted standards of dental practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">During his summation plaintiff\u2019s counsel discussed the X-rays and their belated presentation, and then stated that \u201cthat X-ray was talked about by Dr. Polikoff. You know who asked him about the X-ray, I did. It wasn\u2019t asked about anything on direct and he has yet to be asked, does the little X-ray, the one he says is of this man, does that show a pin in the pulp?\u201d Defendant\u2019s counsel immediately objected to plaintiff\u2019s attorney\u2019s suggestion that further testimony on the X-ray was not introduced due to defendant\u2019s unwillingness. The trial judge agreed with defendant and informed the jury that \u201cas a result of objections * * * made after the conclusion of Dr. Polikoff\u2019s testimony, it was agreed by counsel and directed by the Court that no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>other witness [would] be permitted to be asked any questions in regard to that X-ray.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">Alter the jury returned a verdict in favor of defendant, plaintiff moved for a new trial, primarily on the basis that defendant had failed to reveal the existence of the purported December 11 X-rays prior to his testimony at trial. In granting plaintiff\u2019s motion the trial judge noted that defendant\u2019s failure to reveal the disputed X-ray before trial had created a \u201ctouchy situation,\u201d particularly because plaintiff\u2019s expert, not knowing of the X-ray, had testified that defendant breached the standard of dental care by failing to take an X-ray after the pin insertion, and because the expert had had no opportunity to examine the purported X-ray. Characterizing the question raised by defendant\u2019s objection to plaintiff\u2019s summation comments on the X-ray as \u201cdifficult,\u201d the trial judge concluded that he had erroneously foreclosed plaintiff\u2019s counsel from commenting on defendant\u2019s direct testimony concerning the X-ray. Viewing the entire case as a close one, the judge found that this limitation on plaintiff\u2019s summation had had a significant effect on the jury, and concluded that plaintiff was unfairly prejudiced by the ruling and the accompanying instruction to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">We conclude that the trial judge was justified in granting plaintiff a new trial. Defendant\u2019s failure to reveal the X-ray to plaintiff prior to trial, defendant\u2019s surprise production of the X-ray after the completion of plaintiff\u2019s case, and the confused situation which developed during summations as a result of the agreement of counsel settling plaintiff\u2019s motion to strike, warranted the finding that plaintiff\u2019s case was seriously prejudiced. The trial judge\u2019s conclusion deserves deference because he had the opportunity to hear the witnesses and to assess their credibility, and was in the best position to evaluate the effect of the X-ray dispute, plaintiff\u2019s summation and the court\u2019s instruction on the jury. <em>Dolson v. </em>Anastasia, 55 <em>N. J. </em>2, 7 (1969). Such deference is especially appropriate where, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>as here, the trial judge grants a new trial because of his own error. <em>Rossetti v. Public Service Coord. Transport, </em>53 <em>N. J. Super. </em>293, 299 (App. Div. 1958). There was no manifest denial or miscarriage of justice in granting the new trial, and hence the trial judge\u2019s conclusion should stand undisturbed. <em>Dolson v. Anastasia, supra, </em>55 <em>N. J. </em>at 6-8; <em>Kulbacki v. Sobchinsky, </em>38 <em>N. J. </em>435, 459 (1962) (Weintraub, C. J., dissenting); <em>R. </em>2:10\u20141.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">We next turn to plaintiff\u2019s appeal. When the case was retried before the second trial judge, plaintiff informed the court that he would seek to introduce into evidence the transcribed testimony of the expert witness who testified on his behalf at the first trial, rather than have him appear in person. Counsel for plaintiff represented to ..the judge that the expert witness was now \u201ctotally retired\u201d and was not seeing patients at all. Counsel explained that he had spoken by telephone with the witness, who lives in Hollywood, Florida, and had learned that his health, particularly his heart condition, had worsened appreciably since the first trial in 1975. Noting that at the time of the first trial the witness had traveled to New York City monthly on business, counsel stated that the witness had not made such trips during the nine months prior to the second trial. Counsel reported to the judge that the witness now came north only for treatment at a Boston clinic and appointments with his personal cardiologist in New York, and that the physician had told the witness to avoid tense situations. Counsel indicated to the judge that, while the witness felt that he was under a \"moral obligation\u201d to testify, he would do so only for a fee of $1,400 plus his expenses. Counsel stated that plaintiff had been forced to borrow funds from relatives to pay the witness\u2019 fee during the first trial, and that plaintiff was unable to obtain the funds required by the witness for the second trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">Although the trial judge noted that the witness was technically beyond the jurisdiction of the New Jersey courts, he viewed plaintiff\u2019s application as directed toward the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>cretion of the court. The judge concluded that defendant\u2019s interest in having the jury observe the appearance and demeanor of plaintiff\u2019s expert witness outweighed any hardship on plaintiff resulting from his inability to pay the required fees, and ruled that the transcribed testimony from the first trial was inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">Faced with the inability to present the crucial expert testimony at the second trial, plaintiff\u2019s counsel stipulated the facts that he would produce rather than go through the motions of a second trial. Because plaintiff was unable to introduce any expert testimony showing that defendant had deviated from accepted standards of dental practice, the judge found no cause of action and dismissed plaintiff\u2019s suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">Although the preferable practice would have been for plaintiff to introduce sworn affidavits describing the facts forming the basis for his request, we note that defendant did not dispute the truth of plaintiff\u2019s attorney\u2019s representations, and the judge accepted them as valid. For the purposes of deciding the legal issue presented by this appeal, we will consider the representations on the same basis as did the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">On the merits, we note that under <em>Evid. R. </em>63(3) (a) (ii) prior testimony is admissible to prove the truth of statements therein in a subsequent proceeding without violating the hearsay rule, if the witness who originally gave the testimony is unavailable and if the testimony goes to an issue on which the adverse party in the prior proceeding had the right and opportunity to cross-examine the now unavailable witness with an interest and motive similar to his interest and motive in the proceeding in which the testimony is offered. In this case the issues to which plaintiff\u2019s expert\u2019s prior testimony were directed in the first trial would be identical to the relevant issues in the second trial. Further, defendant had an adequate opportunity to cross-examine plaintiff\u2019s expert with the same interest as he would have during the second trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>\u201cUnavailability,\u201d as defined in <em>Evid. R. </em>62(6), requires, among other things, either that the witness be beyond the jurisdiction of the court\u2019s process to compel his appearance, or that the proponent of the prior statement be unable, despite due diligence, to obtain the attendance of the witness. As a resident of Florida, the witness is, of course, beyond the subpoena power of the New Jersey courts. The assumption underlying the trial judge\u2019s ruling is that, even if an expert witness is beyond the jurisdiction of the court, the proponent must attempt, with due diligence, to procure his attendance. The judge apparently concluded that plaintiff\u2019s inability to pay an expert\u2019s fee is, by itself, a lack of due diligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\"> We find no support for the trial judge\u2019s interpretation of the rule in its express terms. According to the language of the rule, the inability of a court to compel attendance and the presence or absence of \u201cdue diligence\u201d are separate considerations. Use of the preposition \u201cor\u201d means that these two definitions of unavailability are disjunctive. See 5 <em>Wigmore, Evidence </em>(Chadbourn rev. 1974), \u00a7 1404. We conclude that the fact that the expert witness could have been made available by plaintiff\u2019s payment of the $1,400 fee is irrelevant to the fulfillment of the unable-to-compel-attendance definition of the rule. <em>Cf. Caramico v. Ferrigno, </em>83 <em>N. J. Super. </em>426 (App. Div. 1964) (deposition testimony held improperly admitted where proponent of an allegedly unavailable witness had reason to believe he was within the jurisdiction, and made no attempt to locate or serve him until the day before the trial). But see, <em>Carter-Wallace, Inc. v. Otte, </em>474 <em>F. </em>2d 529 (2d Cir. 1972), <em>cert. </em>den. 412 <em>U. S. </em>929, 93 <em>S. Ct. </em>2753, 37 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 156 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">The judgment granting the new trial is affirmed and the judgment in favor of defendant at the second trial is reversed and the matter remanded for new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
