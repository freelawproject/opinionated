J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"AmA\">Tried to a jury, defendant was convicted of assault with intent to kill Michael Morris <em>(N. J. S. A. </em>2A:90-2), the unlawful use of a gun <em>(N. J. S. A. </em>2A:151-56 and <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A:151-5) and possession of a gun without having a permit to carry it <em>(N. J. S. A. </em>2A:151-41). He was acquitted of conspiring to kill Michael Morris. His eodefendant, Donna Morris, the wife of the victim, who had been indicted only for conspiracy to kill her husband, was acquitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>Defendant was sentenced to State Prison for terms totalling 16 to 19 years. He seeks a reversal of Ms conviction on the grounds that (a) he was denied a fair trial by the trial judge\u2019s deletion of references to Ms eodefendant in the statement given to the police, and (b) the trial judge erred in admitting his hospital records into evidence. Additionally, he asserts the sentences imposed were excessive. Although we find the issues raised to be clearly without merit under <em>B. </em>2:ll-3(e) (2), we deem it advisable to discuss them briefly.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">The State tried the case on the postulate that defendant and Mrs. Morris were in love with each other and had conspired to kill the victim. The proofs were uncontradicted (defendant did not testify) that on January 21, 1975 defendant laid in wait for the victim and shot Mm in the face, back and shoulder. Aside from defendant\u2019s voluntary statement to the police, the testimony of the victim and the other State\u2019s witnesses overwhelmingly proved that defendant shot and seriously wounded the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">Defendant argues he was denied a fair trial because the State did not utilize the procedure in <em>B. </em>3:15-2 and move before trial to have the trial judge determine whether defendant\u2019s statement could be effectively excised without prejudice to Mm at the joint trial. The trial judge did consider the issue during trial and deleted therefrom those portions dealing with (a) defendant\u2019s relationship, sexual and otherwise, with Mrs. Morris; (b) their travels on the day of the shooting; (c) their conversations as to whether they should go through with their plan to kill the victim; (d) their understanding as to where Mrs. Morris was to leave the gun; (e) the references to the victim as a homosexual; (f) defendant\u2019s state of mind concerning an alleged sex orgy involving the victim and two fellow male employees; (g) a prior aborted attempt to kill the victim; (h) the details of the conspiracy; (i) defendant\u2019s experience with guns; (j) defendant\u2019s intent to shoulder all the blame, and (k) whether defendant intended to kill the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>The issue of whether the excised portions of the statement, which were partly exculpatory in nature as to defendant, and inculpatory as to Mrs. Morris, could be effectively deleted is debatable. <em>Bruton v. United States, </em>391 <em>U. S. </em>123, 88 <em>S. Ct. </em>1620, 20 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 476 (1968); <em>State v. Young, </em>46 <em>N. J. </em>152 (1965); <em>R. </em>3:15-2. It might have been better practice for the trial to have been severed and the entire statement used against defendant. But we need not decide the issue because we are satisfied from our review of this very lengthy record that defendant\u2019s guilt was overwhelmingly established. If any prejudice resulted, it was harmless beyond any reasonable doubt. <em>Milton v. Wainwright, </em>407 <em>U. S. </em>371, 92 <em>S. Ct. </em>2174, 33 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 1 (1972); <em>Harrington v. California, </em>395 <em>U. S. </em>250, 89 <em>S. Ct. </em>1726, 23 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 284 (1969); <em>Chapman v. California, </em>386 <em>U. S. </em>18, 87 <em>S. Ct. </em>824, 17 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 705 (1967); <em>State v. LaPorte, </em>62 <em>N. J. </em>312 (1973). Absent a showing of prejudice to defendant, and none exists here, a violation of the <em>Bruton </em>rule and <em>R. </em>3:15-2 does not automatically require a reversal. As indicated in <em>Brown v. United States, </em>411 <em>U. S. </em>223, 93 <em>S. Ct. </em>1565, 36 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 208 (1973), wherein the <em>Bruton </em>rule was violated, \u201c\u2018[A] defendant is entitled to a fair trial but not a perfect one,\u2019 for there are no perfect trials.\u201d (At 231-232, 93 <em>S. Ct. </em>at 1570). We are completely satisfied by the proofs in this case that defendant received a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">Next, defendant contends the trial judge erred in admitting into evidence the hospital records of the victim\u2019s confinement from January 21 to February 5, 1975.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The custodian of the hospital records testified they were made and kept in the ordinary course of a patient\u2019s hospital stay, and showed the treatment rendered, the patient\u2019s progress, his medical records, X-ray reports and the attending doctor\u2019s resume of the patient\u2019s progress from the time of admission to discharge. This hospital record was properly admitted into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>evidence as an exception to the hearsay rule. <em>State v. Martorelli, </em>136 <em>N. J. Super. </em>449 (App. Div. 1975), certif. den. 69 <em>N. J. </em>445 (1976); <em>State v. Gardner, </em>51 <em>N. J. </em>444 (1968); <em>Evid. R. </em>63(13).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">Finally, in view of the nature of this unprovoked and serious assault with intent to kill, the sentences imposed were warranted, and we cannot say the trial judge abused his discretion in imposing them. <em>State v. Knight, </em>72 <em>N. J. </em>193 (1976); <em>State v. Tyson, </em>43 <em>N. J. </em>411, 417 (1964), <em>cert. </em>den. 380 <em>U. S. </em>987, 85 <em>S. Ct. </em>1359, 14 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 279 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b205-6\">Appellant has failed to include the hospital records as part of his appendix.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
