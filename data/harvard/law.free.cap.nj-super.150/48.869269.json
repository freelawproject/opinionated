A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"Aqm\">Plaintiff was injured in an industrial accident arising out of his employment by the Ionac Chemical Company, a division of Sybron Corporation. He thereupon filed a worker\u2019s compensation petition misnaming respondent as \u201cIonac Chemical Corporation.\u201d Kespondent\u2019s' answer carried over this misnomer. Nevertheless, it is undisputed that Ionac is not a corporate entity but is simply a chemical manufacturing division of Sybron Corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-9\">Plaintiff received an award in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court for his work-connected injuries. He nevertheless instituted a common law action for the injuries resulting from the same accident against \u201cPfaudler Sybron Corp.\u201d (another misnomer) which, in fact, is not a corporate entity but is known as Pfaudler Company, a division of Sybron engaged in the manufacture and sale of equipment utilized in chemical manufacturing. Plaintiff\u2019s allegation in that action is that Pfaudler was negligent in several respects relating to the manufacture of a vat which caused his injuries and to the absence of warning of dangers inherent in the use of the vat.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-10\">Defendant Pfaudler moved for summary judgment with supporting affidavits establishing that Ionac and Pfaudler are both unincorporated operating divisions of Sybron; that plaintiff sustained the accident while employed by the Ionac division, and that he applied for and received workers\u2019 compensation benefits. Defendant attached a W-2 form for 1974, the year during which the accident occurred, which set forth the earnings of plaintiff and designated the em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>ployer as \u201cIonac Chemical Company, Div. of Sybron Corporation.\u201d In addition, the declaration sheet of the workers\u2019 compensation policy of Sybron was submitted and reflected that the Hartford Insurance Company, which paid the compensation award, was the carrier for Sybron covering many of its operating companies at various locations, including Ionac Chemical Company and Pfaudler Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">Plaintiff filed an affidavit in response, in which he stated in substance that he had been employed by Ionac since 1951; that the signs at the plant display the name Ionac Chemical Company; that there is no physical sign of Sybron Corporation; that any relationship with Sybron was never brought to his attention, and that the name of the manufacturer on a plate placed on the vat. involved is \u201cPfaudler Sybron Corp.\u201d It also appears that defendant submitted answers to plaintiff\u2019s interrogatories prior to the argument of the motion, although plaintiff made no reference to the same in support of his position.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">The trial judge granted summary judgment based on the fact that the alleged tortfeasor, Pfaudler, is but a division of Sybron, plaintiff\u2019s employer, and that plaintiff\u2019s right to workers\u2019 compensation benefits constitutes his exclusive remedy against that employer or any of its divisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">Plaintiff urges that the summary judgment should not have been granted and that he should be permitted to go to trial on the theory that a third-party action is viable where the plaintiff is employed by one enterprise and is injured by another separate enterprise, albeit that both are divisions of a single corporate entity. This enterprise theory of third-party recovery is advanced in an article by Professor Clifford Davis entitled, \u201cWorkmen\u2019s Compensation\u2014 Using an Enterprise Theory of Employment to Determine Who Is a Third Party Tort-Feasor,\u201d 32 <em>D. Pitt. L. Rev. </em>289 (1971). We are not cited, however, to any judicial decisions based on such a theory. .</p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>In the context of the facts of this case and the applicable law, we reject the theory advanced by plaintiff and affirm the determination below.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\"><em>N. J. S. A. </em>34:15-8 unequivocally compels a surrender of any other right of recovery against an employer beyond the workers\u2019 compensation benefits. Since Sybron was in fact the employer of plaintiff and Sybron is the corporate entity called upon to respond in damages for the third-party action founded on the negligence of its Pfaudler division, the policy of a single recovery under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act bars any additional right of action. The mere use of divisions or departments, or the labeling of these divisions by proper names in the conduct of Sybron\u2019s business enterprises, does not warrant a deviation from the express legislative policy. So long as the employer and the alleged tortfeasor are one, plaintiff is limited to the compensation recovered under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">In 2A <em>Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law, </em>\u00a7 72.80 at 115 (1976), Larson states the proposition tersely:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-7\">One thing is clear. Dual capacity will not be found merely because the employer has a number of departments or divisions that perhaps are quite separate in their functions and operations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b73-8\">See also, <em>Miller v. United States, </em>307 <em>F. Supp. </em>932 <em>(E. D. Va. </em>1969); <em>Walker v. City and County of San Francisco, </em>97 <em>Cal. App. </em>2d 901, 219 <em>P. </em>2d 487 (D. Ct. App. 1950); <em>Jansen v. Harmon, Iowa </em>164 <em>N. </em>W. 2d 323, 328-330 (Sup. Ct. 1969); <em>Bross v. City of Detroit, </em>262 <em>Mich. </em>447, 247 <em>N. W. </em>714 (Sup. Ct. 1933); <em>Hudson v. Allen, </em>11 <em>Mich. App. </em>511, 161 <em>N. </em>W. 2d 596 (Ct. App. 1968); <em>De Guiseppe v. City of New York, </em>188 <em>Misc. </em>897, 66 <em>N. Y. S. </em>2d 866 (Sup. Ct. 1946), aff\u2019d 273 <em>App. Div. </em>1010, 79 <em>N. Y. S. </em>2d 163 (App. Div. 1948).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-9\">Appellant\u2019s plea that we apply the liberality accorded to employees in order to bring them within the ambit of the salutary benefits of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act is wholly misplaced. We are not concerned with the issue of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>plaintiff\u2019s ability to recover workers\u2019 compensation benefits. We are rather concerned with the important legislative policy immunizing an employer from common law liability. See <em>Freppon v. </em>Hittner, 91 <em>N. J. Super. </em>9, 12 (App. Div.), certif. den. 47 <em>N. J. </em>565 (1966). And it is not within our function to disregard the spirit and purpose of that policy merely because plaintiff is an employee who claims that he did not receive adequate recompense through the workers\u2019 compensation proceeding. See the following eases dealing with dual recovery versus partnership and individual partners: <em>Mazzuchelli v. Silberberg, </em>29 <em>N. J. </em>15, 23-24 (1959); <em>Parker v. </em>Zanghi, 45 <em>N. J. Super. </em>167, 173-176 (App. Div. 1957); <em>Williams v. Hartshorn, </em>296 <em>N. Y. </em>49, 69 <em>N. E. </em>2d 557 (Ct. App. 1946).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">In view of existing law, there is nothing in the record or in any projected discovery which could create a genuine issue as to any material fact leading to a different legal result. The summary judgment was therefore warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
