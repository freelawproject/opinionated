Earinella</p>\n<p id=\"AKj\">and codefendant Edward Gola were charged in a six-count indictment as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">Count 1 \u2014 .Both defendants were charged with conspiracy to commit misconduct in office and bribery, in violation of <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A :85-1, <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A:93-6, <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A :98-1, <em>N. J. S.

A. </em>2A:93-6.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-11\">At trial the -State elected not to prosecute count 2 and at the conclusion of the trial both defendants were found guilty of counts 1, 3, 4, 5 and 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-12\">Defendant Earinella appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-13\">A detailed factual recitation is necessary to an understanding of the issues raised here.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-14\">Earinella and Gola were Passaic County freeholders. This ease concerns their alleged participation in a bribery scheme in connection with the county\u2019s purchase of a garage owned by Albert Scaletti.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-15\">Scaletti, a former mayor of Biverdale, was the State\u2019s chief witness and testified, pursuant to an \u201cagreement\u201d with the State, that he had owned property in Pompton Lakes, Passaic County, New Jersey, upon which there was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>a large garage with offices attached, containing approximately 14,200 square feet. In October 1973 Gola, whom Scaletti had previously met, contacted him and inquired as to whether he would be interested in selling the garage to the county. Scaletti expressed interest and Gola indicated that further action would await the outcome of the November elections. No improper suggestions, demands or requests were made at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">Following the elections, which defendants won, Gola informed Scaletti that \u201che was going to get things in motion to buy the building\u201d and that \u201cthey would buy it after the first of the year.\u201d Again no mention of any bribes or payments was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">On January 8, 9 or 10, 1974 Scaletti led a number of the freeholders, including Farinella and Gola, on an inspection tour through the building. In the course of this tour Gola called Scaletti aside and stated, \u201cDon wants three thousand dollars.\u201d Scaletti understood that Gola was referring to Farinella and replied, \u201cI guess I\u2019ll have to give it to him.\u201d Sometime later during the tour Farinella approached Scaletti and asked him, \u201cDid you have an understanding with Ed?\u201d Scaletti answered, \u201cYes, you\u2019re to get three thousand dollars.\u201d Farinella responded, \u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d and Scaletti then asked, \u201cWho should I give this to, Ed?\u201d Farinella replied, \u201cNo, give it to me.\u201d Scaletti had no further conversation with either Farinella or Gola that day. (Although Gola did not testify, Farinella did and, on this point, his testimony was essentially a denial that any such conversation occurred.)</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">A few days later Scaletti discussed these conversations with Gola. Gola stated, \u201cJoe D\u2019Arco [a freeholder] wants two thousand dollars.\u201d Scaletti stated, \u201cI guess I\u2019ll have to give it to him.\u201d And Gola replied, \u201cFine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">On January 16 the freeholders passed a resolution authorizing City Counsel Yerp, to negotiate with Scaletti for the purchase of the property. These negotiations led to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>contract of sale between the parties for $450,000 which was signed in early February 1974.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">A $45,000 check drawn on the county\u2019s account, dated March 8, 1974, represented the first payment to Scaletti. Shortly after he deposited it Scaletti received a call from Earinella who said he wanted to see him. Scaletti went to Earinella\u2019s place of business, a wholesale Italian foods business in Passaic. When he arrived Earinella took him to a separate room where no one else was present. Earinella then said that he \u201cwanted his money.\u201d Scaletti replied, \u201cI don\u2019t have that money with me. I will go to the bank and get it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">Scaletti then drove to his bank, where he withdrew $5,000 from a safe deposit box. He placed $2,000 in an envelope which he later gave to his office manager to keep in his safe. He put the other $3,000 in his pocket and returned to Earinella\u2019s place at about 2 p.m. There he gave Earinella the $3,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">When Earinella proceeded to count the money, Scaletti asked him if he was satisfied. Earinella replied, \u201cYes,\u201d arid Scaletti then asked, \u201cNow you don\u2019t expect any more,\u201d to which Earinella replied, \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">A few days later Gola called Scaletti and arranged to meet him at the latter\u2019s office the following day. At this meeting Gola said that D\u2019Arco wanted his money, the $2,000 previously mentioned. Scaletti got the $2,000 from his office safe and handed it to Gola.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-9\">Scaletti told Gola to count the money but Gola just put it in his pocket. Scaletti asked, \u201cNow, what do you expect?\u201d Gola replied that he wanted $5,000. Scaletti balked at the amount and then said, \u201cThen you expect, between all you fellows, $10,000, is that right?\u201d To that Gola said, \u201cOne fellow got $3,000 and the other fellow got two and he wanted five.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b87-10\">Scaletti\u2019s next conversation with Gola occurred on July 25, 1974 when they met in Scaletti\u2019s office in Pompton Lakes. Scaletti told Gola that he had $1,000 for him. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>gave him the money and again told him to count it. Again Gola did not do so and they had no further conversation on that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">Title to the garage property changed in mid-October 1974, at -which time Sealetti moved his business to Riverdale.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">He next met Farinella in late October at a political dinner at which time Farinella told Sealetti that he\u2019d heard about a letter which indicated that Sealetti was being investigated by the State. Sealetti told him, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to it,\u201d and walked away.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">\u25a0 In early January 1975 Sealetti and his attorney met with representatives of the Attorney General\u2019s office and ultimately entered into an agreement whereby his corporation, Albert Sealetti, Inc., would plead guilty to a charge against it and Sealetti would be given personal immunity for his part in both the so-called \u201cWindbeam Property\u201d deal (the same one to which the corporation pled) and the Pompton Lakes garage sale here involved. In return, Sealetti promised his truthful testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">Also in furtherance of the \u201carrangement\u201d with the State, a recording device was set up on Scaletti\u2019s telephone by the State Police. On January 16, 1975 Sealetti contacted Gola by phone and arranged a meeting later that same day. Before this meeting, however, Sealetti was fitted with a concealed transmitting device and went unannounced to Farinella\u2019s place of business. Police and Deputy Attorneys General were stationed in a nearby car monitoring and recording the conversation which Sealetti had with Farinella inside the building.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-8\">The transcript of the recorded conversation indicates that Farinella suspected that Sealetti was taped and the transcript of this conversation contains little of significance.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-9\">As arranged, Gola came to Scaletti\u2019s office at approximately 4 p.m. The ensuing conversation lasted about 1-1/2 hours. It was monitored and recorded in the same fashion as the Farinella conversation. At the meeting Sealetti gave Gola $1,000 in bills which had been marked by the State. Upon leaving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>Scaletti\u2019s office Gola was apprehended and a search revealed the marked bills.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\">The statements made by Gola at this meeting are clearly incriminatory both of himself and Farinella. Both the tapes and the transcriptions of these conversations were admitted into evidence over objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">As indicated, Gola did not testify, nor did he produce any witnesses in his behalf.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-6\">[The court holds there was no error in (1) denying defendant\u2019s motion for severance of the defendants or, alternatively, of the county of the indictment, and (2) allowing the Scaletti-Gola and Scaletti-Farinella tapes in evidence.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">Defendant\u2019s third contention that the trial judge erred in \u201callowing the tapes to be admitted into evidence since the conspiracy had terminated and therefore <em>Evid. R. </em>63(9) did not apply\u201d is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-8\"> It is clear that the jury could find that the conspiracy involved an agreement to make payments to Joe D\u2019Arco Farinella and Gola. At the time the conversations were taped, payment of the $5,000 demanded by Gola had not been concluded. A conspiracy is presumed to have continued as to each member of it until either the object of the conspiracy has been established or there is proof of an affirmative act of withdrawal as to one or more members thereof. <em>Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law and Procedure </em>(1957), \u00a7 92 at 202; see also Annotation, 4 <em>A. L. R. </em>3d 671, \u00a7 3 (1965). There is no suggestion of any act of withdrawal of Farinella from the conspiracy. The fact that he had been paid did not terminate the conspiracy, for Gola remained to be paid. This conspiracy not having been terminated when the conversations occurred, the tapes and transcripts thereof were properly admitted into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-9\">Defendant further contends it was error for the trial judge to permit the jury \u201cto consider the taped conversations of Scaletti and Gola\u201d in their deliberations as to the substantive crimes charged against defendant Farinella.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>The trial judge instructed the jury on this issue as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-4\">[I]f you find based upon the proofs that a conspiracy, in fact, existed and that the defendants were among the co-conspirators, then any statement made by one defendant in furtherance of the conspiracy would be binding on the other defendant even though the other defendant was not present and, of course, if you find that such statement was, in fact, made.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-5\">* * * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-6\">I further charge you that this rule will be binding in determining whether or not the defendants are guilty of any substantive offense, but only if you find that a conspiracy, in fact, did exist and both defendants were parties to that conspiracy and that the statement was made in furtherance of the object of the conspiracy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">Defendant charges that such instructions were erroneous, relying on the following passage from <em>State v. Seaman, </em>114 <em>N. J. Super. </em>19 (App. Div.), certif. den. 58 <em>N. J. </em>594 (1971), <em>cert. </em>den. 404 <em>U. S. </em>1015, 92 <em>S. Ct. </em>674, 30 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 662 (1972):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-8\">Finally, defendant claims that although the recordings might have been evidentially competent as to the conspiracy charge, they played no part in the misconduct and extortion charges and their use was therefore confusing to the jury and prejudicial. There is no basis to this claim. The trial judge in his charge specifically and clearly told the jury that the Broskie tapes could not be cor sidered in relation to the other offenses (besides conspiracy). A similar argument was raised and rejected in <em>State v. Dennis, </em>43 <em>N. J. </em>418, 424 (1964). [114 <em>N. J. Super. </em>19 at 28.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-9\">Defendant seeks to draw the inference that the court there ruled that hearsay statements of one co-conspirator could not be used against another coconspirator in the deliberation of any charges other than that of conspiracy. We disagree. On the contrary, it there appeared that defendant conceded the relevance of the statements to the conspiracy count but challenged their relevance to the substantive offenses. Here, the taped conversations between Scaletti and Gola were clearly relevant to the substantive offenses charged. Moreover, defendant\u2019s contention is contrary to existing law on the sub-</p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>ject. In the case of <em>State v. Louf, </em>64 <em>N. J. </em>172 (1974), the Court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-5\">This Court has held that where a conspiracy is shown to exist, the acts and declarations of any of the conspirators in furtherance of the common design may be given in evidence against any other conspirator. The rule is applicable where it is charged that a crime was committed in pursuance of a conspiracy, whether or not the indictment contains a count for such conspiracy, [at 176]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">See also <em>State v. </em>Carbone, 10 <em>N. J. </em>329, 338 (1952), and <em>State v. Rios, </em>17 <em>N. J. </em>572, 596 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">If declarations made by co-conspirators in furtherance of the common design are admissible against all conspirators in those situations where the indictment does not charge conspiracy, then such declarations are clearly admissible to prove the commission of the substantive crimes where a conspiracy to commit the crime is charged. <em>Evid. R. </em>63(9) (b)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> does not provide that statements admitted pursuant to its terms are to be admitted for the limited purpose of proving the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">We conclude that the judge did not err in permitting the jury, in its deliberations, to consider the taped conversations of Scaletti and Gola as to the substantive crimes charged against defendant Earinella.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b91-10\"><em>Evid. R. </em>63(9) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-11\">A statement which would be admissible if made by the declarant at the hearing is admissible against a party if . . . (b) at the time the statement was made the party and the declarant were participating in a plan to commit a crime or civil wrong and the statement was made in furtherance of that plan.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
