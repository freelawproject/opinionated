Van Ness, </em>Public Defender, attorney for appellant <em>(Ms. Rosemary K. Reavey, </em>Assistant Deputy Public Defender, on the letter brief).</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b520-9\"><em>Mr. William F.

He seeks a return to probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-11\">We are not impressed with his claim that the admitted violation<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u2014 his counsel acknowledged that \u201cMr. McCain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>really never did report to the probation department almost from the very commencement of the probationary term imposed\u201d \u2014 is a \u201ctechnical violation.\u201d Reporting procedures present, as prime purposes, an opportunity for the authorities to detect other violations and, in the appropriate case, to help a defendant avoid them. Frustration of these purposes by a failure to report is, it seems to us, a quite substantial and serious violation. Additionally, protection of the public depends in part on maximum contact between the probation officer and the probationer.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">Be this as it may, the fact of the matter is that probation upon a suspended sentence is a privilege the right to which must be earned anew each day until the probationary period expires. When a defendant \u201cfails to meet the test or chance of freedom\u201d he may be committed to prison. <em>In re </em>White, 18 <em>N. J. </em>449, 455 (1955). We see no reason why society should not expect one who has erred to conform meticulously to every condition on which his freedom depends, including such things as reporting to the probation department.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">We discern no mistaken exercise of discretion in the revocation of probation or the sentence imposed. <em>State v. Moretti, </em>50 <em>N. J. Super. </em>223 (App. Div. 1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b520-12\">Neither of <em>the </em>parties has provided us with the \u201ccopy of the substantive charge prepared by the Probation Department\u201d referred to by defense counsel in his comments at sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-13\">His counsel, having conferred with McCain, reported to the court: \u201cMr. McCain advised me at the time he was placed on pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>bation by Judge Donatelli that he was at that time using narcotics, and one of the terms of his probation was that drug dependency rules were to apply. Now Mr. McCain says that at that particular time he was quite sure that his urine would come out positive for narcotics use and he was simply afraid to report to the probation department.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b521-9\">Beyond the fact of the conceded reporting violation, we note the drug use.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
