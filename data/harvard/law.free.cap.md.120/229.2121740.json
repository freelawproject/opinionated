The jury found him guilty on the second count, and he was sentenced to pay a fine of $100 and costs and to confinement in the Maryland House of Correction for four months. From that judgment he has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-11\">During the trial the defendant reserved nineteen exceptions to the rulings of the Court on the evidence, but all of them present practically the same legal question.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-12\">The State offered the testimony of Anthony Musbaum, the prosecuting witness, and Alethia James, tending to prove the alleged assault, and the testimony of William J ames to facts that occurred after the assault, and then produced the witness, William Hooper, who, after stating what occurred during the assault, testified that after the assault the defendant came back from his house to the bam where the witness and the defendant\u2019s brother, Cornelius Murphy, were: that he heard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>the defendant say that he was \u201cgoing to run them all off the place;\u201d that Cornelius and the witness went up the steps leading to the upper part of the bam and that the defendant followed them, and that Cornelius struck the defendant and he fell down the steps. He was then asked by the State\u2019s Attorney, \u201cWith what did Cornelius hit him?\u201d and he replied, \u201cI don\u2019t know \u2014 I didn\u2019t see Cornelius what he hit him with; I was in the barn inside.\u201d To the question \u201cWere you not on the steps?\u201d he answered, \u201cHo, sir;\u201d and the State\u2019s Attorney then asked the following question: \u201cDidn\u2019t you tell me in my office there (indicating) you were on the steps and saw Cornelius hit him ?\u201d to which he replied, \u201cHo, sir; I didn\u2019t say I saw Cornelius hit him.\u201d When asked to state what happened after Cornelius knocked the defendant down the steps, he said he got up and went out. and in reply to the question, \u201cWhat happened before he got up ?\u201d he replied \u201cWhy nothing.\u201d To the question \u201cDidn\u2019t you say Cornelius hit him again in the barn?\u201d he answered, \u201cHo, sir; I don\u2019t think Cornelius hit him but once; that was on top of the steps; I didn\u2019t see him hit him then.\u201d The State\u2019s Attorney then asked him, \u201cDidn\u2019t you tell me this morning in my office \u2014 \u201d and he replied \u201cHo, sir.\u201d The question was then completed \u2014 \u201cthat he beat him with a piece of ax handle?\u201d and he answered, \u201cHo, sir; I never mentioned ax handle to you; never thought of it.\u201d The State then called Cornelius Murphy, the brother of the defendant, who testified that when he first saw the defendant and Husbaum fighting they were down on the ground and Husbaum was on top; that he didn\u2019t attempt to take Husbaum off but told them to stop fighting; that they didn\u2019t pay any attention to him, and that finally the defendant \u201cturned Husbaum over and struck him in the head with a piece of tin;\u201d that witness then undertook \u201cto pull them apart,\u201d and that Husbaum struck the defendant while the witness had hold of the defendant and \u201cknocked him down and knocked him unconscious ;\u201d that when the defendant recovered consciousness he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>was in a rage with witness because he had interfered and turned on him, and that witness struck him and injured his hand. The State\u2019s Attorney then said to witness, \u201cHow, Mr. Murphy tell the gentlemen of the jury if it isn\u2019t a fact that when you went around there, Husbaum was down and your brother Tom was beating him with a can top?\u201d and he answered, \u201cHo, sir;; that is not right.\u201d When asked if he did not tell Dr. Famous and Clarence Wilson that night that that was true, he replied, \u201cHo, six;\u201d and he was then asked the following questions: \u201cDid you tell either Clarence or Dr. Famous that night that you had \u2014 if you hadn\u2019t struck Tom and knocked him unconscious, at the time you broke your hand you believed he would have killed Husbaum ?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">\u201cDidn\u2019t you tell him (Clarence Wilson) if you hadn\u2019t taken your brother Tom off you believed he would have killed Husbaum ?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">\u201cDid you on the way over there (defendant\u2019s house) tell him (Dr. Famous) that you were sorry to have used Tom up, but if you hadn\u2019t done it you believed he would have killed Husbaum ?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">\u201cHo words to that effect?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">\u201cDid you on the evening of this occurrence at Husbaum\u2019s home, have a conversation with Mr. Husbaum, in the presence of Mrs. Husbaum, his wife, and did Husbaum say to you he saw a dogwood club laying on the ground just after he passed the dairy, that he supposed Tom had picked it up and struck him with it, and did you say, cHo, I saw the club,\u2019 and that it was a sassafras ?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b274-9\">To each of these questions the defendant objected, but the Court overruled the objections, and the witness answered that he did not make the statements referred to. The State then called Mrs. Husbaum, Clarence Wilson and Dr. Famous, who were permitted, against the objection of the defendant, to testify that Cornelius Murphy made the statement referred to in said questions and other statements contradictory of his testimony in chief. These rulings of the Court below <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>.are the errors complained of in the first, second, third, fourth, \u00a1sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, tenth, eleventh, twelfth, thirteenth, fourteenth, fifteenth, sixteenth and seventeenth hills \u2022of exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">The rule in this State in regard to this character of evidence was definitely settled in the case of <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Briscoe, </em>65 Md. 561, and repeated and re-affirmed, without any qualification, in the very recent case of <em>State </em>v. <em>B. &amp; O. R. R. Co., </em>117 Md. 282, where it is said: \u201cIf the witness has made to -the party who calls him, or to the attorney of such party, a \u00a1statement totally variant from his sworn testimony, and on the faith of such statement, he has been called, he may be asked if he made such a statement, and if he denies it, we \u00a1see no objection to the proof of such statement, not for the purpose of impeaching the general character of the witness, but for the protection of the party calling him. If a plaintiff \u2022calls a witness, relying upon statements made to him or his attorney, and when on the stand he proves the defendant\u2019s \u25a0case, we think that the principles of justice require that the -plaintiff should be able to show why he called him. There are objections to either course, but the more objectionable \u2022one would he to hold the party bound by the evidence of such treacherous witness. We restrict such declarations to those made to the party calling him or to his attorney, and made in reference to the ease pending, and do not extend them to \u25a0statements made to others. It is upon the statements so made to the party to the suit or his attorney that the witness is \u2022called. If the witness under such circumstances makes a false statement, he can not complain that his falsehood is \u2022exposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">\u201cBut it is not every statement that may be made even to the party litigant or his attorney, that should be allowed to be contradicted by the party calling the witness. It should be left to the discretion of the judge before whom the case is fried below to allow it to be done. The Court should be .satisfied that the party has been taken by surprise, and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>the evidence is contrary to what he had just cause to expect from the witness based upon his statements, and that such statements were about material facts in the case. It is not every light or trivial circumstance that would justify it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">It is apparent that the rulings of the Court below were in direct violation of the rule stated, and were calculated to injure the defendant. Some of the statements as to which Cornelius Murphy was interrogated, and to which the witness called to contradict him testified, were said to have been made in the presence of Anthony Husbaum, and it is urged by the counsel for the State that the exception to the general rule in reference to statements made to a party to the suit should include statements to a prosecuting witness. But we can see no reason for extending the exception, for apart from the inconsistency of impeaching a witness whose credibility has been vouched for by calling him, further and more serious objection to such evidence is its tendency to confuse and mislead the jury, who, in criminal cases, are the judges of the law and facts, by diverting their attention from the evidence bearing directly upon the real issues involved, or causing them to give undue weight or significance to the statement sought to be established. The admission of such evidence should be strictly confined to the only purpose for which it is at all admissible, namely, to explain the surprise occasioned by contrary statements made to the <em>party </em>calling the witness or <em>his attorney </em>in reference to the pending case.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">The fifth bill of exceptions states that \u201cTo each of said last five questions and answers the defendant, by his counsel, objected because the same were not pertinent to the inquiry, but the Court overruled the objection to such question and each answer, to which action of the Court the defendant objected, and prayed the Court to sign and seal this his fifth bill of exceptions,\u201d etc. Each ruling of the Court on the evidence should be made the- subject of a separate exception.. One bill of exceptions can not be made to embrace several exceptions to rulings on the evidence, and when it includes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>more than one exception this Court will refuse <em>to </em>consider them. <em>Junkins </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>110 Md. 539; <em>B. &amp; O. R. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Rueter, </em>114 Md. 687.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">In the eighteenth exception the defendant objected to the State\u2019s Attorney testifying in the case. He was a competent witness and we see no ground for the objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">After the objection was overruled, the State\u2019s Attorney testified as follows: \u201cI want to say to your Honor, and gentlemen, that yesterday morning I took Hooper out the first-opportunity I had to talk with him. I was going to take him in my office, but stopped at the door and asked him about this occurrence, and that he told me just a few minutes before we began this case, that in front of the dairy Tom was knocked in the ditch, that he didn\u2019t see the blow struck, he knew that Husbaum didn\u2019t do it because Husbaum was standing the other side of him, that he couldn\u2019t have done it, that he did go in the ditch at the command of Cornelius and choked him. He also told me that subsequently he came from the house, carrying a piece of board or a piece of plank and followed him up into the barn, and that Cornelius struck him and knocked him down the steps, and also told him if he got the first blow to hit hard, or Tom would clean him up, and as he came up Cornelius struck at him and knocked him down the steps, he then went down the steps after him and \u25a0went on him with an ax handle and beat him. That was his statement to me a few minutes before he went on the stand.\u201d The nineteenth exception'is to the refusal of the Court to grant the motion to strike out all -of his testimony. The only purpose for which it was admissible was to contradict the testimony of the witness Hooper as to statements made by him to the <em>State\u2019s Attorney </em>and in regard to which he was examined while on -the witness stand, and the only questions asked Hooper in reference to any such statements were: \u201cDidn\u2019t you tell me in my office there (indicating) you were on the steps and saw Cornelius hit him?\u201d and \u201cDidn\u2019t you tell me this morning in my office that he beat him with a piece of ax handle?\u201d In so far as the testimony of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>State\u2019s Attorney did not relate to the statements referred to in these questions it was clearly inadmissible, no foundation having been laid for such testimony. <em>Sewell </em>v. <em>Gardner, </em>48 Md. 178; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Briscoe, supra; State </em>v. <em>B. &amp; O. R. R. Co., supra. </em>The motion, however, was to strike out <em>all </em>his testimony, and where such a motion is made, and any part of the evidence thus objected to is admissible, the motion should be overruled. <em>Jessup </em>v. <em>State, </em>117 Md. 119. The record does not contain all the evidence produced at the trial, but as far as we can judge from the evidence before us the statements to which said questions refer do not relate to the offense charged in the indictment, but to matters occurring after the alleged assault, and constituting no part of the <em>res gestae.- </em>It appears from the evidence that after the assault charged, the defendant went or was taken to his house, and that about ten minutes later he came to the barn where the witnesses, Hooper and Oornelius Murphy, were, and the statements in question were in reference to what then occurred between the defendant and his brother Cornelius, out of the presence of Husbaum, and which Cornelius explained by stating that the defendant was mad with him because he claimed that Cornelius had interfered while he was defending himself against Husbaum. There may have been evidence adduced to the trial which made what occurred after-wards between the defendant and his brother Cornelius pertinent and material, but there is no such evidence in the record, and the -State should not have been allowed to contradict the witness as to an immaterial matter. <em>Handy </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>5 Md. 450; <em>Byers </em>v. <em>Horner, </em>47 Md. 23; <em>Wright </em>v. <em>State, </em>88 Md. 705; <em>Sloan </em>v. <em>Edwards, </em>61 Md. 89; <em>City Pass. Ry. Co. </em>v. <em>Tanner, </em>90 Md. 315.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">Because of the errors in the rulings in the first, second, third, fourth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, tenth, eleventh, twelfth, thirteenth, fourteenth, fifteenth, sixteenth, seventeenth and nineteenth bills of exceptions the judgment appealed from must be reversed and the case remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and a neiv trial awarded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
