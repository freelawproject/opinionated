Giering, the appellant\u2019s testator.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-14\">The case was heard by a jury which rendered a verdict for 1he plaintiff for the sum of $600, upon which a judgment was entered for that amount. In the course of the tidal eleven exceptions were taken to the rulings of the Court upon I he admission or rejection of the testimony, one to its rulings upon the prayers, and another upon the ruling of the Court in refusing to inform the jury that certain testimony referred to by counsel for the appellee in his argument to the jury, had been stricken out-</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>The first three exceptions are to the rulings of the Court in permitting the appellee, Rellie C. Sauer, to testify as <em>to </em>the services she rendered to the defendant\u2019s testator, and as to the amounts she had reecived in compensation therefor. The statute, section 3 of Article 35 of the Code of 1912, provides that, \u201cNo party to the cause shall he allowed to testify as to <em>any transaction had with </em>or statement made by the testator,\u201d etc. This testimony was not admissible under this statute. The witness, a party to the suit, was testifying as to the transaction with the defendant\u2019s testator upon which she had brought her action, and the Court below, in permitting her to give such testimony, in our opinion, committed a prejudicial error.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">It is contended by the appellee that even though this testimony given by the witness in response to questions, to which \u2022objections were made and exceptions noted, was inadmissible, nevertheless, the defendant was not damaged by the admission of this testimony because like testimony was permitted to be given by her without objection. As was said in the case of <em>P., B. &amp; W. R. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Greene, </em>110 Md. <em>45: </em>\u201cThis class of testimony does not fall within the principle \u25a0so often announced that the Court will not reverse the judgment where competent evidence favorable to the plaintiff\u2019s \u25a0cause has been first excluded, and afterwards admitted, because in such cases it is apparent that no injury has been \u25a0done.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">In this case the defendant objected to the admission of this testimony and his objections were overruled and the injurious testimony admitted, to which rulings he excepted. It was not necessary that he should continue to object to like testimony in order to avail himself of the exception so taken by him, but he had a right to stand upon his exception to the admission of such prejudicial testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">The fourth exception, the exact meaning of which is difficult to ascertain, but so far as we are able to understand it, is upon the Court\u2019s ruling in admitting the conversation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>between tbe husband of the plaintiff with the defendant, Dr. Giering, in the presence of the plaintiff after the death of Joseph X. Giering. In this conversation the plaintiff and her husband were told by Dr. Giering that his father in his will had left to her the household furniture, at which, as the witness expressed it, he was dumbfounded, and he told the doctor that his father \u201chad promised a thousand dollars, that is the reason there was no claim, or anything made.\u201d Both he and the doctor became excited, and witness said, \u201cWell, if we can\u2019t get it in a peaceful way we will let the Court decide it,\u201d and he was told by the doctor, \u201cWell, go ahead and sue.\u201d The counsel for the appellee (plaintiff\u2019 below) in his brief, in discussing this'exception, says: \u201cIt is impossible to see how this answer would in any way throw any light upon the issue in the case.\u201d In this we agree with him, and if\u2019for no other reason, being immaterial, it was improperly admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">The fifth exception, is to the ruling of the Court in refusing to permit the husband of the plaintiff, upon cross-examination, to answer whether or not he, on behalf of his wife and himself, \u201chad a conversation with D. Giering relative to Mr. Giering, who subsequently died, as to any bills or anything else.\u201d We discover no serious objection to this question, unless, as claimed by the appellee, it is too general in its inquiry as to the subject matter of such conversation. The witness was not asked to give the conversation, but whether he had a conversation with the defendant. The question was asked leading up to the further inquiry as to-its contents. It depended upon what was said in the conversation whether it was admissible, and when asked if he had a conversation with the defendant, the question should have disclosed in a general way the subject matter of the conversation about which the inquiry was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">We think the Court erred in its ruling upon the sixth exception. The witness Sarah B. Owens was asked \u201cDid. he (the decedent) have a cow of his own that he got milk <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>from\u201d? The defense in this case is that the plaintiff did not furnish the decedent with board, but that he provided his own food, consisting, in part, of milk. It it be shown that he had a cow from which he was supplied with milk, such evidence would be admissible under that defense. Moreover, it would likewise be admissible tending to* show that although boarded by the appellee, he, in part, supplied the food consumed by him, and if shown to have been furnished by him without cost to the appellee, it was proper to be considered in arriving at the amount to be allowed the appellee for his board.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">The seventh and eighth exceptions were to the rulings of the Court in permitting Sarah E. Owens to testify as to the value of the board furnished by the appellee to the decedent; and the ninth, tenth and eleventh exceptions were to the Court\u2019s rulings in permitting the witness Norwood to testify not only as to the value of the board, but likewise as to the value of the nursing said to have been rendered by the appellee to the defendant\u2019s testator.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">Both of these witnesses were called and examined as experts. Mrs. Owens was asked: \u201cHaving heard the testimony of Mr. and Mrs. Sauer in reference to the board bill of $480, from November, 1907, to April 1, 1911, what in your opinion would be a fair price for that board?\u201d which she was permitted to answer, under objection, stating that she thought it was a fair price for said board. The record disclosed that about a year prior to 1910, while employed in Richmond by the Old Virginia Antique Eurniture Store, she aided her sister in the management of a small hotel in that city, by looking after the financial part only. When she returned to Baltimore she boarded with her sister and paid her five dollars a week, although there was really no \u201cdefinite price\u201d. Her daughter boarded there, but she did not think her daughter paid anything. She had never kept a boarding house in Baltimore. When asked: \u201cAre you or not familiar with boarding rates in the City of Baltimore; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>have you boarded in the Oity of Baltimore\u201d ? she replied: \u201cI never boarded only with my sister.\u201d She did not know the charges for board in Baltimore, although she had been told they were about like they were in Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">The witness Norwood testified that he was at that time boarding on Eutaw Avenue; that he boarded there with his invalid wife to the time of her death, in February, 1910; that during his married life he frequently employed a nurse for his wife. He was then asked: \u201cWhat do you think is a fair price for the board of Mr. Giering?\u201d Thp defendant objected to the question, but the Court overruled the objection and the witness asked \u201cMay I answer it by telling my own experience ?\u201d He was then asked: \u201cFrom your experience as a boarder, boarding alone and with your wife, what do you ihink would be a fair price for the board of Mr. Giering in his lifetime?\u201d This question was also objected to, but he was permitted to answer, giving the price in his judgment. He was then asked: \u201cFrom your experience in employing a nurse in that neighborhood out there, and you have heard the testimony in Court, what do you think would be a fair price for the services rendered by Mrs. Sauer to Mr. Giering\u201d ? This question, too, was objected fi&gt;, but the objection was overruled and the witness was permitted to answer, stating, as he thought, a fair price therefor.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">The testimony of these witnesses objected to should not have been admitted. Neither of them, in our opinion, was qualified to testify as an expert, and it is clear that the questions propounded to Norwood were -improper ones even though he had been competent to testify as an expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">The record contains three prayers that were offered by the plaintiff, all of which were granted, and five prayers offered by the defendant, which are designated as the first, second, third, fifth and sixth prayers; these were all refused. The rulings of the Court in granting the plaintiff\u2019s prayers and refusing the defendant\u2019s prayers form the the twelfth bill of exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>The first three pjayers of the defendant ask that the ease he taken from the consideration of the jury. These we think were properly refused from the evidence offered in the case. There is testimony in the record, offered by the plaintiff, showing that the plaintiff, who was not a member of his family or in anywise related to him by blood or affinity, furnished to him board and rendered to him certain services that were accepted by him, for which, it is stated hy one or more of her witnesses, he was to pay to her a stipulated sum. This evidence, tending to show an agreement or contract between the appellee and the defendant\u2019s testator, we think should have been submitted to the jury for its consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">Under the evidence in the case the fifth prayer should likewise have been refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">By the defendant\u2019s sixth prayer the Court was asked to instruct the jury \u201cThat if they believe from the evidence that the plaintiff furnished board or rendered services to the defendant\u2019s testator, for which she has not been compensatedj and that she expected to he compensated therefor by devise or bequest by the last will and testament of the defendant\u2019s testator and not otherwise, then the plaintiff can not recover for the board and nursing in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">In support of this prayer our attention is called to the case of <em>Bantz </em>v. <em>Bantz, </em>52 Md. 686. In that case the son was attempting to recover from his mother\u2019s estate for services rendered to her in her life time, and this Court in discussing his claim, said: \u201cThe services must have been of such character, and rendered under such circumstances, as to fairly imply an understanding of payment, and a promise to pay. There must have been an expressed or implied understanding between the parties that a charge for the services was to be made, and to be met by payment. This Court has said in <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Lee &amp; </em>Welch, 6 G. &amp; J. 316, that it is familiar law, that if services are rendered with the exception of compensation by will, a charge can not after-wards be preferred against the person for them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>Upon an examination of the case of <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Lee &amp; Welch, supra, </em>it will be found, that the son was attempting to recover for services rendered to his father in his life time. The father had never by word or deed promised or held forth an expectation to his son that he would compensate him for his services, nor did the son ever intimate to the father or anybody else that he intended to claim such compensation, but declared that he made no contract with his father, but looked to his father\u2019s will as the source whence this compensation was to flow. The Court in speaking of that case said: \u201cIt is a case, which to the letter comes within the familiar principles stated by Ld. Kenyon, 1 Esp. Rep. 189, <em>LeSage </em>v. <em>Coussmaker and </em>Others, <em>Executors, </em>that if the services were rendered by the plaintiff \u2018without any view to reward, but with a view to a legacy, that he could not set up any demand against the testator\u2019s estate.\u2019 The authorities referred to by the appellants <em>(Jacobson </em>v. <em>Le Grange, </em>3 Johns. Rep., 199; 2 Comyn on Contracts; <em>LeSage </em>v. <em>Coussmaker, </em>1 Esp. Rep. 189; 4 Dallas, 111, 130 <em>; Roberts v. Swift, </em>1 Yeates\u2019 Rep. 209; <em>Patterson </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>13 Johns. Rep. 380; <em>Snyder </em>v. <em>Gastors, </em>4 Yeates, 354) do not impugn the principle upon which the order of the Orphans\u2019 Court rests for its support. They were cases where there either was an express promise of reward, or facts from which the promise might be implied. Here no such facts are to be found; and the case therefore comes completely within the well established principle of law, that no action will lie to recover compensation for services performed, where with a view to a voluntary legacy the services were rendered by the plaintiff without any expectation of being paid the value thereof, or any promise of remuneration, express or implied.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">The case before us falls within the class of cases distinguished, in the opinion, from which we have just quoted, from those cases to which the familiar principle stated by Lobo Kenyon applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">The rule stated in <em>Bantz </em>v. <em>Bantz, supra, </em>that the services must have been rendered with a design, at the time of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>rendition, to charge and an expectation on the part of the recipient to pay for the services, and must have been of such a character and rendered under such circumstances as to fairly imply an understanding of payment and a promise to pay, in order to justify the allowance of the claim against the decedent; applies, as this Court said in <em>Bixler </em>v. <em>Sellman, </em>71 Md. 496, \u201conly when a claim of this character is made by a <em>member of the family of the decedent, </em>for of course it must be conceded that generally the law implies a promise to pay for services rendered and accepted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">\"When the services are rendered by a member of the family of the decedent, the presumption of law arises that such services are gratuitous, but with others such legal presumption does not exist. \u201cAs between persons not members of the same family, the mere fact of rendering services useful to the defendant would furnish <em>prima facie </em>evidence of their acceptance, and in the absence of some proof to the contrary, would raise an obligation to pay him what they were worth, there being no proof of special value.\u201d <em>Spencer </em>v. <em>Trafford, </em>42 Md. 20; <em>Wallace </em>v. <em>Schaub, </em>81 Md. 599.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">In this case the record does not disclose any relationship either by blood or affinity between the appellee and the decedent. It is time they had lived in the same house for a number of years, yet she was not <em>&amp;\u25a0 </em>member of his family, in the sense in which the term is used in these decisions, and there was no legal presumption arising against her that the services she rendered to' him, if any, were gratuitous, but in the absence of some proof to the contrary, there was at least an implied obligation upon him to pay her what such services were worth.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">It is said in 40 <em>Cyc. </em>2814, \u201cThere is an implied obligation on the part of one who has received board and nursing from another to pay therefor, when such other is in no wise related to him.\u201d And in the same volume, page 2813, it is said: \u201cWhere one renders service to another in the hope or expectation of a legacy, devise or other provision by his will for his benefit, without any contract express or implied, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>relying solely upon the generosity of a person for whom such services were rendered, he cannot recover for such services because of the failure of such person to make such testamentary provision in his behalf.\u201d But if \u201cservices were performed in expectation of a beneficial provision by will, that will not prevent his recovery if there was an express agreement to pay therefor, or circumstances from which one could be implied by law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">In this case a number of witnesses were produced by the appellee who testified as to the board furnished and the services rendered, which were accepted by the decedent. This at least created an obligation upon him to pay for such services, but in addition to this, there is further testimony that he expressly agreed to pay her therefor. This case is not within the class of cases to which the principle of law found in the sixth prayer applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">The first prayer of the plaintiff does not properly state the law of this case inasmuch as the jury is instructed that should they find certain facts therein mentioned that it \u201cshall find for the plaintiff * * * what said meals and services were reasonably worth,\u201d without regard to their finding upon the alleged contract or agreement to pay a stipulated sum therefor. There is a want of evidence in both first and second prayers as to the value of said meals and services, but no special objection was made thereto in the Court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">The last exception is to the action of the Court in failing or refusing to inform the jury that certain testimony commented upon by the counsel for the plaintiff in making his argument to the jury, had been stricken out. This arose from the impression of the Court that the testimony was still in the record, as he stated, when in fact the record disclosed it had been stricken out. Erom what we have said the judgment will be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\"><em>Judgment reversed and new trial </em>awarded,. <em>with costs to the appellant.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
