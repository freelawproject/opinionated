The discriminatory city action in question is not the equivalent of a reasoned legislative act. II. The right of employees to join and associate with labor organizations of their choice is constitutionally protected from infringement by the city. <em>(N.A.A.C.P. </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>357 U.

The collective bargaining agreements and pending implementing order are squarely within the scope of the Mayor\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>powers. The agreements and pending implementing order effectuate a vital public purpose. <em>(Machinists </em>v. <em>Street, </em>367 U. S. 740; <em>Pennsylvania R. Co. </em>v. <em>Rychlik, </em>352 U.

The Mayor has discretionary power to institute exclusive check-off for the exclusive bargaining agent as an aid to achieving stability in governmental functioning. <em>(Matter of Kleinman </em>v. <em>McCoy, </em>19 <em>N Y </em>2d 292.) III. The collective bargaining agreements and pending implementing order for exclusive check-off for the exclusive bargaining agent are a reasonable exercise of the discretion granted to the Mayor by law. IV. Collective bargaining for the exclusive check-off plan with the majority organization in the bargaining unit is consistent with the principle of fair representation. <em>(Hudson </em>v. <em>Atlantic Coast Line R. R. Co., </em>242 N. C. 650, 351 U. S. 949; <em>National Labor Relations Bd. </em>v. <em>Reed &amp; Prince Mfg. Co., </em>205 F. 2d 131; <em>United R. R. Operating Crafts </em>v. <em>Wyer, </em>115 F.

Exclusive check-off for the exclusive bargaining agent is a permissive subject of collective bargaining under the city program. <em>(Labor Bd. </em>v. <em>Borg-Warner Corp., </em>356 U. S. 342; <em>Industrial Union of Mar. &amp; Shipbuilding Workers r. N.L.R.B., </em>320 F. 2d 615; <em>National Labor Relations Bd. </em>v. <em>Reed &amp; Prince Mfg.

S. 326.) VI. Exclusive check-off for the organization chosen by the majority of the employees in the city-wide bargaining unit as the exclusive bargaining agent is consistent with section 93-b of the General Municipal Law and civil service requirements. <em>(Matter of Moriarity </em>v. <em>Kennedy, </em>20 Misc 2d 593; <em>Matter of Patrolmen\u2019s Benevolent Assn. </em>v. <em>Wagner, </em>8 A D 2d 369, 7 N Y 2d 813, 363 U.

At that time, the city did not recognize any union as an agent for collective bargaining. Later, the city began to recognize unions as exclusive bargaining agents if they were chosen by a majority of the employees in an appropriate bargaining unit. Even then, however, the Board of Estimate resolution extending the check-off privilege to all unions alike was not changed and the city continued to give effect to its provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">In April, 1967, the city modified its union recognition policies by means of an executive order of the Mayor. The order provided (1) that appropriate bargaining units for municipal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>employees were to be established on a city-wide basis or, in some circumstances, on a departmental basis and (2) that the organization chosen by a majority of the employees in each such unit was to be recognized as the exclusive bargaining representative for all employees in the unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">The Mayor proposes to round out this policy by means of a further executive order which will give the privilege of dues check-off solely to the exclusive bargaining agents and will withdraw it from all other unions. It is the declared opinion of the Mayor and the city\u2019s Director of Labor Relations that this plan for a restricted check-off policy, common in private industry, will afford the majority representatives a form of \u201c union security \u201d will increase their prestige and responsibility and will, in consequence, stabilize the collective bargaining process.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">Local 832 (International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen and Helpers of America) and District Council 37 (American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, AFL-CIO) are two unions which include persons employed by the city in nonsupervisory clerical titles. District Council 37 has been recognized by the city as the exclusive bargaining representative for such employees; under the proposed plan it will thus have the exclusive benefit of the dues check-off. Local 832, on the other hand, is a minority union and, accordingly, it will be deprived, under the proposed plan, of the check-off privilege it has enjoyed since 1956.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Strongly objecting, the latter organization, Local 832, has commenced this article 78 proceeding\u2014through its president and several of its members on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated\u2014 to require the city to continue the check-off of dues to it, and to enjoin the city from granting exclusive check-off privileges to District Council 37 or any other labor organization.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>court at Special Term dismissed the petition and the Appellate Division unanimously affirmed the resulting order.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-3\">Under the 1963 New York City Charter (\u00a7 8), the Mayor is authorized to \u201c exercise all the powers vested in the city, except as otherwise provided by law.\u201d He is the successor to the residual powers originally possessed by the Board of Estimate under a similarly worded provision of the 1938 New York City Charter (\u00a7 70) in effect in 1956, when that body adopted the \u2018\u2018 non-discriminatory \u201d check-off policy. (See, also, New York City Charter [1963], \u00a7 1142.) The city\u2014and, thus, the Mayor on its behalf\u2014is empowered to enter into contracts, to regulate the terms of employment and compensation of city employees and to determine the manner of transacting the city\u2019s business and affairs (General City Law, \u00a7 20, subds. 1, 17,19; \u00a7 23, subd. 1). The Charter also specifically authorizes the Mayor to supervise city offices and departments, fix salaries, adopt wage plans and prescribe rules governing working conditions (New York City Charter [1963], \u00a7\u00a7 123, 124, 813, subd. 1). His executive power and discretion thus amply extend to and encompass the proposed action here under review, and no further legislative sanction is required. '</p>\n<p id=\"b637-4\">Contrary to the petitioners\u2019 contention, the Mayor\u2019s discretion to decide which employee organization should have checkoff privileges is not curtailed by section 93-b of the General Municipal Law. That section provides, in its subdivision 1, that a municipality is \u201c authorized \u201d to deduct dues from its employees\u2019 pay.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It is unmistakably permissive, not obligatory. It does not control a municipality\u2019s selection of the unions, if any, to which it may grant the privilege of the check-off; and it certainly does not mandate the continuance of the check-off to minority unions. The only requirements which the section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>imposes are that, if a municipality does adopt the check-off for any union, (1) it must obtain an employee\u2019s written consent before deducting his dues; (2) it must allow the employee to withdraw that consent at any time; and (3) the procedure must be made available only to organizations of civil service employees. These conditions are met in the Mayor\u2019s proposed order.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">That this State\u2019s legislative policy is not antagonistic to the check-off plan embodied in the proposed executive order is manifest, also, from the terms of the Public Employees \u2019 Fair Employment Act (Civil Service Law, art. 14; L. 1967, ch. 392, known also as the Taylor Act). As the court noted in the course of its opinion at Special Term, that statute\u2014which did not take effect until some months after it announced its decision \u2014 explicitly gives majority unions of public employees the right to have their members\u2019 check-off requests honored, and is silent concerning the right to such check-off on behalf of minority unions (Civil Service Law, \u00a7 208). Although our decision in this case will have prospective effect, we need not decide whether the Taylor Act is applicable; it is sufficient to observe that, if the act does apply, it can only reinforce the decision which we reach on the basis of the pre-existing law. In short, the Mayor\u2019s proposed policy is plainly consistent with the scheme set forth in the Taylor Act for according recognition, and a degree of union security, to bargaining agents for public employees; to mention but one provision, section 208 makes it mandatory upon a public employer to extend a \u2018 \u2018 right \u2019 \u2019 of membership dues deduction to a union \u2018\u2018 certified \u201d or \u201c recognized \u2019 \u2019 pursuant to the statute. (See, also, Civil Service Law, \u00a7\u00a7 204, 212.) Whatever discretion a public employer may have, under the act, to grant .the check-off to a minority union not recognized as a bargaining agent\u2014and that question is not before us \u2014 the employer is plainly under no obligation to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">Since we find no statutory obstacle in the way of the city\u2019s proposed check-off policy, we turn to a consideration of whether that policy would, as Local 832 urges, deprive it of due process or equal protection of the laws. We agree with the courts below that it would not. The requirements of due process are satisfied as long as the challenged measure is reasonably related to the attainment of a permissible objective. (See, e.g., <em>Railway </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number><em>Employes\u2019 Dept. </em>v. <em>Hanson, </em>351 U. S. 225, 233-235; <em>Virginian Ry. </em>v. <em>Federation, </em>300 U. S. 515, 558-559.) Similarly, the standards of equal protection are met if a classification, or a distinction among classes, has some reasonable basis. (See, e.g., <em>Baoostrom </em>v. <em>Herold, </em>383 U. S. 107, 111; <em>Morey </em>v. <em>Doud, </em>354 U. S. 457, 464-465; <em>Bucho Holding Co. </em>v. <em>State Rent Comm., </em>11 N Y 2d 469, 477.)</p>\n<p id=\"b639-3\">In the ease before us, the existence of such a reasonable relationship and basis is apparent. The maintenance of stability in the relations between the city and employee organizations, as well as the avoidance of devastating work stoppages, are major responsibilities of the city administration. The Mayor seeks to further these objectives by introducing into city labor relations a practice which has become commonplace in private industry and in the labor policies of other governmental bodies. For example, the Federal Railway Labor Act specifically empowers the carrier and the exclusive bargaining agent to agree on an exclusive dues check-off (U. S. Code, tit. 45, \u00a7 152, subd. <em>Eleventh, </em>par. [b]); the practice is authorized for organizations of Federal civil service employees (Code of Fed. Reg., tit. 5, \u00a7 550.304, subd. [a], par. [5]; Executive Order 10988, \u00a7\u00a7 5, 6, Jan. 17, 1962, 27 Federal Register 551); and it is also followed\u2014according to the record before us \u2014 by the New York City Housing Authority and the New York City Transit Authority. The city program is in accord with national labor policy, which has been built on the premise that a majority organization is the most effective vehicle for improving wages, hours and working conditions. (See <em>NLRB </em>v. <em>Allis-Chalmers Mfg. Co., </em>388 U. S. 175,180.) Be that as it may, we may not consider the merits or the ultimate wisdom of the policy (see <em>Williamson </em>v. <em>Lee Opt. Co., </em>348 U. S. 483, 488); it is enough, as already indicated, that a method of implementing union security, so widely utilized and so long tested as the one proposed by the Mayor, may not be said to lack a reasonable basis or to be unrelated to the city\u2019s legitimate purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-4\">The petitioners also argue that the withdrawal of the dues check-off will weaken their minority union to the point of threatening its very existence. They will thus be deprived, they assert \u2014 pointing to such decisions as <em>Bates </em>v. <em>Little Rock </em>(361 U. S. 516), <em>N.A.A.C.P. </em>v. <em>Alabama </em>(357 U. S. 449) and <em>Thomas </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number><em>Collins </em>(323 U. S. 516)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u2014 of their right of freedom of association guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the Federal Constitution,and by article I of the State Constitution. Their claim lacks substance. Nothing in the city\u2019s labor policy denies members of the petitioners\u2019 union the right to meet, to speak, to publish, to proselytize and to collect dues by the means employed by thousands of organizations of all kinds, that do not have the benefit of a dues check-off. Neither the First Amendment nor any other constitutional provision entitles them to the special aid of the city\u2019s collection and disbursing facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">The order appealed from should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">Judges Burke, Scileppi, Bergan, Keating, Breitel and Jasen concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">Order affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b635-6\">. In labor relations parlance, the \u201c check-off \u201d is the practice whereby an employer -deducts the amount of a union member\u2019s dues from his pay, usually on the employee\u2019s express authorization, and remits it directly to -the union.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b636-7\">. District Council 37 has majority representation status in city-wide units covering over 57,000 employees and in department-wide units covering some 1,300 more. In sharp contrast, Local 832, having an over-all membership in the neighborhood of 1,700, represents only about 1,000 nonsupervisory clerical workers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b636-8\">. The court at Special Term found that the city had undertaken to issue the proposed check-off order in a collective bargaining agreement with District Council 37 and that such agreement constitutes a \u201c final determination \u201d sufficient to provide the basis for review under CPLR article 78. (See <em>Matter of Lipsett </em>v. <em>Gillette, </em>12 N Y 2d 162, 166.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b637-5\">. Subdivision 1 of section 93-b reads, in part, as follows: \u201cThe fiscal or disbursing officer of every municipal corporation * * * is hereby authorized to deduct from the * * * salary of any employee of such municipal corporation * * * such amount that such employee may specify in writing filed with such * * * officer for the payment of dues in a duly organized association or organization of civil service employees and to transmit the sum so deducted to the said * * * organization. Any such written authorization may be withdrawn by such employee or member at any time by filing written notice of such withdrawal with [such] officer.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b640-12\">. The petitioners\u2019 reliance on these decisions is misplaced. The cited cases involved attempts by states to hinder organizations by some affirmative prohibition upon, or intrusion into, their activities. There is not the slightest suggestion that a state or other body must provide services to an organization to help it maintain its competitive position with its rivals.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
