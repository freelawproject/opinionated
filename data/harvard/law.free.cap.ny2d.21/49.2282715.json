Supp. 423.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b82-7\">Breitel, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aco\">Defendant appeals from a judgment of the Appellate Term, First Department, unanimously affirming a judgment of conviction under section 975 of the former Penal Law (possession of policy slips) after a nonjury trial in Criminal Court of the City of New York, Bronx County. Defendant was sentenced to a fine of $300 or 20 days and 10 days in the workhouse.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-8\">Two issues are presented: The sufficiency of proof to establish guilt; and the admissibility of defendant\u2019s statement to a police officer. The officer presented himself at defendant\u2019s apartment with a search warrant. After the officer exhibited the warrant and explained its purpose, but before the officer asked any questions, defendant volunteered to him the whereabouts of the seized contraband which grounds the conviction. Defendant contends that his statement is inadmissible because he was in <em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>custody \u2019 \u2019 when it was made and had not been given \u2018 \u2018 full warnings of [his] constitutional rights \u201d <em>(Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U. S, 436, 445).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-9\">At trial (which was held on August 16,1966, after the date of the <em>Miranda </em>decision), Officer Ivan Marfisi testified that he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>gone to defendant\u2019s apartment on May 26, 1966 equipped with a warrant to search both defendant and the apartment premises. Officer Marfisi had identified himself to defendant, exhibited the warrant, and \u2018 \u2018 explained to him what it was. \u2019 \u2019 Before the officer Pad said anything else, defendant, according to the officer, then stated, \u201c The booklets are in the closet in the room, on top. You are going to find them anyway.\u201d Prior to the introduction of this testimony, counsel for defendant objected to the introduction of any statements made by defendant after the warrant had been exhibited on the ground that \u201ccustodial interrogation\u201d had started at that point. In response to a question on the voir dire, the officer agreed that once he had entered the apartment he would have \u201c prevented [defendant] from leaving the premises \u201d. The trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion, holding that any conversations with the defendant after the exhibition of the warrant but prior to arrest were admissible, without the <em>Miranda </em>warnings, because events were still at the \u201c inquisitorial stage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">Continuing, the officer testified that defendant had led him to the designated closet where he found paper bags containing 4 \u201c series \u201d of mutuel horse race policy (\u201c Bolipol \u201d), each series containing 91 booklets. The officer, who was conceded to be an expert on horse race policy, gave his opinion that some of the slips from the booklets had been \u2018 \u2018 played \u2019 \u2019 although there was no record of that fact. On cross-examination, he explained that possession of this quantity of books indicated that defendant was a \u201c banker.\u201d Pointing out that 9 books were missing from each series, which come in lots of 100, he concluded that defendant <em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>banker \u2019 \u2019 had sold these to a \u201c seller \u2019 \u2019 who would have then retailed them to \u201c players \u201d. There was no record of the sale from defendant <em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>banker \u2019 \u2019 to the \u2018 \u2018 seller \u2019 \u2019 because, according to the officer, \u201c A banker will not keep a portion. A banker will give the complete booklet to the seller \u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">Contending that the \u201c possession of unplayed boli-pol \u201d does not constitute a violation of section 975 of the former Penal Law, defendant argues that the officer\u2019s conclusion that certain of the booklets had been played \u201c was an inference upon an inference and therefore improper. \u2019 \u2019 The expert opinion of the officer was proper because it was based on facts in evidence, the number of booklets seized, coupled with the observation that all of the series were incomplete (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Crossland, </em>9 N Y 2d 464, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>466-467). From these facts, the officer could conclude that the defendant was a hanker and, in the absence of any other explanation, that the missing booklets had been sold to a seller.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">But there is a more fundamental ground for rejecting defendant\u2019s contention on this issue; specifically, his argument that only the possession of \u201cplayed\u201d slips violates section 975. Such a limited construction of the statute is contradicted by its language: \u201cAny person other than a public officer, who shall knowingly, have possession of any writing, paper, or document representing or being a record of any chance, share or interest in numbers, sold, given away, drawn, or selected, or to be drawn or selected, or in what is commonly called \u2018 policy \u2019 or \u2018 the numbers game, \u2019 or in the nature of a bet, wager or insurance upon the drawing or selection of, the drawn or selected, numbers of any public or private lottery, or any paper, print, writing, policy slip, or article of any kind, such as is commonly used in carrying on, promoting or playing the game commonly called <em>\u2018 </em>policy \u2019 shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, except that a person possessing only records of not more than ten of his own bets, wagers, or plays shall not be so guilty. Proof of the possession of any writing, paper, document, print, slip or article of the kind mentioned herein is presumptive evidence of possession thereof knowingly. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">While the first part of the statute could be read to limit offending \u201c paper [s], or document[s] \u201d to those which are records of bets already placed, the omnibus phrase, \u2018 \u2018 or any paper, print, writing, policy slip, or article of any kind \u2019 \u2019 used in policy, has a broader sweep. It embraces all the paraphernalia commonly used for \u201cpolicy\u201d; and possession of such items, whether or not they record the fact that a bet has been placed, is presumptive evidence of violation of the statute (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Kravitz, </em>287 N. Y. 475, 477-478, revg. 262 App. Div. 911, 912 [violation of \u00a7 975 grounded on possession of unsold lottery slips]; Ann. Possession of Gambling Device as Crime, 162 ALR 1188, 1189-1191; cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Lalli, </em>5 N Y 2d 536, 539; but see, contra, <em>People </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>49 Misc 2d 324). Hence, even if the officer\u2019s testimony was insufficient to establish that the missing booklets had been played, defendant\u2019s possession of the remaining booklets\u2014 articles used in playing \u201c policy \u201d \u2014 established that the statute was violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>The remaining question is whether defendant\u2019s statement to the officer disclosing the whereabouts of the booklets was properly admitted. It will be recalled that the statement was made after the warrant had been exhibited by the officer but before he had asked any questions of defendant, let alone informed him of the so-called <em>\u201cMiranda </em>rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">Both the parties and the trial court considered that the resolution of this issue turned on whether defendant was in \u2018 \u2018 custodial interrogation \u201d when he made his admission to the officer <em>(Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U. S. 436, 444, <em>supra). </em>Defendant argues that once the officer entered the apartment and exhibited the warrant, defendant was \u201cdeprived of his freedom in [a] significant way \u201d \u2014 a conclusion said to be reinforced by the policeman\u2019s testimony as to his state of mind, namely, that he would have restrained defendant from leaving\u2014a subjective test. On the other hand, the District Attorney contends (and the trial court agreed) that defendant was not in custody because: he had not been arrested; the police investigation had not reached the \u201c accusatorial stage\u201d; and the confrontation took place in defendant\u2019s apartment, rather than in an \u201c incommunicado police-dominated atmosphere \u201d <em>{id., </em>p. 456).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">Several recent cases tend to support the position of the District Attorney that a pre-arrest interrogation by a police officer in surroundings that are not \u201c police dominated \u201d does not constitute <em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>custodial interrogation \u2019 \u2019 requiring the <em>Miranda </em>\u201cwarnings\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rodney P. </em>[Anonymous], 21 N Y 2d 1, holding that an interrogation of a named suspect outside the suspect\u2019s home did not require the giving of the <em>Miranda </em>warnings; <em>People </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>28 A D 2d 724 [rape suspect questioned in home; Appellate Division, two Justices dissenting, stressed that defendant did not know that officer would have restrained him from departing]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Schwartz, </em>53 Misc 2d 635 [to similar effect]; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Toole, </em>351 Mass. 627 [Sup. Jud. Ct. Mass., 1967 \u2014 extended, but sporadic, questioning of public official in District Attorney\u2019s office]; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Littlejohn, </em>260 F. Supp. 278, 282 [E. D. N. Y., 1966 \u2014 suspect stopped and questioned in car, court noted defendant \u201c could not have believed \u2019 \u2019 he was in custody]; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>259 F. Supp. 496 [D. Mass., 1966, Wyzanski, J.\u2014 seaman questioned on shipboard, did not know customs agents had warrant]; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>but see <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U. S. 436, 478, n. 46, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">While it is quite arguable that a defendant, who is shown a search warrant covering his apartment and person and then questioned, even in his own home, is deprived of his freedom in a <em>\u201c </em>significant way,\u201d this issue need not now be decided (cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Rodney P. </em>[Anonymous], <em>supra). </em>The important point is that defendant was never questioned; rather, he volunteered the whereabouts of the contraband before the officer had asked any questions (presuming that he had intended to do so). As the Supreme Court held in the <em>Miranda </em>opinion: \u2018 \u2018 In dealing with statements obtained through interrogation, we do not purport to find all confessions inadmissible. Confessions remain a proper element in law enforcement. Any statement given freely and voluntarily without any compelling influences is, of course, admissible in evidence. The fundamental import of the privilege while an individual is in custody is not whether he is allowed to talk to the police without the benefit of warnings and counsel, but whether he can be interrogated. There is no requirement that police stop a person who enters a police station and states that he wishes to confess to a crime, or a person who calls the police to offer a confession or any other statement he desires to make. Volunteered statements of any kind are not barred by the Fifth Amendment and their admissibility is not affected by our holding today. \u201d (384 U. S., <em>supra, </em>p. 478)</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">Defendant\u2019s inculpating remark is admissible, then, unless one is to conclude that the mere existence of the search warrant coupled with the officer\u2019s presence amounted to a \u201c compelling influence \u201d. Such an interpretation would extend the <em>Miranda </em>rules beyond their avowed purpose, namely, to forbid \u201c custodial interrogation \u2019 \u2019 by law enforcement officials of suspects who have not been informed of certain constitutional rights. Absent interrogation, <em>post-Miranda </em>decisions have consistently held that voluntary or \u2018 <em>\u2018 </em>spontaneous \u2019 \u2019 statements made by suspects who were plainly in custody are admissible. For instance, in <em>People </em>v. <em>Charles </em>(66 Cal. 2d 330), a defendant was arrested for robbery and, without questioning, made admissions at a police station concerning several robberies in which he had been involved. The Supreme Court of California held that the statements were \u2018 \u2018 voluntary \u2019 \u2019 under <em>Miranda </em>standards and, therefore, admissible. And in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Cruz </em>(265 F. Supp. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>15, 20 [W.D., Texas, 1967]) officers broke down a defendant\u2019s door to arrest him for selling narcotics. In the ensuing search, marked money was discovered and, before he had been given the <em>Miranda </em>warnings, defendant blurted out that the money was his. The statement was held to be admissible. To the same effect, see <em>People </em>v. <em>Kenny </em>(53 Misc 2d 527 [unsolicited statement made by robbery suspect while entering station house]); <em>Ballay </em>v. <em>People </em>(419 P. 2d 446 [Sup. Ct., Col., 1966 \u2014 murder suspect made full confession in jail before interrogation had started]); <em>Pitman </em>v. <em>United States </em>(380 F. 2d 368, 370 [9th Cir., 1967 \u2014bank robber, stopped by officer immediately after robbery said, \u2018\u2018I am the fellow you are looking for; I heisted the bank\u201d]); cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Duke </em>(369 F. 2d 355, 358, cert. den. 386 U. S. 934 [7th Cir., 1966\u2014voluntary admissions in squad car after arrest for possession of narcotics not barred by <em>Escobedo </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>378 U. S. 478]).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\">Accordingly, the judgment of conviction should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">Chief Judge Fuld and Judges Van Voorhis, Burke, Scileppi, Bergan and Keating concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
