In 1964 defendant had signed a limited waiver of immunity and testified before the Grand Jury of New York County which was then investigating bribery of public officials in connection with violations of the gambling laws. During his testimony, defendant denied that he had ever met one \u201c Grumpy\u201d Johnson, a gambler, or that he had ever received anything from Johnson in August, 1960. An indictment for perjury, based on these denials, was returned against defendant on July 19, 1965. After a jury trial in Supreme Court, New York County, defendant was convicted of perjury on March 14, 1966 and sentenced to a term of one year and six months to three years.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">Relying on <em>Garrity </em>v. <em>New Jersey </em>(385 U. S. 493) defendant\u2019s primary contention is that the waiver of immunity signed by him prior to his testimony was wholly \u201cvoid\u201d because it was extracted on pain of losing his job (New York City Charter, \u00a7 1123). Consequently, as he was a prospective defendant of the Grand Jury investigation, defendant claims that he could not be prosecuted for his allegedly perjurious testimony before that body \u201c in the absence of a * * * validly executed waiver of immunity. \u2019 \u2019 Alternatively, defendant argues that he was \u201cdeprived of due process\u201d in that the events which formed the basis of his testimony before the Grand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>Jury and which led to Ms indictment for perjury occurred in 1960, more than four years before he was called as a witness. Finally, defendant argues that there was insufficient evidence to support Ms conviction because he never made a <em>\u2018\u2018 </em>clear and unequivocal \u201d denial before the Grand Jury that he had known or received anything from the gambler, Johnson.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">On September 29, 1964 defendant appeared before the Grand Jury and was informed of the purpose of its investigation. He was advised that he had a right to refrain from answering questions which he believed might incriminate him but that if he wished to retain his employment as a police officer, he was required to sign a limited waiver of immunity. Defendant was also informed that if he signed the waiver, \u201c whatever you say may be used in evidence against you should you become a defendant.\u201d Defendant stated that he understood and, thereafter, signed a waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">Apart from some preliminary questions concerning his finances, the inqmry of defendant was confined to his activities on August 3, 1960 and, specifically, whether he had met the gambler, Johnson, on that date and received anything from him. Defendant was shown a photograph taken on that date by a hidden police motion picture camera wMch depicted Johnson handing sometMng to another man. While he conceded that the other man in the picture <em>\u201c </em>looks like me,\u201d defendant gave the following answers when he was questioned about Johnson:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-7\"><em>\u201c </em>Question: Do you know a policy gambler by the name of Johnson?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-8\">\u201c Answer: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-9\"><em>\u201c </em>Question: Did you ever meet him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-10\">\u201c Answer: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-11\">\u201c Question: Did you ever talk to him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-12\"><em>\u201c </em>Answer: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-13\"><em>\u201c </em>Question: I direct your attention again to Grand Jury ExMbit 220 and ask you whether or not you, Patrolman Goldman, in August of 1960, ever received anything from Mr. Johnson?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-14\"><em>\u201c </em>Answer: I don\u2019t even know Mr. Johnson, Mr. Andreoli.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-15\"><em>\u201c </em>Question: Will you look at 220 [the picture] again?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-16\">\u201c Answer: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>\u201c Question: That shows a picture of a man, I will tell you his name is Mr. Johnson, handing something to a man standing on the stairway which you say looks like you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-5\">\u201c Answer: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-6\">\u201c Question: Did you, Patrolman Goldman, ever receive anything from the man shown in that picture?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-7\">\u201c Answer: No, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-8\">Upon further questioning, defendant stated several times that he did not recall being at the place where the picture was taken nor could he remember the incident depicted. When asked again, however, whether he had ever met Johnson, defendant said, without qualification, \u201cNo, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-9\">At trial, after this testimony had been introduced, a Detective Robert Miles testified that, while in hiding, he had taken the photograph in question (a \u201cstill\u201d excerpted from a motion picture film). Other pictures were introduced of the same incident and Detective Miles identified the two men in all the pictures as defendant and Johnson, a \u201cKnown [policy] Gambler.\u201d Miles also testified that on two separate occasions during this incident, Johnson had handed money in bill form to defendant. The second payment was made after Johnson had. received money from another gambler, William Larkins, and passed it on to defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-10\">Another detective, Gerald Edwards, who had observed the meeting between defendant and Johnson, corroborated Miles\u2019 testimony and the identifications of the two men in the pictures. William Larkins also testified that he recognized one of the men in the photographs as defendant, who was known to Larkins only as \u201cLouie * * * the captain\u2019s man.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b188-11\">Defendant testified in his own behalf and stated that he knew neither Johnson nor Larkins and had never received any money from them. While he admitted that one of the men in the pictures looked like him, defendant denied that it was he or that he had been there. On summation, counsel for defendant stressed that it was unfair for the District Attorney to delay defendant\u2019s appearance b\u00e9fore the Grand Jury until 1964, four years after his alleged meeting with Johnson.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-12\">Turning first to the question of waiver, defendant urges that, as in <em>Garrity </em>v. <em>New Jersey </em>(385 U. S. 493, <em>supra), </em>the waiver he signed before his Grand Jury testimony was the product <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>of coercion. In the <em>Garrity </em>case* decided almost a year after the trial in this case, the Supreme Court held that the failure of the police officers to raise their privilege against self incrimination was motivated, not by free choice, but by the threat of removal from public office. Consequently, the testimony obtained under this \u2018\u2018 duress \u201d could not be used against them <em>\u2018\u2018 </em>in subsequent prosecutions for conspiracy to obstruct the administration of the traffic laws \u201d <em>(supra, </em>p. 495). Defendant, assuming on the authority of the <em>Garrity </em>case that his waiver was therefore, \u201c invalid,\u201d concludes that, as he was a \u201c potential defendant\u201d before the Grand Jury, the oath \u201c could not be legally administered to him \u2019 \u2019 and he may not now be prosecuted for perjury, even if <em>People </em>v. <em>Gillette </em>(126 App. Div. 665) and subsequent decisions of this court which have followed the <em>Gillette </em>rule were applicable. (But see <em>People </em>v. <em>Tomasello, </em>21 N Y 2d 143, decided herewith.)</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">As defendant concedes, the <em>Gillette </em>rule, assuming that it were still a viable rule, does not obtain when the witness, albeit a prospective defendant or one of the subjects of the inquiry, waives his right against self incrimination (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Yonkers Contr. Co., </em>17 N Y 2d 322, 334-335; <em>People </em>v. <em>Macner, </em>171 Misc. 720, 722-723). Nor has the rule protected one who had been granted immunity from prosecution for any substantive crimes from penalties for perjurious or contumacious testimony <em>(People </em>v. <em>Reiss, </em>255 App. Div. 509, 511-516, affd. 280 N. Y. 539; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Gittleson, </em>18 N Y 2d 427). The basis for both of these exceptions is that, unlike the situation in the <em>Gillette </em>case, defendants who either waive or are granted immunity for substantive crimes may then be \u201c legally \u201d sworn <em>(People </em>v. <em>Reiss, </em>255 App. Div. 509, 512, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">With this in mind, it is appropriate to consider the nature and effect of the waiver signed by defendant, particularly in the light of this court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Matter of Gardner </em>v. <em>Broderick </em>(20 N Y 2d 227). In the <em>Gardner </em>case, the petitioner had been dismissed from the New York City Police Department for refusing to waive his privilege against self incrimination when subpoenaed before the Grand Jury. Relying upon the <em>Garrity </em>case, petitioner contended that his discharge was \u2018 <em>\u2018 </em>unconstitutional. \u2019 \u2019 The court, while noting that any testimony taken from petitioner under this waiver would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number><em>\u2018\u2018 </em>inadmissible in a criminal prosecution,\u201d held, nevertheless, that petitioner\u2019s refusal to testify \u201cbore upon his fitness to remain in office \u2019 \u2019 and constituted \u2018\u2018 \u2018 employee insubordination \u2019 \u201d for which he might be dismissed <em>(supra, </em>pp. 230-231).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">For present purposes, the importance of the <em>Gardner </em>case is its holding that a public officer may be validly compelled to testify before a Grand Jury even though his testimony would be the product of \u201cduress\u201d\u2014namely, the threat of removal from public office. True, any waiver exerted by means of this coercive force would be ineffective to prohibit him from raising his right against self incriminatory testimony bearing on a substantive crime, but it by no means follows that he cannot be legally sworn. Quite the contrary, the <em>Gardner </em>case indicates that the oath may be validly administered to a public officer and testimony may be required of him.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">And, if such an officer may be compelled to testify, there must, of course, be sanctions for perjurious or contumacious testimony. Otherwise, the result of the <em>Gardner </em>case would be largely meaningless: the officer must testify, if he is to keep his position, but he can, with impunity, lie, or even refuse to answer questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">The most appropriate analogy is to the prospective defendant who is called before the Grand Jury and granted immunity from prosecution for substantive crimes. As noted above, such a witness was not protected by the <em>Gillette </em>rule, even before its restatement by this court in <em>People </em>v. <em>Tomasello </em>(21 N Y 2d 143, <em>supra) </em>in that he may be validly sworn and subsequently prosecuted for perjurious or contumacious answers. The rationale for such a result was explained in <em>Glickstein </em>v. <em>United States </em>(222 U. S. 139). There, a witness who had been granted immunity under the Bankruptcy Act from prosecution for substantive crimes gave perjurious testimony. In upholding his conviction for perjury, the Supreme Court held: \u2018\u2018 the statute expressly commands the giving of testimony, and its manifest purpose is to secure truthful testimony, while the limited and exclusive meaning which the [defendant\u2019s] contention attributes to the immunity clause would cause the section to be a mere license to commit perjury, and hence not to command the giving of testimony in the true sense of the word.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">\u201c The argument that because the section does not contain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>an expression of the reservation of a right to prosecute for perjury in harmony with the reservations in Rev. Stat., \u00a7 860, and the act of 1893, therefore it is to be presumed and it was intended that no such right should exist, we think, simply begs the question for decision, since it is impossible in reason to conceive that Congress commanded the giving of testimony, and at the same time intended that false testimony might be given with impunity in the absence of the most express and specific command to that effect\u201d <em>(supra, </em>p. 143).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">It is interesting to note that in a recent California case involving facts substantially similar to those involved here, the court, relying on the <em>Glickstein, </em>case, upheld the defendant\u2019s conviction for perjury <em>(People </em>v. <em>Genser, </em>250 Cal. App. 2d 351 [Dist. Ct. of App., 1967]). Even though it does not appear that the California courts have held that a public officer may be dismissed for refusing to waive his privilege against self incrimination when questioned about his official duties, the court in the <em>Genser </em>case distinguished the <em>Garrity </em>case and held that \u201c one compelled to make sworn statements under compulsion such as illustrated by the facts at bench \u201d does not have <em>\u201c </em>a license to make untruthful statements \u201d (250 Cal. App. 2d 351, 355, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">The import of <em>Matter of Gardner </em>v. <em>Broderick (supra), </em>like the statute involved in the <em>Glickstein </em>case, is that testimony should be given by a public officer and \u2018\u2018 its manifest purpose is to secure truthful testimony \u201d. Even though the testimony may not be used against him in a prosecution for any substantive crime, he is not immune from penalties for crimes inherent in the giving of the testimony itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">Defendant\u2019s additional contentions are of no merit. He contends that when his testimony before the Grand Jury is read as a whole, particularly in the light of his oft-reiterated failure of recollection on many details, it is impossible to isolate an outright denial that he ever met Johnson or received something from him. The contention is refuted by the record. While defendant repeatedly professed that he was unable to remember details, such as where he was on the particular day involved, he categorically denied that he knew Johnson, had ever met him., or received anything from him. The falsity of these denials was proved by the testimony of the People\u2019s witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>Finally, defendant argues that the District Attorney unfairly delayed his appearance before the G-rand Jury until more than four years had elapsed from the time of his meeting with Johnson. The contention is not answered by the fact that the indictment for perjury was brought about nine months after defendant\u2019s testimony before the Grand Jury (and, therefore, well within the five-year limitation of section 142 of the Code of Criminal Procedure). But, at most, the delay was a factor to be considered by the jury in determining whether defendant really could not remember meeting Johnson. Counsel for defendant recognized this by stressing the point in his summation, but the jury, in view of his outright denials on this score, must have found that the passage of time had not clouded defendant\u2019s memory\u2014at least with respect to his dealings with Johnson.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">Accordingly, the judgment of conviction should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">Chief Judge Fuld and Judges Van Voorhis, Burke, Scileppi, Bergan and Keating concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
