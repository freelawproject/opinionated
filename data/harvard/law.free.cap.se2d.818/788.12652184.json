Terry argues that the circuit court erred in ruling that her amended complaint failed to\n   state a claim for which relief could be granted against Irish Fleet and Morris under a theory of assumed duty. Finding no reversible error in the circuit court's ruling, we will affirm its judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Because this case was decided below on demurrer, we accept as true the well-pleaded facts set forth in the amended complaint and all inferences fairly drawn therefrom.\n   <em>\n    Tharpe v.

During one of these calls, the caller asked for a taxicab \"from Jesse Lee Apartments, building 700, going to Halcom Manor.\" Morris \"thought this call was a 'red flag' \" because the caller \"indicated [he was] calling from a payphone, but [Morris] knew that there was not a payphone at that location.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   When the caller telephoned again, Morris \"established a call back number\" and \"documented\" it as \"one that merited screening.\" After several calls, Morris dispatched a taxicab, but then cancelled it after \"the caller called back and requested a change in pick-up location to a business that [Morris] knew to be closed, all of the business around it closed, and was in front of the apartment complex.\" Morris also \"called another cab company to warn them about this caller.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On the morning of October 18, Ambrister reported to work \"for Craig Buck and/or Cab King, Inc. and/or John Doe Corporation.\" At approximately 9:15 a.m., Tanya Tatum,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   another dispatcher employed with Irish Fleet, received a phone call \"from the Caller\n   on the same phone as the night before requesting a cab from Jesse Lee Apartments, building 700, going to Halcom Manor.\" Tatum dispatched Ambrister to this caller, and sometime after Ambrister began the transport, he was fatally shot three times by his passenger.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Terry filed an amended complaint against Irish Fleet and Morris, and other defendants, asserting that the defendants \"were negligent and their negligence was the proximate cause of [Ambrister's] death.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   With regard to Irish Fleet and Morris, Terry asserts a theory of assumed duty. Specifically, Terry alleges that defendants\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   undertook, gratuitously or for consideration, to render services, including but not limited to[,] screening calls of potential cab fares callers, pick up locations, drop off locations[,] including the Caller as described in this complaint, and determining the safety risk of the call, caller, and/or location for the health and safety of cab drivers they dispatch, using ordinary car[e] in the screening and selection process of whom they accept fares from and when, or if, they dispatch a cab to the potential callers and location, and the warning of known dangerous or troubling callers or fares to Irish Fleet and all other employees and/or agents of Irish Fleet which Irish Fleet, Tatum, Morris, and/or John Doe should recognize as necessary for the protection of people and other cab drivers, including [Ambrister].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Terry alleges that Tatum \"negligently dispatched [Ambrister] to a known dangerous fare that led to his death despite the documentation in the log book of the troubling calls\" from the prior evening. Terry alleges, in the alternative, that Morris \"negligent[ly] failed to warn and document the safety concern this caller with identifiable call back number posed to the cab drivers['] health and safety, which increased the risk of harm to [Ambrister].\" Terry contends that Irish Fleet is \"vicariously liable for the acts and omissions of their employees ... including Tatum and Morris,\" and that all defendants knew or should have known of prior crimes committed\n   against cab drivers in Petersburg earlier in the year that Ambrister was murdered and in the preceding 25-year period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Irish Fleet and Morris filed demurrers to Terry's amended complaint and asserted, among other grounds, that the amended complaint failed to allege sufficient facts to support a cause of action based on a theory that they assumed a duty to Ambrister. The circuit court sustained the demurrers and Terry nonsuited her claims against the remaining defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In reviewing the circuit court's judgment sustaining the defendants' demurrers, we note that \"[t]he purpose of a demurrer is to determine whether a complaint states a cause of action upon which the requested relief may be granted.\"\n   <em>\n    Murayama 1997 Trust v.

Thus, Terry does not assert facts to support either one of the two theories on which we have recognized a duty to warn or protect against criminal assault by a third party-a duty arising from the existence of a special relationship and a duty voluntarily assumed by an express undertaking.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Instead, Terry's claim that defendants assumed a duty to protect Ambrister is based on an implied voluntary undertaking.

The alleged undertaking is necessarily ambiguous and there is no designated beginning or end to the undertaking.

If we were to recognize that a duty to warn or protect against the danger of criminal assault by third persons could arise outside the context of a special relationship or an express undertaking, the exception would swallow the rule. Therefore, we believe the recognition of a voluntarily assumed duty to warn or protect against the danger of criminal assault by a third person should be confined to express undertakings. Because Terry's claim that Irish Fleet and Morris voluntarily assumed a duty to warn or protect Ambrister against the danger of criminal assault is based on an implied undertaking, the allegations of her amended complaint are insufficient to state a claim against these defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, we hold that the circuit court did not err in in ruling that Terry's amended complaint failed to state a claim for which relief could be granted against Irish Fleet and Morris under a theory of assumed duty.

This standard finds no support in our caselaw, in the Second Restatement of Torts, in persuasive authority from other states, or in academic commentary. It is inconsistent with the concept of an assumed duty as that concept comes to us from the common law. The effect of this unique rule is to remove any accountability for those who have, by their conduct, assumed a duty to warn or protect against the criminal acts of others and negligently performed this duty. The majority thereby leaves persons who have detrimentally relied on such conduct without recourse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The majority acknowledges, as it must, the proposition that a duty can be assumed implicitly,\n   that is, by conduct, as well as by an\n   express undertaking.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 323 (1965).

This does not mean, as Terry suggests, that \"if the plaintiff alleges that a defendant undertook a duty to act for the safety of another,\" the claim cannot be challenged by demurrer. What it means is that the court determines whether the law recognizes an assumed duty based on the facts alleged and the fact-finder determines whether plaintiff has proven those facts. Indeed, in making this observation in\n    <em>\n     Burns\n    </em>\n    , we cited decisions in which we reviewed the factual allegations to determine whether they were sufficient to state a claim based on the theory of assumed duty.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Kellermann\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=278%20Va.%20478\">\n     278 Va. at 489-90\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=684%20S.E.2d%20786\">\n     684 S.E.2d at 791-92\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (determining whether plaintiff alleged sufficient facts to plead a viable cause of action against defendants on the theory that they assumed a duty to plaintiff's daughter);\n    <em>\n     Didato\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4204427\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/262/617/#p628\">\n     262 Va. at 629\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=554%20S.E.2d%2042\">\n     554 S.E.2d at 48\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (determining whether plaintiff alleged sufficient facts to support theory of assumed duty).

For purposes of our analysis, however, we assume that her claim is based on actions the defendants took voluntarily, not actions required by law.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    As applied to this case, the majority notes that \"there is no specifically described undertaking\" and \"[t]he alleged undertaking is necessarily ambiguous.\" The plaintiffs alleged that the dispatching service assumed a specific duty through their conduct, and that was to warn cab drivers when a prospective fare presented suspicious circumstances. The complaint details these suspicious circumstances. This specific duty was owed not by an \"indefinite\" number of persons-dispatchers and dispatch companies are a definite class-and it was not owed to an \"indefinite\" number of individuals-cab drivers operating in a geographic area constitute a readily ascertainable and limited class of persons. The majority also assumes that this practice of warning cab drivers of potentially dangerous fares \"is undoubtedly common to the dispatching business in general.\" The record does not support this assumption, and I will confess my lack of expertise with respect to taxicab dispatching practices. Moreover, even if a duty is commonly assumed, it does not alter the fact that it has been assumed and others have relied on the performance of that duty to their detriment.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    The original quote is \"The Christian ideal has not been tried and found wanting.
