He brought home asbestos fibers and his car was contaminated with these fibers. His daughter, Wanda, lived in his home and was exposed to asbestos beginning in 1942. Beginning in 1954, she regularly helped launder her father's clothes, shaking off and breathing in asbestos dust in the process. She moved out of the home in 1969.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In December 2013, Wanda Quisenberry was diagnosed with malignant pleural mesothelioma, caused by exposure to asbestos dust and fibers. She died from the disease three years later. Her son, Wesley Quisenberry, administrator of her estate, brought this action in the Circuit Court of the City of Newport News. As is relevant to this certified question, the complaint alleges that in the years Wanda was exposed to asbestos, particularly between 1950 and 1969, the Shipyard knew or had reason to know of the dangers that asbestos posed to workers' family members and members of the public, including Wanda. The complaint alleges the Shipyard was negligent in choosing not to exercise reasonable care to, among other things, sufficiently warn workers not to wear work clothes home; educate workers about safeguards such as coveralls; provide a locker room, showers, or laundry service; and adhere to various statutes, regulations, and guidelines. The complaint further alleges that this negligence proximately resulted in Wanda's death. A separate count alleges gross negligence and wanton and willful conduct on the part of the Shipyard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   After removing to federal court, the Shipyard sought to dismiss this action on the basis that the plaintiff's theory relied on \"take home\" exposure liability. Although this Court has not addressed the specific issue, the Shipyard represented that Virginia precedent did not support imposing a legal duty on an employer for injury to an employee's family member that occurred outside the premises. Agreeing that this Court had not addressed this issue, Quisenberry argued that the majority, although not all, of the circuit courts from Virginia that had considered the issue had recognized such a duty. The Shipyard then moved to certify the question to the Supreme Court of Virginia to resolve the issue. On November 3, 2017, the Eastern District issued a certification order requesting that this Court exercise its discretion to consider this dispositive question of law. On November 16, 2017, this Court issued an order accepting the certified question for oral argument and requesting briefing. We now consider the question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   II. DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    A. Restating the Question\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The certified question in this case characterizes the Shipyard and Wanda as having \"no relationship.\" The pleadings clearly indicate they lack a contractual, familial, employer-employee, or agency-agent relationship, or facts giving rise to a \"special relationship.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thompson v. Skate America, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4203632\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/261/121/#p129\">\n    261 Va. 121\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 129,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=540%20S.E.2d%20123\">\n    540 S.E.2d 123\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 127 (2001) (collecting examples of special relationships recognized in Virginia). They are, generally speaking, strangers under the law. This is not, however, dispositive as to the existence of a duty.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Whether the circumstances surrounding the issue now being litigated created a sufficient relationship for\n   duty to lie in a general negligence claim is a question of law. This inquiry is distinct from the traditional characterizations of \"relationship\" above and is dependent on whether plaintiff has pled a set of circumstances where the Shipyard placed Wanda within reach of the Shipyard's conduct, within a class of persons at recognizable risk of harm. Accordingly, in order to prevent the language of \"relationship\" in the certified question from creating assumptions as to duty under the law, we restate the original question as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Does an employer owe a duty of care to an employee's family member who alleges exposure to asbestos from the work clothes of an employee, where the family member alleges the employer's negligence allowed asbestos fibers to be regularly transported away from the place of employment to the employee's home?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \"[W]hether a legal duty in tort exists is a pure question of law.\"\n   <em>\n    Volpe v.

This case relies on an existing duty of care, firmly established in Virginia law and well-rooted in common law, establishing liability to those members of a class of persons facing a recognizable risk of harm from one's conduct. And, under the facts as alleged in this complaint, the family members of asbestos workers are one such class of persons. The Shipyard argues that establishing a duty in this area must fall to the legislature. Although the legislature is of course free to intervene so as to calibrate in either direction the scope of the duty, default principles rooted in the common law establish the existence of a duty here.

In\n   <em>\n    Dudley\n   </em>\n   , we held that the private operator of a \"halfway house\" for convicted felons had a special relationship with its clients, giving rise to a potential duty of care to control its clients' actions. As in all actions premised on a duty to protect against third party conduct, the absence of foreseeable harm may\n   <em>\n    defeat\n   </em>\n   a potential duty to protect against third party conduct arising from a special relationship.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth v.

In Virginia, there is no duty arising from foreseeable harm.

And the principles governing liability for the maintenance of private nuisances do not give rise to such a duty.
