F. </em>Smith, for Ware.</attorneys>\n<opinion><p id=\"b696-5\">Where one of two parties or joint adventurers has filed a cross complaint and obtained an injunction against the other, in respect of the partnership affairs, a receiver will be granted on the latter\u2019s motion, although his original complaint contains no prayer for a receiver.</p><p id=\"b696-6\">And where it appears that each party is equally entitled to the possession of the joint effects, and one has enjoined the other from receiving or disposing of the same; on the application of the latter, a like injunction will be granted against the former, without any proof of insolvency or other special cause for depriving him of the control.</p><p id=\"b696-8\">These points were decided by Sandeobd, J., upon advisement with the Chief Justice and Paine, J., on a motion by the plaintiff for an injunction and receiver, in a suit commenced by him against Ware. His complaint asked for an injunction, but not for a receiver. Ware had previously filed a complaint against him, in which he asked for a receiver, and had obtained an injunction, restraining the above plaintiff from receiving or disposing of the property in question, which was the proceeds of a partnership, or of several joint adventures, in the African trade. The plaintiff alleged, that the property would be insecure in Ware\u2019s hands, but this was denied.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"
