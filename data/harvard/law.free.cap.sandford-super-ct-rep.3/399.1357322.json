On discharging the cargo at New York, there proved to be nearly four hundred and sixty chaldrons. <em>Held, </em>that there was nothing in the charter party which made the measuring or weighing conclusive upon the parties, and that the owner of the vessel was entitled to be paid four dollars for every thirty hundred weight.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b407-6\">And T.\u2019s agent, to whom 'the cargo was delivered in New York, oifering to pay in cash, the freight as specified, on <em>four hundred chaldrons </em>only, and refusing to settle on any other terms; <em>held, </em>that by such refusal the owner was discharged from the obligation of waiting for the expiration of the thirty days, before commencing proceedings for the recovery of the freight.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b407-7\">Where the master of a vessel has merely an equitable interest in her, under a contract with the owner, to become the owner of one eighth part whenever he shall pay for it; the vessel, in the mean time, being run for their joint account, but entirely subject to the control of the owner ; the master has not such an interest as to make him a necessary party to proceedings instituted by the owner for the recovery of freight earned by the vessel.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b407-8\">It is well settled, that a party must object to the competency of proof, at the first opportunity. Thus, when a paper is attempted to be proved by a witness, whose deposition is taken before the trial, any such objection to the proof must be made at the time of taking the-deposition. If not then made, the party will be precluded from raising it on the trial.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b407-9\">The statute requirement that there shall be two sureties in a bond to procure the discharge of an attachment upon a vessel, is for the benefit of the creditor; and he may dispense with more than one, without invalidating the bond.</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b407-10\">(Before Oaklet, Ch.

The bond was conditioned to pay the attaching creditor, the amount which Tremlett justly owed him, &amp;c. It was executed by Whitney, the agent of Tremlett, with one surety only. The principal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>facts are set forth in the opinion of the court. The declaration, after stating the proceedings under the statute, set up a claim of the plaintiff against Tvemlett, for the freight of coal carried under an unsealed charter party from Pictou, H. S., to Hew York, in the ship James Edward, and for demurrage while the ship was at her port of discharge. It contained counts both for the non-delivery of an acceptance,'and for the freight itself. It was provided in the charter party, that the freight should be paid at the rate of four dollars per chaldron, Pictou measure of 30 cwt., by an approved acceptance within thirty days from the period of discharging the cargo.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b408-5\">At the trial before Yabderpoel, J., on the 16th October, 1848, the execution of the charter party was proved by the captain of the vessel, and that under it he went to Pictou, and obtained a cargo, with which he proceeded to Hew York. The coal was not weighed at Pictou. The bill of lading signed by the captain, described the cargo as consisting of four hundred chaldrons. In the margin of the bill, were these words, \u201cweight of chaldrons unknown,\u201d written by the captain. It appeared by the testimony of one of the measurers of the custom house, who was employed to measure the cargo, that the same consisted of 451 chaldrons. It also appeared that on the arrival of the vessel, she was detained twelve days longer in discharging her cargo than the terms of the charter party allowed, which delay was occasioned by the consignees; and that fifty dollars per day was a proper allowance for demurrage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b408-6\">Objections were taken on the trial to the competency of the captain of the vessel, and to the maintenance of the action, on the ground of his being a part owner in the vessel; also to the admissibility of the charter party, without the testimony of the subscribing witness, both of which were overruled. As to the former point, it appeared from the testimony of the captain, that he had, some five years before, made a verbal contract with the owner, for the purchase of an interest in the vessel, which, however, had never been consummated; and that since the making of the contract he had received a portion of the profits of the voyages. A release was executed on the trial, by the captain, to the plaintiff of all his interest in the subject of the suit. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>defendants had offered to pay for the freight of 400 chaldrons of the coal, but declined paying for more.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b409-5\">The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff for $2,156 85.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b409-6\"><em>F.

Paine, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AMb\">It appears in this ease, that the charter party was executed by J. B. Dowd, agent for Tremlett, and attested by a subscribing witness. It contained a stipulation, that \u201c freight should be payable at four dollars per chaldron, Pictou mines measure of 30 cwt., in approved acceptance of thirty days from the period of discharging the cargo, and twelve days allowed for discharging in New York.\u201d At the foot of the charter party was the following direction in Dowd\u2019s handwriting, to the master, to whom the charter party was delivered\u2014\u201c On arrival at Pictou, you will address yourself to Mr. Henry Poole, the superintendent at the mines, who will be instructed to give you every possible dispatch.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b409-9\">The vessel was loaded at Pictou in the usual manner. The coal was brought to the ship, from the mines, in cars unequally loaded, and the weight of the coal was not ascertained. The master signed a bill of lading containing the same stipulation as the charter party, and noted in the margin, <em>\u201c </em>weight of chaldrons unknown.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b409-10\">By the bill of lading, the cargo was deliverable to Tremlett or his assigns ; and on the ship\u2019s arrival at New York, the defendant Whitney\u2019s house, of Soule, Whitney &amp; Co., claimed to receive the cargo as the agents of Tremlett, and it was delivered to them. It turned out, that instead of four hundred chaldrons of coal, of thirty cwt. to the chaldron, there were nearly four hundred and sixty chaldrons.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-11\">After the delivery of the cargo, the plaintiff, who was owner of the vessel, presented a bill to Soule, Whitney &amp; Co., for the freight of 458{- chaldrons of coal, with this note at the foot: \u201c Satisfactory acceptance at thirty days, from Nov. 8th, 1841,\u201d (the time of the delivery.) Soule, Whitney &amp; Co., declined to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>settle the bill, but said they were ready to pay in cash (deducting interest for the thirty days) for four hundred chaldrons, at four dollars, and when urged by the plaintiff to settle, they refused to settle upon any other terms. The plaintiff then said he would attach a cargo belonging to Tremlett; and Soule, Whitney &amp; Co., replied, \u201cWe have to settle only for four hundred chaldrons at four dollars each.\u201d The plaintiff then began his attachment proceedings, before the thirty days had expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">The defendant Whitney, who was examined by the plaintiff on the trial, stated that he knew the terms of the charter party; that he. received it inclosed in a letter addressed to him by Tremlett ;\u2022 and that the terms of the charter party were discussed between him, and the plaintiff. The defendants\u2019 counsel did not raise the question at the trial, whether the charter party received by Whitney, was in any respect different from, that delivered to the captain of the ship, and offered in evidence on the trial by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">The captain of the vessel, who was the plaintiff\u2019s principal witness, was, during the whole of the voyage, entitled, under an agreement with the plaintiff, to an eighth of the vessel, on his paying for it, but the vessel was held by the plaintiff, under a bill of sale to himself, and stood in his name alone. The captain, however, shared in the profits and losses of the vessel up to the period when he decided not to become an owner, which was not until after this voyage was wound up. On the trial, the captain executed a release to the plaintiff to remove the objection of interest, but the defendants still insisted, that he should, on account of his interest in the vessel, have been joined as a co-plaintiff in the action and proceedings under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">The defendants\u2019 counsel also insisted on the trial, that the charter party was not sufficiently proved, without proof of the handwriting of the subscribing witness, who resided in London. He also objected, that the proceedings were instituted before the expiration of the thirty days; that the bond declared upon was void, because it was executed by Tremlett\u2019s agent with only one surety; and that no evidence should have been received, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>showing the actual weight of the coal, the parties being bound by the Pictou chaldron, as per bill of lading. And upon all these points which were ruled against him, the defendant took exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">We do not think there is much intrinsic difficulty about any of these objections. The master was never the legal owner of this vessel. He had an interest in her, under a contract with the plaintiff to become the owner of an eighth part whenever he should pay for it. In the mean time the vessel was run for their joint account, but entirely subject to the plaintiff\u2019s control as owner. It is a transaction of the most ordinary occurrence, and in which the real owner always acts, and is regarded, as a trustee for the person who has a right to become the purchaser. It is true, that one may be a legal owner of a vessel without written evidence of ownership; and it is equally true, that one may be only equitably interested and yet have full evidence in writing of his interest. It is the nature of the interest, and not the evidence of it, which determines whether he is legal owner. There ' is no difference in this respect between property in ships and other property. In this case the master had merely an equitable interest under a contract, and, by the rules of pleading, should not have been made a co-plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">It is a well settled rule of evidence, that a party must object to the competency of proof at the first opportunity; and, when a paper is attempted to be proved by a witness, whose deposition is taken before the trial, any such objection to the proof should be made at the time of taking the deposition. In this case, Webster, the master, was examined some months before the trial, and proved the execution of the charter party by Tremlett\u2019s agent. No objection was then made to the sufficiency of the proof, or that the paper should have been proved by the subscribing witness. This precluded the defendant from raising the question at the trial. But, independently of this, the charter party was not an instrument executed and laid aside, merely as evidence of the rights of parties. At the bottom of it were written directions from Tremlett\u2019s agent to the master, for his government, and which the witness did not subscribe. In this state, the charter party was- delivered to the masterand the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>cargo was expressly received and delivered under it; and the agents of Tremlett, as well as the master, regarded it, and acted under it, on all occasions, as the contract between the parties. Under such circumstances, it would be but a perversion of a rule of evidence to require, that it should be proved by the subscribing witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">The conduct of Tremlett\u2019s agents in Hew York, when called upon for a settlement, whether we regard it as a refusal to perform the contract, or as a waiver of the thirty days credit, discharged the plaintiff from the necessity of waiting for the expiration of the thirty days, before he commenced his proceedings. If Tremlett\u2019s agents, who 2\u2019eceived the cargo, had no authority to give the acceptance, as the defendants insisted at the trial, then there was so much the more reason for the plaintiff\u2019s being allowed to proceed at once.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">As to the objection that the bond was signed by only one surety, the language of the statute is, that the bond shall be executed by the non-resident debtor or his agent, \u201cwith such sureties as shall be approved.\u201d The plurality of sureties is for the benefit of the creditor, and he may dispense with more than one, without invalidating the bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">The point to which most importance seems to have been attached by the defendants, is that by the terms of the charter party, the plaintiff was <em>bound </em>to receive the coal as four hundred chaldrons, Pictou mines measure of thirty cwt., because Tremlett\u2019s agent delivered it to him as such; that the expression in the charter party \u201c thirty cwt.\u201d was mere surplusage; and that he had no right to have the weight of the chaldrons ascertained. This is the defendants\u2019 view, so far as we have been able to understand it. We think, on the contrary, that the thirty cwt. is a very material expression in the contract. It is a defining and restraining clause, and has very much the appearance of having been inserted at the master\u2019s desire or suggestion, either from a knowledge of the way in which vessels were loaded at the mines, or from a distrust of the uncertain meaning of the word chaldron. Its importance in this case appears from the fact that about an eighth more cargo was put on board the vessel under the contract, than was agreed for.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>The plaintiff was entitled to be paid four dollars for every thirty hundred weight. There is nothing in the charter party which makes the measuring or weighing at Pictou conclusive upon the parties. It appears, in point of fact, that it never was measured there with any accuracy, and never was weighed at all. But had it been, there is no reason why any mistake or inaccuracy should not have been afterwards corrected.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">The motion for a new trial must be denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
