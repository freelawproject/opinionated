Ann Demurest had an estate for her life in the premises in question as tenant in dower. She took this estate in dower as an emanation from the estate of her then late husband James Walker, and not as a freehold created by his heirs. Upon the assignment of her dower, the seizin of the heirs intervening between the death of her husband and the assignment, was displaced, (Coke Litt. 15 a,) and the law supposes her to he in, by relation, from the death of her husband on the fourth of November, 1806. Therefore it was not competent for the heirs to make partition. (Park on Dower, 339, 343; Watkins on Descents, 2d ed. 65, 68.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b396-9\">II. On the death of Ann Demurest, on the twentieth May, 1835, the estate descended to those who could make themselves heirs to the person last actually seized. The estate in dower suspended the descent. While the intervening estate continued, the person seized was not a new stock of descent. (3 Johns. Cas. 214, <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Gomer; </em>13 J. R. 260, 262, <em>Bates </em>v. <em>Schroeder; </em>16 ibid. 96, 99, <em>Jacksons.

Ann Demarest having been the tenant of the freehold, under an assignment of her dower, from the death of her husband James Walker, in 1806, until her decease in 1835, there was no lawful authority in the mayor\u2019s court of the city of New York to make a partition of the lands assigned to her for her dower, during the continuance of her estate in dower therein, 'among the heirs at.law of James Walker, deceased. The proceedings for that purpose were wholly inoperative against the plaintiff, and those to whose rights she has since succeeded, and did not change nor extinguish the rights which she and they had respectively in the premises in question, as the heirs at law of James Walker, the elder, deceased. The plaintiff is entitled to recover her proportion of the premises in question in this suit. (Co. Litt. 147, a, sect. 247; do. 169, sect. 250; 1 R. R. of 1813, 507, sec. 1.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b397-5\">Y.

Upon the death of James Walker, one equal, undivided sixth part of his estate, including the premises in question, descended to each of his six children, subject to the dower estate of then* mother, Ann Walker, afterwards the wife of Thomas Demarest.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b397-8\">II. The descent was <em>not suspended </em>by the intervention of this dower estate, but the heirs immediately acquired a <em>seizin vn lorn </em>of the estate descending. The only effect of the dower estate preventing the heirs from acquiring <em>actual possession </em>was, that had James M. R. Walker, or any of his brothers or sisters, died before they acquired such possession, <em>or the title of the tenant in dower was released, </em>and not having conveyed away their estate or interests in the property, the estate would then have descended to the heirs of James Walker, the original ancestor then living, and not to the heirs of James M. R. Walker, or his brother or sister so dying. In other words, actual possession or a release from the tenant in dower, was necessary to constitute the heir the new stock of descent, but was not necessary to vest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>the estate in him. (Chitty on Descents, 55, title \u201cSeizin;\u201d Ibid, c. 4, \u00a7 2, \u201cSeizin of Ancestor;\u201d <em>Stringer </em>v. <em>New, </em>9 Mod. 363; Co.

Walker, a lunatic, and the master in chancery under the chancellor\u2019s order in lunacy, to James Bailey, in Harch, 1827, passed to Bailey, the grantee, <em>the vested remwi/nder in'fee </em>of James H. R. Walker in the property, subject to the life estate of Mrs. Demarest, the widow, for her dower; and the widow by her trustee uniting in the conveyance and releasing her dower, perfected the estate, which Bayley, the grantee, acquired <em>as am estate in </em>possession, and made it a fee simple absolute. (See cases cited above.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b398-7\">IY. The appearance of Rachel Ann Fowler, who, at the time of the commencement of the partition suit in the mayor\u2019s court, was a minor of about twenty years of age and a married woman, by her husband, who was an attorney of the court and appeared as attorney of record for himself and wife, <em>was, if wny thing, error merely, </em>for which the judgment might have been revere ed on writ-of error, <em>a/nd not a jurisdictional defect making the judgment void. </em>The judgment is therefore conclusive against the claim of Mrs. Fowler; never having been reversed. (1.) The mayor\u2019s court was a court of record of general jurisdiction, and although the proceedings in partition were regulated by statute, this was not a case of summary or statutory jurisdiction merely, but the proceedings were according to the course of the' common law. (2 Revised Laws of 1813, p. 502, \u00a7 5; Ibid. p. 141, \u00a7 3; 1 R. Laws of 1813, p. 509; Foote <em>v. Stevens, </em>17 Wend. 483, and cases cited; <em>Grignon </em>v. <em>Astor, </em>2 Howard\u2019s Rep.) (2.) The judgment is void, only when the court has failed to acquire jurisdiction of the person by the service of process or notice of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>appearance in any shape. Wherever there has been an actual appearance, however erroneous, it must be corrected, by writ of error, and the judgment is good until reversed. <em>(Foote </em>v. Stevens, 17 Wend. 483, and cases cited; <em>Bloom </em>v. Burdick, 1 Hill 142; <em>Hart </em>v. Seixas, 21 Wend. 40; <em>Thompson </em>v. Talmie, 2 Peters 157; 2 Hill 333; 16 Wend. 48; 2 Hill 391; 2 Saund. R. 203; 8 Cow. 361.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b399-5\">\"V\". If the judgment in partition were void, it would not help the plaintiff, as in that case the conveyances by the committee of James M. R. Walker and the trustee of Mrs. Demarest to James \"Bailey, passed all James M. R. Walker\u2019s interest in the property.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b399-6\">Bv the OomtT. Sai-tofobd, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A1K\">The plaintiff\u2019s first point is undoubtedly correct, that upon the assignment of dower to the widow of James Walker in the premises in question, the seizin in fact of James M. R. Walker, (or of the heirs of James W., if the partition were to be laid out of view,) was displaced, and the dowress was in, by relation, from the time of the death of her husband. But we think the conclusions which the plaintiff derives from this proposition are entirely erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">1. As to its effect on the partition. The assignment of dower was made by the commissioners in partition, as a part of their supposed duty under the order of the court in the partition suit. As a judicial act, the whole thing was nugatory, because it was not authorized by the statute of partition then in force. The assignment derived its vitality, not from the order of the court directing the commissioners to make it, nor from the commissioners signing their report in which lands were allotted for dower, nor from the judgment of the court confirming the report and directing the partition to be made and the dower to be allotted accordingly. But the assignment of dower, thus made by the commissioners without authority, became valid and obligatory upon the heirs, by the widow\u2019s entry upon the lands assigned, and by the heirs\u2019 subsequent adoption and ratification of the commissioners\u2019 proceedings. We cannot infer from the interlocutory judgment of the court, which appointed the commissioners and directed both the partition and the assignment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>of dower, an authority from the heirs, who were parties to the suit, to the commissioners to make as their agents, a parol assignment of dower, which of itself would defeat the principal object of the partition suit. The court, acting, it is true, for all the parties, made an erroneous order respecting the dower. On holding that order to be of no effect, we have no right to imply from it an authority for the officers of the court to do by parol and in pais, what the parties never intended should be thus accomplished.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">Their subsequent adoption of the partition and assignment of dower, doubtless, precluded them from disturbing the latter; but this is on a very different ground from that of a previous authority to make the assignment. The result of our reasoning is, that when the judgment of partition was made, there had been no assignment of dower effected ; the heirs were still seized in fact, and the partition between them became effectual, unless the proceedings were defective, because of the infancy of the plaintiff. Before proceeding to that subject, we ought to add, that if the assignment of dower were held to have become operative simultaneously with the judgment of partition, it could not have the effect to defeat the latter. Although the seizin of the heirs in the lands allotted for dower became divested at the instant of the judgment, yet during that instant they were seized, and that was sufficient to support the partition.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">2. The fact, that Mrs. Eowler was an infant, and appeared in the suit by an attorney, instead of a guardian, rendered the proceedings irregular and voidable, but it did not make them void. Without reference to the question as to the general or limited jurisdiction of the mayor\u2019s court, or to the point that the proceeding was wholly of a statutory creation, and not a branch of the common law jurisdiction of the court; it is sufficient to say, that the act for the partition of lands then in force, did not make the appointment of a guardian for infants a preliminary to the court\u2019s entertaining the suit against them. Infants were to be notified and served in the first instance. (1 Rev. Laws 507, 511, \u00a7 2, 8.) Jurisdiction was thus acquired, irrespective of infancy, and an omission subsequently to appoint a guardian for an infant, did not affect the jurisdiction of the court to pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>nounce a judgment in the suit. On a writ of error, such an omission might have been fatal to the judgment, but never in any collateral suit or proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">3. It was contended that James M. R. Walker, who became entitled to the premises in question in severalty, by the judgment in partition, subject to the widow\u2019s life estate in the whole premises, never had any actual seizin of the same, and on his death without issue, the same descended to the heirs of his father, as the person last seized, of whom the plaintiff is one. And further, that the conveyance made by the committee of the estate of James M. R. Walker, did not transmit the estate to his grantee.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">Although according to the common law, James M. R. W. was not seized in fact, from 1814 until his death, and therefore was not a stock of descent in respect of the lands in question, his right and title were alienable. They were a vested estate in the land itself, which he could convey absolutely. He had the freehold in law, although not in deed, (Litt. Ten. \u00a7 <em>44T, </em>448 ;) and such freehold would pass by his deed. (Co. Litt. 266 b, and 53 b; Shep. Touch. 222, 238.) The plaintiff\u2019s error on this point consists in assuming, that because the descent was suspended during the pendency of the life estate, therefore, the power of alienation was suspended also. The latter consequence never ensued, when the reversion was vested in interest, although the feudal rules of descent, from time immemorial, established the former doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">The plaintiff has failed to show any existing title to the premises, and there must be judgment for the defendants.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
