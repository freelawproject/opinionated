There was no question upon the evidence, of the plaintiff\u2019s being entitled to a verdict; and in respect of the damages, the judge having reported that the amount was much beyond what in his opinion the circumstances of the case required, he was advised and he so ordered, that the plaintiff\u2019s consent to a reduction of the amount, should be imposed as one of the terms of granting the motion.</summary>\n\n<attorneys id=\"b743-7\"><em>Rodgers &amp; </em>Woodman,, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AdU\"><em>M.

At the trial, before Saudeoed, J., five witnesses who were Germans, proved the slander to have been spoken in the German language, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>words used were shown by a sworn interpreter, to mean in English precisely the words alleged in the complaint. The defendant moved for a nonsuit, and the judge said the complaint was defective in not having stated the slanderous words in the language in which they were spoken, with an averment of their meaning in English, and that the hearers understood German, <footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>but the judge preferring not to fix at the trial the terms on which the complaint might be amended, gave the plaintiff leave to proceed, and subsequently if he obtained a verdict, to apply to him at chambers, on notice, for leave to amend, with the same effect as if moved at the trial. The cause thereupon proceeded, and the plaintiff obtained a verdict for a large sum. He thereupon moved at chambers, for leave to amend his complaint, as of the time of the trial. There was no proof or affidavit offered on. the part of the defendant, at the trial or on the motion, that he had been misled or surprised by the variance.
