Ann Hamilton was the owner in fee of the lot of land in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>question prior to the making of the deed to Francis Many, and the plaintiffs, as her heirs at law, upon her subsequent decease, intestate, became entitled to and owners of the lot, unless the gift supposed to have been made by her to St. Clement\u2019s Church, and the instruments executed for effecting such gift, were valid and effectual to pass the title. The church claims no title except under those instruments.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b254-5\">IT. Under the act to provide for the incorporation of religious societies, St. Clement\u2019s Church is incorporated and empowered to hold real and personal property to a Ernited amount of income; but this simply constitutes the church a person, (or body corporate,) with capacity to hold real estate. Within the prescribed Emits, the church is placed on the same footing with individuals, and all conveyances to the church must be governed by the same laws, and are subject to the same restrictions as conveyances to natural persons. (2 R. L. of 1813, ch. 60, p. 213; not revised in 1830.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b254-6\">IH. Where several instruments relating to the same subject matter are made at the same time, they must be taken and considered as one instrument, and construed together. <em>(Jackson </em>v. McKinney, 3 Wend. 236; <em>Hayes </em>v. Kershaw, 1 Sand. Ch. R. 263.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b254-7\">IV. Every instrument must be construed according to the intent of the parties; and in the construction of an instrument creating or conveying any estate, it is the duty of the court to carry into effect the intent of the parties, so far as such intent can be coEected from the whole instrument, and is not inconsistent with the rules of law. (1 R. S. 748, title 5, \u00a7 2.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b254-8\">V. A trust is where the legal title to property is vested in one person, and the right to receive the rents and profits belongs to another. And no particular set of words or form of expression is necessary for creating a trust. (4 Kent\u2019s Com. 2d ed. 304-5; <em>Fisher </em>v. Fields, 10 J. R. 495; Sanders on Uses, 215-16; <em>Steeve </em>v. Steeve, 5 J. Ch. R. 1.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b254-9\">VI. By the revised statutes of 1830, uses and trusts, except as therein authorized and modified, are abolished. (1 R. S. 727, \u00a7 45 &amp; 55.) And every future estate in lands is declared void in its creation, which shaE, by any Emitation or condition what<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>ever, suspend the absolute power of alienation for a longer period than during the continuance of two lives in being at the creation of the trust. (1 R. S. 723, \u00a7 14 &amp; 15.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b255-5\">It is also enacted, that the absolute ownership of personal property shall not be suspended by any limitation or condition whatever, for a longer period than during the continuance of two lives in being at the date of the instrument containing the limitation or condition, or in case of a will, two lives in being at the death of the testator. (1 R. S. 773, title 4, \u00a7 1.) All deeds and instruments, made in contravention of these statutory provisions, are void. <em>(Coster </em>v. Lorillard, 14 Wendell 265; <em>Hawley </em>v. James, 16 Wendell 61; <em>Hone's Ex'rs </em>v. <em>Van Schaick, </em>20 Wendell 564; <em>Kane </em>v. <em>Gott, </em>24 Wendell 641.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b255-6\">VIL The interest of Ann Hamilton, Francis Many, and St. Clement\u2019s Church, was, by the instruments in evidence, dated 6th December, 1843, (which must be construed together,) conveyed, and the effect of those instruments, (if valid,) is to convey the lot of land in question to the church in fee; in trust to hold the same, or the proceeds thereof, for ever, and to apply the rents or income to the maintenance and support of the rector or minister, for the time being, of the church. This is an attempt to create an estate and trust not allowed by law, and the instruments in question are consequently void.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b255-7\">VHI. This is not the case of an absolute conveyance of lands to St. Clement\u2019s Church, subject to a condition subsequent, which being illegal, may be declared void, leaving the property in the absolute ownership and possession of the church, discharged of the condition. The intent of the donor, (which must govern,) was not to give the property for the benefit, in any event, of St. Clement\u2019s Church, but to vest the legal title only in the church, for the use of the rector or minister, for the time being. This is a trust which is sufficiently expressed, and being contrary to law, the instrument by which it is attempted to he created is void.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b255-8\">IX. The plaintiffs, as heirs of Ann Hamilton, have inherited and are entitled to the premises in question, and to have the alleged gift to St. Clement\u2019s Church declared void, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>premises released to them, so as to remove the cloud which now rests upon their title.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b256-5\"><em>Unwary Hoffmcm, </em>for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b256-6\">I. The trust created by the various instruments would have been-before the revised statutes a perfectly valid trust, with a trustee competent to take, and a <em>cestui-qui trust </em>clearly designated.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b256-7\">1. A corporate body may be a trustee. <em>(Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Whorewood, </em>1 Vesey Sen. 536; <em>Green </em>v. <em>Rutherfurth, </em>Ibid. 462; <em>Dummer </em>v. <em>Corporation of Chippenham, </em>14 Vesey 251; <em>In the matter of </em>Howe, 1 Paige 214.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b256-8\">2. The <em>cesbwv-qid t/rust </em>was designated, viz. the minister, for the time being, of St Clement\u2019s Church.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b256-9\">8. Such a conveyance for such a trust would have been valid prior to 1830. <em>(Montraple </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>Croke Eliz. 288; the Mortmain Acts, Shelford on Mortmain; Statute of Edward 6, concerning Charities, cited 1 Hoffman Ch. Rep. 249, and cases Ibid. 254; <em>Lyon and Wife </em>v. <em>Herne, </em>Ed. 6, cited Ibid, page 255; <em>Vidal </em>v. <em>Girard\u2019s Ex. </em>2 Howard U. S. Rep. 196.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b256-10\">n. The statute of trusts of the revised statutes of 1830, made no change in this law. It does not apply to trusts for a religious or charitable nature. <em>(The State </em>v. <em>Gerard, </em>2 North Car. Eq. 210; <em>The State </em>v. <em>McGowan, </em>Ibid. 9; <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>Graham, </em>1 Hawks, 96; <em>Shotwell </em>v. <em>Mott, </em>2 Sand. Ch. Rep. 54.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b256-11\">Duer, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ag3\">We shall not decide, in this case, the important questions that were so learnedly discussed upon the hearing, namely, whether the English doctrine relative to pious and charitable uses was in force in this state, as a part of its common law, prior to the adoption of the revised statutes; and if so, whether the doctrine has not been wholly abrogated by the new-statutory provisions in relation to trusts and perpetuities. In giving our judgment in another cause, which has been heard by us during the present term, it will probably be necessary to state our deliberate views in relation to these grave and difficult <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>questions: but the grounds upon which we shall rest our decision, in the present case, render it unnecessary now to consider them.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">When the powers of a corporation are not defined and restricted by its charter, or by any general law, its capacity to take, hold, and dispose of real estate is precisely the same as that of a natural person, and that such a corporation may hold lands, as a trustee, can no longer be considered a doubtful question. But when the purposes for which a corporation may take and hold real estate are expressed and enumerated in its charter, the maxim, \u201c <em>expressio wnius est exclusio alterius </em>,\u201d is invariably applied, and the enumeration is construed as a prohibition of all that it does not embrace. Such a corporation can hold lands for the purposes specified, and none other, and hence every question that can arise as to its legal capacity must be determined solely by a reference to the words of its charter. This principle of construction was adopted by our supreme court, in the early case of <em>Jackson </em>v. Hartwell, 18 John. 422, has since been followed in cases too numerous to be quoted, and is now placed beyond the reach of judicial discretion by an express provision in the revised statutes. (1 R. S. 602, \u00a7 1 and 4.)</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">The rector, wardens, and vestry of St. Clement\u2019s Church are a religious society, incorporated under the general act providing for the incorporation of religious societies, (Laws of 1813, ch. 60; 3 R. S., 1st ed. page 292;) and the provisions of that act, so far as they are applicable to societies of the same denomination, that is, Protestant Episcopal Churches, constitute its charter. The provisions in the fourth section of the act are general, and apply to every religious society, incorporated under the law, and they confer upon each the power \u201c to purchase and hold real estate, and to demise, lease, and improve the same for the use of such church, congregation, or society, or <em>other pious uses.\u201d </em>We do not doubt that the words \u201c for the use of such church or other pious uses,\u201d are to be read in connexion with each of the preceding members of the sentence, and it is equally clear that they must be understood iri the same sense as applied to each. Consequently, every religious society may take lands by purchase to the same uses, for which, when no special use is ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>pressed in the conveyance, it may demise or lease, them, hnt it also follows that it is to snch uses that its capacity to hold lands in trnst must he restricted. The general words, \u201c pious uses,\u201d 'are not to he understood in their broadest sense, so as'to authorize a religious society to hold lands to any use, however foreign to the purposes of its incorporation, that religion and charity may sanction. When lands are conveyed to such a corporation, without restriction, it may dedicate them, by virtue of its power of demising and leasing, to any specific use comprehended in the general objects of its incorporation; but should its trustees apply the rents and profits, by the terms of the lease, to any use or purpose foreign to the objects of the society, and from which its members, as such, would derive no benefit, they would abuse their power and violate their trust, and a court of equity would undoubtedly grant relief by avoiding their act. Hence the power of the corporation to hold lands by purchase, as a trustee, must be subject to the same limitation. The use, specified in the conveyance, must be one of the purposes for which the society was incorporated, and to which its trustees, in the exercise of their discretion, might lawfully apply the property, if generally conveyed. It is a further proof that the wordspious uses\u201d were meant by the legislature to be understood in the restricted sense, that all the lands conveyed to a religious corporation, whether for the use generally of the society, or for some other pious use, are considered as a part of its whole estate, of which the income cannot exceed a limited amount; but, had the legislature intended that such a corporation might hold lands in trust for purposes entirely foreign to the objects of the society, as the land so held could not justly be considered as a part of its estate, it is reasonable to believe that the rents and profits would have been excepted from the limitation of its income.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">Understanding, however, the words of the statute in the limited sense that we adopt, they still leave no room for questioning the validity of the conveyance, which has given rise to the present controversy, whether that conveyance be considered as the act of the original owner, Mrs. Hamilton, or of her immediate grantee, Francis Many. The use or trust expressed in the deed is the application of the rents and profits of the land con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>veyed to the maintenance and support of the rector or the minister, for the time being, of St. Clement\u2019s Church, a purpose to which, had none been expressed in the deed, the same rents and profits might lawfully have been applied by the trustees of the church. The support of its minister, is a duty that devolves upon every religious society, and to afford him that support, may justly be regarded as one of the objects of its incorporation. It is, therefore, a pious use, within the meaning of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">The only question that remains to be considered is, whether the power of a religious corporation to hold lands, upon a trust of this description, has been taken away by the revised statutes, and we have no difficulty in saying that, in our judgment, the trust is just as valid as if the new provisions in the revised statutes, which are relied upon by the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel, had never been adopted. We cannot believe that these provisions were designed to change or affect the powers of religious corporations; for, should they be thus construed, no grant of lands made to religious corporations, since the revised statutes have been in force, can be valid. Every such conveyance creates a perpetuity, and necessarily implies a trust, although none may be expressed, and hence those to whom the care and management of the temporalities of a religious corporation are entrusted, are, with strict propriety, <em>denominated its ti\u2019ustees. The </em>trust, however, upon which they hold its property, it is certain, cannot be referred to any class of those cases which alone are authorized by the revised statutes. The general repealing act, which was adopted by the legislature at the close of the revision, enumerates all the acts and parts of acts that were meant to be superseded and repealed by the revised statutes. Ho mention of the act to provide for the incorporation of religious societies is there to be found; and we are satisfied that there would have been no such omission, had the repeal of that act, or of any of its provisions, been intended. It is an historical fact, that a revision of the act was reported by the revisers, and was not adopted by the legislature, from the conviction that it was expedient, for many reasons, to retain the law exactly in its present form. So far, therefore, from being repealed, it was virtually reenacted.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>Hence we rest in the conclusion that, under the existing law, real estate may be granted to any religious corporation, in trust, for any specific use or purpose comprehended in the general objects of its incorporation. It is a necessary consequence that the bill of the heirs at law, the plaintiffs in this suit, must be dismissed with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
