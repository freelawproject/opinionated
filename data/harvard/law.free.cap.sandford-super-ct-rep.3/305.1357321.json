The complaint stated that the plaintiff was \u201c engaged in the wooden ware business, in the city of Hew York,\u201d and that the defendant had published concerning him, the following slanderous words : \u201cYou are a cheat: you always was a d\u2014n cheat: you came some of your d\u2014n cheating tricks the other day about that check, when you bought some brooms of us, and then kept out of the way. I have got you just where I want you; but there is no bottom to you. I would put you through, but you won\u2019t stand. You will burst or fail, before I have a chance.\u201d The complaint also contained other allegations of a similar character, in which the defendant was charged with having cautioned persons against trusting the plaintiff, and that he would soon break.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b313-10\">The defendant did not answer the complaint. The cause came on before the chief justice and a jury, on the 27th June, 1849. The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff, of $75. After the verdict, the defendant\u2019s counsel moved in arrest of judgment, which motion was denied, and the defendant appealed to the general term.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b313-11\"><em>N.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"A7z\">The slander, as alleged in the complaint, undoubtedly consisted in a charge of insolvency against the plaintiff, who is engaged in the business of vending wooden ware in the city of Hew York, and a distinct intimation that he was unworthy of credit. It is well settled, that such allegations spoken of a merchant engaged in business, constitute an abundant cause of action. But it is contended, that the rule is not applicable to dealers like the plaintiff. We think, however, upon examination, that the principle is not so narrow as was insisted by the defendant\u2019s counsel. Starkie, in his Treatise on Slander, at pages 117 and 118, lays down what we conceive to be the true rule, that imputations upon the credit of merchants and traders, which, if believed, must necessarily operate to their serious prejudice, are actionable; and he cites instances in which the rale has been applied to a great variety of trades and employments, in which credit is usual, and to some which were much less like the business of merchants, than the occupation of the plaintiff. The description in the complaint, of the plaintiff\u2019s employment, in its ordinary meaning, does not, as was said by the defendant\u2019s counsel, imply of itself merely that he was a turner of wooden bowls. It means a buyer and seller of wooden ware, and as such, he is within the established principle by which such words are held to be actionable without proof of special damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
