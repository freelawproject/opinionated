CARCHMAN, P.J.A.D.</author>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">This appeal requires us to address the issue of whether an innocent property owner is entitled to compensation under the New Jersey Tort Claims Act (TCA), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:1-1 to 12-3, as well as 42 <em>U.S.CA. </em>\u00a7 1983 (section 1983), or in the alternative, just compensation from the State under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution and Article I, paragraph 20 to the New Jersey Constitution (the taking claim) when property damage occurs as a result of the execution of a lawful search warrant. The first issue requires an application of the unique facts of this case to the provisions of the TCA. Applying the facts, we conclude that plaintiffs are not entitled to such relief under the TCA. In addition, while we recognize that innocent third-parties suffered damages as a result of lawful government action, we conclude that such loss is not a \u201ctaking\u201d under either the federal or state constitutions, and the proper remedy must result from legislative action to provide relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">We address these issues in the context of the following facts. In February 2004, plaintiff Armatrue Simmons, then seventy-one years old, and plaintiff John Simmons,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> then sixty-six years old, owned and resided in a two-story, multi-unit dwelling located at 33 Lockwood Avenue in the Borough of Freehold, which they operated as a licensed rooming house. Armatrue\u2019s daughter, son-in-law and granddaughter resided with them, and plaintiffs rented six of their seven available rooms to tenants. Willie Tyler, Armatrue\u2019s nephew, rented one of the rooms, and five other unrelated individuals, including two elderly women, rented the other rooms. Plaintiffs had agreed to allow Tyler, who they knew was on probation, to rent a room upon his release from federal prison for drug-related charges, because he had nowhere to live, and they thought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>he deserved a chance. According to Armatrue, after Tyler\u2019s release from prison he attended job training, obtained employment, was not violent, followed her rules and acted like a \u201cgentleman.\u201d She trusted Tyler because, as far as she knew, he was not \u201cdoing wrong.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">On February 26, 2004, a Superior Court judge issued a no-knock search warrant for the property and the adjoining property.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The search warrant was issued based on an eleven-page affidavit submitted by defendant Patrolman Christopher Otlowski of the Freehold Borough Police Department. The affidavit had been reviewed by an assistant prosecutor, and detailed information from reliable confidential informants, other law enforcement officials and from Otlowski\u2019s own lengthy investigation into the two target residences regarding controlled dangerous substance (CDS) activity. At the time, Tyler, the target of the 33 Lockwood search, had five felony convictions in New Jersey, four of which were for CDS possession or distribution. James Brown, the target of the 35 Lockwood search, was on parole, had four felony convictions for CDS possession or distribution, and had several arrests for assault, resisting arrest and obstruction. The affidavit provided that Tyler and Brown, who were related, were \u201ccontinuously walking back and forth between 33 and 35 Lockwood Ave.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">In the affidavit, Otlowski stated that his department had received \u201cnumerous complaints\u201d about Tyler selling drugs at the Freehold racetrack and out of the 33 Lockwood residence. Several reliable confidential informants reported that \u201c[a]s arrests were made at the Freehold Racetrack on different occasions for CDS, [Tyler] started dealing more at his residence and on the street ... due to the pressure of the police in the area of the track.\u201d Surveillance conducted over several weeks confirmed that there was \u201cconstant motor vehicle traffic pulling up to\u201d the 33 Lockwood <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>residence, that the vehicles left shortly thereafter and that Tyler was \u201cobserved on many occasions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">Otlowski also set forth that a concerned citizen informant, who lived in the vicinity of both residences, reported to the police on a weekly and sometimes daily basis over the course of several months that he or she had seen Tyler selling CDS at 33 Lockwood. The informant provided information regarding \u201can overabundance of vehicle traffic pulling up to the residence and into the driveway of the residence,\u201d including one vehicle that was observed \u201con a consistent basis.\u201d The informant provided the police with a description of the vehicle, the driver and the license plate number. Otlowski noted that the vehicle was owned by Damien Stewart, a convicted felon who had admitted \u201cto being the largest [CDS] dealer in Freehold.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">Surveillance conducted over several weeks confirmed the informant\u2019s report that there was an increase in vehicular and foot traffic arriving at the two target residences, that the majority of the vehicles were rental cars and that most of the traffic occurred in the afternoon and evening hours when Tyler was home. During the investigation into the activities at the target residences, Otlowski and other officers observed Tyler and Brown \u201cmaking transactions\u201d in front of the two residences, and Tyler was observed meeting with Stewart in the driveway of his residence, during which \u201can exchange was made.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">Additionally, Otlowski stated that between February 18 and 24, 2004, a confidential informant made a controlled buy of crack cocaine from Tyler in the area of the 33 Lockwood residence, while under constant surveillance by undercover police officers. Between February 20 and 25, 2004, a confidential informant made a second controlled buy of CDS from the 35 Lockwood residence, again while under surveillance by undercover police officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">Otlowski requested that a \u201cno-knock warrant be issued for both residences\u201d based on the concern for the safety of the officers executing the warrant and to prevent destruction of evidence. Otlowski detailed the physical layout of the target residences. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>also indicated that at least five people resided in an upper level of the \u201crooming facility,\u201d and that these individuals were observed \u201cmoving in and out of the rooms constantly\u201d and at \u201call hours of the day, evening and night.\u201d \u201cThe subjects who stay in these rooms are said to have access to the rest of the house such as the common areas of the living room, kitchen and bathrooms.\u201d The informant provided information that \u201csome of the subjects who stay in these rooms purchase CDS from Tyler and Brown and sometimes are observed outside on the property of number 33 acting as lookouts.\u201d Moreover, the large residence had many windows, and there were few obstructions in the front and rear yards, making it possible for a lookout to detect officers before they reached the dwelling. Otlowski stated that he had observed lookouts during two of his surveillance details and changed his location \u201cdue to their curiosity of [his] vehicle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">Further, Otlowski noted that a large dog, usually chained in a pen behind the residences, barked \u201cviciously\u201d whenever anyone approached the properties during the surveillance. The dog was not, however, always outside, and Otlowski suspected the dog might be allowed to enter the 33 Lockwood residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">Finally, Otlowski averred that the \u201cmost important factor\u201d in his request for a no-knock warrant was Tyler\u2019s and Brown\u2019s association with Stewart, who had been observed at the residences several times a week and was \u201cdocumented\u201d as their CDS supplier. Stewart was under investigation for CDS and guns, had been involved in a shooting incident with Patrolman Joseph Cicero of the Freehold Township Police Department, had sold large amounts of cocaine to different CDS dealers and had access to a gun supplier in Jackson, New Jersey.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">The two-month investigation that led to issuance of the search warrant was conducted by the Joint Investigation Team (JIT), consisting of police officers from both Freehold Borough\u2019s and Freehold Township\u2019s police departments, but not from the State Police. Because the JIT drew its members from relatively small police forces, it sought assistance from the State Police\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>\u201cT.E.A.M.S.\u201d unit in executing the search warrant. According to Sergeant Mark Wodell of the Freehold Police Department, prior to execution of the warrant, he and Otlowski had met with members of the T.E.A.M.S. unit and the JIT, during which Otlowski informed the officers that the 33 Lockwood residence was a rooming house, and that the entire house had been included in the search warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">On March 3, 2004, officers from Freehold Township, Freehold Borough and the State Police converged in the area surrounding the target residences. The State Police\u2019s T.E.A.M.S. unit executed the warrant by using a ramming device to forcibly enter the front door and \u201cdeploy[ing] a flash bang into the residence,\u201d which made a \u201cvery loud bang\u201d and created a \u201cbrilliant white light.\u201d The State Police elected to deploy the \u201cflash bang\u201d as a diversionary tactic because of the size of the residence, the number of residents, reports of drug transactions and the presence of a large dog. Upon entry, the T.E.A.M.S. officers secured the residents and brought them downstairs to a central location.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">After executing the warrant, the State Police turned the investigation over to the local police departments to conduct the search. According to Otlowski, he entered the residence at that time and conducted a search of Tyler\u2019s bedroom, searching the dresser and the bed \u201cby hand.\u201d He said he left the room in substantially the same condition that he found it. He did not search any other rooms in the house, and did not have any contact with the smoke detector or sprinkler system.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">Meanwhile, an unidentified man informed plaintiffs, who were attending a prayer meeting at their church, that the police were \u201craiding]\u201d their home. Upon returning home, plaintiffs found that their residence and the surrounding area had been roped off, and they were told to wait outside. When they were eventually permitted to enter their residence, plaintiffs found what Armatrue described as a \u201choly mess.\u201d The parties stipulated that execution of the warrant by the State Police defendants caused $4,312.16 in damages to plaintiffs\u2019 residence, including the cost to replace or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>repair the front door and five interior doors, the fire alarm system, a microwave oven and other personal property, including lighting fixtures, a rug, curtains, a water heater, dishes and glasses. Plaintiffs continued, however, to rent the rooms even though some of the damage had not been fixed as of commencement of the law suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">Meanwhile, the \u201cReturn of Search Warrant,\u201d signed by Otlowski and returned on March 4, 2004, provided that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-6\">The within Warrant served on the 3rd day of March 2004, by making a search therein directed, with the assistance of persons hereinafter named: Freehold Twp/Boro Joint Investigation Team members Lt Larry Loose (FTPD), K-9 unit Billy Martin (MTPD), Ptlm Walter Perski, Ptlm Joe Cicero, myself Ptlm Chris Otlowski, and Freehold Boro Detective Mike George. The NJ State Police T.E.A.M.S. unit also assisted with the entry of the premises.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-7\">33 Lockwood Ave Freehold NJ 07728</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aaa\">No evidence was seized from this premises.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">There is no indication whether any evidence was seized from 35 Lockwood Avenue, or whether Tyler or Brown were arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-9\">As a result of the search and destruction of their property, John stated that his blood pressure was elevated for approximately two weeks after the search. Armatrue, who was a diabetic, set forth that her blood sugar rose as a result of the incident and continues to fluctuate, and that she remained fearful for her safety, experienced difficulty in sleeping and felt \u201cvulnerable and uncomfortable in [her] own home.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b246-10\">Plaintiffs filed a complaint against thirty individual police officers involved in the search, including Otlowski, and against the Township of Freehold (the Township), the Borough of Freehold (the Borough), Manalapan Township<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and the State Police. Plaintiffs alleged that in the course of executing a search warrant defendants \u201cwantonly and maliciously inflicted damages on the premises.\u201d They sought relief against the individual officers for trespass and conspiracy, and from all defendants under the TCA, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>and under 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1983, for violations of their constitutional rights. In addition, they sought relief under the Takings Clauses of the Federal and State constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"AWM\">The Borough and the police officers employed by the Borough, including Otlowski, moved for summary judgment joined by the Township and the police officers employed by the Township.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The motion judge granted summary judgment in favor of the individual defendants, and granted partial summary judgment in favor of the Township and the Borough, dismissing all claims except the takings claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">In May 2009, plaintiffs cross-moved for reconsideration of the grant of partial summary judgment, and to amend their complaint to assert a claim based on the validity of the no-knock provision of the search warrant. These motions were denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">A trial was conducted against the State Police and the twelve individual State Police officers on all claims, and against the Township and the Borough on the takings claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-9\">Following trial, the judge granted the Borough\u2019s and the Township\u2019s motions for judgment, granted the motion for judgment by the individual State Police officers on the basis that they had qualified immunity and entered judgment in favor of plaintiffs for $4,312.16 against the State Police on the takings claim. Plaintiffs appeal the dismissal of their TCA action, and the State Police cross-appeal the judgment on the takings claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-10\">Plaintiffs\u2019 appeal focuses on Otlowski and attacks the \u201cno-knock\u201d warrant, contesting not its issuance, but rather its execution. They assert he was not entitled to qualified immunity, he is personally responsible for the damage associated with the \u201cno-knock\u201d warrant and their proofs satisfied the requirements of the TCA and Section 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>Plaintiffs are not consistent in their arguments. In some instances, they appear to challenge the issuance of the \u201cno-knoek\u201d provisions of the warrant and elsewhere, to concede its validity and to attack its execution. Since we conclude that the warrant was properly issued including the \u201cno-knock\u201d provision, these seeming contradictions are of no moment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">We first address the claims under Section 1983. Plaintiffs instituted this civil action under the TCA, and sought damages for violations of their rights to be free from unlawful searches and seizures under Section 1983. As we previously noted, plaintiffs concede that there was probable cause for issuance of a search warrant but contest the no-knock provision and the scope of the warrant, which allowed a search of the entire dwelling. They focus on Section 1983, and we now address that claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1983 provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-8\">Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or Territory or the District of Columbia, subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-9\">To establish a claim under Section 1983, plaintiffs must prove that \u201cdefendants acted under color of state law and deprived [them] of a well-established federal constitutional or statutory right.\u201d <em>Wildoner v. Borough of Ramsey, </em>162 <em>N.J. </em>375, 385, 744 A.2d 1146 (2000). \u201cThis section does not create any new substantive rights but instead provides a remedy for the violation of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>federal constitutional or statutory right.\u201d <em>Gruenke v. Seip, 225 F.</em>3d 290, 298 (3d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">Government officials are entitled to qualified immunity from liability for civil damages under Section 1983 \u201c\u2018insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wildoner, supra, </em>162 <em>N.J. </em>at 386, 744 A.2d 1146 (quoting <em>Harlow v. Fitzgerald, </em>457 <em>U.S. </em>800, 817-18, 102 <em>S.Ct. </em>2727, 2738, 73 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>396, 410 (1982)). \u201cA right is clearly established when it is sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that his act violates that right.\u201d <em>Bayer v. Twp. of Union, </em>414 <em>N.J.Super. </em>238, 262, 997 A.2d 1118 (App.Div.2010) (citing <em>Anderson v. Creighton, </em>483 <em>U.S. </em>635, 640, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>3034, 3039, 97 L.Ed.2d 523, 531 (1987)). In analyzing a qualified immunity claim, courts consider whether the law enforcement officer\u2019s conduct violated a constitutional right and whether the right was clearly established. <em>Saucier v. Katz, </em>533 <em>U.S. </em>194, 201, 121 <em>S.Ct. </em>2151, 2156, 150 L.Ed.2d 272, 281 (2001), <em>overruled in part by, Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U.S. </em>223,-, 129 <em>S.Ct. </em>808, 818, 172 L.Ed.2d 565, 576 (2009) (noting that the sequence of <em>Saucier </em>two-pronged analysis is not mandatory).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-9\">Our Supreme Court has adopted the federal \u201cobjective reasonableness\u201d standard for determining whether law enforcement officials are entitled to qualified immunity in Section 1983 actions. <em>Wildoner, supra, </em>162 <em>N.J. </em>at 386, 744 A.2d 1146. Under that standard, a law enforcement official is entitled to a favorable judgment as a matter of law when the officer\u2019s conduct is found to be objectively reasonable under the circumstances. <em>Kirk v. City of Newark, </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>173, 184, 536 A.2d 229 (1988). For example, in <em>Kirk, </em>a case challenging an arrest warrant, the Court held that an officer \u201ccan defend a [Sjection 1983 claim by establishing either that he or she acted with probable cause, or, even if probable cause did not exist, that a reasonable police officer could have believed in its existence.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>Resolution of immunity in a Section 1983 action, particularly when it arises out of an alleged unlawful search or seizure, should be decided early in the proceedings, preferably on a motion for summary judgment or dismissal. <em>Schneider v. Simonini, </em>163 <em>N.J. </em>336, 356, 749 A.2d 336 (2000), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 <em>U.S. </em>1146, 121 <em>S.Ct. </em>1083, 148 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>959 (2001); <em>Wildoner, supra, </em>162 <em>N.J. </em>at 387, 744 A.2d 1146.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">Addressing the alleged violations at issue here, \u201c[t]he warrant requirement embodied in both the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, <em>U.S. Const, </em>amend. IV, and in paragraph 7 of Article I of the New Jersey Constitution, <em>N.J. Const, </em>art. I, 117, limits the power of the sovereign to enter our homes and seize our persons or our effects.\u201d <em>State v. Robinson, </em>200 <em>N.J. </em>1, 3, 974 A.2d 1057 (2009). The United States Supreme Court has determined that \u201cthe reasonableness of a search of a dwelling may depend in part on whether law enforcement officers announced their presence and authority prior to entering[,]\u201d and \u201cin some circumstances an officer\u2019s unannounced entry into a home might be unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment.\u201d <em>Wilson v. Arkansas, </em>514 <em>U.S. </em>927, 931, 934, 115 <em>S.Ct. </em>1914, 1916, 1918, 131 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>976, 980, 982 (1995). The announced entry requirement is not, however, absolute. <em>State v. Jones, </em>179 <em>N.J. </em>377, 398, 846 A.2d 569 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">In some cases, issuance of a no-knock warrant, which as the name implies authorizes police officers to enter a home without first knocking and announcing their presence, is lawful under the Fourth Amendment. <em>State v. Johnson, </em>168 <em>N.J. </em>608, 611, 775 A.2d 1273 (2001). The standard for issuance of such a warrant is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-7\">First, to justify a no-knoek warrant provision, a police officer must have a reasonable, particularized suspicion that a no-knock entry is required to prevent the destruction of evidence, to protect the officer\u2019s safety, or to effectuate the arrest or seizure of evidence. Second, the police officer must articulate the reasons for that suspicion and may base those reasons on the totality of the circumstances with which he or she is faced. Third, although the officer\u2019s assessment of the circumstances may be based on his or her experience and knowledge, the officer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>must articulate a minimal level of objective justification to support the no-knock entry, meaning it may not be based on a mere hunch.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-5\"><em>[Id. </em>at 619, 775 A.2d 1273.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">There is no \u201cblanket exception\u201d to the knock-and-announce rule in drug cases consistent with the Fourth Amendment. <em>Richards v.

The Court stated in <em>Jones, supra, </em>179 <em>N.J. </em>at 406, 846 A.2d 569, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJP\">The evaluation of the reasonableness of a no-knock warrant application cannot be made in a theoretical vacuum. The determination is highly fact sensitive and requires a balancing of risks. Among those factors the court must take into account are the practical risks to the officers\u2019 lives and safety, which are of especial concern when a warrant is to be executed in a home.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>Here, the validity of the no-knock provision in the warrant turned on both the officers\u2019 safety and the destruction of the evidence. To satisfy the reasonable suspicion standard when the officers\u2019 safety is at issue, courts have recognized several factors, including, but not limited to, a suspect\u2019s violent criminal history including arrests, an informant\u2019s tip regarding the presence of weapons at the search location that suggest an increased threat to officers\u2019 safety, the size or layout of the search location where one or more of the occupants has a violent criminal past, and whether others involved in the ongoing criminal activity are expected to be present. <em>Jones, supra, </em>179 <em>N.J. </em>at 399-408, 846 A.2d 569. <em>See also Robinson, supra, </em>200 <em>N.J. </em>at 17, 974 A.2d 1057 (applying factors involving amount of time from announcement to execution of search).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">Additionally, \u201c[t]o satisfy the destructibility-of-evidence exception to the knoek-and-announce rule, the police must articulate some reason specific to the crime, to the person under investigation, or to some other permissible factor, that leads them reasonably to believe that destruction of evidence is more than a hypothetical possibility.\u201d <em>Johnson, supra, </em>168 <em>N.J. </em>at 620, 775 A.2d 1273. For example,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-6\">the presence of a surveillance camera and other monitoring equipment to view potential narcotics customers and law enforcement personnel as they approach a drug distribution location can form the basis for an officer\u2019s particularized suspicion that a \u201cno-knock\u201d search warrant is necessary to prevent the destruction of evidence and insure officer safety.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-7\"><em>[State v.

A \u201cdefendant must make a substantial preliminary show<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>ing that the affiant, either deliberately or with reckless disregard of the truth, failed to apprise the issuing judge of material information which, had it been included in the affidavit, would have militated against issuance of the search warrant.\u201d <em>State v. Sheehan, </em>217 <em>N.J.Super. </em>20, 25, 524 A.2d 1265 (App.Div.1987). Further, \u201c[a] warrant which authorizes the search of an entire building when cause is shown for searching only one apartment is overly broad and invalid.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 28, 524 A.2d 1265. We apply this reasoning here.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">Despite the fact that Tyler did not have a violent criminal history, Brown, the target of the 35 Lockwood Avenue residence, had a significant criminal history, and had several arrests for assault, resisting arrest and obstruction. Brown\u2019s criminal history suggested that he had a potential for violence during execution of the search warrant. <em>Jones, supra, </em>179 <em>N.J. </em>at 405, 846 A.2d 569. Additionally, James and Brown, who were related, were seen by Otlowski \u201cmaking transactions\u201d and \u201ccontinuously walking back and forth between 33 and 35 Lockwood [A]venue.\u201d Stewart, who was involved in the alleged ongoing criminal activity as a major supplier of CDS, and was often observed by Otlowski and the confidential informant at the premises, had been involved in a shooting incident with a police officer. Because the ongoing criminal activity included both residences and the areas surrounding the residences, the fact that Brown and Stewart were not actually observed in the 33 Lockwood residence did not diminish the danger to the officers that these men posed \u2014 men who had the potential for violence and were actively involved in the criminal activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">Other evidence in Otlowski\u2019s affidavit also demonstrates that under the totality of the circumstances, a no-knock provision was appropriate. The physical layout of the residence presented risks to the officers in that it made an unobserved approach unlikely, particularly if lookouts were utilized. Further, Tyler\u2019s room was located in the upper level, and the officers had to walk through the house, where tenants had access and were \u201coften moving in and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>out.\u201d These factors combined with Brown\u2019s and Stewart\u2019s violent criminal records, and the ongoing drug activities, provided a sufficient basis to authorize a no-knoek search.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">We deem it of no moment that Otlowski\u2019s affidavit failed to mention that the Borough\u2019s Code Enforcement Official had told him that three elderly people resided on the second floor in three separate rooms. Plaintiffs contend that based on these \u201comissions\u201d the search warrant was improperly entered for the entire household, and not just Tyler\u2019s \u201climited area.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">Otlowski also set forth in his affidavit that the concerned citizen informant provided information that the five residents of the upper floors were \u201coften moving in and out of the rooms,\u201d and that they had access to the rest of the house, such as the living room, kitchen and bathroom. The informant also reported that \u201csome of the subjects who stay in these rooms purchase CDS from Tyler and Brown.\u201d The fact that all of the tenants, including Tyler, had access to the common areas clearly supported a warrant encompassing more than just Tyler\u2019s room. Additionally, although Otlowski failed to apprise the issuing judge that three of the rooming house residents were elderly, it is unknown which of the residents had purchased CDS from Tyler and Brown. It was not unreasonable for the police to expect to find evidence of criminality in the common areas, and in the rooming house bedrooms, other than that occupied by Tyler. We find neither bad faith nor a fatal omission to call into question the scope of the warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-9\">Plaintiffs assert that the judge erred by finding that Otlowski was entitled to qualified immunity under the TCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-10\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:3-l(a) provides that \u201ca public employee is liable for injury caused by this act or omission to the same extent as a private person.\u201d This liability is \u201csubject to any immunity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>... provided by law[.]\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:3-l(b).

The totality of circumstances presented here including the nature of the offenses, the individuals involved and prior violent behavior on the part of Brown and Stewart, two principal actors in this scenario, all support Otlowski\u2019s actions in securing the \u201cno-knock\u201d warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">We now turn to the issue of Otlowski\u2019s conduct in the execution of the warrant, and reach the same result. In granting Otlowski\u2019s motion for summary judgment on this issue, the judge found that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-9\">The only evidence in the record indicates that LOtlowski\u2019s] activities in the premises with the exception of some activity outside the building related to the shed were confined to a hand search in Mr. Tyler\u2019s bedroom. There\u2019s no evidence that he did any damage, whatsoever, to the premises in question, or that he, in any way, acted in an objectively unreasonable manner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-10\">The manner in which a no-knock warrant is executed is reviewed under the \u201cgeneral touchstone of reasonableness which governs Fourth Amendment analysisf.]\u201d <em>United States v.

Instead, Otlowski, as a member of the JIT, sought the assistance of the State Police in executing the warrant. And although Otlowski obtained the no-knock warrant, there was no evidence that he ordered, condoned or ratified the alleged \u201cwanton and maliciously inflicted damage\u201d plaintiffs asserted was caused by the State Police in executing the search warrant. <em>See Gurski, supra, </em>242 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 162, 576 A.2d 292 (noting that the judge properly granted summary judgment where police superintendent did not participate in execution of warrant and did not order or condone State Police officers\u2019 action in executing it).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">Nor, contrary to plaintiffs\u2019 argument, did Otlowski\u2019s conduct, in obtaining a no-knoek warrant, set in motion \u201ca series of acts\u201d by the State Police that Otlowski knew or should have known would cause the State Police to inflict constitutional injury in the execution of the warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>In <em>Siligato v. State, </em>268 <em>N.J.Super. </em>21, 24, 632 A.2d 837 (App. Div.1993), the police obtained a warrant to excavate under the foundations of two buildings owned by the plaintiff based on an affidavit that contained material misstatements. The police were searching for the bodies of two victims that the plaintiff was accused of having murdered, but found nothing incriminating. The plaintiff sued for damage to his property under 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1983. In affirming the denial of summary judgment in favor of the officer, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-6\">It is now a settled proposition of Fourth Amendment jurisprudence that material misstatements in a search warrant affidavit, made knowingly or with reckless disregard of the truth, will invalidate the warrant and require suppression of the evidence seized thereunder. <em>Franks v. Delaware, </em>438 <em>U.S. </em>154, 98 <em>S.Ct. </em>2674, 57 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>667 (1978). Nor can there be any question that a police officer who has procured the issuance of a search warrant by such an affidavit may be liable under Section 1983 to a person damaged thereby. As the United States Supreme Court has made clear in <em>Malley v. Briggs, </em>475 <em>U.S. </em>335, 344-45, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>1092, 1098, 89 <em>L.Ed.</em>2d 271, 281 (1986), an officer who procures a warrant without probable cause is nevertheless entitled to immunity from suit unless \u201cthe warrant application is so lacking in indicia of probable cause as to render official belief in its existence unreasonable.\u201d <em>See also generally Kirk v. City of Newark, </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>173 [536 A.2d 229] (1988). Obviously, a warrant obtained by knowing and purposeful material misrepresentations cannot meet an objectively reasonable test.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-7\"><em>[Id. </em>at 29, 632 A.2d 837.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">Otlowski obtained a valid no-knock warrant based on an extensive affidavit setting forth particularized reasons for the warrant provision, and cannot be found liable for the alleged \u201cwanton and malicious\u201d damage allegedly caused by the State Police during execution of the warrant \u2014 damage plaintiffs alleged was in excess of what would be reasonably expected during such an execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-9\">Furthermore, even if Otlowski could be held liable for the acts of the State Police, there is no evidence that the State Police executed the warrant in an unreasonable manner. Here, the damage inflicted, particularly the damage to the exterior and interior doors, which was estimated to cost $3,200 out of the total of $4,312.16, was entirely consistent with a reasonable execution of a no-knock warrant. <em>See United States v. Banks, </em>540 <em>U.S. </em>31, 37, 124 <em>S.Ct. </em>521, 525, 157 L.Ed.2d 343, 352 (2003) (\u201cSince most people <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>keep their doors locked, entering without knocking will normally do some damage\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">We distinguish this ease from <em>Gurski, supra, </em>242 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 161, 576 A.2d 292, where we concluded that the State Police had acted unreasonably in executing the warrant. In <em>Gurski </em>the police destroyed the plaintiffs personal property, used the telephone without permission, \u201cfrolicked\u201d on the lawn, \u201cdry\u201d fired weapons, used abusive language, directed sarcastic comments at the plaintiffs wife and frightened his wife and children. <em>See also McKinney v. East Orange Mun. Corp., </em>284 <em>N.J.Super. </em>639, 648, 666 A.2d 191 (App.Div.1995) (concluding that officer\u2019s decision to execute no-knock warrant by breaking down door of plaintiffs apartment, who was not target of search, was not objectively reasonable given warrant\u2019s evident incorrect description of premises to be searched), <em>certif. denied, </em>143 <em>N.J. </em>519, 673 A.2d 277 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">Finally, plaintiffs argue that Otlowski was not entitled to qualified immunity under Section 1983 because \u201cobjective reasonableness would have precluded use of the flash bang devices under the circumstances of this case.\u201d Once again, Otlowski did not participate in the execution of the warrant and did not authorize the use of the flash bang device.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">As to the State Police, we defer to the factual findings of the trial judge, who found that the State Police had followed the general guidelines that existed at the time of the search,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>apparently allowed use of the device where there were reports of weapons on the premises, the presence of a potentially vicious dog or a building that had many entrances and exits and was thus hard to secure. Under these circumstances, the deployment of the device was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">We now address the issue of the claimed taking. The State Police argue by way of cross-appeal that the judge erred in entering judgment against them for damages incurred by plaintiffs during the execution of a properly issued no-knock warrant. Their argument is two-fold. First, they contend that because the individual officers were immune from liability, they cannot be liable for claims based on the acts of their officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">In granting the individual State Police officers\u2019 motion for judgment at the close of plaintiffs\u2019 case pursuant to <em>Rule </em>4:40-1, the court found that \u201cthe state police officers who executed the warrant had qualified immunity ... [and] were not unreasonable in their search.\u201d Plaintiffs did not appeal from that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-9\">When, as here, the individual officers are immune from liability for property damage associated with the execution of the warrant, the public entity, in this case the State Police, would also be immune from liability for any tort claims asserted under the TCA for the conduct of its officers. <em>See Ernst v. Ft. Lee, </em>739 <em>F.Supp. </em>220, 227 (D.N.J.1990) (noting that because police officers were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>immune from liability for the plaintiffs\u2019 emotional distress claim, the Borough of Fort Lee was also immune); <em>Evans v. Elizabeth Police Dep\u2019t, </em>190 <em>N.J.Super. </em>633, 636, 464 A.2d 1212 (Law Div. 1983) (because police officer was not liable, police department and the city were also immune).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">However, our analysis does not end there because some claims against public entities that seek compensation for violations of constitutionally-protected rights and interests exist independent of the TCA. <em>Garlanger v. Verbeke, </em>223 <em>F.Supp.</em>2d 596, 604 (D.N.J. 2002). In <em>Greenway Development Co. v. Borough of Paramus, </em>163 <em>N.J. </em>546, 557, 750 A.2d 764 (2000), the Court held that the notice provisions of the TCA did not apply to an inverse condemnation claim brought by a landowner against the borough, mayor and zoning officials seeking compensation for actions which allegedly amounted to a unconstitutional \u201ctaking\u201d under the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment and under the New Jersey Constitution. The individual state troopers\u2019 immunity under the TCA would not insulate the State Police from plaintiffs\u2019 claims for an unlawful taking under the federal and state constitutions. <em>Id. </em>at 557-58, 750 A.2d 764; <em>Wallace v.

At the same time, we have long considered a physical intrusion by government to be a property restriction of an unusually serious character for purposes of the Takings Clause. Our eases further establish that when the physical intrusion reaches the extreme form of a permanent physical occupation, a taking has occurred. In such a case, \u201cthe character of the government action\u201d not only is an important factor in resolving whether the action works a taking but also is determinative.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-7\"><em>[Loretto, supra, </em>458 <em>U.S. </em>at 426,102 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 3171, 73 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 876.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">In a . physical invasion case, the size of the invasion does not affect the owner\u2019s right to compensation. <em>Rohaly v.

Temporary physical limitations are not per se takings, and are subjected to \u201ca more complex balancing process to determine whether they are a taking ...

The judge rejected the landlord\u2019s claim under the TCA, finding that there was no evidence of misconduct or negligence by the police, and entry was made as a result of a lawfully executed no-knock search warrant. <em>Id. </em>at 406-07, 608 A.2d 480. However, the judge awarded the plaintiff damages on the basis that the destruction constituted a Fifth Amendment taking, \u201can issue of first impression\u201d in New Jersey. <em>Id. </em>at 407, 608 A.2d 480.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">In making that determination, the judge applied the \u201cintended beneficiary\u201d test established in <em>National Board of YMCA v. United States, </em>395 <em>U.S. </em>85, 89 <em>S.Ct. </em>1511, 23 L.Ed.2d 117 (1969). In that case, the plaintiffs sought compensation under the Fifth Amendment for damages committed by rioters to their building, which had been occupied by United States troops during the riots in the Panama Canal Zone in 1964. The majority in <em>National Board of YMCA </em>held that the owners were not entitled to just compensation under the Takings Clause because the troops were acting primarily in defense of the building, and not as part of the general defense of the Canal Zone. <em>Id. </em>at 92, 89 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1515, 23 L.Ed.2d at 124.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">The \u201cintended beneficiary\u201d test, as accepted by both the majority and the dissent in <em>National Board of YMCA, </em>provides that if the particularized intended beneficiary was the public, rather than a private individual, compensation under the Fifth Amendment would be warranted. <em>Wallace, supra, </em>257 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 409, 608 A.2d 480. If the intended beneficiary was a private individual, the plaintiff would not be entitled to compensation even if the public was an incidental beneficiary. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">In applying that test, the judge in <em>Wallace </em>found that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>plaintiff is entitled to compensation. The search was conducted for a public purpose; i.e., a search for and seizure of property and concomitant arrests as part of an ongoing criminal investigation. As part of the investigation the police damaged plaintiff\u2019s property. As an innocent third party he should not bear the sole financial burden of such an undertaking. Since the damage was incurred for the public good, rather than for the benefit of the private individual, the public should bear the cost. The intended beneficiary of the police action was not plaintiff, but society as a whole.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-5\"><em>[Id, </em>at 409-10, 608 A.2d 480.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">The judge explained that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-7\">Placing the burden on the public purse rather than on the purse of an innocent third party should not impair the police from effectively doing their job. It is a question of allocation of financial resources which local governments face every day. Just as a local government must decide how many police to hire, whether to purchase new equipment, and similar issues, the decision of how much to allocate for the destruction of property during the execution of search warrants is a question to be determined at budget time, not by the police officer on the street. Constitutional protections should not be dependent upon a line item in a municipal budget.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-8\">Moreover, every time property is destroyed by a governmental official such action will not automatically require payment of just compensation^ ] The holding herein is limited to a physical taking of property belonging to an innocent third party for a public purpose.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-9\"><em>[Id. </em>at 411-12, 608 A.2d 480 (footnote omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-10\">And the judge further explained that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-11\">For example, compensation is not payable if police forcibly enter a property to stop a burglary in progress; the intended beneficiary would be the property owner, not the public at large. Similarly, when fire fighters damage a building fighting a fire therein, the intended beneficiary is the property owner and no compensation would be payable. The fact that the public would be an incidental, rather than the intended, beneficiary is not sufficient to warrant compensation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-12\"><em>[Id. </em>at 412 n. 3, 608 A.2d 480.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-13\">No published New Jersey decisions have applied the holding in <em>Wallace, </em>and the United State Supreme Court has not addressed this specific issue. <em>Wallace </em>has, however, been criticized or distinguished by other state courts, and has been discussed in several law review articles. <em>See, e.g., Kelley v. Story County Sheriff, </em>611 N.W.2d 475, 488 (Iowa 2000); <em>Sullivant v. City of Oklahoma City, </em>940 P.2d 220, 226 (Okla.1997); <em>Brutsche v. City of Kent, </em>164 <em>Wash.2d </em>664, 193 P.3d 110, 121 (2008). <em>See also, e.g., </em>Charles E. Cohen, <em>Takings Analysis of Police Destruction of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number><em>Innocent Owners\u2019 Property in the Course of Law Enforcement: The View from Five State Supreme Cowls, </em>34 <em>McGeorge L.Rev. </em>1 (2002); C. Wayne Owen, Jr., <em>Everyone Benefits, Everyone Pays: Does the Fifth Amendment Mandate Compensation When Property is Damaged During the Course of Police Activities?, </em>9 <em>Wm. &amp; Mary Bill of Rts. J. </em>277 (2000); Lior J. Strahilevitz, <em>When the Taking Itself Is Just Compensation, </em>107 <em>Yale L.J. </em>1975 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">The application of the \u201cintended beneficiary\u201d test enunciated in <em>Wallace </em>in determining whether to grant compensation when property is damaged due to police activities raises significant issues. Notably, the Court in <em>National Board of YMCA </em>set forth in dictum that the \u201cintended beneficiary\u201d test shielded government bodies from liability to property owners under the Takings Clause when \u201cpolicemen break down the doors of buildings to foil burglars thought to be inside.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 92, 89 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1515, 23 L.Ed.2d at 124. As the Supreme Court in <em>National Board of YMCA </em>and the court in <em>Wallace </em>found, the intended beneficiary in such a burglary situation was the property owner, not the public at large, and the public was only an incidental beneficiary. <em>Wallace, supra, </em>257 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 412, 608 A.2d 480. The difficulty with this distinction is that any protection of private property also serves a broader public purpose, and application of such a doctrine inevitably will lead to inconsistent decisions. For example, in <em>Wallace, </em>the court found that the execution of the warrant on the apartment primarily benefited the public, but in some instances, a drug raid on an apartment might more directly benefit the landlord by eliminating a criminal activity occurring in the premises or, in multi-family dwellings, other tenants who are exposed to the inherent dangers of narcotic trafficking conducted by their neighbors. Our concern is that such fact-finding and analysis lacks a meaningful formulation in addressing the rights of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">The issue before us has generated a split of authority amongst other jurisdictions, with the majority adopting a takings theory under specific constitutional provisions as a basis for recovery. In <em>Steele v. City of Houston, </em>603 S.W.2d 786, 788 (Tex.1980), the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>owner and residents of a house sued the city under the takings clause of the Texas constitution<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> for damages they suffered when the police intentionally set fire to their house in an effort to recapture escaped convicts who had, unbeknownst to the plaintiffs, taken refuge in their house. To establish a takings claim under the Texas constitution, a plaintiff must prove the State intentionally performed certain acts that resulted in a \u201ctaking\u201d of property for public use. <em>Id. </em>at 789-91. The Court refused to differentiate between an exercise of police power, which did not require compensation, and eminent domain, which did. <em>Id. </em>at 789. The Court found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-5\">plaintiffs\u2019 pleadings and their claim in contesting the motion for summary judgment established a lawful cause of action under Section 17, Article I, of the Texas Constitution. That claim was made under the authority of the Constitution and was not grounded upon proof of either a tort or a nuisance. It was a claim for the destruction of property, and governmental immunity does not shield the City of Houston. The Constitution itself is the authorization for compensation for the destruction of property and is a waiver of governmental immunity for the taking, damaging or destruction of property for public use.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-6\">[Id at 791.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">In <em>Wegner v. Milwaukee Mutual Ins. Co., </em>479 N.W.2d 38, 38-39 (Minn.1991), the police severely damaged a home while attempting to apprehend an armed suspect, who had entered and hidden in the home. The homeowner sought compensation on trespass and under the Takings Clause of the Minnesota Constitution.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Ibid. </em>Applying the test set forth in <em>Steele, </em>the court in <em>Wegner </em>found that the plaintiff was entitled to compensation for damage caused when the police intentionally fired tear gas and concussion grenades into the house for the public purpose of apprehending a dangerous suspect. <em>Id. </em>at 41. The court held that \u201cwhere an innocent third party\u2019s property is damaged by the police in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>course of apprehending a suspect, that property is damaged within the meaning of the constitution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 41-42. The court explained that its taking clause analysis was not restricted to eminent domain, and</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-6\">in situations where an innocent third party\u2019s property is taken, damaged or destroyed by the police in the course of apprehending a suspect, [it| is for the municipality to compensate the innocent party for the resulting damages. The policy considerations in this case center around the basic notions of fairness and justice. At its most basic level, the issue is whether it is fair to allocate the entire risk of loss to an innocent homeowner for the good of the public. We do not believe the imposition of such a burden on the innocent citizens of this state would square with the underlying principles of our system of justice. Therefore, the City must reimburse Wegner for the losses sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-7\">As a final note, we hold that the individual police officers, who were acting in the public interest, cannot be held personally liable. Instead, the citizens of the City should all bear the cost of the benefit conferred.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-8\"><em>[Id. </em>at 42.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b267-9\">And, in <em>McGovern v. City of Minneapolis, </em>480 N.W.2d 121, 123-24 (Minn.Ct.App.1992), the police caused extensive damage in executing a no-knock search warrant. The police used a front-end loader to gain entry through an exterior wall and a window. <em>Ibid,. </em>The court remanded to the trial court for a determination of whether the plaintiff landlords were \u201cinnocent third parties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 127. The court held that \u201c[i]f the landlords are innocent third parties, they are entitled to compensation as a matter of law pursuant to <em>Wegner.\u201d Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b267-10\">The majority approach in addressing compensation under the takings clause is to apply a modified version of the multifactor balancing test applicable to regulatory takings. In New Jersey, three factors have been identified in having \u201cparticular significance\u201d in a determination of whether an action constitutes a regulatory taking: (1) the economic impact of the regulation on the claimant; (2) the extent to which the regulation has interfered with distinct investment-backed expectations; and (3) the character of the governmental action. <em>Bernardsville Quarry v. Borough of Bernardsville, </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>221, 232, 608 A.2d 1377 (1992). <em>See Connolly v. Pension Benefit Guar. Corp., </em>475 <em>U.S. </em>211, 224-25, 106 <em>S.Ct. 1018, </em>1026, 89 L.Ed.2d 166, 179 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>The court in <em>Jones v. Philadelphia Police Department, </em>57 <em>Fed.Appx. </em>939, 942 (3d Cir.2003), applied those factors in determining whether the plaintiff, the owner of a building that included a store and several apartments, could recover under a Fifth Amendment claim for damages to its premises that were caused when the police executed a valid search warrant over a two-hour period. The court found, in applying factor one, that the economic impact of the government action was minimal because the police caused only $500 of damage. <em>Ibid. </em>In applying factor two, the court found there was no evidence that the plaintiff invested in the property with the expectation that it would remain free of legal searches founded on probable cause. <em>Ibid. </em>In applying the third factor, the character of the governmental action, the court found that although a taking may more readily be found when there is a physical invasion by the government, in that case the government\u2019s two-hour occupation of the property was more like a trespass than an invasion. <em>Ibid. </em>Because of the short duration of the \u201cinvasion,\u201d it did not \u201cinterfere with many, even most, of the traditional rights of property owners.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Further, the court found that \u201ca temporary seizure of property in order to search that property is a permissible exercise of the government\u2019s police \u2014 as opposed to its eminent domain \u2014 powerf.]\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">In <em>Kelley v. Story County Sheriff, supra, </em>611 N.W.2d at 477, the police officers damaged two doors while executing an arrest at a rented home. The landlord sued, alleging that the damage amounted to a taking of private property under the Iowa Constitution.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 478. The court noted that the physical damage caused to the plaintiffs property by the officers when they entered the property to execute the arrest warrant did \u201cnot fit neatly within the other categories of takings cases such as the physical invasion or occupation of private property, or the regulation of the use of property by statute or ordinance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 479.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>The court in <em>Kelley </em>found that the \u201cexercise of police power may, in some situations, amount to a taking <em>of </em>private property if it deprives a property owner of the substantial use and enjoyment of one\u2019s property.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 480. \u201cThe point at which police power becomes so oppressive that it results in a taking is determined on a case-by-case basis.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Factors to be considered included: the economic impact of the regulation on the claimant\u2019s property; the regulation\u2019s interference with investment-backed expectations; and the character of the governmental action. <em>Ibid. </em>The court ultimately concluded that the destruction at issue was a reasonable exercise of police power and did not amount to a taking. <em>Id. </em>at 482.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">Other courts have found that damages incurred as a result of execution of a valid search warrant are not actionable under the Takings Clause, primarily based on the separate doctrines of eminent domain and police power. In <em>Customer Company v. City of Sacramento, </em>10 Cal.4th 368, 41 <em>Cal.Rptr</em>.2d 658, 660-63, 895 P.2d 900 (1995), the police fired tear gas into a convenience store to apprehend a suspect who was reported to be armed and extremely dangerous, causing in excess of $275,000 in damages. The owner filed an inverse condemnation claim under California\u2019s Takings Clause.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 663, 895 P.2d 900. The court rejected that theory, finding that section 19 \u201cnever has been applied to require a public entity to compensate a property owner for property damage resulting from the efforts of law enforcement officers to enforce the criminal laws.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 664, 895 P.2d 900.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">The court also found that the state\u2019s constitutional provision \u201cnever was intended, and never has been interpreted, to impose a constitutional obligation upon the government to pay \u2018just compensation\u2019 whenever a governmental employee commits an act that causes loss of private property.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>\u201c[Sjuch property damage, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>like any personal injury caused by the same type of public employee activity, has \u2014 throughout the entire history of section 19 \u2014 been recoverable, if at all, under general tort principles, principles that always have been understood to be subject to the control and regulation of the Legislature.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">In <em>Sullivant v. City of Oklahoma City, supra, </em>940 P.2d at 222, during the execution of a valid search warrant police officers damaged the outer door and two interior doors of an apartment unit. The landlord sued the city for $718 in damages, arguing that his property was damaged by the police for \u201cpublic use,\u201d and thus he was entitled to compensation under the Oklahoma Constitution\u2019s Takings Clause.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 222-24. The court relied on the decision in <em>Customer Company </em>in rejecting the landlord\u2019s takings claim. <em>Id. </em>at 225-26.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">Similarly, in <em>Certain Interested Underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s London v. City of St. Petersburg, </em>864 So.2d 1145, 1146 (Fla.Dist.Ct. App.2003), the court held that an innocent property owner did not state a cause of action under the Takings Clause of either the state or federal constitution for damage to property caused by the police while executing a valid search warrant.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The court held that the plaintiffs\u2019 claim was \u201ccompensable, if at all, as a tort rather than a taking.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1150. <em>See also Eggleston v. Pierce County, </em>148 Wash.2d 760, 64 P.3d 618, 623 (2003) (denying a takings claim after police, pursuant to a valid warrant, rendered a house uninhabitable by removing a load-bearing wall because the \u201c[pjolice power and the power of eminent domain are essential and distinct powers of government\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">Additionally, at least two federal courts and one state case have rejected claims based on the Fifth Amendment for damages based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>on police officer\u2019s conduct. In <em>Brutsche v. City of Kent, supra, </em>193 P.3d at 121, law enforcement officers caused damage to doors and doorjambs when they used a battering ram to gain entry and execute a search warrant for a suspected methamphetamine lab on premises owned by the plaintiff. The court rejected the plaintiffs takings claim, finding that \u201cthere simply is no permanent physical occupation of property that occurs when police officers damage property during execution of a search warrant, and ... [the plaintiff] has not established a taking under the federal constitution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 121. <em>See also Lawmaster v. Ward, </em>125 F.3d 1341, 1351 (10th Cir.1997) (finding that plaintiff who alleged officers had \u201cransacked\u201d his home during a search by leaving his pistol submerged in a dogs\u2019 water bowl and leaving cigar and cigarette ashes in his bedding, failed to \u201callege any facts showing how his property was taken for public use in violation of the Fifth Amendment\u201d); <em>Birdsall v. City of Hartford, </em>249 F.Supp.2d 163, 171 (D.Conn.2003) (holding that plaintiff did not have a Fifth Amendment takings claim where the officers\u2019 conduct resulted in loss of business for arrestee).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">Finally, the Supreme Court has admonished that a \u201cproperty owner necessarily expects the uses of his property to be restricted, from time to time, by various measures newly enacted by the State in legitimate exercise of its police powers; \u2018as long recognized, some values are enjoyed under an implied limitation and must yield to the police power.\u2019\u201d <em>Lucas v. S.C. Coastal Council, </em>505 <em>U.S. </em>1003, 1027, 112 <em>S.Ct. </em>2886, 2899, 120 L.Ed.2d 798, 820 (1992) (quoting <em>Pa. Coal Co. v. Mahon, </em>260 <em>U.S. </em>393, 413, 43 <em>S.Ct. </em>158, 159, 67 <em>L.Ed. </em>322, 325 (1922)).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">And, the Supreme Court in a regulatory takings case held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AXX\">the extreme categorical rule that any deprivation of all economic use, no matter how brief, constitutes a compensable taking surely cannot be sustained. Petitioners\u2019 broad submission would apply to numerous \u201cnormal delays in obtaining building permits, changes in zoning ordinances, variances, and the like,\u201d ... as well as to orders temporarily prohibiting access to crime scenes, businesses that violate health codes, fire-damaged buildings, or other areas that we cannot now foresee. Such a rule would undoubtedly require changes in numerous practices that have long been considered permissible exercises of the police power. As Justice Holmes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>warned in <em>Mahon, </em>\u201cgovernment hardly could go on if to some extent values incident to property could not be diminished without paying for every such change in the general law.\u201d ... A rule that required compensation for every delay in the use of property would render routine government processes prohibitively expensive or encourage hasty decision-making. Such an important change in the law should be the product of legislative rulemaking rather than adjudication.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-5\"><em>[Tahoe-Sierra Pres. Council, Inc. v. Tahoe Reg\u2019l Planning Agency, </em>535 <em>U.S. </em>302, 334-335, 122 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1465, 1485, 152 L.Ed.2d 517, 548 (2002) (internal citations omitted). <em>See also Hurtado v. United States, </em>410 <em>U.S. </em>578, 589, 93 <em>S.Ct </em>1157, 1164, 35 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>508, 518 (1973) (holding that the detention of a material witness was not a taking, but a \u201cpersonal sacrifice\u201d which is a \u201cnecessary contribution of the individual to the welfare of the public\u201d).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">Contrary to <em>Wallace, </em>we believe that the majority rule best addresses the most important policies underlying the takings clause \u2014 the protection of the property-owning minority from majoritarian redistributivism, stability and settled expectations within our economic system and the deterrence of arbitrary action by the government. The \u201cintended beneficiary\u201d analysis, on the other hand, only narrowly addresses these issues. By determining, ad hoc, the primary beneficiary, the nuances of the analysis are reduced to either a simplistic \u201cquid pro quo\u201d situation (the State benefited you individually, therefore the State owes you nothing) or an automatic taking determination. Further, the intended beneficiary test forces courts to be \u201ccaught up in an identification and evaluation of the primary beneficiary,\u201d when, in reality, \u201cthe intended beneficiary of police activity is always the general public.\u201d Owen, <em>supra, </em>9 <em>Wm. &amp; Mary Bill Rts. J., </em>at 295.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">The better rule is one that addresses the reconciliation of two competing policies \u2014 the lawful exercise of police power and the Takings Clause. Specifically, the \u201ccomplex balancing process\u201d applied to temporary physical limitations is the appropriate analysis. See <em>PruneYard, supra. </em>We do not hold that the exercise of police power may never be a taking. The \u201cexercise of police power may, in some situations, amount to a taking of private property if it deprives a property owner of the substantial use and enjoyment of one\u2019s property.\u201d <em>Kelley, supras </em>611 <em>N.W.2d </em>at 480.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>The balancing process must be sensitive to the policies implicated by the Takings Clause. Factors to consider should include, among others, whether the taking was put to any productive use, the amount of utility or value lost, whether the settled expectations in property were disturbed, whether the punitive party was purposefully chosen, and if so, whether that decision was arbitrarily made. We conclude that the majority rule represents a sound analysis and result.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">Applying the rule here, the execution of the search warrant was not a taking. Because \u201cthe property has not been put to any productive use by the government, the concerns that the government is acting to enrich itself at the expense of the property owner are not implicated.\u201d Cohen, <em>supra, </em>34 <em>McGeorge L.Rev. </em>at 24. The loss, valued at $4,312.16, was not insignificant, but there is also no evidence that the utility of the boarding house was substantially reduced. The relatively short and reasonably executed search warrant was akin to a trespass, not a taking. Further, plaintiffs\u2019 expectation that they could enjoy their property free from government interference was disturbed, but plaintiffs could not expect to remain free from reasonable searches founded on probable cause. Finally, the location of the search was not arbitrarily chosen, but was executed pursuant to a valid warrant, based upon probable cause to believe that illegal drugs were present.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">In sum, plaintiffs have identified a harm in search of a remedy, and we do not agree that the use of the Takings Clause is the proper remedy in this case.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> If there is to be compensation for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>innocent victims, the Legislature may take appropriate action to achieve such a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">As to the direct appeal, we affirm.
