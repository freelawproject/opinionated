At trial, he did not dispute shooting and stabbing the victim to death but instead asserted an insanity defense. He now argues the trial judge\u2019s instructions on the insanity defense were incomplete. Because defendant\u2019s testimony and other evidence supported his contention that he acted in accordance with a deific command, we reverse and remand for a new trial due to the judge\u2019s failure to give the amplified instruction required by <em>State v. Worlock, </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>596, 569 A.2d 1814 (1990), and <em>State v. Winder, </em>200 <em>N.J. </em>231, 979 A.2d 312 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b208-12\">The evidence revealed that, on September 13, 2005, defendant shot his pregnant girlfriend, Michelle Cazan, four times. Michelle did not immediately die from these wounds. She was choking on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>her own blood when defendant stabbed her four times with a butterfly knife. The knife wounds proved fatal.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">Defendant had been living in Michelle\u2019s home in Mansfield since July 27, 2005; they commenced a dating relationship about a week after defendant moved in. On September 12, 2005, the day before her death, Michelle told defendant she was pregnant with his child.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">The next day, September 13, 2005 \u2014 the day Michelle was killed \u2014 defendant went to Air Force and Army recruiting centers in Pennsylvania to discuss enlistment. Later that afternoon, he drove Michelle\u2019s car to Trenton to pick her up from her place of employment. Unknown to defendant, Michelle had scheduled an appointment for him to meet with her former co-workers about potential job openings. Defendant and Michelle, however, began to argue instead.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">As defendant later recounted to police, he was in a \u201cterrible\u201d mood. He was not interested in enlisting but was conscious of his need to provide for his child. Defendant asked Michelle to drive him to his brother\u2019s house in nearby Morrisville, Pennsylvania. During their argument, which continued on the ride to Morrisville, defendant said he saw Michelle \u201c[a]s a prostitute\u201d \u2014 meaning \u201cshe was prostituting herself to another God\u201d \u2014 and exclaimed he \u201cdidn\u2019t trust her [and he] didn\u2019t want to be around her ... [or] with her anymore.\u201d Michelle stopped the ear and the two conversed for about forty-five minutes. Later, instead of continuing to Morrisville, they decided to drive north.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-9\">Defendant and Michelle eventually arrived in her hometown of East Rutherford, where she pointed out some of the local sites. Defendant became \u201cenraged\u201d by stories Michelle told about mob activity in the town. To defendant, Michelle \u201cwas bragging about\u201d mob killings, which \u201cdefeat[ed] the purpose of the type of people who [they] were trying to become.\u201d At this point, defendant said he decided not to join the military: \u201cI was not going to serve any other God but my God and I was going to have the courage and the strength to do what he was calling me to do.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>The couple left East Rutherford, and continued arguing on the way to Mansfield. Defendant later told police he questioned \u201cwhat we was gonna do for our future cause for the baby, how was it gonna work out, how, how it was gonna work, you know, how, how could it work, how could this work, how could that work and then like you know this is hell.\u201d He further described his feelings at the time as being void of \u201cemotion, it was no love or, I didn\u2019t know love, I didn\u2019t feel nothing.\u201d At trial, defendant testified that Michelle was concerned for the unborn child and how it would be cared for, but \u201cin [defendant\u2019s] eyes, that was just a lack of faith because [defendant] knew in [him]self that God will provide whatever [they] needed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">They arrived at Michelle\u2019s home around 10:30 p.m. Upon entering, defendant asked Michelle for the car keys. When she refused, defendant drew a revolver from his waistband and shot Michelle as she walked toward him. She screamed his name and began choking on her own blood. Because defendant \u201cdidn\u2019t want her to die like that ... [and] didn\u2019t want her to suffer,\u201d he stabbed her with a butterfly knife. Defendant put the knife back in his pocket, left the revolver, and ran out of the home.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">Defendant immediately drove Michelle\u2019s ear to his friend William Britt\u2019s house in Trenton, where he washed his hands and changed his clothes. Defendant drank and smoked marijuana with William, who described defendant as \u201cantsy\u201d and \u201call over the place\u201d during their few hours together. William\u2019s brother John Britt testified that defendant seemed \u201csomewhat frantic ... [k]ind of like he was seared\u201d but also \u201cconfused.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">Defendant left Britt\u2019s home and started walking to his parents\u2019 Morrisville home. On the way, he threw the knife into a canal in Trenton. Defendant told police he \u201cplanned on running\u201d and \u201cjust keep killing] everybody ... until [he] got killed.\u201d He also said he discarded the knife because \u201cthat\u2019s what [he] was supposed to do, ... cause from watching movie[s] ... they tell you to get rid of the murder weapon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>Defendant arrived in Morrisville in the early morning hours of September 14. Defendant\u2019s sister, Lakeisha Singleton, arrived home at the same time. She testified that defendant approached the home with a \u201cnumb\u201d expression on his face and appeared \u201clost.\u201d Defendant asked Lakeisha for a ride to Michelle\u2019s house, and she agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">When they arrived at Michelle\u2019s house, defendant directed his sister to park in the rear of the building and, after determining that no one was there, defendant instructed Lakeisha to park in front. At trial, defendant explained that the police were his enemy and if he was captured, he could not serve God. He went inside Michelle\u2019s home, retrieved the revolver, and \u201ccleaned up the place a little bit\u201d by wiping down the door handles and steps to clean the \u201cblood from everywhere.\u201d Defendant placed the revolver and items used to clean the residence in a plastic garbage bag.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">Defendant returned to Lakeisha\u2019s car with the plastic bag and asked her to drive to Trenton so he could retrieve Michelle\u2019s car. Lakeisha testified that defendant had \u201cmany rambling conversations\u201d during the ride but not with her: \u201cWhoever he was talking to or whatever he was hearing, he was responding to. But the conversation wasn\u2019t for me.\u201d Defendant recalled Lakeisha asking what was wrong; he eventually confessed he had killed Michelle. Lakeisha suggested they drive to their parents\u2019 home, rather than' stopping to retrieve Michelle\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">Upon returning to Morrisville, defendant told his father he had killed Michelle. He also called a cousin in North Carolina to say he would be heading there. Defendant then left his parents\u2019 home and returned to Trenton to get Michelle\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-9\">During his drive south on Interstate 95, defendant spoke on the phone with his mother and Lakeisha. He cried during these conversations and said he wanted to hold Michelle. Defendant got as far as Baltimore before he decided to turn around and return to Morrisville.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>Defendant arrived at Ms parents\u2019 home sometime after sunrise and informed his family he wanted to turn himself in but first wanted to \u201cgo hold [Michelle and] go see her.\u201d Defendant drove to Michelle\u2019s house with his brother, Damon. Lakeisha and defendant\u2019s mother followed in another car. Defendant first stopped at William Britt\u2019s home to retrieve Ms bloody clothes and to .tell the Britt brothers he planned on turrnng himself in. Damon testified that defendant was \u201cincoherent\u201d during the car ride, that defendant \u201cwas talking to somebody\u201d other than Damon.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">When they arrived at Michelle\u2019s house, defendant went inside while the others remained outside. He entered Michelle\u2019s bedroom, repositioned her clothing, touched her elbow, and sprayed perfume on a stuffed ammal, wMeh he placed by her body. Damon eventually entered out of concern defendant might hurt himself and observed defendant holding Michelle\u2019s body in Ms arms \u201ctrying to wake her [and] telling her [to] wake up.\u201d Outside, defendant\u2019s mother asked a neighbor to call police.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">After arriving at Michelle\u2019s home around 10:30 a.m., Mansfield Patrolman Jason Abad\u00eda immediately called for back-up, and Patrolman Donald Mathews arrived a few minutes later. Abad\u00eda positioned himself with a shotgun at the front while Mathews secured the rear of the residence. Abad\u00eda heard a man screaming from inside, a scream that eventually became more audible. The garage door then \u201cflew open\u201d and defendant exited. Defendant complied with Abadia\u2019s order that he \u201cget down,\u201d and Mathews checked for weapons and handcuffed him. Abad\u00eda testified that defendant said:</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">I killed her. I killed her. Don\u2019t leave her like that. Cover her up. I killed her. Defendant was then placed in the back of a patrol vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">Abad\u00eda testified that, after being read Ms Miranda<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> rights, defendant stated he killed Michelle by shooting and stabbing her. Defendant told the officer the gun was in the car and that he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>thrown the knife in the canal. Abadia testified defendant was rocking about and crying.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">The officers secured the scene and responsibility for further investigation was transferred to the New Jersey State Police, whose Detective Sergeant Lindsey Cooper arrived at Michelle\u2019s residence around 11:40 a.m. After assessing the scene, Cooper decided to seek a recorded statement from defendant and read defendant his <em>Miranda </em>rights. Defendant again admitted killing Michelle. He also stated that he saw a vision of Michelle in the window of her home as he was giving the statement. When asked why he was so angry, defendant stated: \u2018Well, it\u2019s that damn book, that damn book, that damn book, man, it\u2019s that damn book, it\u2019s that damn book.\u201d He explained he was referring to the Bible and that: \u201cI lost it and the devil kept fucking with me, he just kept fucking with me and I lost it....\u201d Defendant was asked if anyone else had been involved in the killing; defendant replied: \u201cNo, the devil, god and the devil (inaudible) inside of me, outside of me, all over the place, all over the place.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">Defendant was transported to the stationhouse where Cooper again advised defendant of his <em>Miranda </em>rights and conducted an unrecorded nearly two-hour pre-interview, following which defendant provided a second taped statement. He was then taken to Trenton to recover the knife; it was never found.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b213-9\">Defendant was charged and, at the conclusion of a ten-day trial, convicted of first-degree murder, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:ll-3a(l) and -3a(2); second-degree possession of a weapon (a handgun) for an unlawful purpose, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:39-4a; third-degree possession of a weapon (a knife) for an unlawful purpose, <em>N.J.SA </em>2C:39-4d; third-degree unlawful possession of a weapon (handgun), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-5b; third-degree hindering apprehension, <em>N.J.SA </em>2C:29-3b(l); and fourth-degree tampering with physical evidence, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:28-6(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>Defendant moved for a new trial, claiming, among other things, the judge\u2019s insanity defense instructions were erroneous. The motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">At sentencing, after merging some of the weapons convictions into the murder conviction, the judge imposed a fifty-year prison term with an 85% period of parole ineligibility, pursuant to the No Early Release Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-7.2, on the murder conviction. The judge also imposed: a five-year prison term on the conviction for unlawful possession of a weapon, concurrent to the term imposed on the murder conviction; a five-year prison term on the hindering conviction, consecutive to the term imposed on the murder conviction; and an eighteen-month term on the tampering conviction, concurrent to the term imposed on the hindering conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">In appealing, defendant raises the following arguments:</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">I. THE COURT\u2019S INSANITY DEFENSE JURY INSTRUCTION FAILED TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN KNOWING AN ACT IS LEGALLY WRONG AND KNOWING IT IS MORALLY WRONG, AS REQUIRED BY <em>STATE v. WOR-LOCK </em>AND <em>STATE v. WINDER, </em>THEREBY DEPRIVING DEFENDANT OF DUE PROCESS OF LAW AND THE RIGHT TO A FAIR TRIAL. <em>U.S. CONST. </em>AMENDS. VI, XIV; <em>NJ. CONST. </em>ART. I, \u00ab1, 9,10.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-8\">II. BECAUSE THERE WAS EVIDENCE THAT MR. SINGLETON DID NOT ACT KNOWINGLY OR PURPOSELY DURING THE OFFENSES, THE ABSENCE OF AN INSTRUCTION ON DIMINISHED CAPACITY REQUIRES REVERSAL OF HIS CONVICTIONS AND A NEW TRIAL (Partially raised below).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-9\">III. REPEATED INSTANCES OF PROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT DENIED TO MR. SINGLETON HIS CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS TO DUE PROCESS AND A FAIR TRIAL. <em>U.S. CONST. </em>AMENDS. V, VI, XTV; <em>N.J. CONST. </em>ART. 1,11111,10.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-10\">IV. THE ADMISSION OF GRUESOME PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE DECEDENT DEPRIVED DEFENDANT OF THE RIGHT TO A FAIR TRIAL. <em>U.S. CONST. </em>AMEND. VI, XTV; <em>NJ. CONST. </em>ART. 1, Ml 1,10.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-11\">V. THE IMPOSITION OF A FIFTY-YEAR TERM FOR MURDER WITH 85% PAROLE INELIGIBILITY, AND A CONSECUTIVE TERM FOR THE RELATED OFFENSE OF HINDERING APPREHENSION, WERE MANIFESTLY EXCESSIVE.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-12\">Because we agree with the argument in Point I that a new trial is required due to the judge\u2019s failure to provide additional instruc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>lions to the jury on defendant\u2019s insanity defense, we need not reach the arguments contained in the remaining points.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b215-8\">In instructing the jury on defendant\u2019s insanity defense, the judge generally explained the law\u2019s view of insanity and the allocation of the burden of persuasion. Defendant does not question the accuracy of those instructions or the judge\u2019s following instruction, based on the <em>Model Jury Charge (Criminal), </em>\u201cInsanity\u201d (2011), which defines insanity in terms of legal wrong:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-9\">to establish insanity as a defense to the criminal charge in this case, the defendant must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that he was laboring under such a defect of reason from disease of the mind, as not to know the nature and quality of the act, or if the defendant did know it, that he did not know that what he was doing was wrong.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-10\">Defendant argued instead, for the first time in his motion for a new trial and now here in this appeal, that the concept of insanity contained in the judge\u2019s charge was insufficient because his actions were produced by a \u201cdeific command,\u201d and consequently, the jury should have been instructed as required in that circumstance by <em>Worlock, supra, </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>596, 569 A.2d 1314, and <em>Winder, supra, </em>200 <em>N.J. </em>231, 979 A.2d 312. Although defendant has not presented the specific instruction in question, we assume the amplified instruction now urged would have advised the jury that if it were to find defendant had a delusion of a command from God and acted pursuant to that command \u2014 even though he understood the act was legally wrong \u2014 the jury could find him insane. <em>See, e.g., People v. Schmidt, </em>216 <em>N.Y. </em>324, 110 <em>N.E. </em>945, 946 (1915).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">Our Legislature has defined the insanity defense in the following way:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-6\">A person is not criminally responsible for conduct if at the time of such conduct he was laboring under such a defect of reason, from disease of the mind as not to know the nature and quality of the act he was doing, or if he did know it, that he did not know what he was doing was wrong.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-7\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>2C:4-1.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">So defined, the insanity defense comports with the fundamental purposes of our criminal law system to ensure public safety. <em>Worlock, supra, </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>at 601, 569 A.2d 1314. That is, criminal punishment serves to deter the defendant in choosing wrong over right, but \u201c[i]f the defendant cannot understand the wrongfulness of his or her conduct, he or she will not understand the reason for the punishment, and that punishment will not serve as a deterrent to anyone.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 601-02, 569 A.2d 1314.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-9\">The test for insanity, as codified by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:4-1, is based on the M\u2019Naghten<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Rule. <em>Id. </em>at 602-06, 569 A.2d 1314. The <em>M\u2019Naghten </em>Rule, however, does not define the term \u201cwrong,\u201d and as a result, there has been much debate in jurisdictions that also apply this insanity test as to its meaning. <em>Id. </em>at 606-11, 569 A.2d 1314. The Court addressed this in <em>Worlock, </em>recognizing that \u201c[i]n most instances, legal wrong is coextensive with moral wrong,\u201d because the \u201c[l]aw is largely the crystallization of societal morals.\u201d Id.' at 610, 569 A.2d 1314. Thus, in most cases, \u201cif the defendant was capable of understanding that he was acting contrary to law, he would also have sufficient capacity to understand that he was acting contrary to the morals of society.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 609-10, 569 A.2d 1314.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-10\">The <em>Worlock </em>Court further explained that the \u201c\u2018right and wrong\u2019 test does not focus on the actual knowledge of the defendant, but rather on his ability <em>to perceive </em>the wrongfulness of his conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 610, 569 A.2d 1314 (emphasis added). If, at the time of the crime, the accused lacked the capacity to distin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>guish right from wrong, he or she will be excused from criminal liability. <em>Ibid. </em>Importantly, because the focus is on the defendant\u2019s \u201cability to comprehend whether his or her actions would ordinarily be disapproved by society, the concept of moral wrong must be judged by the societal standards, not the personal standard of the individual defendant.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>It follows that, \u201c[a]s a general rule, it will not be sufficient ... that a defendant\u2019s personal moral code justified a killing otherwise prohibited by law and societal morals.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">Given the facts before it, the <em>Worlock </em>Court rejected the defendant\u2019s claim to a more particularized insanity instruction. <em>Id. </em>at 614-15, 569 A.2d 1314. There, the defendant had killed two of his friends, after one had stolen his wallet, which contained a scandalous photograph of the defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 599-600, 569 A.2d 1314. At the time of the murders, the defendant admitted he knew his actions were both illegal and against the morals of society. <em>Id. </em>at 614, 569 A.2d 1314. Nevertheless, he justified the killings under his own personal code of morality. <em>Ibid. </em>The Court determined that the \u201c[bjelief in an idiosyncratic code of morality does not constitute the defense of criminal insanity,\u201d otherwise \u201cthe life of each member of society would be imperilled by the whims of every other member.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">The <em>Worlock </em>Court, however, did recognize the \u201cexceptional case\u201d in which a defendant claims to have acted \u201cunder a command from God.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 611, 569 A.2d 1314. In such circumstances, the jury must be instructed that \u201cwrong\u201d includes both legal wrong and moral wrong. <em>Ibid. </em>Although the facts of <em>Worlock </em>did not evoke this deific exception, the Court hypothesized: \u201cif the defendant contends that he or she knowingly killed another in obedience to a command from God, a jury could find that the defendant was insane.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b217-8\">This concept was again addressed in <em>Winder, supra, </em>200 <em>N.J. </em>at 242-51, 979 A.2d 312.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> There, the defendant shot and killed a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>cabdriver at point blank range, and claimed insanity. <em>Id. </em>at 235, 979 A.2d 312. He asserted \u201ca belief that his parents were trying to kill him\u201d and that, at the time of the murder, he knew it was legally wrong but claimed he did not know it was morally wrong. <em>Ibid. </em>Citing <em>Worlock, </em>defense counsel sought a jury instruction that distinguished between legal and moral wrong. <em>Id. </em>at 240, 979 A.2d 312. The trial judge denied the request, noting that the facts presented a case where legal and moral wrong were coextensive. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">After examining the principles set forth in <em>Worlock, </em>and the \u201crare instance in which legal and moral wrong are not coextensive,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 248, 979 A.2d 312, the Court concluded that the defendant did \u201cnot assert that his delusion commanded him to kill the cabdriver or that it would not be wrong to kill.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 249, 979 A.2d 312. In fact, the defendant \u201cdemonstrated knowledge of the social unacceptance of his deed both by apologizing to his victim at the time of his anti-social act, and by consciously excluding children and his parents from his potential victims.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Consequently, the Court explained \u201c[t]his case does not present the type of command-type delusion that renders its hearer incapable of any appreciation of what society deems right from wrong.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">Thus, in two cases, <em>Worlock </em>and <em>Winder, </em>the Court recognized the possibility of cases in which an insanity defense will require further definition of insanity beyond the actor\u2019s understanding of what is legally wrong, but found the facts before it did not justify such a charge. In addition, the <em>Winder </em>Court recognized the \u201cexceptional\u201d nature of deific-command delusions, 200 <em>N.J. </em>at 249-50, 979 A.2d 312, and cited a few examples. <em>See Diestel v. Hines, </em>506 <em>F.</em>3d 1249, 1272 (10th Cir.2007) (observing that a defendant could be found legally insane if \u201cmental illness caused him to believe that he had a warrant from the President or a command from God to kill the victim\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>553 <em>U.S. </em>1079, 128 <em>S.Ct. </em>2875, 171 L.Ed.2d 812 (2008); <em>People v. Serravo, </em>823 P.2d 128, 140 (Colo.1992) (determining that the insanity defense may be estab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>lished where \u201cthe defendant\u2019s cognitive ability to distinguish right from wrong with respect to the act has been destroyed as a result of a psychotic delusion that God has decreed the act\u201d); <em>State v. Cameron, </em>100 Was A.2d 520, 674 F.2d 650, 653-54 (1983) (recognizing the need for amplification beyond the \u201cright and wrong\u201d instruction where the defendant claimed to have killed under the command of God).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">In considering the deific-command situation further, the <em>Winder </em>Court provided this additional clarification:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-6\"><em>Worlock\u2019s </em>dicta on delusional commands allowed for a specific distinction between legal and moral wrong in only the clearest and narrowest category of cases where a delusional command could be objectively recognized to confound the difference between lawful behavior and a moral imperative. Hence, courts have identified few examples as fitting the narrow class of cases <em>contemplated____Worlock\u2019s </em>holding demonstrates that cases involving only an idiosyncratic, subjective sense that an action is morally correct do not constitute exceptions to the generally coextensive nature of legal and moral wrong in society so as to support being excused from criminal responsibility.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-9\"><em>[Winder, supra, </em>200 <em>N.J. </em>at 251, 979 A.2d 312.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b219-10\">To summarize, then, the deific command category is narrow, and the facts of <em>Worlock </em>and <em>Winder </em>failed to fit that category. Notwithstanding, those cases recognize that at times insanity may be established even when the defendant knows his or her act is legally wrong if acting under the compulsion of a command from God. An example provided in <em>Schmidt </em>is instructive:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-11\">A mother kills her infant child to whom she has been devotedly attached. She knows the nature and quality of the act; she knows that the law condemns it; but she is inspired by an insane delusion that God has appeared to her and ordained the sacrifice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-12\">[ 110 <em>N.E. </em>at 949. ]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b219-13\">As Judge Cardozo explained for the court in <em>Schmidt, </em>\u201c[i]t seems a mockery to say that, within the meaning of the statute, she knows that the act is wrong,\u201d concluding that \u201cnothing either in the history of the rule, or in its reason and purpose, or in judicial exposition of its meaning,\u201d could \u201cjustify a conclusion so abhorrent\u201d as to hold the mother legally responsible for the crime. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>c</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">The scope of the category in question has been established by <em>Warlock </em>and <em>Winder; </em>further amplification of the meaning of insanity is required only in \u201cthe clearest and narrowest category\u201d in which the accused claims to have acted on a deifie or presidential command. <em>Winder, supra, </em>200 <em>N.J. </em>at 251, 979 A.2d 312.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Our role is limited to considering whether the evidence permitted a finding by the jury that defendant acted pursuant to a deifie command. If so, then the additional amplified definition of insanity was required. We, therefore, turn to the evidence offered in support of defendant\u2019s insanity defense, which we explore at some length.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">Lakeisha testified first. She recalled defendant was once \u201c[e]nergetic [and] happy,\u201d but in his early to mid-twenties, \u201c[h]e just started acting different sometimes.\u201d Defendant had attended college but eventually dropped out and moved home. According to Lakeisha, their family was very religious and, after leaving college, defendant devoted a significant amount of time to studying the Bible. He grew his hair long, stopped shaving, and wrote scriptures on walls.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">Defendant told Lakeisha he was a Levite, a first-born son, and as such, his family should support and care for him. She testified defendant developed strong beliefs in the separation of church and state, and concluded that the words \u201cIn God We Trust\u201d rendered money evil.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">Lakeisha testified that sometime in July 2005, a few months prior to Michelle\u2019s murder, defendant inquired about mental health treatment. On the same occasion, he told Lakeisha he had been hearing voices that told him to kill his family because they were sinners. She testified: \u201cmy brother looked at me and said to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>me, if I didn\u2019t love you so much, you would have already been dead, because the voices told me to kill all of you because you\u2019re sinning.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">Tamika Farris spent a lot of time with the Singleton family, and similarly described changes in defendant after he came home from college, explaining defendant was \u201cvery ... adamant and fervent about the Bible and reading the Bible ... almost to a point of consumption.\u201d Tamika recalled defendant entering a phase where he wanted to be like people from the Bible, grow his hair long, and live off the earth without money. Tamika also described defendant\u2019s strong views on money and the separation of church and state.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">In recounting the July 2005 incident described by Lakeisha, Tamika remembered Lakeisha was visiting her home when defendant stopped by \u201cseem[ing] really distraught, really upset, [and] really worried.\u201d Tamika and Lakeisha asked defendant what was bothering him, and he replied: \u201cI keep hearing these voices.\u201d Defendant explained: \u201cGod speaks to me [and] tells me that I have a job to do.\u201d Tamika said defendant either referred to himself as a \u201cwarrior\u201d or a \u201csoldier\u201d and said that God had sent him \u201cto eradicate all the evil people [and] eliminate all the sinners.\u201d Defendant further told Tamika and Lakeisha that he had a list of people whom God had given him to \u201ctake out.\u201d Defendant then looked to his sister and Tamika and said: \u201cyou need to be glad that I love you so much, because you two are also on my list.\u201d At this point, Tamika offered to help him seek treatment, but defendant left.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">Defendant\u2019s mother, Mary, also testified. Like the other witnesses, Mary described defendant as \u201cfun-loving\u201d and popular growing up. She noticed changes in defendant around junior high school. He \u201cshutdown\u201d in some respects, no longer interested in schoolwork and believing \u201ceverybody was against him.\u201d Defendant participated in a school walk-out, as a response to an incident involving a teacher and defendant\u2019s brother Damon, resulting in his suspension from the football team. As a result, defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>\u201cjust ran\u201d to an uncle\u2019s house in New York \u201cfor quite some time,\u201d and became more disrespectful and angry by the end of high school.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">Mary then testified about defendant\u2019s brief college experience. After being placed on academic probation a few times, defendant eventually left school and moved home. Defendant was \u201cmoping around,\u201d and Mary suggested he \u201cget into the Bible [and] just start reading the word.\u201d Defendant \u201cwould shut himself in and just stay in the house and just read____[H]e would just be in his bedroom for days, just stay in the house, weeks, just in there just committed to God.\u201d Defendant \u201ctried to just turn away from sin completely. And, so he was putting people out of his life, his friends, his brothers, his \u2014 everybody.\u201d Mary became concerned with defendant\u2019s interpretation of the Bible and tried to persuade him to become affiliated with a church study group or to talk with other religious family members.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">Mary explained that defendant\u2019s studies focused on the Old Testament, and that he was troubled by the separation of church and state, recounting defendant\u2019s belief that money was evil because it stated \u201cIn God We Trust.\u201d He told his mother that there were two Jesuses in the Bible and her church was teaching incorrect principles. Defendant also told his mother he was a \u201csoldier for God\u201d with a responsibility \u201cto let man know that [they] weren\u2019t living according to the way that God wanted [them] to live.\u201d' His appearance changed and, for a while, defendant stopped working so he would not have to deal with money. Mary testified that defendant viewed himself as a Levite and that his family owed him a \u201ctithe,\u201d meaning one-tenth of their earnings, to support him so he could build a home and live in the woods.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-9\">Mary also testified about defendant\u2019s \u201ccommunications\u201d with God. In 2003, defendant\u2019s sister Shakia was taking medication to control her frequent seizures. Defendant informed his mother that God told him Shakia should stop taking her medication so God could heal her. Shakia continued with the medication and eventually became paralyzed from the waist down for several <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>weeks, which prompted defendant to reiterate that God had told him Shakia should have stopped taking her medicine.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">Mary described another incident in May or June of 2005 when defendant demonstrated aggression toward a homosexual. Shakia had become a minister and was counseling the young man because his mother had just passed away. Defendant directed that the man leave the home, calling him a sinner. This \u201ctransition\u201d in defendant, which Mary described as \u201cjust looking] like there was somebody there that it wasn\u2019t him,\u201d alarmed Mary and Shakia, and they immediately left the house. Mary expressed that she \u201cfelt threatened, afraid, because that was not [her son], and [she] didn\u2019t want to go back in the house with him in there.\u201d Defendant left Mary\u2019s home as a result of that incident and, soon thereafter, moved in with Michelle.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">Mary also testified regarding the events in her home after Michelle\u2019s murder. She recalled that defendant \u201cwas standing in the bathroom, and he was looking at himself in his mirror and he kept looking at his hands and flipping them back and forth and looking at himself.\u201d After defendant left the house, Mary said \u201cwe were just sitting there, just quiet \u2014 so after a while the Lord spoke to me and said call your son, and so I said and what am I gonna say to him.\u201d She continued: \u201cAnd so I\u2019m having a conversation back and forth with God, and he said just call him. So then I prayed, and I asked God to tell me what to say ... to help us get through this.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">When Mary called defendant, he was in Michelle\u2019s car. Defendant was crying and told his mother: \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to hurt [Michelle], I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to hurt her.\u201d Defendant said he wished he had another bullet so he could kill himself. Eventually, Mary convinced defendant to return, surrender to the police, and \u201cget right with God.\u201d As defendant proceeded home, Mary kept calling him. Each time, defendant repeated he was sorry and that he did not mean to hurt Michelle. Mary also testified defendant appeared to be having other conversations when they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>were on the phone: \u201cI couldn\u2019t understand. It\u2019s like he was talking to God.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">Defendant\u2019s brother Damon was also present in the early morning hours following Michelle\u2019s murder. Like other witnesses, Damon remembered defendant as a positive person; \u201che was the best possible brother you could ask for,\u201d recalling the walk-out in high school and the sacrifice defendant made to support him during that time. Damon also noticed the changes in defendant once he returned home from college: \u201c[i]t just seemed like he had the weight of the world on his shoulders.\u201d Damon described defendant\u2019s transformation in becoming a Levite, including \u201cdays\u201d he would spend in his bedroom studying the Bible. Defendant asked Damon for help in reading some of the passages from the Old Testament. Damon thought that \u201cwhat I was reading was not what he was interpreting, and we\u2019d sit and discuss it, and it was not even \u2014 it wasn\u2019t even in the. same ball park, the things that I read.\u201d He could not understand defendant\u2019s interpretation of the Bible. At one point, Damon thought that perhaps defendant \u201cshould go see someone, to talk to someone.\u201d Damon became concerned because the things \u201cGod was saying to [defendant] w[ere] not something that [Damon] would think [his] God or anybody\u2019s God would say,\u201d and thought some of defendant\u2019s values and beliefs demonstrated aggression.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">Damon also testified about the morning of September 14, 2005, when he found out defendant had killed Michelle. When Damon arrived at his parents\u2019 house, defendant had already headed south in Michelle\u2019s car. When defendant returned, Damon said he was \u201ca wreck,\u201d crying and mumbling. However, when they drove to Michelle\u2019s home, defendant \u201cdrove perfectly]\u201d and took his time. Damon tried to talk to his brother during the ride, but defendant was \u201cincoherent\u201d and talking to someone else.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">In her testimony, defendant\u2019s sister Shakia recalled inviting defendant to a Bible study class at her home. Defendant \u201cwould get frustrated, because they didn\u2019t want to hear what he had to say,\u201d and eventually members of the class stopped attending. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>Shakia testified that \u201cmy brother and I had very different understandings of the Bible, and at some point we just stopped talking about it.\u201d Her testimony corroborated some of the circumstances testified to by others.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">Defendant\u2019s aunt, Melissa Panniel, also testified. Much of her testimony supported that of other family members regarding changes in defendant\u2019s appearance, demeanor, and beliefs. She recalled studying the Bible with defendant and feeling as if he was taking it \u201ctoo literal.\u201d For example, Melissa tried to help him understand there was no longer a need for sacrifices as in Biblical times.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">Defendant testified on his own behalf. He detailed the tribulations of his life up until 2003 when he decided to actively turn to the Bible. After his unsuccessful college experience, defendant moved into his mother\u2019s home but did not remain long given his mother\u2019s strict views on women, drinking, smoking, and music in the home. From there, defendant moved around.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">A girlfriend in Trenton became pregnant with defendant\u2019s first child. Operating under the mistaken belief she had an abortion, defendant moved to California to be with another woman, who became pregnant and gave birth to defendant\u2019s second child. Defendant testified at length about his troubled relationship with his California girlfriend, including a domestic violence incident. Defendant also described when he learned his Trenton girlfriend had not had an abortion, and his efforts to secure visitation rights and a resulting altercation.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">In 2003, realizing he needed a more disciplined life, defendant began reading the Bible. Defendant explained his Bible studies, including his following of the Old Testament and his belief in two Jesuses, by reading different passages to the court. Defendant admitted other people did not understand his interpretations, so he stopped going to church.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-10\">Defendant discussed the laws of the Old Testament. When asked for his interpretation of \u201cthou shalt not kill,\u201d defendant stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>I understand it to mean that thou shalt not kill as far as breaking the law. A killing or a murder is an unlawful killing. Now, there\u2019s times where it\u2019s warranted by law to kill, so I understand, that is thou shall not kill if I tell you not to kill or it\u2019s not warranted. You just can\u2019t go and kill for any reason just because you see fit and you want to kill. No, if I tell you it\u2019s okay to kill, then it\u2019s okay, but other than that, thou shalt not murder or thou shalt not kill.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">Defendant explained that if \u201cGod tells you to kill[,] [t]hen you\u2019re supposed to kill. If you don\u2019t kill, it\u2019s actually a sin not to.\u201d For example, \u201c[y]ou can be put to death for idolatry[,] ... for homosexuality!;,] ... for working on a Saturday];,] [and] for adultery. There\u2019s quite a few things that you can be put to death for in the Old Testament.\u201d Relying on another Bible passage, defendant justified the killing of family members or any other person \u201cwho tries to get you to follow the God other than the God that I \u2014 I worship.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">Defendant also testified at trial about his relationship with God. When asked whether he \u201cactually spoke with God,\u201d he responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-7\">Yes. Yes____I can\u2019t \u2014 can I \u2014 can I say I actually spoke with God or God spoke with me as far as His Spirit is \u2014 it\u2019s kind of complicated to get into. But His Spirit \u2014 that His Spirit ministered to me and that I received like a \u2014 a talk from Him, yes. Not, per se, did I hear His \u2014 His voice, specifically.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-9\">In describing the incident with Shakia\u2019s seizure medication, defendant explained he had been sleeping on the floor with the Bible after \u201cstudying real heavy.\u201d He fell asleep and \u201cfelt like a presence come over [him] ... and it was like pray for [his] sister ... and tell her to stop taking medication.\u201d The next morning, defendant woke up, prayed for Shakia, and told her God wanted her to stop taking her medication. Defendant described feeling \u201chappy\u201d in this moment, for God had chosen him to do his work.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-10\">Thereafter, defendant changed his lifestyle. He testified about his beliefs regarding money and the separation of church and state. He recalled not paying a fine while on probation because it did not accord with his Levite beliefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-11\">Defendant testified about the July 2005 incident, when Shakia was counseling the homosexual man in his mother\u2019s home. He remembered: \u201cI was upstairs in bed, once again, like asleep, and I guess I stayed between sleep and, like, not sleep, but I guess in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>between. I can\u2019t really describe that state.\u201d He continued: \u201cI believed that I heard something say to me go downstairs and kill him because he was homosexual.\u201d Defendant admitted to \u201cwrestling\u201d with the idea but thought there might be \u201cconsequences\u201d if he did not go downstairs. He could not recall his exact words when entering the room, but he remembered telling Shakia \u201cshe would suffer the same fate that he would suffer\u201d if she sided with her friend, meaning defendant would also \u201cput her to death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">Defendant discussed a visit he had with Tamika and Lakeisha regarding his beliefs and experiences. He had been thinking about his relationship with Michelle and their Bible studies together, but he believed he was being hypocritical by not practicing what he was preaching. On the day defendant visited Tamika and his sister, he walked away from his job and decided he \u201chad to follow God and ... knew he needed to get a gun.\u201d When asked why he needed the gun to serve God, defendant explained: \u201cFor different things that people were doing that were wrong, they would be put to death.\u201d Defendant also stated he was \u201cskeptical\u201d of Michelle, thinking she may be an FBI agent or that she may have somehow attributed to Shakia\u2019s seizures.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">Defendant nevertheless ended up moving in with Michelle and became intimate with her. In recounting the events of September 13, 2005, defendant testified Michelle was upset when he arrived late to pick her up. Once in the car, defendant wrestled with the idea of joining the military but determined he \u201cwasn\u2019t going to go because [he] was not going to take a life for a God other than [his] God.\u201d He further told Michelle she \u201cwas prostituting herself to another God\u201d just like everybody else. Moreover, after Michelle took defendant to her hometown and pointed out the location of a \u201cmob hit,\u201d defendant knew \u201c[s]he had already had her mind made up that she was going to serve the God that was in In God We Trust, and [defendant] had [his] mind made up that [he] was not going to serve that God.\u201d Defendant explained their argument had nothing to do with their unborn child; in fact, he described being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>\u201chappy\u201d about it because he planned on having a family and moving into the woods.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">Before they arrived at Michelle\u2019s home, she stopped to make a few purchases. Her use of money confirmed to defendant that they were already \u201cdivided\u201d and Michelle was going to work for Satan. When they arrived home, defendant said he shot Michelle \u201c[b]ecause she was trying to get [him] to worship a God other than [his] God, and follow a God other than [his] God.\u201d Defendant stated: \u201cIt was the right thing because it was something God was telling me to do.\u201d He continued to stab her \u201c[b]ecause [he] heard Michelle choke\u201d and he loved her. At the same time, he knew he had to serve God, and was \u201chappy\u201d that he had the courage to serve him.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">When asked what defendant next planned on doing, he responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-7\">[I]t all depend[ed] on this \u2014 the individual that I came upon. If an individual did not understand who God was and didn\u2019t understand what I believed, then I wouldn\u2019t have just, I guess, randomly killed him or did anything to him, I would probably tried to teach him how strongly it was that I believed and if they was trying to get me to do anything other than that, then, yeah, I probably would have killed that person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">Defendant then described leaving Michelle\u2019s home and going to see the Britt brothers. He was \u201cplanning on seeing if [John] was ready to go and do the things that [they] were supposed to do be doing because [John] had an understanding of what it was that [defendant] believed.\u201d Defendant further stated that asking John for money was a test; John lending money to defendant signified he did not want to serve the same God as defendant. Defendant testified he \u201cwas going to kill him,\u201d but failed to do so because he left the gun at Michelle\u2019s home and the knife was a poor choice of weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-9\">Defendant testified that many of his actions after killing Michelle were to buy more time so he could acquire more ammunition to \u201cfight the police\u201d and continue to \u201cserve God.\u201d He pondered going to Mexico to purchase ammunition because the money there did not say \u201cIn God We Trust.\u201d However, while driving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>south, he heard a song on the radio that reminded him of Michelle and signaled she had forgiven him.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">Defense expert Dr. Maureen Santina, a clinical and forensic psychologist, testified defendant suffered from schizoaffective disorder of the bipolar type, \u201c[w]hich means he has the symptoms of schizophrenia and the symptoms of bipolar disorder.\u201d Dr. Santina considered comments made by defendant\u2019s family and friends during interviews, and determined defendant\u2019s delusions had been progressing for years prior to Michelle\u2019s death. She concluded that defendant \u201cwas not capable of recognizing that what he did was wrong [b]ut in fact, he believed that he was right. He believed that he was being compelled to do this by God and that therefore he had to obey that belief.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">Dr. Santina concluded with her opinion that defendant met the test for legal insanity. First, she classified her diagnosis as \u201cone of the most severe and one of the most debilitating\u201d mental diseases. Next, Dr. Santina opined that defendant knew he was killing Michelle but did not understand the nature of what he was doing. In other words, he believed \u201che was supposed to kill her because God was ordering it.\u201d She then testified that defendant \u201cwas not capable of recognizing that what he did was wrong[,] [b]ut in fact, he believed that he was right. He believed that he was being compelled to do this by God and that therefore he had to obey that belief.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">The State\u2019s expert, Dr. Elliot Atkins, also a clinical and forensic psychologist, agreed with Dr. Santina that defendant suffered from schizoaffective disorder and that defendant operated under a delusional system in which he believed he needed to serve God. However, Dr. Atkins opined these delusions did not trigger Michelle\u2019s murder. Rather, in Dr. Atkins\u2019s view, defendant had a history of aggressive behavior towards women, he and Michelle had a \u201cstrained relationship,\u201d and \u201c[t]here was a tremendous amount of conflict and tension\u201d on the day of the murder. Dr. Atkins concluded that defendant knew \u201cthe nature and quality of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>his actions,\u201d and \u201cthat his intention was to kill the decedent,\u201d which defendant \u201cknew ... was wrong.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">Defendant contends he provided substantial evidence that, as a result of mental illness, he sincerely believed he received a deific command to kill, which required the amplified instruction regarding moral wrong. The State, on the other hand, argues defendant failed to present facts that would necessitate such a clarifying instruction, contending defendant did not kill Michelle pursuant to a deific command but instead operated under his own idiosyncratic interpretation of the Bible.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">If the State\u2019s interpretation was all that was before the jury, we would agree this ease would not fit the narrow class described by the <em>Winder </em>Court and conclude that the additional instruction sought by defendant was not necessary. Acting on a faulty Bible interpretation rather than a deific command would not meet the <em>Winder </em>majority\u2019s requirements for the amplified instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">But that was only one interpretation of the evidence. Defendant testified that killing Michelle \u201cwas the right thing because it was something God was telling me to do\u201d \u2014 that he was acting pursuant to God\u2019s command \u2014 and his expert agreed that defendant \u201cbelieved that he was being compelled to do this by God and that therefore he had to obey that belief.\u201d Whether or to what extent the State was able to call into question the persuasiveness of this evidence is not determinative of the content of the judge\u2019s charge. It was for the jury to find the facts and determine whether defendant believed God commanded him to kill Michelle.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-9\">And it was for the judge to provide instructions depending upon how the jury might find the facts. \u2018When ... divergent factual versions give rise to different theories ..., the trial court should provide the jury with appropriate instructions, depending <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>on which version it chooses to accept.\u201d <em>State v. Martin, </em>119 <em>N.J. 2, 16-17, 573 </em>A.2d 1359 (1990); <em>see also Mathews v. United States, </em>485 <em>U.S. 58, </em>63, 108 <em>S.Ct. </em>883, 887, 99 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>54, 66 (1988); <em>State v. Echols, </em>199 <em>N.J </em>344, 363, 972 A.2d 1091 (2009); <em>State v. Sloane, </em>111 <em>N.J. </em>293, 303, 544 A.2d 826 (1988). Indeed, the Court has counseled that jury instructions on an alternative defense theory should be given even when that theory is supported only by \u201c[v]ery slight evidence.\u201d <em>State v. Powell, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>305, 317, 419 A.2d 406 (1980); <em>see also State v. Moultrie, </em>357 <em>N.J.Super. </em>547, 556, 816 A.2d 180 (App.Div.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">Here, defendant provided his own testimony and the testimony of others to support his contention that he was commanded by God to kill Michelle. He also supported this theory with testimony from an expert. Defendant\u2019s evidence in support of his claim of a deific command is not \u201cslight.\u201d And, although the State offered evidence to rebut this, it was not for the trial judge to choose one version over the other in crafting a jury charge. Defendant was entitled to have the jury instructed on his theory of the case and the failure to provide amplification of his insanity defense was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">To be clear, there was nothing erroneous about the charge as far as it went. The trial judge properly utilized the model charge in describing the basic meaning of insanity. In a case such as this, the jury should be instructed that an insanity defense may be established by evidence that the defendant \u201cwas laboring under such a defect of reason from disease of the mind, as not to know the nature and quality of the act, or if the defendant did know it, that he did not know that what he was doing was wrong.\u201d <em>Model Jury Charge (Criminal), </em>\u201cInsanity\u201d (2011). The trial judge gave this instruction; the error was in the failure to provide additional instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">That is, as we have observed, the record contained evidence from which the jury could have found that defendant believed he had received a deific command to murder Michelle. With only the model jury charge as a guide, the jury could have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>rejected the insanity defense \u2014 even if it found persuasive the deific-command evidence \u2014 by finding defendant understood his actions were contrary to law. To avoid that possibility, a judge must provide not only the model charge but also the further explanation that insanity may be found \u2014 even if defendant knew his actions were contrary to law \u2014 if he proved by a preponderance of the evidence that he acted pursuant to a delusion of receiving a deific command. In other words, in such an instance, the judge must instruct that the defendant may not be held responsible for his actions \u201cwhere a delusional command could be objectively recognized to confound the difference between lawful behavior and a moral imperative.\u201d <em>Winder, supra, </em>200 <em>N.J. </em>at 251, 979 A.2d 312.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">E</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">We are mindful that defendant did not object to the instructions given to the jury regarding his insanity defense. The argument he reprises here was first asserted in the trial court on defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial, far too late to assist the judge in crafting a correct jury charge on the point now hotly contested. Notwithstanding, we conclude that the absence of the amplified instruction required when the insanity defense is based on a deific command was capable of producing an unjust result. <em>R. </em>2:10-2; <em>see also State v. Burns, </em>192 <em>N.J. </em>312, 341, 929 A.2d 1041 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">As has been well established, errors in a jury charge in a criminal ease on material issues are viewed as \u201cpoor candidates for rehabilitation under the harmless error philosophy,\u201d <em>State v. Vick, </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>288, 289, 566 A.2d 531 (1989), and are presumed to constitute reversible error, <em>State v. Jordan, </em>147 <em>N.J. </em>409, 422, 688 A.2d 97 (1997). The judge\u2019s instructions on the insanity defense did not preclude the possibility that the jury believed that defendant acted on God\u2019s command and yet rejected the insanity defense by finding defendant understood what he did was legally wrong. Because it is not inconceivable that the jury rejected the insanity defense because it did not know that insanity could have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>been found if defendant knew what he did was legally wrong but nevertheless acted because of God\u2019s command, we are compelled to conclude the charge was capable of producing an unjust result.</p>\n<p id=\"A2B\">Reversed and remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b212-9\"> <em>Miranda v.
