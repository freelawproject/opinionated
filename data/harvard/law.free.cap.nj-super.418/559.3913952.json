The purpose of the GDLS is described in a statement issued by the Senate Law and Public Safety Committee. The \u201cgraduated system of licensing [is] designed to phase-in [a driver\u2019s] exposure to increasingly complex driving tasks and environments as new drivers mature and develop their driving skills under supervised conditions.\u201d <em>Senate Law and Public Safety Committee, Statement to Senate Committee Substitute for S. 318 </em>at 1 (February 23, 1998). It gives new drivers \u201cgreater opportunity to get their behind-the-wheel experience under conditions of controlled risk.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Its purpose is to make a basic license \u201ca privilege\u201d that can be \u201cgained only by demonstrating, in a systematic and progressive manner, conscientious and responsible driving behavior in each stage of licensing.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">The GDLS requires a new driver to first obtain a permit, either a special learner\u2019s permit for those under seventeen or an examination permit for those seventeen and older, and then a probationary license, before applying for a basic license. <em>N.J.S.A </em>39:3\u2014 10, :3-13, :3-13.4a. The restrictions on driving privileges imposed through the GDLS vary with the driver\u2019s authorization and age. In general and subject to certain exceptions, holders of GDLS authorizations cannot drive between certain hours of the day, cannot drive with more than a certain number of non-parents and non-dependents in the vehicle, cannot use hand-held or hands-free wireless devices and are subject to special sanctions for violating the motor vehicle laws. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:3-13.2a, :3 \u2014 13, :3-13.4a.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">Chapter 37 mandates that all holders of special learner\u2019s permits, examination permits, and probationary licenses display on their vehicles \u201chighly visible, reflective decals\u201d issued by the chief administrator of the MVC indicative of the driver\u2019s status in a manner prescribed by the chief administrator so that they are \u201cclearly visible to law enforcement officers.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:3-13.2a, :3-13, :3-13.4f. Chapter 37\u2019s purpose is indicated by its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>terms \u2014 facilitating enforcement of the GDLS restrictions on the privileges of the holders of permits and probationary licenses issued in this State.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">Despite Chapter 37\u2019s unequivocal requirement that all GDLS holders display the decal, as clarified in supplemental briefs submitted by the parties at our request prior to oral argument, the MVC has determined that only those under twenty-one are obligated to obtain and display the decals. Plaintiffs\u2019 challenges are primarily based on the assertion that the mandatory decals disclose private information \u2014 their age group. They do not dispute or challenge the MVC\u2019s interpretation of Chapter 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">We question the construction of Chapter 37 urged by the parties. Although the State defendants contend that it is the clear intent of the Legislature for Chapter 37 to only apply to those under twenty-one because the passenger and hour GDLS restrictions are limited to those drivers, we note that one GDLS restriction applies regardless of age. In particular, use of hands-free and hand-held wireless devices is forbidden regardless of the driver\u2019s age. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:3-13, :3-13.4c. But because there is no challenge to the MVC\u2019s interpretation, we consider plaintiffs\u2019 objections to Chapter 37 as construed and applied by the MVC, its chief administrator and the Attorney General.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b593-9\">The display of decals required by Chapter 37 is not in conflict with or otherwise preempted by the Federal Drivers Privacy Protection Act, 18 <em>U.S.C.S. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 2721-2725.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-10\">Pursuant to 18 <em>U.S.C.S. </em>\u00a7 2721, \u201ca State department of motor vehicles\u201d is forbidden from \u201cdisclosing] or otherwise mak[ing] available\u201d any driver\u2019s \u201cpersonal information\u201d or \u201chighly restricted personal information,\u201d except in specified circumstances not applicable here. Plaintiffs\u2019 argument, as we understand it, is that Chapter 37 is preempted because the mandatory display of decals by drivers under twenty-one compels what the Act prohibits\u2014 disclosure of \u201cpersonal information.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>Undoubtedly Chapter 37 would be preempted if it required what the Act prohibited. <em>English v. General Elec. Co., </em>496 <em>US. </em>72, 79, 110 <em>S.Ct. </em>2270, 2275, 110 L.Ed.2d 65, 74 (1990). But in our view, it does not. The decal permits an observer to infer that the driver is under twenty-one, but we cannot conclude that information disclosing a person\u2019s membership in a particular age group is \u201cpersonal information\u201d within the meaning of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">The scope of the Act\u2019s prohibition against disclosure of personal and highly personal information presents a question of statutory interpretation subject to de novo review. <em>In re Liquidation of Integrity Ins. Co., </em>193 <em>N.J. </em>86, 94, 935 A.2d 1184 (2007). The Act defines the critical terms, and our task is to determine if Congress intended to include a person\u2019s age group. <em>See Higgins v. Pascack Valley Hosp., </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>404, 418, 730 A.2d 327 (1999). The inquiry begins with the language of the statute. <em>Ibid. </em>Because the Act is a federal law, \u201cthe interest of comity and the benefits of uniform application require us to consider and give due deference to decisions of federal and state courts interpreting the statute.\u201d <em>Fletcher v. Cessna Aircraft Co., </em>412 <em>N.J.Super. </em>530, 534, 991 A.2d 859 (App.Div.2010). In this case, however, the parties have not cited and our research has not disclosed a published judicial or administrative interpretation of the Act that might inform our decision. Accordingly, we focus on the statutory definitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">Under the Act, \u201c\u2018[hjighly restricted personal information\u2019 means an individual\u2019s photograph or image, social security number, medical or disability information.\u201d 18 <em>U.S.C.S. </em>\u00a7 2725(4). The list is exhaustive, and it does not include age or age group.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">The scope of the Act\u2019s definition of \u201cpersonal information\u201d is not as clear. \u201cPersonal information\u201d means \u201cinformation that identifies an individual, including an individual\u2019s photograph, social security number, driver identification number, name, address (but not the five-digit zip code), telephone number, and medical or disability information, but does not include information on vehicular accidents, driving violations, and driver status.\u201d 18 <em>U.S.C.S. </em>\u00a7 2725(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>As we interpret the statute, this definition has two parts: 1) \u201cinformation that identifies an individual,\u201d which is illustrated by a non-exhaustive list that follows; and 2) \u201cmedical or disability information.\u201d In other words, the commas that bound the list beginning with \u201can individual\u2019s photograph\u201d and ending with \u201ctelephone number\u201d act as parenthesis, with what lies between acting as illustrations of what is meant by \u201cinformation that identifies an individual.\u201d The \u201cand\u201d designates a second definition of \u201cpersonal information,\u201d separate from \u201cinformation that identifies an individual.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">We admit that the comma following \u201ctelephone number\u201d could be read as a serial comma, with \u201cmedical or disability information\u201d acting as the last item in a series meant to illustrate \u201cinformation that identifies an individual.\u201d We reject this latter reading, however, as inconsistent with the sense of the statute as a whole. Medical or disability information simply is not information that \u201cidentifies an individual.\u201d It is not unique to a person the way the other items are. It would therefore be incongruent for Congress to have included \u201cmedical or disability information\u201d on a list meant to illustrate what is meant by \u201cinformation that identifies an individual\u201d; its inclusion would disrupt the otherwise harmonious list. Our reading, in other words, \u201cgive[s] sense to the legislation as a whole,\u201d <em>DiProspero v. Penn, </em>183 <em>N.J. 4171, </em>492, 874 A.2d 1039 (2005), and avoids an \u201cabsurd result.\u201d <em>In re Tenure Hearing of Young, </em>202 <em>N.J. </em>50, 69, 995 A.2d 826 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">As a matter of common usage <em>and </em>ordinary understanding, a person\u2019s age group does not identify an individual. It identifies the person as a member of a large segment of the population. We cannot, however, rely solely on the ordinary meaning of the phrase \u201cinformation that identifies an individual\u201d because it would also exclude information expressly included, such as address and telephone number which may be shared by several people. Accordingly, under well-settled principles of statutory construction, we must consider the non-exhaustive list that follows \u201cinformation that identifies an individual\u201d and determine whether age group is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>of the same nature as the items in the list and, therefore, properly included within the definition. <em>State v. Hoffman, </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>564, 584, 695 A.2d 236 (1997); <em>Hovbilt, Inc. v. Twp. of Howell, </em>263 <em>N.J.Super. </em>567, 571, 623 A.2d 770 (App.Div.1993), <em>affd, </em>138 <em>N.J. </em>598, 651 A.2d 77 (1994); 2A Norman J. Singer &amp; J.D. Shambie Singer, <em>Sutherland Statutory Construction </em>\u00a7 47:17 (7th ed. 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">When it comes to providing information useful in identifying an individual, there is no similarity between age group and a photograph, social security number, driver\u2019s identification number, name, address or telephone number. The information the Act lists as identifying an individual either points to a specific person or provides a way to reach the person. Information about age group does neither, and we cannot conclude that Congress intended to prohibit its disclosure due to its capacity to identify an individual.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">Nor is age group \u201cmedical or disability information.\u201d Membership in this youthful age group consisting of persons between sixteen and twenty-one clearly says nothing about a person\u2019s medical conditions or disabilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">Plaintiffs argue that age, medical condition and disability are all of the same nature because they are private and very personal. We fail to see how age group is comparable to medical condition and disability in that regard. One who is between sixteen and twenty-one cannot conceal the physical characteristics that tend to establish his or membership in the group but need not disclose every medical condition and disability with each appearance in public.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-8\">Plaintiffs also present an argument based on the Act\u2019s legislative history that indicates the Act was intended to avoid disclosure of information that might facilitate the commission of crimes. <em>See generally State v. Donis, </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>44, 53, 723 A.2d 35 (1998) (discussing extrinsic evidence of congressional intent and notorious criminal incidents that led to the Act\u2019s adoption). They contend that age group, like information about medical condition and disability, tends to identify persons who are particularly vulnera<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>ble. Setting aside that there is nothing obvious to us about persons between sixteen and twenty-one that makes them peculiarly vulnerable to criminal acts, knowledge of vulnerability, unlike knowledge that identifies an individual or where the individual may be reached, does not facilitate crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we reject the claim that Chapter 37 requires disclosure of personal or highly personal information that is prohibited by the Act. Chapter 37 is not preempted.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b597-8\">There is no merit in plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the decal requirement of Chapter 37 violates the equal protection clause, <em>U.S. Const. </em>amend. XIV, \u00a7 1, or Article I, paragraph 1 of the New Jersey Constitution, which \u201cconfer\u00eds] the right to equal treatment under the law.\u201d <em>Doe v. Poritz, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>1, 94, 662 A.2d 367 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-9\">Plaintiffs\u2019 challenge focuses on two groups of drivers that they claim are similarly situated to but are exempt from the decal requirements imposed on New Jersey residents. They point to drivers licensed in this State who are temporarily residing outside of New Jersey or serving in the military outside the State and may obtain a temporary license, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:3-10n, and to drivers licensed in other states who drive in New Jersey pursuant to the touring privilege, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:3-17.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b597-10\">Before addressing the contours of the constitutional provisions plaintiffs invoke, we dispose of their claim that they are treated differently than those who obtain temporary licenses pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:3-10n. Their objection is based on a misreading of the statute. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:3-10n permits the chief administrator, at the administrator\u2019s discretion, to issue temporary driver\u2019s licenses that are valid without a digitized color picture of the licensee. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number><em>Ibid. </em>The chief administrator may issue such temporary licenses to \u201cNew Jersey <em>licensees </em>who are serving in the military outside the State or who temporarily are residents of another state or foreign country.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(emphasis added). The statute does not authorize the issuance of licenses to permitees, and even if we assume that the chief administrator issues these temporary licenses to holders of probationary licenses, there is no indication that a probationary licensee receives a temporary license exempt from the restrictions on driving privileges that accompany it while in this State.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">We turn next to consider the validity of the distinction between youthful inexperienced drivers licensed in this State and those holding licenses issued elsewhere who are eligible to drive in accordance with <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:3-17. The essence of equal protection is that the government may not treat differently people who are alike in all relevant respects. <em>State v. Mortimer, </em>135 <em>N.J. </em>517, 536, 641 A.2d 257, <em>cert. denied, </em>513 <em>U.S. </em>970, 115 <em>S.Ct. </em>440, 130 <em>L.Ed.2 </em>d 351 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">Under the federal constitution, \u201c[a] classification that does not impact a suspect class or impinge upon a fundamental constitutional right will be upheld if it is rationally related to a legitimate government interest.\u201d <em>Doe, supra, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>at 92, 662 A.2d 367; <em>see Fed. Commc\u2019ns Comm\u2019n v. Beach Commc\u2019ns, </em>508 <em>U.S. </em>307, 313, 113 <em>S.Ct. </em>2096, 2101, 124 L.Ed.2d 211, 221 (1993); <em>Dandridge v. Williams, </em>397 <em>U.S. </em>471, 485, 90 <em>S.Ct. </em>1153, 1161, 25 L.Ed.2d 491, 502 (1970). Review under this standard is for a rational basis and plaintiffs concede their challenge to this classification is s\u00fabjeet to review under that standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">Where the equal protection clause requires only a rational basis for a classification, the question is whether the classification is arbitrary. <em>Doe, supra, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>at 91, 662 A.2d 367. A classification that provides a \u201crational means to serve a legitimate end\u201d is permissible, not arbitrary. <em>Id. </em>at 91-92, 662 A.2d 367 (quoting <em>City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr., </em>473 <em>U.S. </em>432, 441-42, 105 <em>S.Ct. </em>3249, 3255, 87 L.Ed.2d 313, 321 (1985)). Con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>versely, a classification is invalid when the objectives of the law are not legitimate or the relationship between the asserted permissible goal and classification is so attenuated as to be arbitrary or irrational. <em>City of Cleburne, supra, </em>478 <em>U.S. </em>at 446-47, 105 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 3258, 87 L.Ed.2d at 324; <em>Doe, supra, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>at 92, 662 A.2d 367.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">Measured against those standards, Chapter 37 is constitutionally permissible. The purpose of Chapter 37 is to facilitate enforcement of the restrictions on the driving privileges enjoyed by holders of special learner\u2019s permits, examination permits and probationary licenses that have been issued by this State. Plaintiffs do not contend that the restrictions imposed by New Jersey\u2019s GDLS or their enforcement further impermissible goals. They simply challenge the rationality of the obligation to display a decal that treats them differently than drivers of the same age and experience with permits or licenses issued by another state.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">The difficulty with plaintiffs\u2019 argument is that it overlooks that the GDLS restrictions enforced with the aid of the decal obligation do not apply to drivers licensed elsewhere. Because the GDLS does not apply to out-of-state drivers, Chapter 37\u2019s distinction between them and New Jersey drivers is a \u201crational\u201d limitation on the decal obligation. It would be irrational and arbitrary to require those not subject to the GDLS restrictions to display a decal designed to facilitate enforcement of the restrictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">Plaintiffs\u2019 equal protection argument fares no better under the State Constitution. Our courts \u201capply a balancing test which considers the nature of the right affected, the extent to which the government action interferes with that right, and the public need for such interference.\u201d <em>Doe, supra, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>at 94, 662 A.2d 367; <em>see Barone v. Dep\u2019t of Human Servs., </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>355, 368, 526 A.2d 1055 (1987). The \u201ccritical issue\u201d is \u201cwhether there is an appropriate governmental interest suitably furthered by the differential treatment involved.\u201d <em>Barone, supra, </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>at 368, 526 A.2d 1055 (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>Measured under those standards, Chapter 37 passes muster. The governmental interest furthered by enforcement of the system of restricted driving privileges established by the GDLS is safety on the roadways of this State. The decals which must be used by young drivers subject to the GDLS restrictions are a suitable means of furthering that interest. It would serve no purpose at all to impose the same obligation on young drivers licensed elsewhere who are not subject to the GDLS. In short, Chapter 37\u2019s distinction between drivers permitted and licensed here and elsewhere does not treat differently people who are alike in the respect relevant to Chapter 37\u2019s goal. The minimal burden entailed in the display of the decal is greatly outweighed by the potential benefit to the enforcement of the GDLS.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">In an effort to add weight to their side of the balance, plaintiffs argue that the disclosure of their age group impinges upon their right to privacy by compelling them to display decals showing their age group. The Supreme Court, however, has held that the government\u2019s disclosure of matters that are exposed to public view does not violate a privacy interest protected by either the federal or State constitution. <em>Doe, supra, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>at 80, 91, 662 A.2d 367. Membership in a particular age group is something its members expose to public view every time they appear in public.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">We decline to discuss plaintiffs\u2019 policy arguments. The wisdom of Chapter 37 is a question for the Legislature not the courts. <em>Sykes v. Propane Power Corp., </em>224 <em>N.J.Super. </em>686, 701, 541 A.2d 271 (App.Div.1988). Indeed, there are several pending bills in legislative committees as of the date of this opinion that would revise Chapter 37. Assemb. 2650, 214th Legis. Sess. (2010); Assemb. 2703, 214th Legis. Sess. (2010); Assemb. A3210, 214th Legis. Sess. (2010); S. 1908, 214th Legis. Sess. (2010); S. 1991, 214th Legis. Sess. (2010); S. 2238, 214th Legis. Sess. (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b600-8\">Plaintiffs also challenge Chapter 37 as authorizing unreasonable searches and seizures prohibited by the State and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>federal constitutions. <em>U.S. Const. </em>amends. IV, XIV; <em>N.J. Const. </em>art. I, H 7. No statute \u201ccan authorize a violation\u201d of the constitutional prohibition, <em>Almeida-Sanchez v. United States, </em>413 <em>U.S. </em>266, 272, 93 <em>S.Ct. </em>2535, 2539, 37 L.Ed.2d 596, 602 (1973), and Chapter 37 does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">The purpose of the prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures is \u201cto safeguard the privacy and security of individuals against arbitrary invasions by governmental officials.\u201d <em>Camara v. Municipal Court, </em>387 <em>U.S. </em>523, 528, 87 <em>S.Ct. </em>1727, 1730, 18 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>930, 935 (1967). Consistent with that purpose, protection does not extend to matters or facts in which a person does not have a reasonable expectation of privacy because the person exposes them to public view. <em>Katz v. United States, </em>389 <em>U.S. </em>347, 351, 88 <em>S.Ct. </em>507, 511, 19 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>576, 582 (1967); <em>Doe, supra, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>at 28 n. 8, 80, 662 A.2d 367.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">Chapter 37 does not implicate reasonable expectations of privacy. True, the obligation to display a decal compels disclosure of information that permits identification of a driver\u2019s age group, but a driver has no reasonable expectation of privacy in that information because it is discernible from his or her physical appearance and necessarily exposed to public view. <em>United States v. Dionisio, </em>410 <em>U.S. </em>1, 14, 93 <em>S.Ct. </em>764, 771, 35 L.Ed.2d 67, 79 (1973); <em>Doe, supra, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>at 28 n. 8, 80, 662 A.2d 367. Moreover, once the obligatory decal is visibly displayed on the car, it may be viewed; it is not a \u201csearch\u201d for police to examine it, \u201can object required by law to be located in a place ordinarily in plain view from the exterior of [an] automobile.\u201d <em>New York v. Class, </em>475 <em>U.S. </em>106, 114, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>960, 966, 89 L.Ed.2d 81, 90 (1986); <em>Donis, supra, </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>at 54-55, 723 A.2d 35 (quoting <em>Class). </em>Finally, although plaintiffs do not claim otherwise, it is worth noting that Chapter 37 does not authorize officers to stop a car that bears a decal without a reasonable and articulable suspicion of a violation of the law. <em>Delaware v. Prouse, </em>440 <em>U.S. </em>648, 663, 99 <em>S.Ct. </em>1391, 1401, 59 L.Ed.2d 660, 673 (1979); <em>State v. Amelio, </em>197 <em>N.J. </em>207, 211, 962 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>A.2d 498 (2008), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 <em>U.S. </em>\u2014, 129 <em>S.Ct. </em>2402, 173 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>1297 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">To summarize, on the arguments presented to us, we find that Chapter 37 is neither preempted nor constitutionally infirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b591-12\"> By leave granted, Donna Weeks, a proponent of Chapter 37, a law known by the name of her child Kyleigh, filed an amicus brief in the trial court. On appeal she has joined in the briefs filed by the Attorney General on behalf of the State defendants.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b597-11\"> Although the decal requirement as applied by the MVC to holders of examination permits and probationary licenses treats drivers under twenty-one differently than those who are twenty-one or older, plaintiffs do not challenge that age-based distinction.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
