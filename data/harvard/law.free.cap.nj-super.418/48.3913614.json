His conviction was reversed on appeal and the State declined to pursue retrial. This matter involves Marrero\u2019s professional negligence action against criminal defense counsel, defendants Howard Feintuch, his law firm Feintuch, Porwich &amp; Feintuch and law partners, Philip Feintuch and Alan Porwich. Marrero\u2019s complaint sought repayment of the legal fees paid, compensatory damages, punitive damages and counsel fees and costs. Generally, Marrero alleged defendants failed to introduce evidence supporting his alibi defense, which he maintained would have defeated prosecution in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">Defendants, by our leave granted, appeal from a June 25, 2010 interlocutory order denying reconsideration of a May 14, 2010 order quashing a subpoena to obtain witness testimony. Defendants asserted the information sought was relevant to refute Marrero\u2019s alibi and to show they were not negligent in providing his criminal defense. The trial court quashed the subpoena, determining Marrero\u2019s guilt of the criminal offense was not relevant in the malpractice action.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-8\">Following our examination, we conclude the motion judge exceeded her discretion in barring the pretrial discovery deposition testimony, as the evidence may be relevant to defeat plaintiff\u2019s malpractice claims. Accordingly, we reverse the May 14, 2010 order quashing the subpoena and the June 25, 2010 order denying reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-9\">The facts of the underlying criminal matter are recited in our unpublished opinion reversing Marrero\u2019s conviction. <em>State v. Marrero, </em>No. A \u2014 4141-05, 2007 WL 1627465 (App. Div. June 7, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>2007). We restate those facts necessary to understand the context of the issues under review.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">Defendants were hired as Marrero\u2019s criminal defense counsel following his indictment in connection with the January 11, 2005 knife-point robbery of Ralph Greiss, the owner of St. Mina\u2019s Deli. <em>Marrero, supra, </em>slip op. at 2. After the robbery, Greiss chose Marrero\u2019s picture from a photographic array. <em>Id. </em>at 3. At trial, when asked whether he saw the perpetrator in the courtroom, Greiss said, \u201cHe\u2019s not here.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2. When asked a second time to find the man who robbed him in the courtroom, Greiss chose a member of the jury. <em>Id. </em>at 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">Severo Cordero, a customer who had entered the deli as the robbery was taking place, also testified. <em>Ibid. </em>Cordero explained he briefly saw the face of the perpetrator as he exited the deli. <em>Ibid. </em>When asked by police to view suspect photographs, Cordero chose a picture of someone who he stated \u201cresembled\u201d the perpetrator. <em>Id. </em>at 5. Cordero advised he was not certain the photograph was of the robber. <em>Ibid. </em>Cordero\u2019s in-court identification was equally equivocal. <em>Ibid. </em>He stated Marrero \u201clooked just like\u201d the robber he saw, but he was not \u201c100 percent\u201d sure Marrero was the person responsible for the stick-up. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b79-8\">Marrero\u2019s girlfriend Christine Vuolo was called by the defense. She stated that at about 6:30 p.m. Marrero telephoned her and they talked for approximately \u201cfifteen to twenty minutes.\u201d Marrero\u2019s telephone records, which were not introduced to corroborate Vuolo\u2019s testimony, verified that on the date of the robbery, a call was placed from his residence at 6:32 p.m., which lasted until 6:38 p.m. The robbery occurred at 6:57 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-9\">The jury found Marrero guilty and he was sentenced to five years imprisonment, subject to the No Early Release Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-7.2. <em>Id. </em>at 2. On appeal, we overturned the conviction, principally based on judicial errors. We remanded the matter for a new trial. <em>Id. </em>at 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>Following a discussion with appellate counsel, the State declined to pursue further prosecution and recommended dismissal of the indictment. In a memo to the trial judge supporting the requested dismissal, Assistant Hudson County Prosecutor Leo Hurley identified problems that thwarted prosecution. These included the equivocal victim identification, Marrero\u2019s telephone records corroborating Vuolo\u2019s testimony regarding their telephone call, and the defense proffer of another witness it proposed to call at retrial who telephoned Marrero at home at 6:32 p.m., which was also corroborated by the telephone records. Hurley concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-6\">Given that the armed robbery occurred ... at 6:57 p.m. and that testimony backed by certified telephone records would show that [Marrero] was on the phone with two different people until roughly 6:38 p.m. on January 11, 2005, it is highly unlikely that he could travel a mile and a half to the St. Mina\u2019s Deli in order to commit the armed robbery of that store. Greiss\u2019s identification of a juror as the perpetrator of the armed robbery during the first day of trial further buttresses this conclusion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">The court dismissed the indictment. On June 11, 2007, Marrero was released from prison after serving one year and eight months of his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">Marrero\u2019s legal malpractice action alleged defendants, as criminal defense counsel, failed to investigate or properly interview witnesses, neglected to support Marrero\u2019s alibi by introducing his certified telephone records to show he was speaking to Yuolo about the time the robbery occurred, undermined Marrero\u2019s alibi during .summation by improperly suggesting Marrero may have been talking to Vuolo on a cellular telephone and improperly cross-examined Greiss, allowing him to reiterate his out-of-court identification despite his inability to identify Marrero during trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-9\">During discovery in the negligence action, defendants issued a Subpoena Ad Testificandum to Richard Stenzer, Marrero\u2019s friend, who had spent time with him the day of the robbery. In the criminal matter, Stenzer was identified among the State\u2019s proposed trial witnesses, but failed to appear. Defendants proposed to depose Stenzer to reconstruct the events of that day. Marrero moved to quash the subpoena.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>Defendants opposed the motion to quash, filing the affidavit of Jorge Morales, the former assistant prosecutor at Marrero\u2019s criminal trial. Morales stated the telephone records were available at trial and had they been introduced, he \u201ccould have called [] Stenzer to testify ... [as] Stenzer[\u2019s] house was on the same block as the victim\u2019s store.\u201d Morales also stated that he declined the court\u2019s offer of a bench warrant to compel Stenzer\u2019s appearance because the telephone records were not used. Additionally, Morales stated that with the telephone records in hand he could have attacked Vuolo\u2019s testimony on cross-examination as the call lasted only six minutes, not fifteen or twenty.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">The motion judge found Stenzer\u2019s testimony as to Marrero\u2019s alibi had \u201cno relevance\u201d to Marrero\u2019s legal malpractice claim. During her oral findings, the motion judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-7\">Notably Mr. Stenzer never testified at trial [inj the original action. [D]efendant[s] here never sought to have him testily. Allowing him to testify as part of this action ... would be contrary to the holding in <em>Lieberman </em>[if. <em>Employers Ins. of Wausau, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>325, 419 A.2d 417 (1980),] which indicates the jury must be provided with an accurate evidential reflection ... of the original action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">Because the motion judge concluded Marrero need not prove his innocence for the underlying robbery, defendants\u2019 subpoena for Stenzer\u2019s testimony to pursue such information was quashed.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-9\">Defendants moved for reconsideration. Following oral argument, the motion judge issued a written decision and entered an order denying the motion. The motion judge reiterated her prior conclusion that Stenzer\u2019s testimony as to Marrero\u2019s guilt or innocence for the underlying robbery was irrelevant to the legal malpractice claims and the \u201csuit within a suit\u201d format was inapplicable to criminal legal malpractice actions because a \u201cjury must be provided with \u2018an accurate evidential reflection or semblance of the original action.\u2019 \u201d We granted defendants\u2019 request for leave to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-10\">On appeal, defendants argue the motion judge erred in quashing the subpoena after concluding Marrero\u2019s guilt or innocence was not relevant to dispute his claims of legal malpractice. Defendants suggest \u201cthe role a plaintiffs guilt or innocence should play <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>in a criminal legal malpractice action\u201d is not clearly decided by New Jersey case law. Defendants assert Marrero\u2019s guilt is relevant to whether their actions were negligent, making the information to be obtained through Stenzer\u2019s deposition relevant. Defendants urge the order should be reversed because quashing the subpoena limits their ability to defend against Marrero\u2019s malpractice claims. Additionally, defendants assert the trial court erred in its application of <em>Lieberman, supra, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>at 342-44, 419 A.2d 417, by incorrectly concluding the \u201csuit within a suit\u201d approach was inapplicable to the legal negligence trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">Marrero argues the Supreme Court in <em>McKnight v. Office of Pub. Defender, </em>197 <em>N.J. </em>180,182, 962 A.2d 482 (2008), rejected the precept that a criminal defendant must prove actual innocence to prevail on claims of professional negligence. Plaintiff correctly observes the Court, in determining the commencement of the tolling period for a negligence suit, stated that only \u201csome form of exoneration\u201d rather than proof of actual innocence is required. <em>Ibid. </em>From this he concludes Stenzer\u2019s testimony was properly quashed.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">Our de novo review examines whether the court correctly applied the governing legal principles in exercising its discretion to quash the subpoena. <em>See Manalapan Realty, L.P. v. Twp. Comm. of Manalapan, </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>366, 378, 658 A.2d 1230 (1995) (\u201cA trial court\u2019s interpretation of the law and the legal consequences that flow from established facts are not entitled to any special deference.\u201d). <em>See also Rowe v. Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., </em>383 <em>N.J.Super. </em>442, 452, 892 A.2d 694 (App.Div.2006), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>189 <em>N.J. </em>615, 917 A2.d 767 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-8\">Contrary to the assertions of the parties, the question now presented was not squarely addressed by this court or the Supreme Court in <em>McKnight.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Nevertheless, it is instructive to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>provide an overview of our opinion and that of the Supreme Court in <em>McKnight.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">In our opinion in <em>McKnight v. Office of Pub. Defender, </em>397 <em>N.J.Super. </em>265, 267, 936 A.2d 1036 (App.Div.2007), <em>rev\u2019d., </em>197 <em>N.J. </em>180, 962 A2.d 482 (2008), the issue we reviewed was when does a professional negligence action against criminal defense counsel accrue. The plaintiff, who was born in Trinidad and Tobago, filed a legal malpractice action against the public defender who counseled him in his guilty plea to third-degree aggravated assault. <em>Ibid. </em>Following conviction, the plaintiff was informed he would be deported because of his guilty plea. <em>Ibid. </em>The trial court denied the motion to withdraw his plea, which we affirmed on appeal. <em>Id. </em>at 267-68, 936 A.2d 1036. The plaintiffs native country declined to accept him as a deportee, resulting in his indefinite incarceration. <em>Id. </em>at 269, 936 A.2d 1036. The plaintiff sought post-conviction relief (PCR), asserting counsel misinformed him of the deportation consequences of a guilty plea. <em>Id. </em>at 268, 936 A.2d 1036. PCR was granted. <em>Ibid. </em>On remand, the State agreed to accept a guilty plea to a lesser offense. <em>Id. </em>at 269-70, 936 A.2d 1036.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">More than four years following his guilty plea, but within ninety days of the order granting PCR relief, the plaintiff, represented by different counsel, filed the professional negligence complaint against the public defender. <em>Id. </em>at 269-70, 936 A.2d 1036. The public defender\u2019s office moved to dismiss the action as untimely, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>because it had been filed more than two years beyond the date the plaintiff was informed he was subject to deportation. <em>Id. </em>at 271, 936 A.2d 1036. The trial court was persuaded and dismissed the civil action. <em>Ibid. </em>On appeal, we ascertained the accrual date of plaintiffs malpractice action. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">Addressing the plaintiff\u2019s argument that any legal malpractice action against defense counsel should not accrue until he was exonerated by way of PCR, we considered decisions of our sister states. <em>Id. </em>at 274, 936 A.2d 1036. Relevant to the instant matter, we flatly rejected determinations from other jurisdictions that relied upon public policy considerations to preclude malpractice recovery by a criminal defendant who had not proven his or her actual innocence of the crimes charged. <em>See e.g., Ang v. Martin, </em>154 <em>Wash.2d </em>477, 114 P.3d 637, 640 (2005) (reiterating that innocence is an additional element a criminal defendant-malpractice plaintiff must prove to prevail); <em>Taylor v. Davis, </em>265 <em>Va. </em>187, 576 S.E.2d 445, 447 (2003) (requiring legal malpractice plaintiff who alleges attorney\u2019s negligence in a criminal ease, which resulted in an erroneous conviction, must prove he has obtained post-conviction relief and was \u201cactually innocent\u201d of the crimes charged); <em>Coscia v. McKenna &amp; Cuneo, </em>25 Cal.4th 1194, 108 <em>Cal.Rptr.2d </em>471, 25 P.3d 670, 673 (2001) (concluding \u201conly an innocent person wrongly convicted [may] be deemed to have suffered a legally compensable harm\u201d); <em>Brown v. Theos, </em>345 <em>S.C. </em>626, 550 <em>S.E.2d </em>304, 306 (2001) (stating plaintiff must show innocence of the crime in order to establish liability in an action for legal malpractice); <em>Wiley v. Cnty. of San Diego, </em>19 Cal.4th 532, 79 Cal.Rptr.2d 672, 966 P.2d 983, 987 (1998) (holding that \u201c[o]nly an innocent person wrongly convicted due to inadequate representation has suffered a compensable injury\u201d); <em>Kramer v. Dirksen, </em>296 <em>Ill.App.3d </em>819, 231 <em>Ill.Dec. </em>169, 695 N.E.2d 1288, 1290 (1998); <em>Ray v. Stone, </em>952 <em>S.W.2d </em>220, 224 (Ky.Ct.App.1997) (supporting the public policy that prohibits financial gain resulting, directly or indirectly, from criminal acts); <em>Lamb v. Manweiler, </em>129 <em>Idaho </em>269, 923 P.2d 976, 979 (1996) (noting plaintiff did not dispute proposition that actual innocence was \u201cadditional element\u201d of criminal malpractice cause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>of action); <em>Bailey v. Tucker, </em>533 <em>Pa. </em>237, 621 A.2d 108, 115 (1993) (stating plaintiff must prove that he is innocent of the crime charged or any lesser included offense); <em>Glenn v. Aiken, </em>409 <em>Mass. </em>699, 569 N.E.2d 783, 787 (1991) (stating that in order to recover for attorney malpractice, plaintiff must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that he is innocent of the crime charged); <em>Carmel v. Lunney, </em>70 N.Y.2d 169, 518 N.Y.S.2d 605, 511 N.E.2d 1126, 1128 (1987) (stating that unless a plaintiff can assert his innocence, \u201cpublic policy prevents maintenance of a malpractice action against his attorney\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">The public policy undergirding each of these out-of-state authorities is concisely expressed in <em>Wiley:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-7\">[P]ermitting a convicted criminal to pursue a legal malpractice claim -without requiring proof of innocence would allow the criminal to profit by his own fraud, or to take advantage of his own wrong, or to found [a] claim upon his iniquity, or to acquire property by his own crime. As such, it is against public policy for the suit to continue in that it would indeed shock the public conscience, engender disrespect for courts and generally discredit the administration of justice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-8\"><em>[supra, </em>79 <em>Cal.Rptr.2d </em>672, 966 P.2d at 986 (internal quotations and citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b85-9\">In specifically rejecting this premise we concluded, \u201cthe requirement of actual innocence illogically and unfairly bars valid and legitimate claims of malpractice[.]\u201d <em>McKnight, supra, </em>397 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 276, 936 A.2d 1036. Instead, we accepted as a founding premise that \u201cboth the innocent and the guilty are entitled to competent counsel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 288, 936 A.2d 1036. Noting malpractice cases focus on \u201cwhether the plaintiff was damaged by an attorney\u2019s negligent performance in the underlying criminal action!,]\u201d we favored allowance of a remedy when a criminal defendant was damaged by the negligent conduct of an attorney who was duty bound to protect the client\u2019s interests. <em>Id. </em>at 282, 936 A.2d 1036.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-10\">The majority of our panel adopted a two-track approach to determine when an aggrieved criminal defendant\u2019s malpractice action accrues. Applying the generally held principle for accrual of professional negligence matters, we concluded actual knowledge triggered the time to file the suit and determined a plaintiff must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>also seek PCR to \u201cundo some of the harm allegedly caused by the attorney negligence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 279, 936 A.2d 1036. In that way, the malpractice action would be stayed pending the outcome of the petition for PCR to ascertain the scope of damages suffered. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">We affirmed the trial court\u2019s dismissal of the malpractice action as untimely, to which Judge Stem dissented.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 295-97, 936 A.2d 1036 (Stern, J., dissenting). Judge Stern favored a rule providing for the delay of accrual until exoneration. <em>Id. </em>at 297, 936 A.2d 1036.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">The Court, in a brief per curiam opinion, reversed our decision and reinstated the plaintiffs legal malpractice action, adopting the approach enunciated by Judge Stern. <em>McKnight, supra, </em>197 <em>N.J. </em>at 182, 962 A.2d 482. The Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-8\">Accordingly, in a legal malpractice action brought by a defendant against the attorney who represented him in a criminal ease, the statute of limitations does not begin to run until the defendant receives relief in the form of exoneration.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>[Ibid, </em>(citing <em>McKnight, supra, </em>397 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 295-301, 936 A.2d 1036 (Stem, J., dissenting)).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b86-9\">Although not specifically abrogating the requirement of actual innocence, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-10\">Judge Stern noted that exoneration \u201cmight be vacation of a guilty plea and dismissal of the charges, entry of judgment on a lesser offense after spending substantial time in custody following conviction for a greater offense or any disposition more beneficial to the criminal defendant than the original judgment.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 298 [936 A.2d 1036]. Judge Stern also emphasized that \u201cdefendant has to be exonerated to the point of being able to show some injury caused by the alleged malpractice whether that relief is dismissal of the charges, acquittal on retrial, conviction of a lesser included offense or otherwise____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 300-01 [936 A.2d 1036],</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-8\">Id. at 182, 962 A.2d 482 (quoting <em>McKnight supra, </em>397 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 298, 936 A.2d 1036 (Stern, J., dissenting)).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b87-9\">These comments provide sufficient guidance to allow us to conclude a plaintiff need not prove actual innocence of criminal charges as a prerequisite to pursue legal malpractice claims against his former criminal defense counsel. Having reached that conclusion, we next examine whether plaintiffs guilt of the offenses charged is relevant to defend the negligence action. Although we give \u201csubstantial deference\u201d to the trial judge\u2019s evidentiary rulings, <em>Benevenga v. Digregorio, </em>325 <em>N.J.Super. </em>27, 32, 737 A.2d 696 (App.Div.1999) (citations omitted), <em>certif. denied, </em>163 <em>N.J. </em>79, 747 A.2d 287 (2000), following our review, we do not agree with the motion judge that the evidence sought to be uncovered is not relevant and conclude the order quashing the subpoena, issued during pretrial discovery, was a misapplication of the court\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-10\">The scope of pretrial discovery is very broad. <em>Jenkins v. Rainner, </em>69 <em>N.J. </em>50, 56, 350 A.2d 473 (1976). <em>Rule </em>4:10-2(a) allows parties to \u201cobtain discovery regarding any matter, not privileged, which is relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending action, whether it relates to the claim or defense of the party seeking discovery or to the claim or defense of any other party[J\u201d \u201c[0]ur courts have held that rules of discovery are to be liberally construed and accorded the broadest possible latitude.\u201d <em>Blumberg v. Dornbusch, </em>139 <em>N.J.Super. </em>433, 437-38, 354 A.2d 351, (App.Div.1976). <em>See also </em>Pressler &amp; Verniero, <em>supra, </em>comment 1 to <em>Rule </em>4:10-2(a) (2011) (stating \u201cthere is substantial liberality in the granting of discovery\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-11\">Relevant information is defined by <em>N.J.R.E. </em>401 as \u201cevidence having a tendency in reason to prove or disprove any fact of consequence to the determination of the action.\u201d <em>See also Bren</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number><em>man v. Demello, </em>191 <em>N.J. </em>18, 30, 921 A.2d 1110 (2007). The inquiry \u201cfocuses upon \u2018the logical connection between the proffered evidence and a fact in issue.\u2019 \u201d <em>Verdicchio v.

Hutchins, </em>241 <em>N.J.Super. </em>353, 358, 575 A.2d 35 (App.Div.1990)).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">When examining a party\u2019s request to restrict pretrial discovery, the principle guiding the court should be to generally permit the widest latitude in the use of available discovery tools. <em>Blumberg, supra, </em>139 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 438, 354 A.2d 351. In its review, a court must also keep in mind \u201c[i]t is not ground for objection that the information sought [in discovery] will be inadmissible at the trial if the information sought appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence^]\u201d <em>R. </em>4:10-2(a). <em>See also Pfenninger v. Hunterdon Cent. Reg\u2019l High Sch., </em>167 <em>N.J. </em>230, 237, 770 A.2d 1126 (2001). Relevant evidence may certainly be excluded at trial if its probative value is outweighed by the risks of undue prejudice or the likelihood of misleading the jury. <em>N.J.R.E. </em>403(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">In this matter, among the allegations set forth in Marrero\u2019s complaint is that if not for defendants\u2019 failure to introduce certified copies of his telephone records, Marrero would not have been convicted. Defendants suggest both Marrero\u2019s innocence and his alibi are placed at issue by the complaint, making discovery centering on those facts relevant and permissible. Also, defendants believe Stenzer was with Marrero on the day of the robbery, making his testimony relevant to develop a timeline of events. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-8\">Paragraph 13 of the malpractice complaint, states: \u201cJeffery Marrero was home ... at the time of the robbery. Jeffrey Marrero was not involved in any manner in the robbery.\u201d Further, paragraph 21 asserts: \u201cJeffery Marrero informed defendant that at the time of the robbery he ... had been on the land-line telephone at his home, with ... Vuolo.\u201d Because Marrero placed his innocence at issue to clarify defendants\u2019 alleged breach of duty, then Stenzer\u2019s testimony of Marrero\u2019s whereabouts is relevant. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>Consequently, Stenzer\u2019s deposition is \u201creasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.\u201d <em>In re Liquidation of Integrity Ins. Co., </em>165 <em>N.J. </em>75, 82, 754 A.2d 1177 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">We reject Marrero\u2019s assertion to bar Stenzer\u2019s testimony because the State\u2019s decision not to retry him resulted solely from defense counsel\u2019s failure to introduce the telephone records. The ultimate decision not to pursue retrial was also greatly impacted by the victim\u2019s equivocal identification and the unavailability of the assistant prosecutor who had participated in the first trial but had been deployed for military service in Iraq. We are told the defense had uncertified telephone records at trial but did not use them and that the State had listed Stenzer on its witness list to blunt any effect once the telephone records were offered. Thus, the production of the certified records alone did not cause the State to decline prosecution. Believing Stenzer\u2019s testimony would have been damaging to Marrero in his criminal trial, defendants may have withheld the records, so as not to trigger the State\u2019s presentation of Stenzer. Therefore, Stenzer\u2019s deposition may confirm defendants\u2019 assertion that their decision not to present the telephone records was not negligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">Based on this record, we also note Stenzer\u2019s testimony may lead to evidence discrediting other elements of professional negligence. To prevail on his claim, Marrero must show defendants negligently breached a duty resulting in a \u201closs proximately caused\u201d by that negligence. <em>Gautam v. De Luca, </em>215 <em>N.J.Super. </em>388, 397, 521 A.2d 1343 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>39, 532 A.2d 1107 (1987). Marrero must also quantify the damages suffered as a proximate consequence of defendants\u2019 breach. <em>Lieberman, supra, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>at 342, 419 A.2d 417. If Stenzer implicates Marrero in the robbery, that fact may undermine the requisite proximate cause to support a malpractice claim. <em>See Krahn v. Kinney, </em>43 <em>Ohio </em>St.3d 103, 538 N.E.2d 1058, 1062 (1989) (observing the failure to obtain exoneration of the underlying criminal conviction could destroy the plaintiffs ability to establish proximate cause). Stated differently, if defendants offer evidence that Marrero robbed St. Mina\u2019s Deli, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>then Marrero\u2019s detention and incarceration were the expected consequence of his culpable criminal conduct, defeating plaintiffs claim that defendants\u2019 conduct caused the harm alleged. <em>See Coscia, supra, </em>108 <em>Cal.Rptr.2d </em>471, 25 P.3d at 673 (internal citations omitted); <em>see also </em>Christopher Scott Marvel, \u201cMonday Morning Lawyering: Proximate Cause and the Requirement of Actual Innocence in a Criminal Defense Malpractice Action,\u201d 16 <em>Widener L.J. </em>131, 133 (2006) (explaining that \u201cin order for the former attorney\u2019s negligence to have proximately caused the plaintiffs harm, the former criminal defendant must establish that it was the attorney\u2019s negligent representation, not the plaintiffs own criminal behavior that led to the harm suffered\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">Additionally, we note the motion judge\u2019s decision, based in part on the admissibility of the evidence, was error. The court\u2019s declaration barring Stenzer\u2019s deposition because \u201cthe jury must be provided with an accurate evidential reflection or semblance of the original action\u201d suggests an evaluation of the admissibility of the discoverable facts. The test is limited to whether the evidence is relevant, not admissible. <em>R. </em>4:10-2(a). Without knowing the content of Stenzer\u2019s testimony, it is premature to assess whether the information gleaned from any deposition will be admissible. Such a determination must abide future considerations in accordance with the balancing test set forth in <em>N.J.R.E. </em>403.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">In view of the sweeping nature of our discovery rules designed to ensure, with few exceptions, the ability to obtain all relevant facts before trial, we conclude quashing the subpoena regarding Marrero\u2019s alibi was unwarranted and represented a misguided exercise of discretion. Accordingly, we reverse the May 14, 2010 order quashing the subpoena.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">For completeness, we comment on the court\u2019s statement upon reconsideration to decline application of the \u201csuit within a suit\u201d format when reviewing a \u201clegal malpractice claim[ ] involving non-economic claims in criminal defense work.\u201d <em>Lieberman, supra, </em>did not eschew the \u201csuit within a suit\u201d format but advised that this traditional presentation was not the only way to proceed in a legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>malpractice action. 84 <em>N.J. </em>at 325, 419 A.2d 417; <em>see also Garcia v.

The Court observed the alternatives to be considered to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-6\">the \u201csuit within a suit\u201d approach or any reasonable modification thereof.
