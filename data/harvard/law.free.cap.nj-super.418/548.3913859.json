We affirm as to all issues except the sentence, which we vacate and remand for resentencing consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-12\">We discern the following facts and procedural history from the record on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-13\">On August 6, 1998, Michael York and David Pomeroy were working at a restaurant in Toms River. York was the manager of the restaurant. At approximately 11:00 p.m., he asked Pomeroy, the kitchen manager, to walk with him to the bank next door to make a deposit. They left through the back of the restaurant and walked through a parking lot and row of trees toward the bank. According to York, the parking lot was well lit, \u201calmost like daylight.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b578-14\">As they passed through the trees, Pennington approached. He was holding a silver revolver with a long barrel. He repeatedly told York and Pomeroy: \u201cGive me the money.\u201d When York was an arm\u2019s length away from Pennington and could see his face, York handed him the money. Pennington then fled toward a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>\u201cdark car\u201d and left the area. York ran back to the restaurant, where he asked someone to call the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">The following morning, York and Pomeroy went to the police station to meet with a sketch artist. They helped him create a composite sketch of the man who robbed them. The sketch depicted the man as wearing wire-rimmed glasses.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">On August 10, Detective Sergeant Roger Kriney presented a photo array to York. None of pictures depicted men with eyeglasses. York identified Pennington as the man who robbed him. However, because Kriney thought York\u2019s identification appeared tentative, he did not ask York to sign the back of the photograph.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">On August 12, Pomeroy went to the police station to view the photo array. Pomeroy told Kriney that he had not had any conversations with York about the array. Pomeroy identified Pennington as the man who robbed him and York.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-9\">On August 16, Kriney visited York at the restaurant. He showed York a photo array that did not contain Pennington\u2019s photo. York did not identify anyone from that array. Kriney next showed York an array containing Pennington\u2019s photo. York again identified him as the robber. York signed the photograph at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-10\">After the robbery, Detective John Stillwell saw an alert bulletin from the Dover Township Police regarding a dark-colored Oldsmobile Toronado that was involved in the robbery. He remembered seeing a car and driver matching the description on the alert while he was on patrol the night before the robbery. Stillwell informed Kriney that he had a \u201cgood look\u201d at the driver of that vehicle. On August 16, Kriney showed Stillwell a photo array. Stillwell identified Pennington as the man he saw driving the dark Toronado the night before the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-11\">Pennington owned an Oldsmobile Toronado. When he was arrested, he had $1000 in cash in his possession. Pennington told Kriney that he had seen Fati Sekou with a handgun the day before and the night of the robbery. He further claimed that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>allowed Sekou to borrow his Toronado in exchange for heroin and that he was in Sekou\u2019s motel room using heroin while Sekou was using the Toronado. When Sekou returned, according to Pennington, Sekou gave him the cash and more heroin.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">On November 3, 1997, Pennington was convicted of first degree armed robbery, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:15-1 (count one), and second degree conspiracy to commit armed robbery, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:5-2 and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:15-1 (count two).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At sentencing on December 19, 1997, the trial judge merged the armed robbery conviction with the conspiracy conviction. He then sentenced Pennington to a discretionary extended term of life in prison with twenty-five years of parole ineligibility. He made the term consecutive to an extended-term life sentence Pennington was already serving. Although that offense was committed after the armed robbery involved in this appeal, it had been adjudicated and the sentence imposed prior to the conviction in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">Pennington appealed. We affirmed the conviction and sentence, <em>State v. Pennington, </em>No. A-6920-99 (App.Div. May 7, 2003), and the Supreme Court denied certification. 177 <em>N.J. </em>574, 832 A.2d 324 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">In December 2003, Pennington filed a petition for post-conviction relief (PCR). In August 2005, the Law Division dismissed the petition for failure to prosecute. Pennington\u2019s motion for reinstatement was denied in October 2005. He appealed. We initially affirmed, but on reconsideration we reversed and remanded to the Law Division for oral argument on Pennington\u2019s petition. <em>State v. Pennington, </em>No. A-2223-05, 2008 <em>WL </em>3896670 (App.Div. Aug. 26, 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-8\">The PCR judge heard oral argument on August 12, 2009. In a detailed oral opinion delivered following the argument, the judge denied relief and dismissed the petition. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">On appeal, Pennington raises the following issues:</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\"><em>POINT ONE: </em>THE TRIAL COURT\u2019S IMPOSITION OF A SECOND LIFE TERM IS ILLEGAL WHERE ONLY THREE YEARS BEFORE THE DEFENDANT WAS SENTENCED BY ANOTHER COURT TO AN EXTENDED LIFE TERM.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-8\"><em>POINT TWO: </em>THE DEFENDANT\u2019S TRIAL ATTORNEY WAS CONSTITUTIONALLY INEFFECTIVE WHERE HE FAILED TO BE ADEQUATELY PREPARED TO PROFFER ANY PRETRIAL EVIDENCE THAT THE OUT-OF-COURT POLICE PROCEDURES WERE IMPERMISSIBLY SUGGESTIVE.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-9\"><em>POINT THREE: </em>THE POLICE OFFICER\u2019S OUT-OF-COURT IDENTIFICATION OF THE DEFENDANT AS THE DRIVER OF THE VEHICLE HE OBSERVED THE NIGHT BEFORE THE CRIME WAS NOT RELIABLE AND SHOULD HAVE BEEN BARRED.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-10\"><em>POINT FOUR: </em>THE PCR COURT ERRED IN FAILING TO REVIEW WHETHER THE DEFENDANT\u2019S TRIAL ATTORNEY WAS CONSTITUTIONALLY DEFICIENT WHEN IT DID NOT CONDUCT AN EVIDENTIARY HEARING TO DETERMINE WHY THE ATTORNEY CHOSE NOT TO REEXAMINE THE OUT-OF-COURT IDENTIFICATION PROCEDURE.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-11\">\u201cPost-conviction relief is New Jersey\u2019s analogue to the federal writ of habeas corpus.\u201d <em>State v. Preciose, </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>451, 459, 609 A.2d 1280 (1992). Under <em>Rule </em>3:22-2, there are four grounds for PCR:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-12\">(a) Substantial denial in the conviction proceedings of defendant\u2019s rights under the Constitution of the United States or the Constitution or laws of the State of New Jersey;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-13\">(b) Lack of jurisdiction of the court to impose the judgment rendered upon defendant\u2019s conviction;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-14\">(c) Imposition of sentence in excess of or otherwise not in accordance with the sentence authorized by law____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-16\">(d) Any ground heretofore available as a basis for collateral attack upon a conviction by habeas corpus or any other common-law or statutory remedy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-17\">\u201cA petitioner must establish the right to such relief by a preponderance of the credible evidence.\u201d <em>Preciose, supra, </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>at 459, 609 A.2d 1280. To sustain that burden, specific facts which \u201cprovide the court with an adequate basis on which to rest its decision\u201d must be articulated. <em>State v. Mitchell, </em>126 <em>N.J. </em>565, 579, 601 A.2d 198 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>Pennington\u2019s first argument relates to <em>Rule </em>3:22-2(c), imposition of an illegal sentence. He argues that the trial judge\u2019s imposition of an extended life term was not permitted under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-5(b) because he was already serving an extended term arising from a crime committed after the robbery for which he was being sentenced. Consequently, he argues, it was an illegal sentence. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\"><em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:44-5(b), which governs sentences of imprisonment imposed at different times, provides in relevant part as follows: When a defendant who has previously been sentenced to imprisonment is subsequently sentenced to another term for an offense committed prior to the former sentence, other than an offense committed while in custody:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-6\">(1) The multiple sentences imposed shall so far as possible conform to subsection a. of this section____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">The relevant section of <em>N.J.SA </em>2C:44-5(a), which governs sentences for more than one offense, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-9\">When multiple sentences of imprisonment are imposed on a defendant for more than one offense ... such multiple sentences shall run concurrently or consecutively as the court determines at the time of sentence, except that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-10\">(2) Not more than one sentence for an extended term shall be imposed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AY-\">Pennington asserts that a plain reading of those two sections together precluded the imposition of another extended term sentence under the then-existing circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-11\">The State argues to the contrary. The State relies on <em>State v. Williams, </em>299 <em>N.J.Super. </em>264, 690 A.2d 1082 (App.Div.1997) and <em>State v. Reldan, </em>231 <em>N.J.Super. </em>232, 555 A.2d 653 (App.Div.1989), both of which it argues permitted the judge to sentence Pennington to a second extended term.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-12\">In <em>Reldan, </em>the defendant had been convicted of advocating homicide and conspiracy to commit murder in 1978 and sentenced as a habitual offender pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:85-12. That statute is the extended term predecessor of <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:44-3. In 1981, while serving his habitual offender sentence, Reldan pled guilty to conspiracy to escape from state prison and possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose. He was sentenced to a second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>extended term following his guilty plea. <em>Reldan, supra, </em>231 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 236, 555 A.2d 653.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">On appeal, Reldan argued, among other things, that the second extended term was improper, citing <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-5(a)(2). We rejected that argument and held that <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:44-5(a)(2) \u201chas no application ... where extended terms are imposed by two different courts for different offenses at proceedings separated by a span of nine years\u201d because \u201cthe statute speaks only to situations where multiple sentences are imposed at the same proceeding for more than one offense.\u201d <em>Reldan, supra, </em>231 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 238, 555 A.2d 653.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">Pennington aptly notes, however, that our opinion in <em>Reldan </em>did not discuss <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-5(b)(l), the statutory provision at issue here. In addition, the escape for which Reldan was sentenced occurred while he was serving the first extended term. In our opinion, we noted that the offenses took place nine years apart. <em>Ibid. </em>Consequently, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-5(b) would not have applied because Reldan was not being sentenced for an offense that occurred prior to the sentence he was serving. By its terms, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-5(b)(l) only applies when the sentencing offense occurred prior to the offense for which the existing extended term is being served.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">In <em>Williams, </em>the defendant pled guilty to burglary and was initially sentenced as a persistent offender to an extended term in accordance with the plea agreement. He then filed a motion for reconsideration of the sentence, and was resentenced to probation conditioned on his completion of a substance abuse program. A year later, the defendant was arrested for burglary and theft, and was eventually sentenced to an extended term on those charges. His probation on the earlier offense was revoked. At sentencing, the judge reimposed the original extended term.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">On appeal, Williams argued, among other things, that <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:44-5(a)(2) prohibited the reimposition of the extended term, because he had just received an extended term for the new offenses. We rejected that argument, relying on <em>Reldan:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>The statute \u201cspeaks only to situations where multiple sentences are imposed at the same proceeding for more than one offense.\u201d <em>State v. Reldan, </em>231 <em>N.J.Super. </em>232, 238 [555 A.2d 653] (App.Div.1989). It does not apply to a situation in which two different courts have imposed extended terms for different offenses. <em>Ibid. </em>Defendant was sentenced on the new convictions and violation of probation at a separate time in a separate proceeding by two different courts. Extended terms could legally be imposed at each separate proceeding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-5\"><em>[Williams, supra, </em>299 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 272-73, 690 A.2d 1082.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">Pennington correctly observes that our opinion in <em>Williams </em>does not specifically cite or discuss <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-5(b)(l), and that it relies on our opinion in <em>Reldan, </em>which is not applicable to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-5(b)(l). Consequently, the precedential value of- <em>Williams </em>is minimal.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">There is little helpful legislative history with respect to <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:44-5(b)(l) in New Jersey. However, the text of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44 \u2014 5(b)(1) mirrors \u00a7 7.06(2)(a) of the <em>Model Penal Code </em>(Code). <em>See </em>I <em>Final Report of the New Jersey Criminal Law Revision Commission </em>\u00a7 2C:44-5, at 158 (1971).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> When a Title 2C provision is modeled on the Code, it is appropriate to look at the Code and its commentaries in seeking to interpret the intent of the statutory language. <em>State v. D.A., </em>191 <em>N.J. </em>158, 167, 923 A.2d 217 (2007); <em>MacDougall v. Weichert </em>144 <em>N.J. </em>380, 395, 677 A.2d 162 (1996) (\u201cThe source of our statute is the [Code]. That history is highly relevant in determining the legislative intent underlying our parallel enactments.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-8\">Section 7.06(2)(a) of the Code, which governs sentences imposed at different times, provides, in pertinent part, as follows: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>Section 7.06(l)(d), like <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-5(a)(2), provides that \u201cnot more than one sentence for an extended term shall be imposed.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>When a defendant who has previously been sentenced to imprisonment is subsequently sentenced to another term for a crime committed prior to the former sentence, other than a crime committed while in custody:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-10\">(a) the multiple sentences imposed shall so far as possible conform to Subsection (1) of this Section____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b585-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>The Code\u2019s \u201cExplanatory Note\u201d to \u00a7 7.06 explains its purpose.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-6\">Subsection (2) is grounded on the principle that the timing of trials or the number of trials for different offenses should not affect the limitations established by Subsection (1). Thus, if a defendant has committed two offenses, the sentencing limitations established by this section will apply if he is tried separately for the two crimes as well as if he is tried for both offenses at the same time. Subsection (2) also sets forth other principles to control the situation in which the defendant is being sentenced for an offense that was committed prior to the imposition of another sentence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-7\"><em>[Model Penal Code and Commentaries: </em>Part I \u00a7 7.06, at 270-71 (1985).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">The \u201cComment\u201d section of the Code expands upon the text of the \u201cExplanatory Note,\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-9\">3. <em>Sentences of Imprisonment Imposed at Different Times. </em>Subsection (2) is based on the premise that the timing of the trials for multiple charges against a defendant should have as little bearing on the extent of his exposure to consecutive sentences as possible. In other words, the limits on consecutive sentences should apply in like manner when the defendant is tried and sentenced in the same proceeding for multiple offenses and when he is tried separately for each of them, either by the same court or by another comparable court within the same state.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-10\">The paradigm at which the subsection is aimed occurs when a defendant is tried, convicted and sentenced to imprisonment, and subsequently is tried and convicted of a second offense committed prior to the imposition of the first sentence. In that event there is no basis for enlarging the limits on consecutive sentences that would otherwise be applicable had the two offenses been tried at the same time. <em>[Model Penal Code and Commentaries: </em>Part I, Comment to \u00a7 7.06, at 277-78 (1985) (footnotes omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b585-11\">Although New Jersey did not adopt the Code\u2019s proposed limitation on consecutive sentences, \u00a7 7.06(l)(b) and (c), referred to in the Comment, the Legislature did include the parallel prohibition on more than one extended term found in \u00a7 7.06(l)(d). <em>See N.J.S.A </em>2C:44-5(a)(2). Consequently, the reasoning of the Comment also applies to the issue of multiple extended terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-12\">A plain reading of the statutory language and the available legislative history supports Pennington\u2019s argument that the imposition of a second extended term under the circumstances of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>case was not permitted. As the Supreme Court held in <em>State v. Froland, </em>193 <em>N.J. </em>186, 194, 936 A.2d 947 (2007), \u201c[i]n criminal cases, interpretation of a statute is restricted by the rule of lenity which requires us to strictly construe penal statutes in favor of a criminal defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">We conclude, therefore, that the trial judge imposed an illegal sentence subject to correction in a PCR proceeding. <em>R. </em>3:22-2(c). We vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">Pennington\u2019s remaining arguments concern his assertion that his trial attorney was so ineffective that he was deprived of his constitutional right to counsel, as well as an argument that one of the State\u2019s identification witnesses gave unreliable testimony. Having reviewed those arguments in light of the record before us, we find them to be without merit and not warranting discussion in a written opinion. <em>R. </em>2:11 \u2014 3(e)(2). The claim concerning the \u25a0witness\u2019s reliability could have been raised on direct appeal and is barred. <em>R. </em>3:22-4. We make the following brief comment with respect to the ineffective assistance of counsel issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">An evidentiary hearing is only required to resolve issues of fact when there has been a prima facie showing of ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>Preciose, supra, </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>at 462-64, 609 A.2d 1280. We agree with the PCR judge\u2019s conclusion that no such showing was made in this case. The judge carefully considered Pennington\u2019s arguments and reviewed the transcript of the Wade<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> hearing, correctly determining that there was no ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-8\">Affirmed in part; sentence vacated and remanded for resentencing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b580-9\"> An earlier trial had resulted in a hung jury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b584-11\"> The commentary on <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-5(b) in the Commission\u2019s Report is very brief and does not address the specific issue before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b585-13\"> The \u201cExplanatory Note\u201d makes reference to Code provisions, such as a limit on consecutive terms, not adopted in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-5(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b586-9\"> <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wade, </em>388 <em>U.S. </em>218, 87 <em>S.Ct. </em>1926, 18 L.Ed.2d 1149 (1967).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
