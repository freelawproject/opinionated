PMA Ins. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number><em>Co., </em>394 <em>N.J.Super. 605, </em>607-08, 928 A.2d 54 (App.Div.2007). The plaintiff sought those damages because the insurer had failed to timely comply with orders of the compensation court authorizing certain medical procedures. <em>Ibid. </em>Our affirmance was based on the plaintiffs failure to exhaust available administrative remedies in the compensation court. <em>Id. </em>at 608, 613-14, 928 A.2d 54. However, we expressed our concern about the plaintiffs allegations of delay and recalcitrance by the carrier, <em>id. </em>at 616, 928 A.2d 54, and we questioned the adequacy of the enforcement provisions in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (Act), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-1 to -128, and the corresponding regulations. <em>Id. </em>at 614, 928 A.2d 54. We noted that the then-applicable regulation, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>12:235-3.14(b) (repealed 2009), was \u201csilent as to whether traditional tort damages for pain and suffering caused by a respondent\u2019s recalcitrance in complying with an order are available under this provision, notwithstanding the Act\u2019s general exclusivity barring common-law claims.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 612 n. 1, 928 A.2d 54. Because of our disposition on exhaustion grounds, we declined to address \u201cthat hypothetical issue regarding the scope of a \u2018compensatory levy or sanction\u2019 \u201d under that regulation. <em>Ibid. </em>Finally, we invited the Legislature and the Division of Workers\u2019 Compensation (Division) to consider whether any reform of the statutory and regulatory enforcement measures might be appropriate. <em>Id. </em>at 614, 928 A.2d 54.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">The case now before us is similar in all material respects to <em>Flick, </em>except that administrative remedies were exhausted here in the compensation court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In this case, the Law Division judge dismissed plaintiffs complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. <em>See R. </em>4:6-2(e). We are therefore called upon to decide the issue reserved in <em>Flick.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>In the aftermath of <em>Flick, </em>decided July 17, 2007, and in response to a series of newspaper articles in April 2008 suggesting the need for reform in situations such as this, the Legislature amended the Act effective October 1, 2008. The Division adopted corresponding regulations effective October 5, 2009. The new provisions confer greater authority, including contempt powers, on compensation judges and, in our view, make clear that Superior Court remedies are limited to summary enforcement proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">This action was filed in the Law Division on April 15, 2009, after the Act was amended. The Law Division judge rendered his decision and issued his order of dismissal on October 19, 2009, which post-dated the amendatory regulations as well. The amendatory provisions control the disposition of this case. <em>See, e.g., Pizzo Mantin Group v. Twp. of Randolph, </em>137 <em>N.J. </em>216, 235, 645 A.2d 89 (1994) (holding that under the time-of-decision rule, courts ordinarily apply the statute in effect at the time of the decision in order to effectuate current policy).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">We hold that the remedies currently contained in the Act and regulations, which are enforceable in Superior Court under <em>Rule </em>4:67-6, constitute the sole relief available to an aggrieved claimant arising out of willful noncompliance by an employer or its insurer with an order of the compensation court. The remedies were designed by the Legislature to provide adequate disincentives to such conduct and to empower compensation judges with sufficient authority to sanction the conduct. The legislative scheme in this regard is within the Act\u2019s exclusivity framework, thus precluding a common law action against the employer or its insurer. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">Plaintiff suffered a work-related injury on May 14, 1995. His employer\u2019s insurer, defendant ACE USA, stipulated that plaintiffs injuries were compensable under the Act. Defendant contends it has paid plaintiff in excess of $567,000 in compensation benefits since 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>On September 12, 2007, the compensation judge ordered defendant to pay certain outstanding medical and related expenses as required by prior orders<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and awarded plaintiffs counsel a $2000 fee for services rendered in procuring such enforcement relief. Defendant persisted in non-payment. On October 29, 2007, the compensation judge conducted a hearing on plaintiffs motion to compel compliance with the orders. Defendant\u2019s counsel conceded that defendant knew of its obligations under the orders but had not complied.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">The compensation judge found that defendant\u2019s defalcation was blatantly willful and clearly intentional. However, he felt constrained because he lacked contempt powers. Although he acknowledged that he had \u201csome ability to impose fines [and] sanctions,\u201d he did not do so, although plaintiff requested it. It was his \u201cposition ... that any attempted imposition to fine, etcetera, beyond awarding [plaintiffs counsel] a [c]ounsel fee, would be arguably beyond [the compensation judge\u2019s] authority, and also, to some extent compromise the relief [plaintiffs counsel] would be seeking in the Superior Court.\u201d He awarded plaintiffs counsel a fee of $1500, and referred him to the Superior Court for further relief. He concluded by stating: \u201cThis is, in my judgment, the complete exhaustion of administrative remedies. There is no further relief, viable relief that you could seek or obtain from this Division.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">Plaintiff then filed his Superior Court complaint. He alleged that defendant wantonly refused to comply with orders of the compensation court, resulting in a delay or denial of necessary medical treatment and causing him pain and suffering and a worsening of his medical condition. He asserted that the compensation judge had \u201creferred\u201d defendant\u2019s refusal to comply with his orders to the Superior Court for further action, pursuant to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>then-existing regulation, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>12:235-3.14(a)5. He sought compensatory and punitive damages, plus costs, interest, and attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">The trial court granted defendant\u2019s <em>Rule </em>4:6-2(e) motion. He found that, unlike in <em>Flick, </em>plaintiff had exhausted his administrative remedies and the matter was properly before the Superior Court. He further found, however, that amendments to the enforcement scheme enacted after <em>Flick </em>made it clear that the remedies specified in the Act and regulations were exclusive, no common law claim was permitted, and the role of the Superior Court was limited to enforcement proceedings. He therefore dismissed the complaint with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">The compensation court proceedings concluded on October 29, 2007. Until that time, the enforcement provisions of the Act and regulations were the same as we described in <em>Flick. </em>If an employer or its carrier unreasonably delayed or refused to pay temporary disability benefits, it could be assessed \u201can additional amount of 25% of the amounts then due plus any reasonable legal fees incurred by the petitioner as a result of and in relation to such delays or refusals.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>34:15-28.1. The dispute here, however, does not pertain to temporary disability benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">By former regulation, for an \u201cunreasonable failure to comply\u201d \u2022with any order, the compensation judge was authorized to impose various remedies, which included ordering attorney\u2019s fees and costs, and \u201crefer[ring] matters for other administrative, civil or criminal proceedings.\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>12:235-3.14(a)4, 5 (repealed 2009). The regulation also allowed a party or the compensation court on its own motion to move for enforcement of an order. <em>N.J.AC. </em>12:235-3.14(b) (repealed 2009). Under this provision, the noncompliant party was required to explain \u201cthe reasons for any noncompliance and manner and time periods to ensure compliance with the order at issue.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Then, before taking any action under paragraph (a), the compensation judge would hold a hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>to determine \u201cthe appropriateness of the action and the reasonableness of any compensatory levy or sanction.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Finally, \u201ccompensatory levy and sanction\u201d was defined as \u201can amount awarded to compensate for actual losses, including, but not limited to, interest on monies due a party as well as attorney\u2019s fees and administrative costs to the Division.\u201d <em>N.J.AC. </em>12:235-3.14(d) (repealed 2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">In <em>Flick, </em>we concluded that the provisions of <em>N.J.S.A </em>34:15-28.1 and the then-existing <em>N.J.AC. </em>12:235-3.14 (including those we have described here and others) were plainly designed to assure compliance with orders of compensation judges. <em>Flick, supra, </em>394 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 613, 928 A.2d 54. We held that, after exhausting those remedies, an aggrieved party could bring an order to show cause in the Law Division under <em>Rule </em>4:67-6, <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">In the case before us, the compensation judge referred the matter to the Superior Court, pursuant to <em>N.J.AC. </em>12:235-3.14(a)5 (repealed 2009), for \u201cother ... civil ... proceedings.\u201d Plaintiff argues that the authorized nature of those proceedings includes a common law tort action. We need not squarely address the issue framed in that manner because <em>N.J.AC. </em>12:235-3.14 has been repealed and replaced by a new section, <em>N.J.AC. </em>12:235-3.16, effective October 5, 2009. 41 <em>N.J.R. </em>3807(a) (October 5, 2009). The new regulation followed the legislative enactment of new enforcement provisions in the Act, codified at <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-28.2 to -28.4. <em>L. </em>2008, <em>c. </em>93 \u00a7\u00a7 1-3, effective October 1, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">That new section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-9\">If any employer, insurer, claimant, or counsel to the employer, insurer, or claimant, or other party to a claim for compensation, fails to comply with any order of a judge of compensation or with the requirements of any statute or regulation regarding workers\u2019 compensation, a judge of compensation may, in addition to any other remedies provided by law:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-10\">a. Impose costs, simple interest on any moneys due, an additional assessment not to exceed 25% of moneys due for unreasonable payment delay, and reasonable legal fees, to enforce the order, statute or regulation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-11\">b. Impose additional fines and other penalties on parties or counsel in an amount not exceeding $5,000 for unreasonable delay, with the proceeds of the penalties paid into the Second Injury Fund;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>c. Close proofs, dismiss a claim or suppress a defense as to any party;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-5\">d. Exclude evidence or witnesses;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-6\">e. <em>Hold a separate hearing on any issue of contempt and, upon a finding of contempt by the judge of compensation, the successful party or the judge of compensation may file a motion with the Superior Court for enforcement of those contempt proceedings; </em>and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-7\">f. Take other actions deemed appropriate by the judge of compensation with respect to the claim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-8\"><em>[N.J.S.A </em>34:15-28.2 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b114-9\">Subsection (e) of this new section conferred contempt authority on compensation judges and specified that, upon a finding of contempt, a motion for enforcement could be made in Superior Court. The legislative history leading up to the formulation of subsection (e) illuminates its intended meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-10\">After <em>Flick </em>was decided in April 2007, a series of newspaper articles published in the <em>Star-Ledger </em>in April 2008 concluded that the workers\u2019 compensation system was in need of reform. <em>See, e.g., </em>Dunstan McNichol &amp; John P. Martin, <em>Politics Tangle a Safety Net for Workers Hurt on Job, Star-Ledger </em>(Newark, N.J.), Apr. 7, 2008, at News, 1; John P. Martin, <em>This Wasn\u2019t Supposed to Happen, Star-Ledger </em>(Newark, N.J.), Apr. 7, 2008, at News, 5. The newspaper series concluded that, among other reforms that were needed, \u201c[cjomp judges must have better tools to discipline insurance companies or others who deliberately drag out cases or payments. Judges now can do little more than add interest payments to an insurer\u2019s bill. Fines and other sanctions are needed to bring recalcitrant payers into line.\u201d Editorial, <em>Jersey Must Do Belter By Injured Workers, Star-Ledger </em>(Newark, N.J.), Apr. 13, 2008, at Perspective, 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-11\">On May 5, 2008, the Senate Labor Committee conducted a hearing on the subject. <em>See </em>Senate Labor Committee, <em>Examination of the Workers\u2019 Compensation System in New Jersey </em>(May 5, 2008). A common theme throughout the testimony of numerous interested parties was that compensation judges needed more enforcement sanctions available to them for circumstances in which an insurance carrier flouts an order and refuses to pay for ordered treatment. See, <em>e.g., id. </em>at 6x (recommendation of David <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>J. Socolow, Commissioner, New Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce Development, that \u201c[t]he Legislature should amend the statute to provide additional statutory sanctions and enforcement powers for workers\u2019 compensation judges\u201d); <em>id. </em>at 45x-46x (recommendation of Association of Trial Lawyers of America-New Jersey that compensation judges should be given the ability to levy sanctions, prejudgment interest, and counsel fees against insurance carriers who \u201ceho[o]se to disregard the order of a compensation judge\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">Shortly after the hearing, the Senate introduced a bill on May 22, 2008, in which the section that would eventually become subsection (e) of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-28.2 provided that a compensation judge may:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-7\">Refer matters to other administrative, civil or criminal proceedings including referrals to the Superior Court for contempt proceedings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-9\"><em>\\ Senate No. 191S </em>(May 22, 2008)4</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b115-10\">This provision was similar to the then-existing enforcement regulation that authorized compensation judges to \u201c[rjefer matters for other administrative, civil or criminal proceedings.\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>12:235-3.14(a)5 (repealed 2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-11\">However, on June 5, 2008, the Senate Labor Committee amended the introduced language in subsection (e) to instead \u201cauthorize a judge of compensation to hold a separate hearing on any issue of contempt, and upon a finding of contempt, the successful party may file a motion with Superior Court for enforcement.\u201d <em>Senate Labor Committee Statement to Senate No. 1913 </em>(June 5, 2008) at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-12\">The following week, the Assembly introduced a bill which tracked the original Senate bill (without the amendments), including the language authorizing a compensation judge to \u201c[rjefer\u201d the matter for other administrative, civil, or criminal proceedings. <em>Assembly No. 2966 </em>(June 12, 2008) at 2. However, the Assembly Labor Committee explicitly rejected this broad language and replaced it with the narrower language currently contained in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-28.2. That language does not authorize a compensa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>tion judge to \u201crefer\u201d the matter for \u201cother civil proceedings.\u201d It merely authorizes him or her to hold a hearing on the issue of contempt, after which the compensation judge or aggrieved party \u201cmay file a motion with the Superior Court for enforcement of those contempt proceedings.\u201d The Assembly Labor Committee stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-5\"><em>This amendment is more specific to the issue of contempt and replaces broader language regarding the judge\u2019s authority to refer matters to other tribunals. [Assembly Labor Committee Statement to Assembly No. 2966 </em>(June 12, 2008) at 1 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">This series of events makes clear that the Legislature added N.J.S.A 34:15-28.2 to the statutory scheme to address circumstances in which insurance carriers flout compensation judges\u2019 orders and refuse to pay for employees\u2019 medical expenses. It is equally clear that in considering the remedy for this problem, the Legislature considered and expressly rejected the broader remedy of referring the matter to the Superior Court for other administrative, civil, and criminal proceedings. Instead, the Legislature replaced that proposed provision with the enacted provision relating to contempt proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">Amendments made to a proposed enactment during the legislative process often carry great weight in determining the meaning of the provision in its final form. <em>See Henry v. N.J. Dep\u2019t of Human Servs., </em>204 <em>N.J. </em>320, 347, 9 A.3d 882 (2010) (Rabner, C.J., concurring) (finding instructive of the Framers\u2019 intent that early drafts of the 1947 Constitution included language limiting temporary assignments to the Supreme Court to situations in which it was \u201cnecessary to make the quorum,\u201d but later drafts, and the Constitution as it was adopted, rejected that language and replaced it with the broader \u201c[w]hen necessary\u201d language, and commenting that once the rejected language was removed, \u201c[w]e cannot add it back.\u201d) The amendments and accompanying statements make clear that the Legislature consciously chose to limit Superior Court proceedings to enforcement. To permit the cause of action plaintiff seeks would constitute a judicial undoing of a considered legislative judgment, something courts should avoid. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number><em>See Voss v. Tranquilino, </em>413 <em>N.J.Super. </em>82, 90-92, 992 A.2d 829 (App.Div.), <em>leave to appeal granted, </em>202 <em>N.J. </em>343, 997 A.2d 229 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">Authorizing surcharges of up to twenty-five percent and fines of up to $5000 were new provisions the Legislature added to incentivize insurers to timely comply with compensation court orders. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-28.2a, b (L. 2008, c. 93, \u00a7 1). Another new provision provided insurers with further incentive to comply with compensation court orders: \u201cAny fine, penalty, assessment, or cost, imposed on an insurer pursuant to <em>[N.J.S.A </em>34:15-28.2], shall not be included in the expense base of that insurer for the purpose of determining rates.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>34:15-28.3 <em>(L. </em>2008, c. 93, \u00a7 2). After enactment of the statutory amendments, the Division<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> proposed new rules on May 4, 2009, which would repeal <em>N.J.AC. </em>12:235-3.14, and replace it with a new enforcement section, to be designated as <em>N.J.AC. </em>12:235-3.16. 41 <em>N.J.R. </em>1935(a) (May 4, 2009). The new enforcement rule, which was later adopted in the form proposed, <em>see </em>41 <em>N.J.R. </em>3807(a) (Oct. 5, 2009), conformed to the provisions of the newly enacted <em>N.J.S.A </em>34:15-28.2. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-7\">\u00a7 12:235-3.16 Enforcement</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-8\">(a) A party may, by written motion pursuant to <em>N.J.AC. </em>12:235-3.5(a) and (b), move against an employer, insurance carrier, petitioner, case attorney or any other party to a claim petition for enforcement of any court order or for the enforcement of the requirements of the workers\u2019 compensation statute or rules.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-9\">(b) The motion under (a) above shall identify the order, statute or regulation sought to be enforced.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-10\">(c) The party against whom the motion has been brought shall file a written response to the motion within 14 calendar days of the notice of motion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-11\">(d) The response under (c) above shall include the reasons for any noncompliance and the manner and time period to ensure compliance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-12\">(e) Any time after the 14-day period to respond under (c) above has elapsed and on notice to the parties, the judge shall hold a hearing on the motion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>(f) A judge on his or her own motion may at any time, upon notice to the affected parties, move to enforce a court order or to enforce the requirements of the workers\u2019 compensation statute or rules.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-6\">(g) Prior to ruling on a motion under (f) above, the judge shall provide the parties an opportunity to respond to the motion and to be heard on the record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-7\">(h) Upon a finding by a judge of noncompliance with a court order or the workers\u2019 compensation statute or rules, the judge, in addition to any other remedy provided by law, may take any or all of the following actions:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-8\">1.

This replaced the more general provision in the old rule authorizing compensation judges to \u201c[rjefer matters for other administrative, civil or criminal proceedings.\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>12:235-3.14(a)5 (repealed 2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-9\">Under the new framework, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-28.2 and <em>N.J.A.C. </em>12:235-3.16 specifically address plaintiffs situation, namely one in which an insurer \u201cfails to comply with any order of a judge of compensation.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-28.2. Specific and clearly defined procedures and remedies are now provided. They were developed by the Legislature and Division to address and reform shortcomings in the previous scheme. The general provision authorizing referral to Superior Court for \u201cother ... civil ... proceedings,\u201d which could conceivably be interpreted as authorizing a common law action, has been eliminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-10\">These changes persuade us that the beefed-up enforcement measures were intended by the Legislature to fall within the Act\u2019s exclusivity scheme. In considering and enacting the reform measures, the Legislature was undoubtedly aware of the concerns we had recently expressed in <em>Flick. </em>If authorization of a common law action was intended as a remedy for an insurer\u2019s willful noncompliance with a compensation court order, we think the Legislature would have said so. Instead, it authorized stricter sanctions and prescribed a clear line of authority for enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-11\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b119-12\">We reject plaintiffs argument that willful noncompliance with an order should fall within the intentional wrong exception of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number><em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-8. That exception has been consistently applied only to conduct by an employer or co-employee in the workplace. <em>See, e.g., Laidlow v. Hariton Mach. Co., Inc., </em>170 <em>N.J. </em>602, 606, 790 A.2d 884 (2002) (\u201cThe described limitations involve intentional wrongful conduct committed either by the worker or the employer.\u201d); <em>Millison v. E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co., </em>101 <em>N.J. </em>161, 184-86, 501 A.2d 505 (1985) (holding that intentional \"wrong exception applies to co-employees and employer); <em>Dunlevy v. Kemper Ins. Group, </em>220 <em>N.J.Super. </em>464, 469-70, 532 A.2d 754 (App.Div. 1987) <em>(\u201cMillison </em>dealt with an intentional tort of an employer in the workplace. It did not deal with the intentional wrongful conduct of a compensation carrier in refusing to provide required benefits. We find the distinction controlling.\u201d), <em>certif. denied, </em>110 <em>N.J. </em>176, 540 A.2d 174 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"Aql\">It is even clearer now that the remedy for such conduct is expressly provided for in the statute and regulation. To allow an action such as this would run contrary to the foundational principle underlying the Act, which immunizes defendants from common law claims in exchange for adjudication of claims under a comprehensive regulatory framework. <em>Wilson v. Fault, </em>27 <em>N.J. </em>105, 116, 141 A.2d 768 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">Our conclusion comports with the majority rule. 6 Arthur Larson, <em>Larson\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Law, </em>\u00a7 104.05[3] at 104-30 (2009). Most courts have reasoned that \u201cthe presence in the statute of an administrative penalty for the very conduct on which the tort suit is based ... evidences a legislative intent that the remedy for delay in payments, even vexatious delay, shall remain within the system in the form of some kind of penalty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 104-35 (footnote omitted). Although some claimants might not be fully compensated by penalties that in some cases may be inadequate, \u201cthis does not, within the overall nature of the compensation concept, make them invalid. At most, it may be cause to apply to the legislature for a more suitable penalty level.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>(footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>Finally, we find unpersuasive plaintiffs reliance on <em>Rothfuss v. Bakers Mutual Insurance Co. of New York, </em>107 <em>N.J.Super. </em>189, 257 A.2d 733 (App.Div.1969). That case is limited to allowing common law actions in circumstances in which the insurer undertook to treat an injured employee with a doctor employed by the insurer and then allegedly failed to provide appropriate medical care. <em>Id. </em>at 192-93, 257 A.2d 733; <em>see also Mager v. United Hospitals of Newark, </em>88 <em>N.J.Super. </em>421, 426-28, 212 A.2d 664 (App.Div.1965) (holding that compensation carrier operating its own clinic for treatment of injured workers was subject to a common law action for alleged negligent treatment), <em>affd o.b., </em>46 <em>N.J. </em>398, 217 A.2d 325 (1966). The rationale underlying the decisions in <em>Rothfuss </em>and <em>Mager </em>was \u201cthat the jurisdiction of our law courts was posited on the carriers\u2019 undertaking to treat, a duty not imposed on them by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.\u201d <em>Cortes v. Interboro Mut. Indem. Ins. Co., </em>232 <em>N.J.Super. </em>519, 523, 557 A.2d 1019 (App.Div.1988), <em>affd o.b., </em>115 <em>N.J. </em>190, 557 A.2d 1001 (1989). That is not the case here. Defendant did not undertake to treat plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">In support of his reliance on <em>Rothfuss, </em>plaintiff points to the Supreme Court\u2019s recent comment, referring to <em>Rothfuss, </em>\u201cthat an insurer\u2019s affirmative acts can cause injuries that are not compensable solely within the workers\u2019 compensation scheme.\u201d <em>Basil v. Wolf, </em>193 <em>N.J. </em>38, 59 n. 10, 935 A.2d 1154 (2007). We are unpersuaded by plaintiffs interpretation of that comment. The comment does not expand the narrow holding in <em>Rothfuss. </em>To the contrary, <em>Basil </em>restates and reinforces the holdings of <em>Rothfuss </em>and <em>Mager.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">We therefore affirm the order dismissing plaintiffs complaint. Although the dismissal was with prejudice, plaintiff is not precluded from returning to the compensation court to seek the enumerated remedies authorized under the new regime, and, if a new Superior Court action is thereafter necessary for enforcement, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>such action would not be precluded. Therefore, our affirmance is without prejudice to plaintiffs right to move in a subsequent Superior Court action, should that be necessary, for enforcement of any contempt order that might be issued in the compensation court.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b109-7\"> Like the Law Division judge, we accept for purposes of our analysis that administrative remedies were exhausted. As we will discuss, the judge of compensation found willful disobedience to his orders and those of his predecessor in the case, considered (although he did not impose) available sanctions, noted his lack of contempt powers, declared that administrative remedies had been exhausted, and referred the petitioner to the Superior Court for further relief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b111-7\"> The outstanding items were for plaintiff's treating psychiatrist ($3850), prescription drags ($108.82), rehabilitation facility ($575), and transportation service (because plaintiff was not allowed to drive due to his injuries) ($7562).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b117-13\"> The rules are actually promulgated by the New Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce Development, Division of Workers' Compensation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
