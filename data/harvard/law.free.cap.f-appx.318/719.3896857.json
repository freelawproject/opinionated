McWILLIAMS, Senior Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b743-27\">On December 9, 2005, Jose Chacon-Ras-con, the defendant, was convicted in Curry County, New Mexico on his plea of guilty to a state charge of Criminal Sexual Penetration in the Fourth Degree (a felony), and he was ultimately given a deferred sentence. Shortly thereafter, on January 10, 2006, he was deported to Mexico. On April 24, 2007, defendant was charged in a one-count indictment filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Mexico with reentry into the United States, after having been deported from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>the United States, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1326(a) and (b). On June 6, 2007, the defendant pled guilty to the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">The presentence report set defendant\u2019s base offense level at 8, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(a) and then increased his base offense level by 16 levels, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A), because he previously had been convicted of a crime of violence resulting in his deportation. He then received a three-level reduction in his offense level for acceptance of responsibility, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, resulting in a total offense level of 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">In connection with his criminal history category, defendant received one point for his conviction of criminal sexual penetration of a child, which resulted in his deportation, and received two additional criminal history points, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Al.l(d), because he had reentered the United States while under a criminal justice sentence. With a criminal history category of II and an offense level of 21, his guideline range was imprisonment for 41 to 51 months. The defendant asked for a downward variance, which the district court granted when it sentenced defendant to imprisonment for 33 months. The defendant appeals the sentence thus imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">On appeal, the defendant raised three issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-7\">(1) the district court erred in calculating defendant\u2019s criminal history category;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-8\">(2) the district court erred in calculating defendant\u2019s offense level, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-9\">(3) the district court\u2019s sentence of 33 months imprisonment was \u201cunreasonable\u201d under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b744-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-11\">The defendant first argues that the district court committed \u201cplain error\u201d in calculating defendant\u2019s criminal history category by adding two points under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Al.l(d) for committing the instant offense (re-entry) \u201cwhile under a criminal justice sentence.\u201d In this Court, the defendant argues that a \u201cdeferred sentence\u201d is not a \u201ccriminal justice sentence.\u201d Counsel in his reply brief concedes that this particular issue was not raised in the district court, and that therefore the issue cannot be raised on appeal unless it is an error that was \u201cplain,\u201d meaning clear or obvious and affecting substantial rights. If these requirements are met, we, in our discretion, may correct the error \u201cif it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. A.B., </em>529 F.3d 1275, 1280 (10th Cir.2008). This Court has held that deferred sentences under Oklahoma, Colorado and Utah State law constitute criminal justice sentences under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Al.l(d). <em>See United States v. Vela, </em>992 F.2d 1116 (10th Cir.1993); <em>United States v. Norman, </em>129 F.3d 1393, 1401 (10th Cir.1997); <em>United States v. Gorman, </em>312 F.3d 1159, 1164 (10th Cir.2002). In sum, our study of the present record leads us to conclude that the defendant has failed to show the district court committed \u201cplain error.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b744-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-14\">As stated, the district court followed the recommendation of the presentence report that defendant\u2019s base offense level of 8 be raised by 16 levels pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). In the district court, and in this Court, counsel argues that defendant\u2019s conviction in the New Mexico state court for criminal sexual penetration of a child did not constitute a \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d and that, in fact, the sexual penetration was consensual and not forcible.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) states that statutory rape is a crime of violence. Counsel concedes that the guideline so reads, but argues that such is inconsistent with 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16 which reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ayz\">\u00a7 16. Crime of violence defined</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AKA1\">The term \u201ccrime of violence\u201d means\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-5\">(a) an offense that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-6\">(b) any other offense that is a felony and that, by its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">On appeal, counsel agree that U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A) is \u201cbroader\u201d than 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16. In that connection, the United States on appeal cites, <em>inter alia, United States v. Hernandez-Castillo, </em>449 F.3d 1127 (10th Cir.2006), where we held that the defendant\u2019s prior California conviction for unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor constituted a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d for purposes of the Sentencing Guideline applicable to sentencing for illegal re-entry. Counsel also cites <em>United States v. Parson, </em>955 F.2d 858, 867 (3d Cir.1992) where that Circuit spoke as follows: \u201cWe therefore hold that even if the definition of \u2018crime of violence\u2019 in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2 is broader than that in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16, the Commission\u2019s definition is permissible under the authorizing statute.\u201d In short, the district court did not err in adding 16 levels to defendant\u2019s base offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b745-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-9\">Counsel also asserts on appeal that defendant\u2019s sentence of imprisonment for 33 months, which was <em>below </em>the guideline range of imprisonment of 41 to 51 months, was \u201cunreasonable.\u201d We disagree. The sentence imposed was in our view most reasonable. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007); <em>United States v. Kristl, </em>437 F.3d 1050 (10th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b745-11\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b743-19\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
