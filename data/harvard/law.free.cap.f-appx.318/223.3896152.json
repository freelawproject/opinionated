Barrows, a native and citizen of Jamaica, petitions for review of an order of the Board of Immigration Appeals (Board) dismissing his appeal from the Immigration Judge\u2019s decision, which found him removable as an alien convicted of a crime of domestic violence and as an aggravated felon and ordered him removed to Jamaica.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-23\">Before this court, Barrows contends that the Board erred in finding that he was convicted of an aggravated felony. Based on our review of the record, we agree that the 2003 conviction under Virginia law for domestic assault and battery against a family member amounted to a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d and was therefore an aggravated felony. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F) (2006); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(a) (2006). The Board therefore properly upheld the charge of removability on this ground. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) (2006); <em>In re: Barrows </em>(B.I.A. Apr. 22, 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-24\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>fore the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
