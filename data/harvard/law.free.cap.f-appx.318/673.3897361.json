McKAY, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b698-21\">Defendant pled guilty to illegal re-entry subsequent to a felony conviction for possession of cocaine. Despite the prosecution\u2019s recommendation for a sentence within the twenty-four to thirty-month Guidelines range, the trial court departed upward to a sixty-month sentence. In support of its decision the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ay3-dedup-0\">[Djefendant has illegally re-entered the United States eight times. Defendant has used over thirty aliases, including one on his Kansas driver\u2019s license, sixteen different dates of birth and five different social security numbers. Any or all of these factors justify an upward variance. After all, a defendant with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>only one prior felony conviction who has not tried to hide his identity and who has illegally re-entered the country only once can be convicted of violating 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) and (b)(1). This case clearly \u201cstands out\u201d from the offense conduct generally even without consider-' ing defendant\u2019s eight DUI convictions and at least six DUI arrests.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">(R. Vol. I, Doc. 15 at 3.)</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">On appeal, Defendant raises three claims of error. He claims (1) the court violated the relatedness principle by considering the DUI convictions and arrests, (2) the court erroneously double-counted the DUI convictions, and (3) the sentence created an unwarranted disparity between defendants committing the crime of illegal re-entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">We \u201creview all sentences\u2014whether inside, just outside, or significantly outside the Guidelines range\u2014under a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). First, we assess whether the district court committed any \u201csignificant procedural error, such as ... failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 597. If the sentence is \u201cprocedurally sound,\u201d we assess whether it is substantively reasonable, considering \u201cthe totality of the circumstances, including the extent of any variance from the Guidelines range,\u201d and giving \u201cdue deference to the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on a whole, justify the extent of the variance.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b699-8\">Defendant\u2019s challenge based on the relatedness principle relies primarily on his interpretation of <em>United States v. Allen, </em>488 F.3d 1244 (10th Cir.2007). However, we conclude that <em>Allen </em>does not preclude the district court\u2019s use of unrelated criminal activity to decide on a reasonable sentence under \u00a7 3553. We find no abuse of discretion in the court\u2019s consideration of Defendant\u2019s unrelated criminal conduct in deciding to vary upward from the Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-10\">We also conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it used the DUI convictions both to calculate Defendant\u2019s criminal history and in support of the upward variance. We have held that sentencing courts have discretion when considering a variance under \u00a7 3553 to consider facts already accounted for in the advisory Guidelines range. <em>See United States v. Alapizco-Valenzuela, </em>546 F.3d 1208, 1222 (10th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Smart, </em>518 F.3d 800, 808-09 (10th Cir. 2008). Moreover, the court here did not rely exclusively on the DUI convictions to support the upward variance but also relied on Defendant\u2019s repeated re-entry convictions and his demonstrated failure to be reformed by his prior sentences, as well as his use of aliases and false identifying information.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-11\">We conclude that the sentence in the case does not violate concerns regarding unwarranted disparity in sentencing. While the Guidelines give the district court \u201ca measure of national practice,\u201d \u201cthe district court will have \u2018greater familiarity with the individual case and the individual defendant before him than the Commission.\u2019 \u201d <em>Smart, </em>518 F.3d at 808 (quoting <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 574, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007)). In this case, the court properly used the Guidelines as a starting point to avoid disparity, then adjusted the sentence to reflect the facts of the case and Defendant\u2019s individual history and characteristics. Any disparity is justified by the record facts: Defendant\u2019s use of aliases and false identifying information, his numerous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>DUI arrests and convictions, and his repeated illegal re-entries.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b698-14\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel.
