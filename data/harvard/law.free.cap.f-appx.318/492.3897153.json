We affirm. Because the parties are familiar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>with the history of this case, we need not recount it here.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">The district court properly denied relief on petitioner\u2019s claim that the in-court identification was conducted in violation of <em>Neil v. Biggers, </em>409 U.S. 188, 198, 93 S.Ct. 375, 34 L.Ed.2d 401 (1972). Clearly established Supreme Court law allows identifications taken at impermissibly suggestive photograph lineups to be admitted so long as the identification is reliable. <em>Manson v. Brathwaite, </em>432 U.S. 98, 105, 97 S.Ct. 2243, 53 L.Ed.2d 140 (1977) (citing <em>Biggers, </em>409 U.S. at 199, 93 S.Ct. 375).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">Under <em>Watkins v. Sowders, </em>449 U.S. 341, 349, 101 S.Ct. 654, 66 L.Ed.2d 549 (1981), the determination of whether an identification is reliable is a question that may properly be left for the jury. As the Supreme Court observed, \u201c[ijndeed, as the cases before us demonstrate, the <em>only </em>duty of a jury in cases in which identification evidence has been admitted will often be to assess the reliability of that evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 347-48, 101 S.Ct. 654. The Court decided that, so long as counsel is afforded an opportunity to cast \u201cdoubts as to the accuracy of the identification\u2014including reference to both any suggestibility in the identification procedure and any countervailing testimony such as alibi,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 348, 101 S.Ct. 654, there could be no constitutional claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">Richardson\u2019s counsel was given every opportunity to challenge the identification evidence. He was fully able to argue that suggestive police procedures led to an inaccurate identification, and in fact he did so. The trial court\u2019s decision to leave the ultimate question of the identification\u2019s reliability to the jury thus was not \u201ccontrary to, or involving] an unreasonable application of ... clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d \u00a7 2254(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b517-11\">We grant petitioner\u2019s motion to broaden the certificate of appealability to include petitioner\u2019s claim the state court\u2019s rejection of his challenge under <em>Batson v. Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 79, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69 (1986) constituted an unreasonable application of controlling Supreme Court precedent. <em>See Miller-El v. Cock-rell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 338, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003) (reciting standard for grant of a certificate of appealability). Although we have granted the motion for an expanded certificate of appealability, we deny the claim on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-12\">Because the trial court failed to undertake any inquiry into direct or circumstantial evidence of the prosecutor\u2019s intent in striking the juror, and because the California Court of Appeals also did not engage in the required analysis, we review <em>de novo </em>the trial court\u2019s <em>Batson </em>ruling. <em>Green v. LaMarque, </em>532 F.3d 1028, 1031 (9th Cir.2008). Because the state court record included the voir dire evidence relevant to our analysis, we apply 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(2), rather than 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1). We will grant federal habeas relief if the trial court\u2019s decision to deny the <em>Batson </em>motion was \u201can unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d <em>Kesser v. Cambra, </em>465 F.3d 351, 358 (9th Cir.2006) (en banc) (quoting 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(2)).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-15\">The prosecutor\u2019s assertion that he dismissed Juror 52, the venire\u2019s only African-American, based on her age and \u201cnaivety\u201d is consistent with his strikes of other jurors. Indeed, he struck almost all the jurors similar in age and background to Juror 52. Therefore, based on our <em>de novo </em>review of the record, we cannot say <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>that the explanation of the strike based on age and perceived naivety was pretextual. Given this determination, we cannot conclude that the state court unreasonably determined the facts or unreasonably applied <em>Batson.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b516-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
