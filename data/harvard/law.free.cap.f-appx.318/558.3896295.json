We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reopen, <em>Malty v. Ashcroft, </em>381 F.3d 942, 945 (9th Cir.2004), and review de novo due process claims, <em>Ram v. INS, </em>243 F.3d 510, 516 (9th Cir.2001). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Hapidudin\u2019s motion to reopen as untimely where Hapidudin filed the motion more than a year after the BIA\u2019s final order of removal, <em>see 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2) (motion to reopen must be filed within ninety days of final order of removal), and failed to submit new and material evidence of changed country conditions in Indonesia that would excuse the late filing, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii); see <em>also Malty, </em>381 F.3d at 945 (requiring circumstances to have changed sufficiently that a petitioner who previously did not have a legitimate claim for asylum now has a well-founded fear of future persecution). Moreover, Hapidudin has not shown a due process violation. <em>See Lata v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 1241, 1246 (9th Cir.2000) (requiring error for a due process violation).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b583-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
