Gilkey, an inmate appearing pro se, seeks to appeal from the district court\u2019s denial of his federal habeas petition, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. Mr. Gilkey challenged the Kansas Parole Board\u2019s (KPB) decision to deny him parole and to delay further parole consideration for three years. The district court also dismissed other claims without prejudice. He contends that the denial was based on improper considerations: his history of substance abuse and his disability which requires a back operation. According to Mr. Gilkey, the denial violates his rights under the Constitution and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12101-12213. Mr. Gilkey sought state habeas relief, which the state courts denied. <em>Gilkey v. Kan. Parole Bd., </em>147 P.3d 1096 (Kan.Ct.App.2006) (Table).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">A challenge to the execution of a state sentence is considered under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. <em>See Montez v. McKinna, </em>208 F.3d 862, 865 (10th Cir.2000). Under \u00a7 2241, a writ of habeas corpus may extend to a prisoner \u201cin custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(c)(3). To appeal from the denial of the petition, Mr. Gilkey needs a certificate of appeala-bility (COA). 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(A). This requires that he make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). He must demonstrate that the issues raised are debatable among jurists, or that jurists could conclude that the questions deserve further proceedings. <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 327, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-8\">After considering the district court\u2019s resolution, and giving due deference to the state court\u2019s resolution of the federal constitutional claims, <em>Henderson v. Scott, </em>260 F.3d 1213, 1215 (10th Cir.2001), we conclude that the resolution of Mr. Gilkey\u2019s claims is not reasonably debatable. For substantially the reasons set forth in the district court\u2019s order, 1 R. Doc. 18,</p>\n<p id=\"b645-10\">We DENY a COA and DISMISS the appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
