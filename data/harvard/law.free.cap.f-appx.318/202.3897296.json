On appeal, McKenzie asserts that the district court failed to conduct a proper analysis of his motion. Because the district court\u2019s order contains insufficient reasoning to permit appellate review, we vacate and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">At sentencing, McKenzie\u2019s Guidelines range was calculated to be 262 to 827 months in prison. The district court sentenced him to 327 months imprisonment. In June 2008, McKenzie, through appointed counsel, filed the instant motion to reduce his sentence. McKenzie stated that application of the amendments would lower his Guidelines range to 210-262 months in prison. McKenzie requested a sentence of 210 months, and the Government consented.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">The district court did not hold a hearing. Instead, the court granted the motion in part and entered a sentence of 262 months. The order contained no reasoning or explanation. The court merely stated that the \u201cdefendant is subject to a reduced sentencing range.... Therefore, it is hereby ORDERED that the previously imposed sentence of 327 months is reduced to 262 months.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">We review the district court\u2019s decision to modify a sentence under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>See United States v. Legree, </em>205 F.3d 724, 727 (4th Cir.2000). In deciding whether to grant a motion to reduce sentence based upon a Guideline amendment, the district court must \u201cconsider[ ] the factors set forth in [18 U.S.C.] section 3553(a) [ (2006) ] to the extent that they are applicable\u201d and must determine whether \u201creduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). A district court need not engage in a \u201critualistic incantation\u201d in order to establish its consideration of the motion. Instead, it is presumed that the court considered the \u00a7 3553 factors, as well as the issues presented for determination, when issuing its ruling. <em>Legree, </em>205 F.3d at 728-29.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-10\">We find that the circumstances of the instant case overcome the presumption that the court properly considered the statutory factors and other issues relevant to the motion, and we conclude that, under the specific facts of this case, the district court\u2019s failure, to provide reasoning was an abuse of discretion. First, unlike in <em>Legree, </em>in this case, the Government agreed to the sentencing reduction sought by McKenzie. The parties jointly recommended a sentence over five years shorter than the one McKenzie received. The court did not hold a hearing and gave no reasons for granting the motion in part, but rejecting the parties\u2019 recommendation of the appropriate sentence. While the parties\u2019 agreement was not binding on the district court, the court\u2019s reasons for rejecting the agreement are simply absent.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-11\">Second, the motion in <em>Legree </em>was denied; here, the motion was granted in part. One could logically conclude from the decision in <em>Legree </em>that the reasons underlying the original sentence remained the district court\u2019s reasoning. <em>See </em>205 F.3d at 729. Here, however, the court clearly determined that the \u00a7 3553 factors-merited a partial reduction in sentence; however, the court provided no insight into its thought process as to the appropriate reduction. Any determination by this court as to the basis of the district court\u2019s decision would be purely speculative.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-12\">Finally, while in both <em>Legree </em>and the instant case, the judge presiding over the \u00a7 3582 motion was the same judge as at the original sentence, the elapsed time in this case was significantly longer. In <em>Le</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number><em>gree, </em>the time between the two events was approximately three years, <em>see id. </em>at 726-27, while in this case over nine years elapsed between sentencing and the \u00a7 3582 motion. It is not clear whether the judge, in considering McKenzie\u2019s \u00a7 3582 motion, recalled factors presented at the original sentencing. The original sentencing transcript is not included in the record on appeal, so it is also unclear whether the court was even able to review it or how thoroughly McKenzie\u2019s background was initially examined.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s order and remand the case for the district court to provide adequate reasoning for its decision. We express no opinion on the length of' an appropriate sentence. We decline to address the merits of McKenzie\u2019s remaining claims on appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
