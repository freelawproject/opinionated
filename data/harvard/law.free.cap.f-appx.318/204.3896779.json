While Jackson filed a notice of appeal with the district court in which he sought to pursue his direct appeal, there was no new criminal judgment from which he could timely appeal, thereby preventing review of his conviction and sentence by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-12\">Furthermore, while the district court denied relief as to the remainder of Jackson\u2019s \u00a7 2255 claims and dismissed them with prejudice, we note that those claims could otherwise be raised in Jackson\u2019s reinstated direct appeal. When a prisoner has wrongly been denied his right to a direct appeal, he should not be forced to raise all possible claims against his criminal judgment in his first \u00a7 2255 motion and thereby \u201cmake the substantive objections to his conviction and sentence that his lawyer would have made for him on direct appeal.\u201d <em>See In re Goddard, </em>170 F.3d 435, 437 (4th Cir.1999). Therefore, we grant Jackson\u2019s motion for a certificate of appealability, modify the district court\u2019s dismissal of Jackson\u2019s remaining claims to be without prejudice, and affirm the dismissal as modified. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the eourt and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-14\">\n<em>AFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
