INS, </em>23 F.3d 1557, 1559 (9th Cir.1994). We review de novo the agency\u2019s construction of the definition of \u201creasonable cause,\u201d but that interpretation is entitled to considerable deference. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b543-30\">A review of the record does not support a claim that the BIA abused its discretion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>by denying petitioner\u2019s motion to reopen for failure to establish reasonable cause for his absence from the December 11, 1990 deportation hearing. At two prior appearances before the Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d), petitioner was warned that he must return for the next scheduled hearing, with or without an attorney. Based on the advice of a notario, petitioner did not attend the December 11,1990 hearing, which resulted in the entry of an in. absentia deportation order.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">Given the IJ\u2019s warnings, it appears unreasonable for petitioner to rely on the advice of a notario. In these circumstances, the BIA could conclude that petitioner did not establish \u201creasonable cause\u201d for his failure to appear, and did not abuse its discretion by denying the motion to reopen. Accordingly, respondent\u2019s motion for summary disposition is granted because petitioner has failed to raise a substantial issue to warrant further argument. <em>See United States v. Hooton, </em>693 F.2d 857, 858 (9th Cir.1982) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">All other pending motions are denied as moot. The temporary stay of deportation confirmed by Ninth Circuit General Order 6.4(c) shall continue in effect until issuance of the mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b543-31\"> This disposition is riot appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
