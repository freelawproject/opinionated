Mukasey, </em>516 F.3d 770, 773 (9th Cir.2008), <em>Lara-Torres v. Ashcroft, </em>383 F.3d 968, 972 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">We have reviewed the response to the court\u2019s October 29, 2008 order to show cause, and we dismiss this petition for review for lack of jurisdiction with respect to the denial of the motion to reopen. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i); <em>Fernandez v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 592, 601 (9th Cir.2006) (concluding that the court lacks jurisdiction to review the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 denial of motion to reopen for failure to establish a prima facie case if a prior adverse discretionary decision was made by the agency).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">We deny the petition for review with \u25a0 respect to the BIA\u2019s denial of the motion to reconsider. An alien who is subject to a final order of removal is limited to filing one motion to reconsider removal proceedings. A motion reconsider must be filed within 30 days of the entry of the final order of removal. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). Because petitioners\u2019 motion to reconsider was filed beyond the deadlines, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying petitioners\u2019 motion as untimely. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">Finally, we note that petitioners have overstayed voluntary departure and are statutorily ineligible for discretionary relief. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229c(d)(l); <em>Granados-Oseguera v. Mukasey, </em>546 F.3d 1011 (9th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-11\">All other pending motions are denied as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-12\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b537-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
