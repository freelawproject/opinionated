Finding Floyd eligible for relief under Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines, the district court reduced Floyd\u2019s sentence, but denied Floyd\u2019s request to reduce his sentence below the low end of the amended Guidelines range. Floyd first argues the district court erred by concluding it could not sentence him below his amended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>Guidelines range. Floyd also contends the district court erred by refusing to reconsider its application of a two-point enhancement for possession of a dangerous weapon\u2019 in connection with a drug trafficking crime, which was applied in his original sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">Floyd argues the district court erred by concluding it lacked authority, under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), to reduce Floyd\u2019s sentence below the low end of his amended Guidelines range. He contends <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) renders the Guidelines advisory, even in the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) context. Moreover, he maintains any policy statement directly conflicting with <em>Booker </em>is invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-6\">We review a district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Brown, </em>332 F.3d 1341, 1343 (11th Cir.2003). We, however, review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions as to the scope of its authority under the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>United States v. White, </em>305 F.3d 1264, 1267 (11th Cir.2002). We also review questions of statutory interpretation <em>de novo. United States v. Maupin, </em>520 F.3d 1304, 1306 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b894-7\">\u201cA district court generally cannot modify a term of imprisonment once imposed.\u201d <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008). One statutory exception to this general rule is 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), which allows a district court to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence when a change in the Guidelines reduces his applicable Guidelines range. Any such reduction, however, must be consistent with the applicable Guidelines\u2019 policy statements. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The applicable policy statement here is U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, which pertains to Guidelines amendments that may be applied retroactively, including Amendment 706. Section 1B1.10 provides, in cases in which the defendant received a within-Guidelines sentence at his original sentencing, a reduction pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) shall not be less than the minimum of the amended Guidelines range. \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(2)(A)-(B) &amp; cmt. n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-9\">This Court recently addressed whether <em>Booker </em>prohibits Congress or the Sentencing Commission from limiting the discretion of a district court in reducing a sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1190-91 (11th Cir.2009). Concluding <em>Booker </em>does not apply to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings, we held a district court is bound by the limitations on its discretion imposed by \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and the applicable policy statements by the Sentencing Commission. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b894-11\">The applicable policy statement here, \u00a7 1B1.10, and its commentary preclude a district court from reducing a defendant\u2019s sentence below the amended Guidelines range if the defendant\u2019s original sentence fell within the then-applicable Guidelines range. Floyd\u2019s original sentence was within the Guidelines range. Accordingly, the district court was not permitted under \u00a7 1B1.10 to sentence Floyd to a term below the amended Guidelines range. Based upon our holding in <em>Melvin, </em>Floyd\u2019s argument that the district court erred by concluding it lacked authority to reduce his sentence below the amended Guidelines range is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-13\">Floyd next contends the district court erred by refusing to reconsider its application of a two-point enhancement for possession of a dangerous weapon in connection with a drug trafficking crime. He argues the district court was required to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>order a new PSI and sentence him consistently with <em>Booker. </em>Specifically, Floyd maintains his sentence was unconstitutional under <em>Booker </em>because it was based on a fact found by the court under the preponderance of the evidence standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">This Court reviews <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions as to the scope of its authority under the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>White, </em>305 F.3d at 1267. As we discussed earlier, <em>Booker </em>does not apply to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings. <em>See Melvin, </em>556 F.3d at 1190-91. Furthermore, the applicable policy statement provides that a district court, in recalculating a defendant\u2019s sentence under the amended Guidelines, may not reconsider any Guidelines application decisions aside from those affected by the Guidelines amendment. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1B1.10(b)(l). For these reasons, the district court here did not err by concluding it did not have the authority to reconsider Floyd\u2019s two-point enhancement for possession of a dangerous weapon in connection with a drug trafficking crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
