The Government concedes, based on this court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Constante, </em>544 F.3d 584, 585 (5th Cir.2008), that Hopkins is entitled to be resentenced because it cannot show that his prior burglary convictions were crimes of violence warranting the career offender adjustment under U.S.S.G. 4B1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\"><em>Constante </em>held that a generic burglary is a violent felony under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) if the applicable statute requires \u201can unlawful or unprivileged entry into, or remaining in, a building or other structure, with intent to commit a crime.\u201d 544 F.3d at 585. Section 924(e) defines a violent felony to include a \u201cburglary,\u201d which offense is also defined as a crime of violence under \u00a7 4B1.1. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). Thus, the discussion in <em>Constante </em>is instructive.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">This court has determined that a burglary conviction under Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 30.02(a)(3) is not a generic burglary offense because it does not require an intent to commit another crime at the t\u00fane of entry. <em>See Constante, </em>544 F.3d at 585-86. The Government introduced the indictments and judgments in Hopkins\u2019 burglary conviction cases. As the Government concedes, these pleadings reflect that two of Hopkins\u2019s three burglary convictions arose under \u00a7 30.02(a)(3). The Government concedes under <em>Constante </em>that there is not sufficient evidence in the record to support the career offender adjustment. The Government does not argue that the offenses are crimes of violence under the residual clause of \u00a7 4B1.2. In light of the Government\u2019s concession, the sentence is vacated, and the case is remanded for a recalculation of the guidelines range and resentenc-ing.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-11\">Hopkins argues that he received the ineffective assistance of counsel because his counsel failed to subpoena or investigate defense witnesses for the hearing on the motion to suppress and did not seek a continuance when the witnesses were unavailable.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-12\">The issue of ineffective assistance was not raised in the district court and was not addressed. Because the record does not provide sufficient detail to make a fair evaluation of the ineffective assistance claim that Hopkins argues on appeal, we decline to consider the claims. <em>See United States v. Gulley, </em>526 F.3d 809, 821 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 159, 172 L.Ed.2d 116 (2008). Hopkins is not precluded from raising the merits of his ineffective assistance claims in a timely 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-15\">Hopkins\u2019s conviction is AFFIRMED. His sentence is VACATED, and the case is REMANDED to the district court for re-sentencing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b322-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has . determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
