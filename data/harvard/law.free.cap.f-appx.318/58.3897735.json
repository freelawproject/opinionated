We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-12\">Costigan pleaded guilty to bank robbery and to possession of a firearm during the commission of a crime of violence. In 2004, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York sentenced him to 123 months of imprisonment, ordered him to pay $103,118 in restitution upon release from prison, and imposed \u201ca special assessment of $200 which shall be due immediately.\u201d In January 2005, Cos-tigan signed a contract under the Bureau of Prison\u2019s (\u201cBOP\u201d) Inmate Financial Responsibility Program (\u201cIFRP\u201d), whereby he agreed to pay $50 each quarter to satisfy his financial obligations. Costigan signed another IFRP contract in March 2007, agreeing to pay $25 per quarter. Nevertheless, Costigan failed to make any payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-14\">In July 2007, Costigan filed a petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, claiming that the District Court impermissibly delegated to the BOP the task of establishing the schedule by which he would pay the special assessment imposed as part of his sentence. He argued that, because the BOP was not authorized to set the payment schedule, it improperly imposed \u201csanctions\u201d based on his failure to participate in the IFRP. The case was referred to a Magistrate Judge, who concluded that, by setting the special assessment as due immediately, the District Court did not im-permissibly delegate authority. Over Cos-tigan\u2019s objections, the District Court adopted the Magistrate Judge\u2019s Report and Recommendation and dismissed the \u00a7 2241 petition. Costigan timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-15\">Because Costigan\u2019s challenge goes directly to execution of the sentence <em>(i.e., </em>whether the BOP has authority to set the terms of the payment of the special assessment), the claim falls squarely within those properly raised in a petition for habeas corpus under \u00a7 2241. <em>See Coady v. Vaughn, </em>251 F.3d 480, 485 (3d Cir.2001). In support of his claim, Costigan relies on <em>United States v. Coates, </em>178 F.3d 681, 685 (3d Cir.1999), where we held that, under the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act (\u201cMVRA\u201d), the sentencing court cannot delegate the scheduling of restitution payments to a probation officer or to the BOP because the fixing of restitution payments is an exclusively judicial act. More recently, we held that a sentencing court imper-missibly delegates its authority when it orders immediate payment of restitution with knowledge that the defendant could not make immediate payment in full. <em>See United States v. Corley, </em>500 F.3d 210, 226-27 (3d Cir.2007). These holdings are based on 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664(f)(2), which pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>vides that, \u201cin consideration of\u2019 the defendant\u2019s financial resources, the sentencing court \u201cshall ... specify in the restitution order the manner in which, and the schedule according to which, the restitution is to be paid.\u201d <em>See Coates, </em>178 F.3d at 684 (\u201c[s]ince the MVRA mandates that district courts schedule restitution payments after taking into account the defendant\u2019s financial resources, the District Court\u2019s failure to do so here constitutes plain error.\u201d); <em>Corley, </em>500 F.3d at 227.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">Importantly, however, Costigan is not challenging that portion of the judgment pertaining to restitution. Instead, his claim is based exclusively on the sentencing court\u2019s failure to set a schedule for paying the $200 special assessment. The special assessment was mandatory under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3013(a)(2)(A), and was to be \u201ccollected in the manner that fines are collected in criminal cases.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3013(b). The Attorney General is responsible for the collection of criminal fines. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3612(c). The time and method of payment is governed by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3572(d), which provides that \u201c[a] person sentenced to pay a fine or other monetary penalty, including restitution, shall make such payment immediately, unless ... the court provides for payment on a date certain or in installments.\u201d But, unlike with restitution, there is no provision mandating that the order for a fine or special assessment include a payment schedule in consideration of the defendant\u2019s economic circumstances. Therefore, because the sentencing court was not required to set a payment schedule for the special assessment, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s order denying Costigan\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
