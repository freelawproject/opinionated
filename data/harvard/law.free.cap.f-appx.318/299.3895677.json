Fills argues on appeal that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to support the jury\u2019s verdict and that her within-guidelines sentence of 22 months was unreasonable and greater than necessary to accomplish the goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-22\">Upon review of the evidence presented at trial in a light most favorable to the jury verdict, we find that a rational trier of fact could have found that the Government proved all essential elements of bribery of a public official beyond a reasonable doubt. \u00a7 201(b)(2)(C); <em>see United States v. Lankford, </em>196 F.3d 563, 575 (5th Cir.1999). We may not reject the jury\u2019s credibility determinations unless the testimony was incredible or patently unbelievable. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>520 F.3d 414, 420 (5th Cir.2008). The testimony that Fills challenges was consistent with the testimony of other witnesses, Fills\u2019s earlier statement, and the exhibits. It was not incredible or patently unbelievable. Accordingly, Fills\u2019s sufficiency argument fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-23\">Fills\u2019s 22-month sentence was properly calculated, within the applicable guidelines range of 21 to 27 months, and well below the statutory maximum of 15 years. <em>See </em>\u00a7 201(b). Fills has not overcome the presumption that her within-guidelines sentence was reasonable, <em>see United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006), or shown that the district court abused its discretion under <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 596-97, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). No error has been shown, plain or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-24\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b323-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
