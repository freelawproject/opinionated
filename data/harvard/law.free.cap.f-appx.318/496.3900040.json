Gonzales, </em>494 F.3d 1170 (9th Cir.2007). Accordingly, respondent\u2019s unopposed motion for summary disposition is granted because the questions raised by this petition for review are so insubstantial as not to require further argument. <em>See United States v. Hooton, </em>693 F.2d 857, 858 (9th Cir.1982) (per curiam) (stating standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-9\">To the extent that petitioner seeks an extension of the voluntary departure period, that request is denied because the court lacks the authority to provide such relief. <em>See Zazueta-Carrillo v. Ashcroft, </em>322 F.3d 1166, 1172 (9th Cir.2003). Moreover, the request was made after the departure period had expired. <em>See Garcia v. Ashcroft, </em>368 F.3d 1157 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-10\">All other pending motions are denied as moot. The temporary stay of removal confirmed by Ninth Circuit General Order 6.4(c) shall continue in effect until issuance of the mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-13\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b521-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
