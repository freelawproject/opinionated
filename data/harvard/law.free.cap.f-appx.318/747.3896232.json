Tolbert appeals the district court\u2019s denial of her motion for a new trial in her employment discrimination lawsuit, filed pursuant to the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 623. Tolbert, who was then a 61-year-old budget analyst, alleged that her former employer, Jefferson County Commission, violated the ADEA by disciplining and ultimately discharging her, despite her compliance with the County\u2019s policies. In this appeal, Tolbert argues that the district court abused its discretion by not granting her motion for a new trial because she presented evidence of age discrimination that was insufficiently or entirely unrebut-ted at trial by the County. Finding no abuse of discretion, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for a new trial pursuant to Fed. R.Civ.P. 59 for an abuse of discretion. <em>Lambert v. Fulton County, </em>253 F.3d 588, 595 (11th Cir.2001). Our broad deference is warranted because \u201cthe trial court[ ] [had] first-hand experience of the witnesses, their demeanor, and a context of the trial. This level of deference is particularly appropriate where a new trial is denied and the jury\u2019s verdict is left undisturbed.\u201d <em>Rosenfield v. Wellington Leisure Prods., Inc., </em>827 F.2d 1493, 1498 (11th Cir.1987) (citation omitted). \u201c[N]ew trials should not be granted on evidentiary grounds unless, at a minimum, the verdict is against the great\u2014not merely the greater\u2014weight of the evidence.\u201d <em>Lipphardt v. Durango Steakhouse of Brandon, Inc., </em>267 F.3d 1183, 1186 (11th Cir.2001) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b772-8\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Tolbert\u2019s motion for a new trial. The ADEA makes it \u201cunlawful for an employer ... to discharge any individual or otherwise discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual\u2019s age!\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 623(a)(1). \u201cWhen a plaintiff alleges disparate treatment, liability depends on whether the protected trait (under the ADEA, age) actually motivated the employer\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Reeves v. Sand-erson Plumbing Prods., Inc., </em>530 U.S. 133, 141, 120 S.Ct. 2097, 2105, 147 L.Ed.2d 105 (2000) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cAlthough intermediate evidentiary burdens shift back and forth [when the plaintiff establishes a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination], \u2018[t]he ultimate burden of persuading the trier of fact that the defendant intentionally discriminated against the plaintiff remains at all times with the plaintiff.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 143, 120 S.Ct. at 2106 (quoting <em>Texas Dep\u2019t of Comm. Affairs v. Burdine, </em>450 U.S. 248, 253, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 1094, 67 L.Ed.2d 207 (1981)) (alteration in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b772-10\">Tolbert argues that the district court abused its discretion by not granting her motion for a new trial because her evidence of age discrimination was insufficiently or entirely unrebutted at trial by the County. Tolbert contends that the County\u2019s proffered reasons for discharging her were pretextual because she would have had to violate county policies to comply with her supervisor\u2019s instructions. She further contends that she would have been evaluated negatively if she had disobeyed those regulations. She points to her own trial testimony to establish the County\u2019s discriminatory animus.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-11\">The County responds that the district court did not abuse its discretion because the verdict was not against the great weight of the evidence. The County recognizes that Tolbert established a <em>prima </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number><em>facie </em>case of age discrimination. But the County notes that it met its burden of producing legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for her dismissal, namely her noncompliance and unprofessional conduct. Thus, Tolbert bore the burden of persuading the jury that her discharge was the direct result of intentional age discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">The County argues that the jury\u2019s verdict was not against the great weight of the evidence because Tolbert\u2019s only proof of intentional age discrimination was her own uncorroborated testimony. The County also notes that the jury observed the witnesses\u2019 demeanor, including Tol-bert\u2019s unresponsive and elusive answers to questions posed at trial. Thus, the County argues that we should defer to the jury\u2019s credibility determinations and weighing of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">We agree with the County. In reaching its verdict, the jury was free to weigh the evidence and make credibility determinations. All of Tolbert\u2019s evidence tending to establish discriminatory animus was contradicted by the testimony of several witnesses that tended to discredit her evidence. Therefore, the jury\u2019s verdict for the County was not against the great weight of the evidence, and the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Tolbert\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
