We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we vacate and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">Warner contends that the district court erred by not applying a two-level downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a). We conclude that the district court did not err because Warner\u2019s statements during his plea and sentencing colloquies, as well as the timing of his admissions, were inconsistent with acceptance of responsibility. <em>See United States v. Scrivener, </em>189 F.3d 944, 948-49 (9th Cir.1999); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, cmt. n. 1(h) (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-9\">Warner also contends that his sentence is unreasonable because the district court ignored his history and characteristics when fashioning the sentence. We conclude that there was no procedural error and that Warner\u2019s sentence is substantively reasonable. <em>See United States v. Carty, </em>520 F.3d 984, 995-96 (9th Cir.2008) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-10\">Finally, Warner contends that a special condition of supervised release prohibiting him from filing any claim for a refund of taxes after filing initial returns should be vacated because it is not reasonably related to his offense, and it is it not narrowly tailored to be the least restrictive as possible. We conclude that this condition as written is not reasonably related to the sentencing factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See United States v. Betts, </em>511 F.3d 872, 876-81 (9th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-13\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b479-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
