Goff argues that the district court <footnotemark>1</footnotemark>erred in (1) finding him to be a career offender and (2) failing to grant a variance. Having jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, this court affirms.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-23\">Goff contends that he is not a career offender under United States Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 4B1.1. He maintains that one of his prior convictions was expunged by an Order of Dismissal from an Arkansas state court in 1992. The district court properly found that the state Order dismissed only a petition to revoke parole, as evidenced by the fact that Goffs parole was later revoked in 1993. Thus, Goff qualified for career offender status. <em>See United States v. Walterman, </em>343 F.3d 938, 940 (8th Cir.2003) (\u201cGenerally, a district court\u2019s determination of whether a defendant\u2019s prior convictions qualify him as a career offender is factual, and thus we review for clear error.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-24\">The district court also did not err in sentencing within the Guidelines. <em>See United States v. Robinson, </em>516 F.3d 716, 717 (8th Cir.2008) (sentencing within the Guidelines range is accorded a presumption of substantive reasonableness on appeal). The district court adequately considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, noting the seriousness of the offense and the possibility of recidivism. <em>See United States v. Washington, </em>515 F.3d 861, 867 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 2493, 171 L.Ed.2d 781 (2008) (this court gives due deference to the analysis of \u00a7 3553(a) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>factors by the district court, unless it fails to consider a relevant factor, gives significant weight to an improper or irrelevant factor, or commits a clear error of judgment). The district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to vary from the Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b463-19\">. The Honorable James M. Moody, United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Arkansas.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
