We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">King presents no evidence of juror misconduct that supports finding a violation of clearly established federal law in denying him access to the jurors\u2019 personal information. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1); <em>Grotemeyer v. Hickman, </em>393 F.3d 871 (9th Cir.2004). That a juror brought his \u201coutside experience to bear on the case is not sufficient to make [his] alleged statements violate\u201d King\u2019s right of confrontation or right to an impartial jury. <em>Grotemeyer, </em>393 F.3d at 878-79.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">Moreover, King does not present colorable evidence of extrinsic influence so that an evidentiary hearing or other action, such as disclosure of jurors\u2019 personal information, was required under <em>Remmer v. United States, </em>347 U.S. 227, 74 S.Ct. 450, 98 L.Ed. 654 (1954). <em>Grotemeyer, </em>393 F.3d at 880-81. King attempts to distinguish <em>Grotemeyer, </em>but that case involved the denial of an evidentiary hearing under similar circumstances. <em>See Grotemeyer, </em>at 875-76; 880-81. A juror\u2019s provision of a scientific explanation for his statements during deliberations is not colorable evidence of misconduct and does not create a right to a hearing or other action under <em>Remmer. See id. </em>at 880-81. Thus, this case is unlike those King relies on, where allegations of juror misconduct necessitated a hearing. <em>See Remmer, </em>347 U.S. at 228-30, 74 S.Ct. 450; <em>Smith v. Phillips, </em>455 U.S. 209, 212-214, 102 S.Ct. 940, 71 L.Ed.2d 78 (1982); <em>Dyer v. Calderon, </em>151 F.3d 970, 972-73 (9th Cir.1998) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-9\">We do not address King\u2019s contention that the state court made unreasonable determinations of fact under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(2) in finding that an evidentiary issue was not material at trial and was a matter of common knowledge. Even if King were to prevail on these issues, the juror conduct at issue would not be misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b567-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
