Fuchs, federal prisoner # 29679-177, appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for release pending the disposition of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion. Release pending disposition of a Section 2255 motion will be granted only when the prisoner has raised a substantial constitutional claim upon which he has a high probability of success, and also when extraordinary or exceptional circumstances exist which make the grant of bail necessary to make the postconviction remedy effective. <em>Calley v. Callaway, </em>496 F.2d 701, 702 (5th Cir.1974). Regardless of the merits of Fuchs\u2019s claims, upon which the district court has not yet ruled, Fuchs has not pointed to any \u201cextraordinary or exceptional circumstances\u201d that necessitate his release to make the postconviction remedy effective. The district court did not err by denying Fuchs\u2019s motion for release. Fuchs\u2019s motions to expedite this appeal, to supplement the appeal, and to require timely action in the district court are denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-23\">AFFIRMED, MOTION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b335-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
