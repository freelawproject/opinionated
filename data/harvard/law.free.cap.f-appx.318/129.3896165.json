His attorney has moved to withdraw his representation under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). We grant the motion to withdraw and affirm the District Court\u2019s order.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">Because we write solely for the parties, we recount only the facts necessary to our decision. On July 16, 2003, Mercado pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to distribute more than five kilograms of cocaine and more than 50 grams of cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 and 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) <em>&amp; </em>(b)(1)(A), and to one count of possession of a firearm during a drug trafficking offense, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A)(i). The controlled substances involved in the first count, 35 kilograms of powder cocaine and 118 grams of cocaine base, amounted to an equivalent of 9,360 kilograms of marijuana, meriting a base offense level of 34 and a suggested range of 135 to 168 months\u2019 imprisonment under the Sentencing Guidelines in effect at that time. The possession of a firearm during a drug trafficking offense carried with it a mandatory five-year consecutive minimum sentence. When combined, the suggested Guidelines range was 195 to 228 months\u2019 imprisonment. However, the District Court departed from this range in light of the Government\u2019s motion for a reduction based on Mercado\u2019s \u201csubstantial assistance.\u201d Ultimately, Mercado was sentenced in January 2004 to 124 months\u2019 imprisonment and five years\u2019 supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-9\">On November 1, 2007 and May 1, 2008, amendments to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 became effective, generally reducing the base offense levels for most quantities of crack cocaine by two levels. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. app. C, amends. 706, 715. Because these amendments applied retroactively, Mercado was potentially eligible for a reduction of his sentence. <em>See </em>U.S. S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(c). In July 2008, he moved to have his sentence reduced under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The District Court denied the motion, holding that Mercado was ineligible for the two-level reduction in his offense level because granting that reduction would result in his receiving a lower offense level than he would if he were just sentenced for the powder cocaine offense. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 n. 10(D)(ii)(II).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-10\">Despite his attorney\u2019s determination that there existed no nonfrivolous issues for appeal, Mercado insisted on filing an appeal, in effect challenging the District Court\u2019s denial of his motion to reduce his sentence. His counsel filed an <em>Anders </em>brief, seeking to withdraw his representation. Mercado declined to file a <em>pro se </em>brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-11\">Our rules provide that \u201c[wjhere, upon review of the district court record, trial counsel is persuaded that the appeal presents no issue of even arguable merit, counsel may file a motion to withdraw and supporting brief pursuant to <em>Anders.\u201d </em>3d Cir. LAR 109.2(a). If we concur with trial counsel\u2019s assessment, then we \u201cwill grant [the] <em>Anders </em>motion, and dispose of the appeal without appointing new counsel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, our \u201cinquiry when counsel submits an <em>Anders </em>brief is ... twofold: (1) whether counsel adequately fulfilled the rule\u2019s requirements; and (2) whether an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>independent review of the record presents any nonfrivolous issues.\u201d <em>United States v. Youla, </em>241 F.3d 296, 300 (3d Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">We are satisfied that trial counsel\u2019s <em>Anders </em>brief is adequate and that there are no nonfrivolous grounds on which to challenge the District Court\u2019s denial of Mercado\u2019s motion for sentence reduction. We agree with his counsel that the District Court correctly held that Mercado was ineligible for a sentence reduction under the retroactive amendments to the crack cocaine Sentencing Guidelines.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">While the amendments to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 lower the base offense level for most offenses involving crack cocaine, they do not apply here. Note 10 to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 provides in pertinent part that the two-level reduction \u201cshall not apply\u201d when \u201cthe [two]-level reduction results in a combined offense level that is less than the combined offense level that would apply ... if the offense involved only the other controlled substance(s) (ie., the controlled substances other than the cocaine base).\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 n. 10(D)(ii)(II). The base offense level for only the \u201cother substance\u201d in this case\u2014five kilograms of powder cocaine\u2014was 34. That was the same base offense level as Mercado received for the combined offenses. Thus, the District Court correctly held that Mercado\u2019s sentence was ineligible for a two-level reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">Counsel adequately fulfilled the requirements of <em>Anders. </em>Because our independent review of the record fails to reveal any nonfrivolous grounds for appeal, we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw and affirm the judgment entered by the District Court. In addition, we certify that the issues presented in this appeal lack legal merit and thus that counsel is not required to file a petition for writ of certio-rari with the Supreme Court. 3d Cir. LAR 109.2(b).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b154-7\">. The District Court had jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231.
