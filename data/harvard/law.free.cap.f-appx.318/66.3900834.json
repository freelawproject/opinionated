We will vacate the District Court\u2019s judgment and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">The procedural history of this matter is straightforward. In August 2007, Aruanno submitted a civil rights complaint and an application to proceed <em>informa pauper-is </em>(\u201cIFP\u201d). By order entered November 27, 2007, 2007 WL 4191755, the District Court granted Aruanno\u2019s IFP application but dismissed the complaint, concluding that it failed to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. By order entered December 7, 2007, the District Court denied Aruanno\u2019s motion for reconsideration.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Aruanno appeals and proceeds IFP in this Court. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">In summary, as described in the District Court\u2019s opinion issued on November 21, 2007, the District Court considered the statements contained in Aruanno\u2019s IFP application and form complaint, which referred numerous times to an attached statement. Along with the complaint was a document described by the District Court as a portion of a complaint in another action, with an October 20, 2006 cover letter from Aruanno\u2019s <em>pro bono </em>counsel in another case to the New Jersey United States Attorney. The District Court described that other document in some detail. For example, the District Court listed the named defendants, which included Dr. Merrill Main, the same named defendant on Aruanno\u2019s form complaint in this action. The District Court also quoted the first few paragraphs of the document, in which Aruanno asserted, <em>inter alia, </em>that the defendants were denying him access to his attorneys in the pursuit of his ongoing litigation. Yet concerning the matter before it, the District Court found that, despite the indication on the form complaint that the defendants were \u201cMerrill Main, et al.,\u201d Main was the sole defendant as the only one identified by name. Further, the District Court found that complaint was devoid of factual allegations save for \u201cPlease see attached statement,\u201d and that there was no attached statement other than the statement in support of Aruanno\u2019s IFP application. Noting that the IFP statement did not contain any allegations concerning Main, much less that Main did anything that violated Aruanno\u2019s civil rights, the District Court concluded that the complaint failed to state a claim. In denying the motion for reconsideration, the District Court noted that Aruanno submitted a copy of a letter dated October 20, 2006, which the District Court interpreted as from a law firm representing Aruanno in connection with a claim that defendants \u201chave conspired to prevent him access to the civil courts.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, the District Court concluded that Aruanno had not advanced sufficient reasons for reconsideration of the dismissal of his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-10\">In his notice of appeal, Aruanno states that the issue in his case is that he is being \u201cdenied access to [his] attorneys\u201d and comments that the District Court \u201cstated that he had not received my complaint in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>matter but <em>then </em>quoted from it stating, \u2018it was another complaint\u2019.\u201d Upon review of the record and consideration of Aruanno\u2019s <em>pro se </em>filings, particularly his notice of appeal, <em>see Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972), it is now apparent that the document submitted with the complaint, described by the District Court as a portion of a complaint in another action, was actually the \u201cattached statement\u201d to which Aruanno\u2019s form complaint referred. This \u201cstatement\u201d does, in fact, identify Merrill Main and other named individuals by name as defendants. Moreover, the document also contains allegations specifically concerning Main and other listed defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">Because it appears that the District Court dismissed Aruanno\u2019s action and denied reconsideration on the basis that Aruanno did not present any allegations against the defendants, but it did so without ever considering the document intended to be Aruanno\u2019s statement of claims in the matter, we will summarily vacate the District Court\u2019s judgment and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. We do not reach nor express any opinion regarding any possible merit to Aruanno\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b91-7\">. The docket entries do not reflect that a motion for reconsideration was filed, and none appears in the record. However, there appears to be no dispute that the motion was filed and considered. We add that the motion was apparently timely filed under Rule 59(e) and Rule 6(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, given the dates of entry of the District Court\u2019s orders dismissing the complaint and denying the motion for reconsideration.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b91-12\">. As noted above, the motion for reconsideration is not found in the record, but the District Court's description of the October 20, 2006 letter matches the letter submitted with the complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
