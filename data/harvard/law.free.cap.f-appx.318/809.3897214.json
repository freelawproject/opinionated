After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-8\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b834-9\">A. Lawsuit Filed in 2006</p>\n<p id=\"b834-10\">Plaintiff Wingster is the mother of Jonathon Sheldon Haynes, who was a prisoner at Autry State Prison. Wingster, as Haynes\u2019s mother, filed this \u00a7 1983 action, alleging that excessive force by Autry State Prison guards caused Haynes\u2019s aneurysm and death. Wingster claims that on October 14, 2004, Haynes was beaten by prison guards and admitted to Mitchell County Hospital. After a CT scan of Haynes\u2019s brain showed no \u201cmidline shift, acute hemorrhage, or herniation,\u201d he was discharged from Mitchell County Hospital and returned to Autry State Prison on October 15. On October 16, Haynes died at Phoebe Putney Medical Center (\u201cPhoebe Putney Hospital\u201d) as a result of a brain aneurysm that led to a massive stroke. Wingster claims the October 14 beating caused the aneurysm.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-12\">B. Discovery in 2007</p>\n<p id=\"b834-13\">On May 2, 2007, the district court issued its discovery order, which stated that fact discovery was to be completed by October 20, 2007, and dispositive motions filed by November 30, 2007, unless the court granted an extension. The discovery order directed each party to serve disclosures relating to expert witnesses by August 20, 2007, for the case-in-chief and by September 10, 2007, for rebuttal.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-14\">On May 14, 2007, Plaintiff Wingster served her initial disclosures. Attachment A to Wingster\u2019s disclosures, entitled \u201cWitness List to Initial Disclosures,\u201d listed as possible witnesses: \u201cMedical Personnel at the Autry State Prison and medical personnel at Mitchell County Hospital and Phoebe Putman [sic] Hospital ... who treated Jonathon S, [sic] Haynes.\u201d It is undisputed that Dr. Jack Copeland was Haynes\u2019s treating physician at Phoebe Putney Hospital and signed the death certificate. Wingster\u2019s disclosures indicated that she had not engaged any experts.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-15\">On July 20, 2007, Plaintiff Wingster filed her response to Defendant Head\u2019s first interrogatories. Wingster\u2019s response listed Dr. Copeland\u2019s name on at least three different occasions as a \u201cperson with information and/or knowledge of those facts\u201d asserted in her complaint, including the assertion that the \u201cexcessive use of force ... proximately caused his (Haynes\u2019s) death.\u201d Fact discovery closed on October 20, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-16\">C. December 14, 2007, Motion for Summary Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b834-17\">On December 14, 2007, Defendants filed their motion for summary judgment and numerous exhibits, including Dr. Cope<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>land\u2019s affidavit.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In his affidavit, Dr. Copeland stated that \u201cHaynes did not have any lacerations or bruising, nor did he present any other indicia that he had been the victim of a physical attack or that he had suffered any traumatic injury.\u201d Dr. Copeland recognized that Haynes\u2019s medical history at Mitchell County Hospital indicated that Haynes had a \u201chematoma\u201d on the right side of his skull on October 14, 2004. Dr. Copeland stated that \u201cneither Nurse Hutchinson nor myself observed or recorded any evidence of a hematoma on Mr. Haynes\u2019 admission to Pheobe [sic] Putnam [sic] Medical Center\u201d on October 16, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">In addition, Dr. Copeland averred that \u201c[t]here was no medical evidence to suggest that' Mr. Haynes was the victim of any assault or suffered any major trauma that caused cerebral hemorrhage.\u201d Dr. Copeland stated that \u201c[i]t was and is [his] opinion that Mr. Haynes\u2019 aneurysm developed from natural causes and was not the result of assault or trauma.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">D. Plaintiff Wingster\u2019s Response in 2008</p>\n<p id=\"b835-7\">On January 2, 2008, Plaintiff Wingster filed a motion for extension of time to respond to Defendants\u2019 summary judgment motion. On January 3, the court granted Wingster\u2019s motion. On January 14, Wingster again filed a motion for extension of time, which the court granted on January 17. On January 31, Wingster, for the third time, filed a motion for extension of time to respond to Defendants\u2019 summary judgment motion. On February 5, the court granted Wingster\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-8\">On February 15, 2008, roughly two months after being served with Dr. Copeland\u2019s affidavit, Wingster filed both a response to Defendants\u2019 summary judgment motion and a motion for leave to designate a medical expert witness. Wingster\u2019s response to the summary judgment motion argued that \u201c[t]he close proximity of [Haynes\u2019s] death from a closed head injury and his head being cracked twice by the ... Defendants\u2019 excessive use of force is an obvious proximate cause of his death which can be inferred by the jury without medical evidence.\u201d Wingster\u2019s response stressed that two inmates, Joseph Archer and Thomas White, had testified that the Defendant Officers beat Haynes in his cell the day or days before his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-12\">Wingster\u2019s response also noted certain Mitchell County Hospital records. Haynes\u2019s \u201cEmergency Physician Record\u201d from Mitchell County Hospital states that Haynes was \u201cfound unresponsive by guards\u201d and twice indicates that Haynes \u201cha[d] hematoma \u00ae side of head.\u201d Haynes\u2019s Discharge Summary from Mitchell County Hospital, filled out by Dr. Barbara Kupka, states, \u201cThe patient was transferred from Autry Correctional Institute, status post being found unresponsive, reported a questionable seizure but no witnessed seizure. They said that he had hit his head but there was no significant trauma.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b835-13\">Plaintiff Wingster\u2019s motion for leave to designate a medical expert witness stated that Wingster needed thirty additional days to depose Dr. Copeland and to locate an expert of her own. Wingster claimed that she \u201chad no prior notice that [Dr. Copeland\u2019s] expert testimony would be submitted.\u201d Further, Wingster asserted that she \u201chad no notice that the Defendants\u2019 [sic] would contest with medical testimony the proximate cause of the death of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>Plaintiffs deceased son\u201d and for this reason did not designate a medical expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\">E. District Court\u2019s September 30, 2008, Order</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">On September 30, 2008, the district court denied Wingster\u2019s motion for leave to designate a medical expert and granted Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment. The district court first discussed the medical-expert issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">The district court found that Wingster \u201cwas aware of Dr. Copeland from the beginning of the case,\u201d as Dr. Copeland treated Haynes at Phoebe Putney Hospital, completed Haynes\u2019s death certificate,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and was explicitly identified by Wingster as a witness to the case in her response to Defendant Head\u2019s interrogatories.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In her initial disclosures, Wingster had indicated that possible witnesses included \u201cmedical personnel at ... Phoebe Putnam [sic].\u201d Later, in response to Defendant Head\u2019s interrogatories, Wingster herself identified the medical personnel at Phoebe Putney Hospital as possible expert witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-7\">After detailing the case\u2019s procedural history, the district court determined that \u201c[a] reasonable reading of the treatment records and the death certificate would have shown a reasonable person that causation could be an issue\u201d and that Wing-ster \u201cha[d] not been diligent in discovering this or any aspect of the case.\u201d The court noted that Defendants filed Dr. Copeland\u2019s affidavit on December 14, 2007. Wingster obtained three extensions of time and eventually filed her response to the summary judgment motion on February 15, 2008. The district court pointed out that, as of the date of its September 30, 2008, order, Wingster\u2019s motion had been pending for over six months, but Wingster had shown no signs of progress in identifying an expert, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-11\">In Plaintiffs motion for leave to designate an expert, Plaintiff does not state that she has even attempted to find an expert even though she has had a copy of Dr. Copeland\u2019s affidavit since at least December 14, 2007, much less what facts the expert would testify to. Plaintiff has not filed any document or notice since the filing of the motion for leave to designate an expert that she has made any progress in her search. Plaintiffs motion has been pending for at least 6 months without any update or statements on the progress of her efforts. There has been no statement as to why Plaintiff failed to locate an expert in the first place or why she has not at least identified an expert since the date of filing of the affidavit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b836-12\">(Internal citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b836-13\">As to Defendants\u2019 summary judgment motion, the district court observed that inmates Archer and White had testified that Defendants beat Haynes shortly before his death. Although Archer testified that he watched the alleged beating in Haynes\u2019s cell, Defendants produced photographic evidence that Archer could not see inside Haynes\u2019s cell from his own cell. And White testified only that, on the day of Haynes\u2019s alleged beating, he heard screams and assumed they were coming from Haynes\u2019s cell. The district court stated that White\u2019s testimony \u201c[was] not properly before the Court\u201d because White <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>had not been timely identified as a witness and that \u201c[e]ven so, White\u2019s testimony is not that helpful to Plaintiff.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"aic-dedup-1\">The court also concluded that, even if Archer\u2019s and White\u2019s testimony created fact issues as to whether Defendants beat Haynes, Wingster still had not shown an issue of material fact as to other elements of her excessive force claim, including causation. The court found that \u201c[a]ll of the admissible evidence, which was presented by Defendants, shows that the aneurysm and stroke are the result of natural causes\u201d and that Wingster had not shown an issue of material fact as to causation. The district court determined that Wing-ster \u201cproduced no admissible evidence, other than conjecture and speculation, that the alleged assault caused [Haynes\u2019s] death.\u201d The district court noted, \u201cIn fact, the overwhelming evidence in the record, [sic] shows that Haynes [sic] death was not caused by Defendants.\u201d Wingster timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">A. Denial of Leave to Designate Medical Expert</p>\n<p id=\"b837-7\">Plaintiff Wingster argues that the district court erred in denying her motion for leave to designate a medical expert.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Wingster claims she was surprised by Dr. Copeland\u2019s affidavit, noting that Dr. Copeland was not listed as an expert in the Defendants\u2019 initial disclosures.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Wingster asserts that she had no notice that causation was an issue and that she would have designated her own medical expert had Defendants given her notice they would rely on Dr. Copeland.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-14\">When a summary judgment motion is filed, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(f) allows a district court, before deciding that pending motion, to grant a continuance for additional discovery when the party opposing the motion \u201cshows by affidavit that, for specified reasons, it cannot present facts essential to justify its opposition.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In construing Rule 56(f), this Court has stated that \u201c[b]ecause the burden on a party resisting summary judgment is not a heavy one, one must conclusively justify his entitlement to the shelter of rule 56(f) by presenting specific facts explaining the inability to make a substantive response as required by rule 56(e) and by specifically demonstrating how postponement of a ruling on the motion will enable him, by discovery or other means, to rebut the movant\u2019s showing of the absence of a genuine issue of fact.\u201d <em>Sec. &amp; Exch. Comm\u2019n v. Spence &amp; Green Chem. Co., </em>612 F.2d 896, 901 (5th Cir.1980) (quotation marks and internal citations omitted).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The party op<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>posing the motion, here Wingster, may not simply rely on vague assertions that additional discovery will produce needed facts, \u201cparticularly where ... ample time and opportunities for discovery have already lapsed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The decision whether to grant a continuance rests in the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\">Here, we cannot say that the district court abused its discretion in denying Wingster\u2019s request for more time to designate a medical expert and to depose Dr. Copeland. Wingster did not meet her burden to \u201cconclusively justify [her] entitlement to the shelter of Rule 56(f).\u201d <em>Id. </em>At least by the time discovery began in December 2006, Wingster was fully aware that Dr. Copeland was her son\u2019s treating physician at Phoebe Putney Hospital. Wingster\u2019s own initial disclosures indicated that medical personnel at Phoebe Put-ney Hospital may be called as witnesses. Similarly, Wingster\u2019s own responses to Defendant Head\u2019s interrogatories identified the medical personnel at Phoebe Put-ney Hospital as possible expert witnesses and repeatedly named Dr. Copeland as an individual likely to have information as to certain issues in the case, including Wing-ster\u2019s assertion that excessive force proximately caused Haynes\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">From the start, it was also clear that the cause of Haynes\u2019s aneurysm was a medical causation issue beyond the scope of a layperson\u2019s knowledge that required competent medical testimony. Yet, Wingster did not depose Dr. Copeland and never identified any other medical expert to establish causation. Indeed, as Haynes\u2019s treating physician, Dr. Copeland was a fact witness to the cause of Haynes\u2019s death, as opposed to strictly Defendants\u2019 own, outside expert. And, even if Defendants failed to timely disclose Dr. Copeland as Defendants\u2019 own expert, Wingster has not demonstrated adequately her inability, by the time Defendants\u2019 summary judgment motion was filed, to rebut Defendants\u2019 contention that causation did not exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-7\">Alternatively, even assuming Wingster was somehow wholly unaware that she needed medical testimony in this case, Dr. Copeland\u2019s affidavit, served on Wingster on December 14, 2007, well after fact discovery closed on October 20, 2007, indisputably put her on notice that she needed medical testimony as to causation. After being granted three extensions of time to respond, only on February 14, 2008, did Wingster ask for leave to designate a medical expert witness. And, in her motion for leave, Wingster failed to (1) explain why she still had not identified a medical expert between December 14, 2007, and February 14, 2008, (2) describe how she intended to rebut Dr. Copeland\u2019s affidavit, or (3) explain her inability to make a substantive response in her motion for leave. Instead, on February 14, Wingster requested 30 additional days to designate an expert. In actuality, Wingster had until September 30, 2008, when the district court denied her motion for leave to designate a medical expert, to give the district court some reason to believe she could rebut Dr. Copeland\u2019s medical testimony. However, just like the time from December 2007 to February 2008, the time from February to September 2008 passed and the district court heard nothing from Wingster.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we cannot say that the district court abused its discretion in denying her motion for leave to designate a medical expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-9\">B. Grant of Summary Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b838-10\">Wingster also asserts that the district court erred in granting summary judgment for the Defendants because there were genuine issues of material fact .as to whether Haynes was beaten and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>whether that excessive force caused his aneurysm and death.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">To establish a claim for excessive force, the plaintiff must show that (1) the defendants acted with a malicious and sadistic purpose to inflict harm and (2) that a more than <em>de minimis </em>injury resulted. <em>Johnson v. Breeden, </em>280 F.3d 1308, 1321 (11th Cir. 2002). Additionally, \u201c[a] \u00a7 1983 claim requires proof of an affirmative causal connection between the defendant\u2019s acts or omissions and the alleged constitutional deprivation.\u201d <em>Troupe v. Sarasota County, Fla., </em>419 F.3d 1160, 1165 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">We need not determine whether the evidence creates fact issues as to the alleged beatings. Even assuming Haynes was beaten, Defendants produced unequivocal and uncontradicted evidence from Dr. Copeland, the treating physician, that Haynes\u2019s aneurysm was the result of natural causes and was not the result of any assault or trauma.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b839-11\">And Wingster produced nothing to refute Dr. Copeland\u2019s sworn testimony.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We recognize that Wingster relies on the temporal proximity of the alleged beatings on October 14 and the aneurysm on October 16. However, this medical causation issue presents a technical and scientific issue that requires the specialized knowledge of an expert medical witness. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 701, 702; <em>see also Webster v. Offshore Food Serv., </em>434 F.2d 1191, 1193 (5th Cir.1970) (stating that summary judgment is appropriate when \u201cthe trier of fact would not be at liberty to disregard arbitrarily the unequivocal, uncontradicted and unimpeached testimony of an expert witness [whose] testimony bears on technical questions of medical causation beyond the competence of lay determination.\u201d).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Sim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>ply put, mere temporal proximity alone does not refute Defendants\u2019 specific, medical expert affidavit explicitly averring that Haynes\u2019s aneurysm resulted from natural causes and not assault or trauma. As such, we conclude that Wingster has not shown that a genuine issue of material fact exists as to the cause of Haynes\u2019s death or that the district court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b835-9\">. The motion also included as attachments the medical records relied upon by Dr. Copeland in his affidavit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b836-8\">.

On Defendants\u2019 objection to its admissibility, the district court noted that White's identity was not revealed until Wingster filed her response to Defendants' motion for summary judgment approximately four months after the close of discovery.
