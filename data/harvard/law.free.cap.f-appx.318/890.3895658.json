The Secretary opposes and moves to dismiss Raytheon\u2019s appeal, no. 2008-1542. Raytheon opposes the motion to dismiss and replies concerning the motion to redesignate the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-19\">Raytheon filed an appeal with the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals (ASBCA) challenging the Secretary\u2019s determination that Raytheon failed to comply with certain Cost Accounting Standards (CAS), that such noncompliance caused the government to incur increased costs, and that Raytheon was required to pay interest on the amounts owed. The administrative judge (AJ) granted the Secretary\u2019s motion for summary judgment, ruling that Raytheon had not complied with CAS, that the government incurred increased costs due to Raytheon\u2019s noncompliance, and that Raytheon was required to pay interest, compounded daily. On Ray-theon\u2019s motion for reconsideration, the AJ determined that he had improperly granted summary judgment in the Secretary\u2019s favor. The AJ granted Raytheon\u2019s motion for reconsideration and entered summary judgment in Raytheon\u2019s favor, determining that the Secretary was not entitled to interest. Both Raytheon and the Secretary appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-21\">The Secretary argues that the judgment of the ASBCA is in Raytheon\u2019s favor and thus Raytheon cannot appeal. Raytheon contends that the AJ did not explicitly vacate his initial order granting summary judgment in favor of the Secretary and argues that, in the event that the court reverses the grant of summary judgment in Raytheon\u2019s favor, Raytheon wishes to challenge certain rulings contained in the AJ\u2019s first decision. Specifically, Raytheon states that it wishes to be able to challenge the AJ\u2019s determination that interest for CAS noncompliance is compounded daily.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-22\">We agree with the Secretary that Raytheon cannot appeal the judgment. In this case, the judgment entered was entirely in Raytheon\u2019s favor. A party may appeal a judgment only if the party \u201cseeks to enlarge its own rights under the judgment or to lessen the rights of its adversary under the judgment.\u201d <em>Bailey v. Dart Container Corp., </em>292 F.3d 1360, 1362 (Fed.Cir.2002). In this case, the AJ entered judgment that the Secretary is not entitled to interest. To the extent that Raytheon wishes to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>present arguments concerning how interest, if allowed, should be calculated, it may do so as an appellee in 2008-1543. Thus, Raytheon\u2019s appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">Because the court dismisses Raytheon\u2019s appeal, Raytheon\u2019s motion to redesignate the parties is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-6\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b915-7\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b915-8\">(1) The Secretary\u2019s motion to dismiss 2008-1542 is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-9\">(2) The revised official caption for 2008-1543 is reflected above.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-10\">(3) The Secretary\u2019s brief in 2008-1543 is due within 30 days of the date of filing of this order.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-11\">(4) Raytheon\u2019s motion to redesignate the parties is denied as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-12\">(5) Each side shall bear its own costs for 2008-1542.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
