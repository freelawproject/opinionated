(collectively, \u201cUnitronics\u201d), or Unitronics\u2019s customers. <em>Unitronics (1989) (R\u201dG) Ltd. v. Gharb, </em>532 F.Supp.2d 25 (D.D.C.2008) <em>(\u201cJan. 30 Order'\u2019). </em>Because we agree with the district court that Unitronics does not infringe the '654 patent, we <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b927-21\">Gharb is the inventor and owner of the '654 patent, entitled \u201cSecurity System with a Mobile Telephone.\u201d Unitronics manufactures general-purpose programmable logic controllers (\u201cPLCs\u201d). <em>Unitronics (1989) (R\u201dG) Ltd. v. Gharb, </em>511 F.Supp.2d 123, 127 (D.D.C.2007) <em>(\u201cSummary Judgment Op.\u201d). </em>When Unitronics introduced a PLC that could communicate using the Global System for Mobile Communications standard (\u201cGSM\u201d), Gharb threatened Uni-tronics and its distributors with patent infringement litigation. <em>Id. </em>at 128-29. In response, Unitronics brought an action seeking a declaratory judgment of nonin-fringement. <em>Id. </em>at 125. The district court concluded that Unitronics did not infringe the '654 patent and granted summary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>judgment in favor of Unitronics. <em>Id. </em>at 136. Unitronics <em>then </em>moved <em>for a </em>permanent injunction to preclude Gharb from threatening Unitronics and its customers with infringement litigation. <em>Unitronics (1989) (R\u201dG) Ltd. v. Gharb, </em>532 F.Supp.2d 25, 26-27 (D.D.C.2008). The district court granted the motion. <em>Jan. 30, </em>532 F.Supp.2d at 26. Gharb appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-5\">Preliminarily, Unitronics challenges this court\u2019s jurisdiction on the ground that Gharb\u2019s notice of appeal was untimely. The district court entered final judgment and closed the case on January 30, 2008, and Gharb did not file a notice of appeal until June 11, 2008\u2014well beyond the thirty-day window allowed by Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(1). However, on February 4, 2008, Gharb, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>filed a document entitled \u201cOpposition to memorandum opinion,\u201d which was docketed as: \u201cMOTION for Reconsideration re: 78 Memorandum &amp; Opinion.\u201d Appellees\u2019 Supplemental Appx. 49. Docket entry number 78-to which Gharb\u2019s motion as docketed refers\u2014is the district court\u2019s January 30, 2008 opinion finally adjudicating all claims. Gharb\u2019s February 4, 2008 filing was therefore treated as a motion for reconsideration under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60, which Gharb filed within ten days of judgment. Consequently, Gharb\u2019s time to file an appeal did not begin to run until after the district court disposed of his motion for reconsideration on June 30, 2008. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(4)(a)(vi). Gharb\u2019s notice of appeal was, if anything, premature rather than untimely, and by rule it ripened on the date that the district court disposed of his motion for reconsideration. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(4)(B)(i). Gharb\u2019s. appeal is therefore timely, and we have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b928-7\">On the merits, Gharb\u2019s primary argument appears to be that Unitronics infringes the '654 patent by selling PLCs with integrated GSM communication capabilities. <em>See, e.g., </em>Appellant\u2019s Informal Br. \u00b6 2 (arguing that Unitronics sells \u201cPLC (programmable logic controller) <em>&amp; </em>GSM (Global System for Mobile communications)\u201d); <em>id. </em>\u00b6 5 (referring to Unitronics\u2019s use of \u201cPLC &amp; GSM\u201d); <em>id. </em>\u00b6 8 (referring to Unitronics products as \u201cPLCs products [sold] with GSM\u201d). The district court concluded on summary judgment that the claims of the '654 patent required more than merely a PLC with GSM capabilities, and that Unitronics\u2019s PLCs with GSM could not infringe, because they do not meet several limitations of the claims. <em>Summary Judgment, </em>511 F.Supp.2d at 133-34. \u201cWe review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment of noninfringement <em>de novo.\u201d Stumbo v. Eastman Outdoors, Inc., </em>508 F.3d 1358, 1361 (Fed. <em>Cir.2007).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b928-8\">We agree with the district court that Unitronics\u2019s PLCs with GSM do not infringe the claims of the '654 patent. Gharb appears to believe that any PLC that is able to communicate over the GSM network infringes his patent, because part of his patent discloses PLCs communicating over GSM. <em>Summary Judgment, </em>511 F.Supp.2d at 133-34. Gharb\u2019s belief, however, is premised on an incorrect understanding of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-9\">\u201cThe words of the claims define the scope of the patented invention.\u201d <em>Computer Docking Station Corp. v. Dell, Inc., </em>519 F.3d 1366, 1373 (Fed.Cir.2008). The broadest claim of the '654 patent is claim 1, the only independent claim. Claim 1 recites:</p>\n<p id=\"b928-10\">1. A security system for monitoring objects, comprising:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b928-11\">a digital recording device having at least one emergency message; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"905\">*905</page-number>a mobile telephone having at least one preselected emergency number;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b929-5\">a first Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) controller for initialing monitoring;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b929-6\">a second PLC controller for repeating an alarm signal; and third, fourth, and fifth PLC controllers for activating a mobile telephone and a digital recording device;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b929-7\">at least one sensor for generating an alarm state connected to the first PLC controller;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b929-8\">a main relay for controlling the first PLC controller and which can be operated by a remote control;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b929-9\">a computer having mobile lines connectable to the five PLC controllers for programming the five PLC controllers; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b929-10\">a data set for transmission to the mobile telephone including alarm information;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b929-11\">wherein the second PLC controller repeats the alarm signal if the line dialed by the mobile telephone in case of an alarm, is busy; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b929-12\">wherein each time the second PLC controller repeats the alarm signal, the third, fourth and fifth PLC controllers activate the mobile telephone and the digital recording device.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b929-13\">'654 patent at col.5 11.25-51. A Unitronics device is not infringing \u201cunless it contains each limitation of the claim, either literally or by an equivalent.\u201d <em>Freedman Seating Co. v. Am. Seating Co., </em>420 F.3d 1350, 1358 (Fed.Cir.2005) (citing <em>Warner-Jenkinson Co. v. Hilton Davis Chem. Co., </em>520 U.S. 17, 29, 117 S.Ct. 1040, 137 L.Ed.2d 146 (1997)). In other words, it was not enough for Gharb to prove that Unitronics sold PLCs that could communicate over GSM. To prove infringement, he was required to show that Unitronics\u2019s devices met <em>all </em>of the limitations of the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-14\">The district court found that Gharb had not put forward evidence showing that any Unitronics product met all of the limitations of claim 1. <em>Summary Judgment, </em>511 F.Supp.2d at 133. We have reviewed the record, and we reach the same conclusion. None of the evidence put forward by Gharb shows that any Unitronics product contains the \u201cdigital recording device having at least one emergency message\u201d or its equivalent, or the \u201cdata set for transmission to the mobile telephone including alarm information\u201d or its equivalent, of the claimed security system. We find no evidence in the record suggesting that Uni-tronics made or sold any type of security system at all. We therefore conclude that the district court was correct to grant summary judgment of noninfringement in favor of Unitronics.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-15\">In his informal brief, Gharb argues that the district court incorrectly decided or failed to take into account several facts. These alleged mistakes of fact all appear to address only whether Unitronics\u2019s devices are PLCs that can communicate over GSM. Because a PLC communicating over GSM alone would not infringe the '654 patent, these alleged errors of fact are immaterial. Gharb also alleges that the district court erred in applying the infringement and damages sections of title 35 of the U.S.Code. Because the district court correctly concluded that Unitronics\u2019s products are noninfringing, we discern no error of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-16\">We have reviewed Gharb\u2019s other arguments and submissions and find them unpersuasive. We <em>affirm </em>the judgment of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
