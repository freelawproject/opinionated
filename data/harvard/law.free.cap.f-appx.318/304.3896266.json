Tlatenchi-Enriquez argues that the district court erred in applying a 16-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii) because the district court considered uncertified Nebraska judicial documents in determining that Tlatenchi-Enriquez\u2019s prior sexual assault conviction constituted a crime of violence under \u00a7 2L1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-11\">A district court may \u201cuse all facts admitted by the defendant in determining whether [a] prior conviction qualifies as an enumerated offense under \u00a7 2L1.2.\u201d <em>United States v. Mendoza-Sanchez, </em>456 F.3d 479, 483 (5th Cir.2006); <em>see also United States v. Jenkins, </em>487 F.3d 279, 281 (5th Cir.2007). Tlatenchi-Enriquez admitted at sentencing that his sexual assault conviction was based on his sexual relations with a 14-year-old girlfriend while he was 19 years old. He conceded at sentencing and concedes on appeal that such a conviction would constitute a crime of violence under \u00a7 2L1.2. Tlatenchi-Enriquez\u2019s admission at sentencing of the facts underlying his sexual assault conviction provided a sufficient basis for the district court to conclude that the conviction constituted a crime of violence. <em>See Mendoza-Sanchez, </em>456 F.3d at 483.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b329-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
