Federal Insurance Company (\u201cFederal\u201d) issued a policy insuring the Plan\u2019s trustees. The Plan sued Federal under the Declaratory Judgment Act, requesting that the district court make two informative rulings: (1) whether the Plan should notify its participants of possible claims against certain trustees and (2) whether, if the Plan so notifies its participants and if the participants sue, there would be coverage under the policy. Relying on the advisory-opinion prohibition and the ripeness doctrine, the district court dismissed the Plan\u2019s complaint as failing to satisfy Article Ill\u2019s case-or-controversy requirement. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>We conduct a de novo review of a district court\u2019s justiciability determinations, including its advisory opinion and ripeness assessments. <em>See Eaton v. Charter Twp. of Emmett, </em>\u2014 Fed.Appx.-,-, 2008 WL 780751, at *4 (6th Cir. Mar.21, 2008) (citing <em>Ammex, Inc. v. Cox, </em>351 F.3d 697, 706 (6th Cir.2003)); <em>Deja Vu of Nashville, Inc. v. Metro. Gov\u2019t of Nashville and Davidson Co., Tenn., </em>274 F.3d 377, 398 (6th Cir.2001). To the extent that the district court\u2019s jurisdictional ruling rests on factual findings, we review those findings for clear error. <em>RMI Titanium Co. v. Westinghouse Elec. Corp., </em>78 F.3d 1125, 1135 (6th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">Our review of the record, the applicable law, and the parties\u2019 briefs convinces us that the district court judge\u2019s memorandum opinion carefully and correctly set out the facts and the governing law, and because a full opinion from this court would be duplicative, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment granting defendant-ap-pellee\u2019s motion to dismiss, adopting the reasoning of the district court\u2019s February 28, 2008 memorandum.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
