We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">When reviewing a sentence, we first consider \u201cwhether the district court committed significant procedural error,\u201d including an incorrect Sentencing Guidelines determination. <em>United States v. Carty, </em>520 F.3d 984, 993 (9th Cir.2008) (en banc) (citing <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 2491, 171 L.Ed.2d 780 (2008). We next consider whether, in light of the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), the district court abused its discretion by imposing a substantively unreasonable sentence. <em>Id. </em>We review the district court\u2019s interpretation of the Guidelines <em>de novo, </em>its application of the Guidelines to the facts for an abuse of discretion, and its factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Garro, </em>517 F.3d 1163, 1167 (9th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Cantrell, </em>433 F.3d 1269, 1279 (9th Cir. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-9\">1. In <em>United States v. MacDonald, </em>339 F.3d 1080, (9th Cir.2003), this court explained that the two-level adjustment for the release of a hazardous substance under U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 2D1.12(b)(2) is \u201ctriggered by a disposal or discharge of a waste \u2018covered\u2019 by RCRA, whether it be a listed or characteristic waste\u201d under the applicable regulatory scheme. <em>Id. </em>at 1083. Under the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s RCRA regulations, phosphine gas is a listed hazardous waste under 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 261.33 (2008), and red phosphorus is a characteristic waste under 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 261.23(a)(6) (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-12\">The evidence presented at the time of sentencing showed that phosphine gas likely had been released or discharged in Stoddard\u2019s garage at the time that methamphetamine was \u201ccooked\u201d there, and that red phosphorus had been present in Stoddard\u2019s garage and was not disposed of properly. [ER 22-27] Taking that evidence together with the facts set forth in the presentence investigation report, the district court found that Stoddard\u2019s garage had contained \u201cthe residue of a meth manufacturing operation,\u201d and that Stoddard had improperly disposed of hazardous substances, requiring a specialized \u201cHAZ-MAT\u201d clean-up costing nearly two thousand dollars; these factual findings were not clearly erroneous. Given the facts before it, the district court did not abuse its discretion in applying the two-level \u00a7 2D1.12(b)(2) adjustment in calculating Stoddard\u2019s advisory Guidelines sentencing range.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-13\">2. Nor did the district court abuse its discretion in applying the four-level upward adjustment under \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6) based upon the presence of a Remington 30-06 rifle and a Mossberg 20-gauge shotgun in Stoddard\u2019s garage, \u201cone of them being loaded, near the presence of this lab and plainly in a position to be used to facilitate the unlawful operations going on there.\u201d [ER 30] The district court\u2019s application of the upward adjustment finds support in the Application Note to \u00a7 2K2.1, which states that such adjustment is warranted \u201cin the case of a drug trafficking offense in which a firearm is found in close proximity to drugs, drug-manufacturing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>materials, or drug paraphernalia\u201d because \u201cthe presence of the firearm has the potential of facilitating\u201d a drug felony. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1, comment (n.14). The district court\u2019s finding that Stoddard\u2019s firearms were kept in close proximity to the meth lab activity in the same garage was not clearly erroneous, and under \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6) as amplified by the Application Note, nothing more is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">Finally, the record reflects that the district court properly considered the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors and imposed a sentence that fell within the applicable advisory Guidelines range. We conclude that under the totality of the circumstances, the sentence imposed was substantively reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">RAWLINSON, Circuit Judge, concurring:</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">I concur in the result.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b581-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
