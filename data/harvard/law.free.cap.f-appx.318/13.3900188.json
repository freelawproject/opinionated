Schoppert, denying her application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Meixiang Liu, </em>No. A98 559 079 (B.I.A. Apr. 23, 2008), <em>aff'g </em>No. A98 559 079 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Jul. 18, 2006). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-14\">When the BIA does not expressly \u201cadopt\u201d the IJ\u2019s decision, but its brief opinion closely tracks the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we consider both the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s opinions for the sake of completeness if doing so does not affect our ultimate conclusion. <em>Jigme Wangchuck v. DHS, </em>448 F.3d 524, 528 (2d Cir.2006). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility findings, under the substantial evidence standard. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>Corovic v. Mukasey, </em>519 F.3d 90, 95 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-15\">As an initial matter, we find that the agency\u2019s analysis was sufficient to qualify as an \u201cexplicit credibility finding,\u201d where the IJ cited specific reasons to doubt Liu\u2019s credibility, and the BIA did not indicate that the basis for the IJ\u2019s denial of relief \u201cwas anything but the applicant\u2019s lack of credibility.\u201d <em>See Zaman v. Mukasey, </em>514 F.3d 233, 237 (2d Cir.2008) (discussing <em>Diallo v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 279, 290 (2d Cir.2000)). Further, we find that the agency\u2019s adverse credibility finding is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-16\">For asylum applications governed by the amendments to the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) made by the REAL ID Act of 2005, the agency may, consider<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>ing the totality of the circumstances, base a credibility finding on an asylum applicant\u2019s demeanor, the plausibility of his or her account, and inconsistencies in his or her statements, without regard to whether they go \u201cto the heart of the applicant\u2019s claim.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(B)(iii). We \u201cdefer to an IJ\u2019s credibility determination unless, from the totality of the circumstances, it is plain that no reasonable fact-finder could make such an adverse credibility ruling.\u201d <em>Xiu Xia Lin v. Mukasey, </em>534 F.3d 162, 167 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">In denying relief, the IJ noted that Liu \u201chad difficulty providing a coherent timeline of the events that occurred.\u201d Specifically, the IJ found that Liu\u2019s testimony was inconsistent with her asylum application as to the date of her pregnancy, the date that she arrived in the United States, and whether the family planning officials told her that she had to have an abortion when they came to her home. These are all clear inconsistencies in the record, and it was proper for the IJ to rely on them in making an adverse credibility determination. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii). Because Liu has not indicated anything in record that would compel a reasonable fact-finder to conclude that she is credible, we will not disturb the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Corovic, </em>519 F.3d at 95. Accordingly, the agency properly denied Liu\u2019s application for asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">Further, inasmuch as Liu based her claims for withholding of removal and CAT relief on the same factual predicate as her asylum claim, those claims necessarily fail. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006); <em>Wu Biao Chen v. INS, </em>344 F.3d 272, 275 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-9\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, the pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
