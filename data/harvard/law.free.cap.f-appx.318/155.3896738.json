The district court sentenced Gasea to the statutory mandatory minimum sentence of 120 months\u2019 imprisonment. Gasea appeals, contending that the district court\u2019s imposition of the statutory minimum sentence was improper because the court erroneously denied a sentencing reduction under the safety-valve provision. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f) (2000); <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7 5C1.2 (2006). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-13\">The safety valve requires a district court to impose a sentence within the applicable guideline range without regard to any statutory minimum sentence if a defendant meets five requirements. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f). The requirements are: (1) the defendant has no more than one criminal history point, (2) the defendant did not use violence or credible threats of violence or possess a firearm in connection with the offense, (3) the offense did not result in death or serious bodily injury, (4) the defendant was not an organizer or leader of others in the offense, and (5) the defendant provided truthful information to the government concerning the crime. <em>Id. </em>The burden is on the defendant to prove that all five safety-valve requirements have been met. <em>United States v. Beltran-Ortiz, </em>91 F.3d 665, 669 (4th Cir.1996). \u201c[T]he factual findings of the district court with respect to whether a defendant has satisfied the criteria of \u00a7 5C1.2 may not be reversed absent clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>114 F.3d 429, 432 (4th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-14\">The district court did not clearly err in denying Gasea the benefit of the safety valve. Gasea concedes that he failed to provide truthful information to the Government concerning the crime prior to the sentencing hearing. To satisfy the fifth requirement, the defendant must, \u201cnot later than the time of the sentencing hearing, ... truthfully provide[ ] to the Government all information and evidence the defendant has concerning the offense or offenses that were part of the same course of conduct or of a common scheme or plan ....\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f)(5). This provision \u201crequires more than accepting responsibility for one\u2019s own acts; ... [it] requires a defendant to disclose all he knows concerning both his involvement and that of any co-conspirators.\u201d <em>United States v. Iv-</em></p>\n<p id=\"agk-dedup-0\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number><em>ester, </em>75 F.3d 182, 184 (4th Cir.1996). Gasea admits that he was provided an opportunity to furnish the Government with information and evidence concerning the conspiracy but failed to offer evidence establishing truthful disclosure. Although Gasea alleges that he entered his guilty plea expecting to be permitted to make an additional proffer, the Government was not required to debrief him. <em>Beltran-Ortiz, </em>91 F.3d at 669 n. 4; <em>Ivester, </em>75 F.3d at 185-86. There was no promise of an additional proffer session contained in Gasca\u2019s plea agreement. Although the district court could have continued the sentencing hearing to provide Gasea additional opportunity to provide the government all information and evidence concerning the relevant crimes, the district court\u2019s decision not to do so was not an abuse of discretion. Indeed, nothing precluded Gasea from affirmatively volunteering such information prior to his sentencing hearing. <em>See Ivester, </em>75 F.3d at 184-85. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s determination that Gasca\u2019s statements were incomplete and untruthful was not clearly erroneous, and the denial of a safety-valve reduction below the statutory minimum on this basis was proper.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">Accordingly, we affirm Gasca\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b181-8\"><em> </em>Additionally, the government argues that Gas-ea is ineligible for the \u00a7 3553(f) safety valve because he was assigned three criminal history points. Gasea maintains that these points were inappropriately awarded because they stemmed from conduct relevant to the instant conspiracy and should not have been included in the criminal history calculation. USSG \u00a7 4A1.2 cmt. n. 1. Because Gasea fails the fifth requirement of \u00a7 3553(f), and all five elements are necessary for Gasea to obtain the benefit of the safety valve, we need not consider this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
