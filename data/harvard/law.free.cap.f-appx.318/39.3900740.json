Jan. 4, 2008), <em>aff'g </em>No. A73 673 978 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Oct. 31, 2006). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-26\">When the BIA does not expressly \u201cadopt\u201d the IJ\u2019s decision, but its brief opinion closely tracks the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>may consider both the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s opinions for the sake of completeness if doing so does not affect the Court\u2019s ultimate conclusion. <em>Jigme Wangchuck v. DHS, </em>448 F.3d 524, 528 (2d Cir.2006). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility findings, under the substantial evidence standard. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Xiu Xia Lin v. Mukasey, </em>534 F.3d 162, 165 (2d Cir.2008).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">As a preliminary matter, Diallo failed to challenge before the BIA the IJ\u2019s pretermission of his untimely application for asylum, and her denial of his application for cancellation of removal and adjustment of status. Because BIA did not address the denial of that relief, and Diallo has not addressed it before this Court, we deem such claims abandoned. <em>See Gui Yin Liu v. INS, </em>508 F.3d 716, 723 n. 6 (2d Cir.2007). Thus, we proceed to consider only the agency\u2019s denial of Diallo\u2019s application for withholding of removal and CAT relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">Upon our review of the administrative record, we find that substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See Xiu Xia Lin, </em>534 F.3d at 165. The IJ properly found that Diallo\u2019s testimony surrounding his arrest, detention, and hospital stay was dramatically different from his written application for asylum. Indeed, while Diallo claimed in his application that he was arrested in February 1990, and beaten and tortured until he was taken to a hospital a month later, he testified that he was beaten for only one day. Similarly, although Diallo stated in his asylum application that he simply left the hospital, he testified that he escaped by jumping out of a window. As we have held, \u201cwhere ... a petitioner has provided two distinct, non-overlapping accounts of persecution, ... an IJ must ... rely on the commonsense observation that it is inconsistent for a petitioner to respond to the same question about the nature of his asylum claim with two entirely different responses.\u201d <em>Yun-Zui Guan v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 391, 396, 397 n. 6, 399 n. 8 (2d Cir.2005). Under the REAL ID Act, it was proper for the IJ to rely on these inconsistencies in making her adverse credibility finding. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(B)(iii); <em>Xiu Xia Lin, </em>534 F.3d at 167; <em>see Majidi, </em>430 F.3d at 80-81, 81 n. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-9\">Contrary to Diallo\u2019s assertion that his medical evidence demonstrated that he suffered persecution, the report he submitted indicated only that he alleged that he was hit with a wooden baton and a sharp metal object sixteen years earlier. Such evidence fails to establish a credible connection between his injuries and his claim of past persecution. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 342 (2d Cir.2006) (holding that the weight afforded to evidence lies largely within the discretion of the IJ).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-10\">Ultimately, the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination was supported by sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>stantial evidence where no reasonable fact-finder would be compelled to conclude to the contrary. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>Xiu Xia Lin, </em>534 F.3d at 165-66. Thus, the agency\u2019s denial of Dial-lo\u2019s application for withholding of removal was proper. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 208.13(b), 208.16(b)(1). Moreover, because the only evidence that Diallo was likely to be tortured depended upon his credibility, the adverse credibility determination in this case necessarily precludes success on his claim for CAT relief. <em>See Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t. of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 520, 523 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(b).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b64-6\">. The asylum application in this case is governed by the amendments made to the Immigration and Nationality Act by the REAL ID Act of 2005, Pub.L. No. 109-13, 119 Stat. 231 (2005). <em>See </em>Title I, \u00a7 101(a)(3) of the Act, 119 Stat. 231, 303 (amending 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158); <em>see also Xiu Xia Lin, </em>534 F.3d at 165. Thus, Diallo\u2019s argument that the IJ was required to rely only on inconsistencies that bear a nexus to his asylum claim is unavailing. <em>See Xiu Xia Lin, </em>534 F.3d at 165. Regardless, the IJ identified discrepancies that did go to the heart of Diallo\u2019s claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b64-11\">. We note that the brief submitted by the Petitioner\u2019s attorney, Theodore Vialet, is cursory at best and comes dangerously close to waiving any challenge to the agency's adverse credibility determination. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 541 n. 1, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005). Further briefing of this quality may result in discipline.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
