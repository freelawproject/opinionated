Because Ramirez had a prior conviction for a felony drug-trafficking offense, her base offense level was increased by 16 levels pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A). The district court sentenced Ramirez within the applicable guidelines range to 41 months of imprisonment and a three-year term of nonreporting supervised release. Ramirez filed a timely notice of appeal and now challenges the sentence imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-19\">Ramirez concedes that this court ordinarily applies a presumption of reasonableness to within-guidelines sentences. <em>See United, States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 338 (5th Cir.), cert. <em>denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 328, 172 L.Ed.2d 236 (2008); <em>United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 624, 172 L.Ed.2d 617 (2008). Citing <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 574-75, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), she contends that the presumption should not apply in this case because \u00a7 2L1.2 is not empirically supported.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-23\">The question presented in <em>Kimbrough </em>was whether \u201ca sentence ... outside the guidelines range is per se unreasonable when it is based on a disagreement with the sentencing disparity for crack and powder cocaine offenses.\u201d 128 S.Ct. at 564. Speaking specifically to the crack cocaine Guidelines, the Court simply ruled that \u201cit would not be an abuse of discretion for a district court to conclude when sentencing a particular defendant that the crack/powder <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>disparity yields a sentence \u2018greater than necessary' to achieve [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3558(a)\u2019s purposes, even in a mine-run case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 575. In <em>Kimbrough, </em>the Court said nothing of the applicability of the presumption of reasonableness. Moreover, the appellate presumption\u2019s continued applicability to \u00a7 2L1.2 sentences is supported by this court\u2019s decision in <em>Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d at 338-39. The appellate presumption is therefore applicable in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">Ramirez also contends that her 41-month sentence was greater than necessary to accomplish the goals of sentencing listed in \u00a7 3553(a)(2). She points out that the instant offense did not involve violent conduct and did not pose a danger to others. She further contends that the offense was not inherently evil and \u201cwas, at bottom, an international trespass.\u201d She also asserts that the applicable guidelines range double counted her prior drug trafficking conviction because it resulted in both a 16-level enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2 and an increase in her criminal history score. She has abandoned on appeal her argument regarding cultural assimilation. <em>See United States v. Lucien, </em>61 F.3d 366, 370 (5th Cir.1995). She also concedes that her argument that she deserved a lesser sentence based on the disparity that results from fast track early disposition programs is foreclosed by <em>Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d at 557-64.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">The district court heard Ramirez\u2019s request for a sentence below the guidelines range, but the court pointed out that Ramirez illegally reentered this country not long after being released from prison. Also, the district court was disturbed by Ramirez\u2019s notion that the desire to be with her children justified her illegal reentry offense. The district court ultimately determined in its discretion that a sentence within the guidelines range was appropriate. Under those circumstances, Ramirez has not shown that the district court abused its discretion in selecting a sentence or, consequently, that the within-guidelines sentence imposed is unreasonable. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007) ; <em>United States v. Newson, </em>515 F.3d 374, 379 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 2522, 171 L.Ed.2d 802 (2008) .</p>\n<p id=\"b321-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b320-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
