He petitioned the United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>States District Court for the Middle District of Florida pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 for a writ of habeas corpus. That court transferred the case to the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida under the erroneous belief that petitioner was incarcerated in that district. The court below recognized the error but denied petitioner\u2019s motion to transfer the case back to the Middle District of Florida. Petitioner now appeals the court\u2019s decision. We issued a certificate of appealability on the issue of whether the district court erred in denying petitioner\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\">Section 2241 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-5\">Where an application for a writ of habe-as corpus is made by a person in custody under the judgment and sentence of a State court of a State which contains two or more Federal judicial districts, the application may be filed in the district court for <em>the district wherein such person is in custody </em>or in the district court for <em>the district within which the State court was held which convicted and sentenced him </em>and each of such district courts shall have <em>concurrent jurisdiction </em>to entertain the application. The district court for the district wherein such an application is filed in the exercise of its discretion and in furtherance of justice may transfer the application to the other district court for hearing and determination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(d) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">Petitioner was convicted, sentenced, and is incarcerated in counties located in the Middle District of Florida. Accordingly, the district court for that district should entertain the instant petition. We therefore vacate the district court\u2019s order denying petitioner\u2019s motion to transfer, and remand the case with the instruction that the district court transfer the case to the Middle District of Florida.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-9\">SO ORDERED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
