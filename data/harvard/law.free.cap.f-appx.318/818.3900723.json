On appeal, Dean argues the district court abused its discretion in denying his request for a downward variance. Specifically, Dean notes the Supreme Court has held courts can take the disparity in sentences between crack cocaine and powder cocaine offenses into consideration when determining a defendant\u2019s sentence. <em>See Kimbrough v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007). Because the district court did not take that factor into consideration, Dean asks this Court to instruct the district court to hold an evidentiary hearing on whether he is entitled to a downward variance.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-18\">We review a district court\u2019s decision to deny a motion for .a reduction in sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), in whole or in part, for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1219 (11th Cir.2005). This Court reviews <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority. <em>United States v. White, </em>305 F.3d 1264, 1267 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-19\">Section 3582(c)(2) of Title 18 gives federal courts the authority to consider reducing the sentence \u201cof a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d Any such reduction, however, must be consistent with the applicable Guidelines\u2019 policy statements. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The applicable policy statement here is U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, which pertains to Guidelines amendments that may be applied retroactively, including Amendment 706. Section 1B1.10 provides, in cases in which the defendant received a within-Guidelines sentence at his original sentencing, a reduction pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) shall not be less than the min<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>imum of the amended Guidelines range. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(A)-(B) &amp; cmt. n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\">We recently addressed whether <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and <em>Kim-brough </em>prohibit Congress or the Sentencing Commission from limiting the discretion of a district court in reducing a sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1191 (11th Cir.2009). Concluding <em>Booker </em>and <em>Kimbrough </em>do not apply to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings, we held a district court is bound by the limitations on its discretion imposed by \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and the applicable policy statements by the Sentencing Commission. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">The applicable policy statement here, \u00a7 1B1.10, and its commentary preclude a district court from reducing a defendant\u2019s sentence below the amended Guidelines range if the defendant\u2019s original sentence fell within the then-applicable Guidelines range. Dean\u2019s original sentence was within the Guidelines range. Accordingly, the district court was not permitted under \u00a7 IB 1.10 to sentence Dean to a term below the amended Guidelines range. Based upon our holding in <em>Melvin, </em>Dean\u2019s argument that the district court should have sentenced him below the amended Guidelines range is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
