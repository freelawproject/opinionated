We review de novo the district court\u2019s decision. <em>Thomas v. Barnhart, </em>278 F.3d 947, 954 (9th Cir.2002). Reviewing de novo questions of law, and for substantial evidence the ALJ\u2019s findings, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g); <em>Thomas, </em>278 F.3d at 954, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-11\">1. The ALJ\u2019s determination of Plaintiffs residual functional capacity (\u201cRFC\u201d) erred in one respect. The ALJ\u2019s conclusion that Plaintiff was capable of a wide range of <em>light </em>work, instead of <em>sedentary </em>work, is not supported by substantial evidence, because the ALJ\u2019s conclusions concerning Plaintiffs standing and walking limitations are inconsistent with light work. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1567 (describ-. ing the requirements of \u201clight work\u201d and \u201csedentary work\u201d). But that error was harmless because the ALJ held, at the next step, that Plaintiff was capable of performing her past relevant <em>work\u2014all </em>of which was <em>sedentary. See Stout v. Comm\u2019r, Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>454 F.3d 1050, 1055 (9th Cir.2006) (holding that an error was harmless if it was \u201cinconsequential to the ultimate nondisability determination\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-14\">We reject Plaintiffs other challenges to the RFC assessment, as they either relate only to the standing/walking limitations discussed above or are unfounded. The ALJ fully complied with the procedural requirements of Social Security Ruling 96-8p.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-16\">2. The ALJ\u2019s hypothetical to the vocational expert accurately reflected the RFC (except with regard to light work which, as discussed above, was harmless error). The ALJ also fully complied with Social Security Ruling 82-62.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-17\">3. We reject Plaintiffs challenge to the ALJ\u2019s rejection of the lay witness testimony of Plaintiffs husband. The district court held that the ALJ did not err and, in the alternative, that any error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-18\">We conclude from our independent review of the record that any error was harmless because any reasonable ALJ would have reached the same disability determination. <em>See Carmickle v. Comm\u2019r, Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>533 F.3d 1155, 1162 (9th Cir.2008) (\u201c[T]he relevant inquiry in this context is not whether the ALJ would have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>made a different decision absent any error, it is whether the ALJ\u2019s decision remains legally valid, despite such error.\u201d (citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b575-12\"><em> </em>This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
