Rawlings appeals a district court judgment, which affirmed the Commissioner of Social Security\u2019s final decision to deny his application for Disability Insurance Benefits under Title II of the Social Security Act. Because the parties are familiar with the facts and procedural history of this case, we will discuss them only as necessary to explain our decision. We have jurisdiction' pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we reverse and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">We review \u201cde novo the district court\u2019s order affirming the Commissioner\u2019s denial of benefits.\u201d <em>Moisa v. Barnhart, </em>367 F.3d 882, 885 (9th Cir.2004) (citation omitted). We \u201cmay set aside a denial of benefits only if it is not supported by substantial evidence or if it is based on legal error.\u201d <em>Thomas v. Barnhart, </em>278 F.3d 947, 954 (9th Cir.2002) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cSubstantial evidence means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Burch v. Barnhart, </em>400 F.3d 676, 679 (9th Cir.2005) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-8\">The Social Security regulations provide a five-step inquiry to determine whether a claimant is entitled to benefits. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(a)(4). The administrative law judge (ALJ) determined at step four that Rawlings\u2019s previous job at American Protective Services (APS) constituted past relevant work as a surveillance system monitor, and that Rawlings had the residual functional capacity to perform this work as generally performed in the national economy, but not as he actually performed it. Rawlings argues that the determination that he has past relevant work as a surveillance system monitor is based on legal error and not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-11\">The ALJ reached these determinations after hearing testimony from Rawlings and a vocational expert. Rawlings testified that while employed at APS, he was assigned to the Qualcomm facility in La Jol-la, California, where he spent an equal amount of time each day walking rounds to check doors and locks and watching television monitors. Based on this testimony, the vocational expert testified that Rawl-ings had past relevant work as a surveillance system monitor. Rawlings\u2019s attorney asked the vocational expert whether the APS job was properly classified as a security guard position that included surveillance system monitoring duties. The vocational expert stated that it could be argued either way, and acknowledged that the <em>Dictionary of Occupational Titles </em>limits the duties of a surveillance system monitor to watching television monitors and does not include such duties as walking rounds and checking doors.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-12\">The vocational expert\u2019s ambiguous testimony is insufficient to support the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that Rawlings had past relevant work as a surveillance system monitor. \u201cIn making disability determinations, the Social Security Administration relies primarily on the <em>Dictionary of Occupational Titles </em>for \u2018information about the requirements of work in the national economy.\u2019 \u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number><em>Massachi v. Astrue, </em>486 F.3d 1149, 1153 (9th Cir.2007) (quoting SSR 00-4p at 2). The Social Security Administration may also rely on testimony from vocational experts, which should be consistent with the <em>Dictionary of Occupational Titles, </em>although neither \u201ctrumps\u201d the other when there is a conflict. <em>Id. </em>(quoting SSR 00-4p at 2). We have observed that SSR 00-4p \u201cexplicitly requir[es] that the ALJ determine whether the [vocational] expert\u2019s testimony deviates from the <em>Dictionary of Occupational Titles </em>and whether there is any reasonable explanation for any deviation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Only after determining whether the vocational expert has deviated from the <em>Dictionary of Occupational Titles </em>and whether any deviation is reasonable can an ALJ properly rely on the vocational expert\u2019s testimony as substantial evidence to support a disability determination. <em>Id. </em>at 1153-54.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">Here, the record evidence indicates that the vocational expert\u2019s classification of Rawlings\u2019s past relevant work as a surveillance system monitor rather than a security guard deviated from the definitions of those occupations in the Dictionary of Occupational Titles. <em>Compare Dictionary of Occupational Titles </em>\u00a7 379.367-010 (4th ed.1991) (defining a surveillance system monitor, in part, as one who \u201c[m]onitors premises of public transportation terminals to detect crimes or disturbances, using closed circuit television monitors, and notifies authorities by telephone of need for corrective action\u201d and providing an industry designation of government services), <em>with id. </em>at \u00a7 372.667-034 (defining a security guard, in part, as one who \u201c[g]uards industrial or commercial property against fire, theft, vandalism, and illegal entry, ... Patrols, periodically, buildings and grounds of industrial plant or commercial establishment, ... Examines doors, windows, and gates to determine that they are secure\u201d and providing an industry designation of any industry). At no point in the proceedings did the ALJ ask the vocational expert whether her testimony deviated from the DOT, and her equivocal answer to the question posed by Rawlings\u2019s attorney is too ambiguous to qualify as a reasonable explanation for any deviation.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">Therefore, we reverse the decision of the district court and remand with instructions to remand this case to the Commissioner for further evidence on the duties and responsibilities of Rawlings\u2019s job at APS.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b618-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
