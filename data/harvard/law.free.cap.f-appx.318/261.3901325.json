Plaintiffs\u2019 suit challenges the Party\u2019s method of allocating delegates to its nominating conventions based on raw voter turnout, a procedure that was not precleared by the United States Attorney General or the District Court for the District of Columbia. Reviewing the dismissal <em>de novo, see In re Katrina Canal Breaches Litig., </em>495 F.3d 191, 205 (5th Cir.2007), we AFFIRM the dismissal for the State, REVERSE the dismissal for the Party, and REMAND for the following reasons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-13\">1. We agree with Plaintiffs that the district judge\u2019s finding of no discrimination against Latino voters resulting from the Party\u2019s delegate-allocation method does not support dismissal of their \u00a7 5 claim against the Party. Section 5 preclearance actions generally must be resolved by a three-judge court, whose decision is appealable only to the Supreme Court. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1973c; <em>LULAC v. Texas, </em>113 F.3d 53, 55 (5th Cir.1997) (per curiam). Since the challenged practice was not precleared, the inquiry by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>three-judge district court is limited to whether \u00a7 5 covers a contested change, and, if so, the appropriate remedy. <em>Lopez v. Monterey County, </em>519 U.S. 9, 23, 117 S.Ct. 340, 349, 136 L.Ed.2d 273 (1996). The coverage issue turns on: (1) whether the delegate-allocation method is a \u201c \u2018standard, practice, or procedure with respect to voting\u2019 within the meaning of \u00a7 5,\u201d <em>Dougherty County, Ga., Bd. of Educ. v. White, </em>439 U.S. 32, 33-34, 99 S.Ct. 368, 370, 58 L.Ed.2d 269 (1978); (2) whether the method constitutes a \u201cchange\u201d to the covered jurisdiction\u2019s baseline, <em>i.e., </em>\u201cthe most recent practice that was both precleared and \u2018in force or effect\u2019\u2014or, absent any change since the jurisdiction\u2019s coverage date, the practice that was \u2018in force or effect\u2019 on that date,\u201d <em>Riley v. Kennedy, </em>\u2014 U.S. -\u2014, 128 S.Ct. 1970, 1982, 170 L.Ed.2d 837 (2008) (internal citation omitted); and (3) whether the Party is a \u201cpolitical subdivision\u201d subject to \u00a7 5, <em>Dougherty County, </em>439 U.S. at 34, 99 S.Ct. at 370. Thus, even a three-judge court cannot assess the discriminatory impact of the challenged method; that determination is reserved for the United States Attorney General or the District Court for the District of Columbia. <em>See Lopez, </em>519 U.S. at 23, 117 S.Ct. at 348-19 (\u201cOn a complaint alleging failure to preclear election changes under \u00a7 5, th[e] [three-judge district] court lacks authority to consider the discriminatory purpose or nature of the changes.\u201d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-5\">2. Nor can dismissal be affirmed on the alternative ground that the Party is not a \u201cpolitical subdivision\u201d subject to \u00a7 5\u2019s preelearance requirement. When determining whether to convene a three-judge court, a single district judge may dismiss a \u00a7 5 claim that is \u201c \u2018wholly insubstantial\u2019 and completely without merit, such as where the claim[][is] frivolous, essentially fictitious, or determined by prior case law.\u201d <em>LULAC, </em>113 F.3d at 55 (internal citation omitted). As the Party concedes, the Supreme Court has not resolved whether and under what circumstances the Voting Rights Act requires a political party to obtain preclearance of internal party rules, and in fact has extended \u00a7 5\u2019s requirement to a political party\u2019s imposition of a registration fee for delegates to the party\u2019s state nominating convention. <em>See generally Morse v. Republican Party of Va., </em>517 U.S. 186, 116 S.Ct. 1186, 134 L.Ed.2d 347 (1996) (plurality opinion). Without binding precedent clearly foreclosing Plaintiffs\u2019 contention that \u00a7 5 applies to the Party\u2019s delegate allocation method, it cannot be said that the claim is wholly insubstantial or frivolous. <em>See Goosby v. Osser, </em>409 U.S. 512, 518, 93 S.Ct. 854, 859, 35 L.Ed.2d 36 (1973) (\u201cA claim is insubstantial only if its soundness so clearly results from the previous decisions of [the Supreme Court] as to foreclose the subject .(internal quotation marks and citation omitted)); <em>cf. LaRouche v. Fowler, </em>152 F.3d 974, 975-77, 983-86, 998 (D.C.Cir.1998) (concluding that <em>Morse </em>did not clearly and inescapably foreclose the plaintiffs \u00a7 5 challenge to a party rule conditioning eligibility as a presidential nominee on the chairman\u2019s determination that the candidate is a bona-fide party member, and reversing its dismissal by a single-judge district court). '</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>3. For similar reasons, we reject the Party\u2019s assertion that its delegate-selection process is not justiciable. None of the authorities cited by the Party involves a \u00a7 5 challenge, and the Party\u2019s assertion that its internal procedures are exempt from judicial review merely reprises its contention that the preclearance requirement does not apply to its delegate-allocation rule\u2014an issue that must be resolved by a three-judge district court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-4\">4. Plaintiffs have not waived their present request for a three-judge court by failing to move for one below. Section 5 incorporates 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2284, which prescribes, \u201c[a] district court of three judges <em>shall be convened, </em>when otherwise required by Act of Congress....\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2284(a) (emphasis added). We agree with our sister circuits that the term \u201cshall\u201d in \u00a7 2284 is mandatory and jurisdictional. <em>See Kalson v. Paterson, </em>542 F.3d 281, 287 (2d Cir.2008) (apportionment case); <em>Armour v. Ohio, </em>925 F.2d 987, 989 (6th Cir.1991) (en banc) (same). Although the 1976 amendment to \u00a7 2284 reduced the categories of cases subject to the three-judge requirement, nothing in the legislative history suggests an intent to alter its jurisdictional nature. <em>See Kal-son, </em>542 F.3d at 287. The absence of a formal request for a three-judge court does not constitute waiver.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-5\">4. Lastly, whether Plaintiffs unreasonably delayed their challenge to a procedure adopted by the Party in 1988 arguably affects the appropriate remedy if coverage is found.by the three-judge court, but it does not provide grounds for dismissal. <em>See Brooks v. State Bd. of Elections, </em>775 F.Supp. 1470, 1474-75, 1481 (S.D.Ga.1989) (three-judge court) (per curiam) (concluding that equitable arguments can be considered \u201conly in the limited context of fashioning an appropriate remedy,\u201d and refusing to \u201cequitably preclear\u201d the changes based on laches), <em>aff'd mem., </em>498 U.S. 916, 111 S.Ct. 288, 112 L.Ed.2d 243 (1990). Having found no basis in the record supporting the district judge\u2019s ruling, we reverse the dismissal of Plaintiffs\u2019 \u00a7 5 claim against the Party and remand for the convening of a three-judge court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-7\">5. Plaintiffs\u2019 \u00a7 5 claim against the State for a voting procedure that it neither enacted or administered, however, was properly dismissed. Section 5 states, \u201c[wjhenever a [covered] State or political subdivision ... shall enact or seek to administer any ... standard, practice, or procedure with respect to -voting different from that in force or effect\u201d on the relevant coverage date, <em>\u201csuch State or subdivision\u201d </em>must obtain pre-clearance either by instituting an action in the District Court for the District of Columbia, or from the United States Attorney General. \u00a7 1973c (emphasis added). The statute plainly imposes a preclearance obligation only on the particular \u201cState or political subdivision\u201d that \u201cenact[s]\u201d or \u201cseek[s] to administer\u201d the disputed change. In this case, the challenged delegate-allocation procedure was enacted and administered by the Party, not the State. Texas law requires the Party to adopt rules, consistent with state law, governing the conduct of its conventions, mandates that such rules be filed with the State, and provides a mechanism for their en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>forcement. <em>See </em>Tex. Elec.Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 163.002; 163.003; 163.005; 163.007. But these provisions do not impute to the State the Party\u2019s obligation, if any, to preclear those rules under \u00a7 5. We affirm the dismissal of Plaintiffs\u2019 wholly insubstantial claim against the State.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">AFFIRMED IN PART; REVERSED IN PART; CAUSE REMANDED FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b286-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.

GARZA,</author>\n<p id=\"AR0U\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">I concur with the majority\u2019s holding that LULAC\u2019s Section 5 claim against the Texas Democratic Party should be remanded to a three-judge panel for consideration. However, I respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s affirmance of the district court\u2019s dismissal of LULAC\u2019s claim against the State of Texas. Because the question of whether the Democratic Party\u2019s internal voting procedures can be imputed to the State of Texas is not \u201c \u201cwholly insubstantial\u2019 and completely without merit, such as where the claim[ ][is] frivolous, essentially fictitious, or determined by prior case law,\u201d <em>LULAC v. Texas, </em>113 F.3d 53, 55 (5th Cir.1997), it should be considered by a three-judge panel.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b289-11\">. I am unaware of any case in this Circuit or any other dealing with the issue. The Supreme Court's Voting Rights Act jurisprudence does not foreclose the possibility that political party activities may be give rise to some obligation on the part of the state, especially where, as here, state law mandates that the party rules be filed with the state and provides a mechanism of enforcement for those rules. <em>See </em>Tex. Elec.Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 163.002, 163.005 (requiring political parties to adopt rules that are consistent with state law); \u00a7 163.007 (making political party rules enforceable by writ of mandamus). Thus, while I make no statement as to the merits of this claim, it does not meet the \"wholly insubstantial\u201d standard so as to be excluded from remand to a three-judge panel for review.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
