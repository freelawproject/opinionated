In April 2007, the District Court sentenced him to 54 months\u2019 imprisonment. In 2008, he filed a motion pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) (\u201cModification of an imposed term of imprisonment\u201d) to reduce his sentence in light of Amendment 706 to the U.S. Sentencing Commission Guidelines (the \u201ccrack amendment,\u201d effective November 2007). The crack amendment applies retroactively and generally reduces base offense levels in crack cocaine cases by two levels. <em>See generally United States v. Wise, </em>515 F.3d 207, 221 (3d Cir.2008) (discussing that the crack amendment became retroactive on March 3, 2008). The District Court denied the motion. Thereafter, Johnson lodged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>this appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He argues that the District Court erred by improperly treating Guidelines \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(2)(B) as mandatory, rather than as advisory, in denying his motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>United States v. Wood, </em>526 F.3d 82, 85 (3d Cir.2008). We have not explicitly set forth the applicable standard of review of a district court\u2019s decision to grant or deny a sentence modification pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), but other courts that have considered this issue apply an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>United States v. Sharkey, </em>543 F.3d 1236, 1238 (10th Cir.2008) (citing <em>United States v. Dorrough, </em>84 F.3d 1309, 1311 (10th Cir.1996)); <em>United States v. Jones, </em>548 F.3d 1366, 1368 n. 1 (11th Cir.2008). We will apply the same standard here.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">A district court may modify an imposed prison term \u201cin the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). A court \u201cmay\u201d make this modification \u201cafter considering the factors set forth in section [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 ] 3553(a) to the extent they are applicable, if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission\u201d under Guidelines \u00a7 1B1.10. <em>Id. </em>Guidelines \u00a7 IB 1.10(b)(2)(B) reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-6\">If the original term of imprisonment imposed was less than the term of imprisonment provided by the guideline range ... at the time of sentencing, a reduction comparably less than the amended guideline range ... <em>may </em>be appropriate. However, if the original term of imprisonment constituted a non-guideline sentence determined pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), a further reduction generally would not be appropriate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-10\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b152-11\">Johnson\u2019s initial recommended Guidelines range was 108 to 135 months\u2019 imprisonment. The Court sentenced him to a non-Guidelines sentence of 54 months\u2019 imprisonment, far below the recommended range, based on the Government\u2019s formal motion for downward departure for cooperation and the applicable \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors. After adoption of the crack amendment, Johnson\u2019s revised Guidelines range, prior to any departure, was 87 to 108 months\u2019 imprisonment. This lower range resulted from a two-level change in Johnson\u2019s base offense level, from 29 to 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-12\">In denying Johnson\u2019s motion for a reduction in sentence, the District Court did not indicate that it was prohibited from further reducing Johnson\u2019s sentence. Rather, it noted that a further reduction \u201cgenerally would not be appropriate\u201d under the Guidelines policy set forth in \u00a7 1B1.10. It continued, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-13\">In imposing the sentence [of 54 months\u2019 imprisonment,] I considered all the pertinent factors to determine a sentence that was not greater than necessary to achieve the objectives of the sentencing statute. The revision of the guideline range does not alter the conclusion that the sentence of 54 months is reasonable considering all the circumstances. [<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>Given the District Court\u2019s statements regarding the appropriateness of Johnson\u2019s sentence, we do not believe the Court improperly treated Guidelines \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(2)(B) as mandating a specific result, nor did it abuse its discretion in denying Johnson\u2019s motion to reduce his sentence further, which, in any event, remained well below the revised Guidelines range.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b152-7\">. The District Court had jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3231 and 3582. We have appellate jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b152-14\">. At Johnson\u2019s sentencing hearing, the District Judge took great care to balance the applicable 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors before arriving at his sentence. The Court specifically noted that, in determining an appropriate sentence, it could not overlook <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>the seriousness of the offense, particularly because a firearm was involved. Nonetheless, the Court granted Johnson \"a significant departure,\u201d and over two years \"below the range that had been asked for by the Government.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
