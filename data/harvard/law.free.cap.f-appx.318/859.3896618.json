At sentencing on May 21, 1996, the district court made the following Guidelines calculations. The court fixed appellant\u2019s offense level at 40 and his criminal history category at IV; that yielded a sentence range calling for imprisonment for term between 360 months and life. The court sentenced appellant to prison term of 360 months. He appealed his sentence, and we affirmed. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>117 F.3d 1431 (11th Cir.1997)(Table).</p>\n<p id=\"b884-17\">On December 12, 2007, appellant moved the district court pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) based on Amendment 706 to the Guidelines, which amended the base offense levels in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) applicable to <em>cocaine </em>base (the drug <em>for </em>which appellant was held accountable at sentencing), <em>see </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, amends. 706, 711, 713 (Supp. May 1, 2008). Amendment 706 prescribed a two-level reduction of appellant\u2019s offense level (from 40 to 38). Appellant urged the court to treat the resulting sentence range as advisory and reduce his sentence to a term below the sentence range because of his post-sentencing rehabilitation. The court granted the prescribed two-level reduction, which, combined with a criminal history category of IV, resulted in a sentence range of 324 to 405 months\u2019 imprisonment. The court then reduced appellant\u2019s prison term to 324 months. Appellant now appeals. He argues that, although U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(1) limited the offense level reduction under Amendment 706 to two levels, a further reduction was permissible because the Guidelines, including \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(1), are advisory in all contexts. To this end, he submits that, pursuant to the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Booker</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and <em>Kimbrough</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em>, </em>every provision of the Guidelines is advisory in every case, irrespective of the context. He adds that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>while <em>United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1220 (11th Cir.2005), holds that <em>Booker </em>does not apply in \u00a7 3582 proceedings, the holding in <em>Moreno </em>was only that neither \u00a7 3582 nor <em>Booker </em>provides a jurisdictional basis to reduce a sentence for post-sentencing rehabilitative conduct. Finally, he contends that his sentence of 324 months is unreasonable because it is greater than necessary to fulfill the purposes of sentencing set out in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), especially in light of his post sentence rehabilitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">We held this appeal in abeyance pending this court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Melvin. Melvin </em>has been decided, 556 F.3d 1190 (11th Cir.2009), and it controls our decision here. <em>Booker </em>and <em>Kimbrough </em>are inapposite; their holdings do not apply in \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings. Amendment 706 only authorized the district court to do what it did, which was to lower appellant\u2019s offense level. It did not authorize the court to resentence appellant anew.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b884-14\">. <em>United States v.
