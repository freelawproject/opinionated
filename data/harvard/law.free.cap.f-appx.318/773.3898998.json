In his motion to vacate, Hinsey argued, under Rule 52(a), that the district court failed to give the facts and legal reasoning that it relied on in denying his \u00a7 3582 motion. On appeal, Hinsey argues that he was entitled to a reduction of sentence based on Amendment 599 because he was given a weapons enhancement on top of his conviction for using a firearm during the commission of a felony, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b797-25\">We review our subject matter jurisdiction <em>de novo. United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1245 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam). \u201cIn a criminal case, a defendant\u2019s notice of appeal must be filed in the district court within 10 days ... of the entry of either the judgment or the order being appealed____\u201d Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(1)(A)(i). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>A motion in a criminal case \u201cmust be filed within the period of time allotted for the filing of a notice of an appeal\u201d in order to toll the time for filing the notice of appeal and give us jurisdiction to consider the underlying motion. <em>See United States v. Russo, </em>760 F.2d 1229, 1230 (11th Cir.1985) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\">Here, the district court denied Hinsey\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion on January 8, 2007. Hinsey filed his motion to vacate the denial of his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion on January 26, 2007. As such, Hulsey\u2019s motion to vacate was not filed within 10 days of the district court\u2019s denial of his \u00a7 3582 motion. Therefore, we do not have jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s denial of his underlying \u00a7 3582 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">In contrast, we do have jurisdiction to consider Hinsey\u2019s appeal of the denial of his motion to vacate because his notice of appeal was filed within ten business days of the district court\u2019s denial of his motion. However, when an appellant does not raise an issue on appeal, it is abandoned. <em>See Greenbriar, Ltd. v. City of Alabaster, </em>881 F.2d 1570, 1573 n. 6 (11th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">On appeal, Hinsey only challenges the district court\u2019s denial of his \u00a7 3582 motion. As previously stated, we do not have jurisdiction to consider that denial. He does not challenge the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to vacate. Therefore, he has abandoned that claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-7\">Even if we were to liberally construe Hinsey\u2019s brief on appeal as a challenge to the district court\u2019s denial of his Fed. R.CivP. 52(a) motion to vacate, we would find no reversible error. The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure cannot be used to challenge the denial of a \u00a7 3582 motion. <em>See United States v. Fair, </em>326 F.3d 1317, 1317 (11th Cir.2003) (per curiam). \u201c[T]he Federal Rules of Civil Procedure \u2018unambiguously\u2019 limited their application to <em>civil </em>cases.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1318. \u201c[A] \u00a7 3582 motion is not a civil post-conviction action, but rather a continuation of a criminal case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure cannot be used to challenge the denial of a \u00a7 3582 motion, Hinsey cannot use Fed.R.CivP. 52(a) to challenge the district court\u2019s denial of his \u00a7 3582 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-9\">Upon review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we discern no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Hinsey\u2019s motion to vacate. We dismiss Kinsey\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction to the extent that he appeals the denial of his \u00a7 3582 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-10\">DISMISSED IN PART, AFFIRMED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
