Appellant argues that law enforcement unlawfully entered the constitutionally protected curtilage surrounding his home because, at the time of entry, they did not have probable cause to secure Appellant\u2019s residence and no exigent circumstances justified a belief that evidence of methamphetamine trafficking would be destroyed or removed before a warrant could be obtained. The district court\u2019s factual findings are not in dispute. Moreover, the parties are familiar with the facts, which we repeat here only to the extent necessary. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review the denial of a motion to suppress evidence de novo, <em>see United States v. Bynum, </em>362 F.3d 574, 578 (9th Cir.2004), and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-15\">It is undisputed that the detectives and officers did not have a warrant at the time they approached Appellant\u2019s residence with the intent of contacting him and \u201cfreezing\u201d the scene until Detective Seanor arrived with a search warrant. It is also undisputed that Appellant\u2019s backyard is considered part of his home\u2019s curtilage and therefore deserving Fourth Amendment protection. <em>See Oliver v. United States, </em>466 U.S. 170, 180, 104 S.Ct. 1735, 80 L.Ed.2d 214 (1984) (Curtilage is \u201cthe area to which extends the intimate activity associated with the sanctity of a [person\u2019s] home and the privacies of life.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-16\">The securing of a residence by law enforcement is a seizure subject to Fourth Amendment protection. <em>United States v. Howard, </em>828 F.2d 552, 554 (9th Cir.1987); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number><em>United States v. Lindsey, </em>877 F.2d 777, 780 (9th Cir.1989). Warrantless searches or entries on a home\u2019s curtilage are per se illegal unless they fall within a recognized exception to the Fourth Amendment\u2019s warrant requirement. <em>United States v. Ojeda, </em>276 F.3d 486, 488 (9th Cir.2002). Exigent circumstances will justify a warrantless entry, search or seizure when officers \u201cacting on probable cause and in good faith, reasonably believe from the totality of the circumstances that (a) evidence or contraband will imminently be destroyed or (b) the nature of the crime or character of the suspect(s) pose a risk of danger to the arresting officers or third persons.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal citation omitted). The existence of exigent circumstances is a fact-specific inquiry where the government bears the burden of demonstrating specific facts to justify the finding of exigent circumstances. <em>United States v. Arellano-Ochoa, </em>461 F.3d 1142, 1145 (9th Cir.2006). The government must also show that a warrant could not have been obtained in time. <em>Howard, </em>828 F.2d at 555; <em>Lindsey, </em>877 F.2d at 780.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">Probable cause exists where \u201cthe known facts and circumstances are sufficient to warrant a [person] of reasonable prudence in the belief that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found.\u201d <em>Ornelas v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 690, 696, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996). Based on the undisputed factual findings of the lower court, evidence of methamphetamine trafficking was obtained nearby in Appellant\u2019s motel rooms. The movement and behavior of Appellant tracked by Det. Sea-nor, including the presence of activity in Appellant\u2019s residence after several days of inactivity, supported the detectives\u2019 conclusion that by a fair probability, evidence of methamphetamine trafficking might be found at Appellant\u2019s residence if he was home. We also give due weight to Det. Seanor\u2019s securing of a search warrant within minutes of the officers\u2019 contact of Appellant at his home, based on the same or similar facts. <em>See Ornelas, </em>517 U.S. at 699, 116 S.Ct. 1657. We further note that Appellant does not deny that probable cause existed to support the issuance of a search warrant. Accordingly, we find that probable cause existed to secure Appellant\u2019s residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">We also find that exigent circumstances were present to justify the warrantless presence of officers inside the curtilage of Appellant\u2019s home. The evidence obtained from the motel room that Appellant was engaged in drug trafficking, combined with the sudden activity in the residence and the observation of a Jeep leaving Appellant\u2019s garage collectively supported the detectives\u2019 belief that Appellant was preparing to transport methamphetamine and that immediate action was warranted to prevent him from doing so. Det. Seanor ordered the traffic stop of the Jeep shortly before the officers entered the curtilage. In addition, Appellant had previously demonstrated a level of sophistication about surveillance, taking steps to avoid detection by washing out all of the plastic bags in the motel room. Lastly, we note that the officers, while in the curtilage of Appellant\u2019s home, were 20 feet from the backdoor\u2014their presence only there in the event that Appellant sought to escape from the backdoor.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">We also find that the government adequately showed that a warrant to search Appellant\u2019s home could not have been obtained prior to the officers\u2019 contact with Appellant. Although evidence of narcotics activity was available earlier, it was not unreasonable for Det. Seanor to wait to obtain the warrant. Based on his training and experience, Det. Seanor believed that evidence of narcotics trafficking would be found in Appellant\u2019s residence and that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>would be more likely to discover such evidence while Appellant was actually present at his home. After observing activity at the residence, Det. Seanor began preparing the search warrant and was on his way to obtaining a search warrant at the time of the incident at issue. We will not penalize him for showing restraint in pursuing further investigation rather than bursting into an occupied dwelling on mere suspicion.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">In conclusion, while Det. Seanor was en route to obtaining a warrant, the officers, based on the totality of circumstances of the facts before them, reasonably believed that evidence of methamphetamine trafficking might be destroyed or removed if they did not secure the residence immediately. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s denial of Appellant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b572-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b574-5\">REINHARDT, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AIBT\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">I agree essentially with the majority that exigent circumstances existed that justified the officers\u2019 entering the curtilage before Detective Seanor could return to the house with a warrant. I believe such circumstances arose when other officers who were a part of the law enforcement operation followed, and then stopped and searched, the vehicle that left the house carrying methamphetamine. A sufficient risk existed that the occupants of the vehicle bearing the narcotics would notify the persons remaining in the house that a drug-bust was underway.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
