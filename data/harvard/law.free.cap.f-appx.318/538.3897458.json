On July 31, 2001, Johnson was convicted by a jury in California Superior Court of first degree murder, Cal. Penal Code \u00a7 187(a), attempted second degree robbery, <em>id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 211, 664, and second degree burglary, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 459. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">Johnson\u2019s claims do not warrant relief under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d). Under AEDPA, habeas relief may be granted only upon a finding that the last reasoned state court decision rejecting Johnson\u2019s claims \u201cwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States; or resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-9\">The California Court of Appeal\u2019s determination that Johnson\u2019s second appointed counsel did not render ineffective assistance of counsel was not contrary to, or an unreasonable application of <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Nor was this conclusion an unreasonable determination of the facts, as it is clear that Johnson\u2019s second attorney did not perform deficiently. In the brief time he represented Johnson, the attorney appeared in court on Johnson\u2019s behalf on four occasions, retrieved and initiated his review of the extensive files prepared by Johnson\u2019s previous attorney, conferred briefly with the previous attorney, and opened his phone line to receive collect calls from Johnson.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-12\">Moreover, shortly after his second attorney was appointed, Johnson expressed determination to have him replaced due to an alleged conflict of interest that had no basis in reality, as both the attorney and the trial court explained to Johnson. Under these circumstances, the attorney\u2019s failure to make further preparations or to visit Johnson was justified by Johnson\u2019s uncooperative refusal to accept, and dogged attempts to remove, his new attorney. Although trial was less than two months away when the attorney was appointed, the attorney had a reasonable expectation that trial would be postponed due to Johnson\u2019s interference. That the court did postpone the trial for two months confirms the reasonableness of this expectation. In light of Johnson\u2019s uncooperative behavior, it is not reasonable to expect a competent attorney to do more. Because the attorney\u2019s representation was not deficient, Johnson\u2019s ineffective assistance claim fails, and we need not consider prejudice. <em>See Delgadillo v. Woodford, </em>527 F.3d 919, 930 n. 5 (9th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-13\">Nor did the California Court of Appeal contradict or unreasonably apply clearly established federal law in upholding the trial court\u2019s denial of Johnson\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>motion to substitute counsel. Any conflict between Johnson and his second attorney resulted from Johnson\u2019s unfounded suspicions that another of his attorney\u2019s clients was a potential criminal informant in his case, and from Johnson\u2019s insistent attempts to replace his attorney. The pre-AEDPA caselaw upon which Johnson relies is inapposite. To warrant relief under AEDPA, \u201cthere must be a showing of an <em>actual </em>conflict, namely that a defendant\u2019s attorney is representing conflicting interests.\u201d <em>Plumlee v. Masto, </em>512 F.3d 1204, 1210 (9th Cir.2008) (en banc) (emphasis in original). Johnson fails to make this showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b563-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
