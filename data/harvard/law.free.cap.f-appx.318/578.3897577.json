Appellants seek review of the Administrative Appeals Office\u2019s (\u201cAAO\u201d) decision revoking Yu\u2019s employment-based visa petition. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Because the evidence does not compel the conclusion that Yu was engaged in primarily executive or managerial duties, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">We review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo. <em>Family Inc. v. U.S. Citizenship &amp; Immigration Servs., </em>469 F.3d 1313, 1315 (9th Cir.2006). \u201cHowever, the underlying agency action may be set aside only if \u2018arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A)). An agency\u2019s factual findings are reviewed for substantial evidence and will not be overturned \u201cunless the evidence presented would <em>compel </em>a reasonable finder of fact to reach a contrary result.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). In order to revoke a previously approved visa petition, the government must have \u201cgood and sufficient cause,\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1155, which means only that the government \u201cretains at least the burden of producing substantial evidence supporting its determination,\u201d <em>Tongatapu Woodcraft Hawaii, Ltd. v. Feldman, </em>736 F.2d 1305, 1309 (9th Cir.1984). Thus, despite appellants\u2019 contention, \u201cour analysis is not affected by the fact that this case arises out of a visa petition revocation as opposed to the initial denial of a visa petition.\u201d <em>Love Korean Church v. Chertoff, </em>549 F.3d 749, 754 n. 3 (9th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">\u201cA United States employer may file a petition on Form 1-140 for classification of an alien ... as a multinational executive or manager.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 204.5(j)(l). An alien qualifies as a multinational executive or manager if, \u201cin the 3 years preceding the time of the alien\u2019s application ..., [the alien] has been employed for at least 1 year by a firm or corporation ... or subsidiary thereof and the alien seeks to enter the United States in order to continue to render services to the same employer ... in a capacity that is managerial or executive.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1153(b)(1)(C).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-8\">The term \u2018managerial capacity\u2019 means an assignment within an organization in which the employee primarily\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-9\">(i) manages the organization, or a department, subdivision, function, or component of the organization;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-10\">(ii) supervises and controls the work of other supervisory, professional, or managerial employees, or manages an essential function within the organization, or a department or subdivision of the organization;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-11\">(iii) if another employee or other employees are directly supervised, has the authority to hire and fire or recommend those as well as other personnel actions (such as promotion and leave authorization) or, if no other employee is directly supervised, functions at a senior level within the organizational hierarchy or with respect to the function managed; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-12\">(iv) exercises discretion over the day-today operations of the activity or function for which the employee has authority.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-13\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1101(a)(44)(A). The statute further provides that a \u201cfirst-line supervisor is not considered to be acting in a managerial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>capacity merely by virtue of the supervisor\u2019s supervisory duties unless the employees supervised are professional.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-5\">The term \u2018executive capacity\u201d means an assignment within an organization in which the employee primarily\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-6\">(i) directs the management of the organization or a major component or function of the organization;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-7\">(ii) establishes the goals and policies of the organization, component, or function;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-8\">(iii) exercises wide latitude in discretionary decision-making; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-9\">(iv) receives only general supervision or direction from higher level executives, the board of directors, or stockholders of the organization.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b605-10\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1101(a)(44)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-11\">Appellants argue the AAO\u2019s decision was arbitrary and capricious for three reasons. First, appellants claim the AAO\u2019s reasoning was inconsistent throughout the proceedings. This argument is unpersuasive. Though the basis for the agency\u2019s various rulings evolved as additional evidence was submitted, the agency consistently maintained that there was insufficient evidence that Yu would be employed in a primarily executive or managerial capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-12\">Second, appellants argue the AAO improperly based its decision on Top Set\u2019s small size. Appellants concede, however, that we are reviewing only the AAO\u2019s final decision, which did not mention Top Set\u2019s small size as a factor in its decision. Even if the AAO had considered Top Set\u2019s size, this would not have constituted error: though \u201can organization\u2019s small size, standing alone, cannot support a finding that its employee is not acting in a managerial capacity, ... size is nevertheless a relevant factor in assessing whether an organization\u2019s operations are substantial enough to support a manager.\u201d <em>Brazil Quality Stones, Inc. v. Chertoff, </em>531 F.3d 1063, 1070 (9th Cir.2008) (internal marks and citation omitted); <em>see also Family Inc., </em>469 F.3d at 1316 (\u201cUSCIS may properly consider an organization\u2019s small size as one factor in assessing whether its operations are substantial enough to support a manager.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-14\">Appellants\u2019 final contention is that the AAO ignored or disregarded evidence that Yu was employed as an executive or manager. The record does not support this contention. There is no indication the AAO ignored the evidence before it. On the contrary, the AAO quoted in full appellants\u2019 description of Yu\u2019s duties, then compared that description to the statutory requirements and found that it was, \u201cfor the most part, ... a generic description paraphrasing elements of the definitions of managerial or executive capacity.\u201d Though some overlap in language between the statute and the job descriptions is probably unavoidable, it was not unreasonable for the AAO to require more than mere recitation before finding that an employee qualifies as a manager or executive. Otherwise, every petition would succeed simply by regurgitating the statutory requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-15\">More fundamentally, even if we accept that Yu performed <em>some </em>managerial or executive duties, appellants have failed to show that Yu was <em>primarily </em>engaged in such activities. In <em>Brazil Quality Stones, </em>this court reviewed the AAO\u2019s decision that the president and chief executive officer of Brazil Quality Stones (\u201cBQS\u201d) was not \u201cprimarily employed in a managerial or executive capacity.\u201d 531 F.3d at 1067. His duties included: \u201c(1) supervising and managing BQS\u2019s office and business affairs; (2) overseeing capital investment opportunities; (3) developing plans to further channels of distribution; (4) hiring and firing all employees and supervising <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>managers; (5) overseeing domestic and international sales; and (6) managing outsourced relationships with BQS\u2019s accounting firm and warehouse.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). The AAO, however, \u201cdetermined that BQS has not yet reached the level of organizational sophistication in which ... [petitioner] could devote his primary attention to managerial duties as opposed to operational ones, even though he held a position at the head of BQS\u2019s corporate structure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1070. The AAO \u201cconcluded that ... [the president\u2019s] direct involvement in the corporation\u2019s daily operations was necessary for its success and that such fact precluded ... [him] from qualifying as a managerial employee.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This court held that, though \u201cthe record contains evidence that ... [the president] performed managerial tasks, it does not compel the conclusion that such tasks comprised his primary responsibilities at BQS.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1071.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">The same can be said about Top Set: its current level of \u201corganizational sophistication\u201d necessitates that Yu, despite her \u201cposition at the head of ... [Top Set\u2019s] corporate structure,\u201d be involved in \u201coperational\u201d duties, such as marketing, designing a computer system, and planning in-house training, which \u201cprecluded ... [her] from qualifying as a managerial [or executive] employee.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 1070. Because the evidence does not compel the conclusion that Yu was engaged in primarily executive or managerial duties, the agency\u2019s decision was not arbitrary, capricious, an abuse, of discretion, or contrary to law. We therefore uphold the decision of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b604-6\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.

Yu entered the country in 2000 and lives here with her husband and two children. I would hold that the AAO\u2019s determination was arbitrary and capricious because it failed to adequately consider the evidence Yu presented regarding her qualifications as an executive or manager. While Top Set did recite the statutory and regulatory requirements for Yu\u2019s position, it went further to specifically describe some of Yu\u2019s many job duties. These duties include planning and designing a computer system, planning and designing an in-house employee training program concerning Top Set\u2019s products and services, and developing a plan to expand Top Set\u2019s marketing capabilities. These are all duties consistent with an executive or managerial position. Accordingly, the record requires me to conclude that Yu was performing as an executive or manager of Top Set.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
