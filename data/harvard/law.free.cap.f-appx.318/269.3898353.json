The district court denied Davis leave to proceed IFP both in his civil action and on appeal after concluding that Davis was barred from proceeding IFP under the three-strikes provision in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). That provision prohibits a prisoner from proceeding IFP if he has \u201con three prior occasions during detention, had an action or appeal dismissed as frivolous, malicious, or for failing to state a claim.\u201d <em>Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 385 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-23\">The district court determined that Davis had earned strikes under \u00a7 1915(g) based on the dismissal, as frivolous, of Davis\u2019s claims in <em>Davis v. Bryant, </em>No. 6:03-CV-564, at 1 (E.D.Tex. March 17, 2004); the dismissal, as frivolous, of Davis\u2019s appeal in <em>Davis v. Bryant, </em>No. 04-40471, at 1-2 (5th Cir. Dec.17, 2004); and the dismissal, as frivolous, of Davis\u2019s claim in <em>Davis v. Dela-rossa, </em>No. 3:06-CV-368, at 1 (S.D.Tex. Feb. 19, 2008). However, the district court erred in attributing a strike to Davis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>for the district court\u2019s dismissal of his claim in <em>Davis, </em>No. 3:06-CV-368, at 1. Davis\u2019s appeal from that decision, <em>Davis v. Delarosa, </em>No. 08-11329, is still pending in this court. A dismissal as frivolous of a complaint may not be counted as a strike for purposes of \u00a7 1915(g) until the appellate process has been exhausted or waived. <em>Adepegba, </em>103 F.3d at 387.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">We have not identified any other actions and appeals in which Davis has accumulated a strike for purposes of \u00a7 1915(g). As Davis has only two strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), the district court erred in determining that he was barred under that provision from proceeding IFP both in the district court and on appeal. Accordingly, we grant Davis leave to proceed IFP on appeal and assess an appellate filing fee in accordance with \u00a7 1915(b)(1). We direct the district court to calculate Davis\u2019s initial partial filing fee and to order collection of that fee and the remaining installments from him in accordance with \u00a7 1915(b). Moreover, we vacate the denial of Davis\u2019s motion to proceed IFP in the district court, and remand Davis\u2019s case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">IFP ON APPEAL GRANTED; APPELLATE FILING FEE ASSESSED; DENIAL OF MOTION TO PROCEED IFP IN THE DISTRICT COURT VACATED; CASE REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b293-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
