After examining the briefs and the record, we have concluded that oral argument is unnecessary. See Fed. R.App. P. 34(a); Cir. R. 34(0-</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b458-26\">Order</p>\n<p id=\"b458-27\">After we affirmed his conviction and sentence for crack-cocaine offenses, Yam-ango Jiles asked the district court to reduce that sentence under the retroactive amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines. The district court recalculated Jiles\u2019s range under the amended guidelines and summarily reduced his sentence from 282 months in prison to 226 months in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>Despite this favorable outcome, Jiles filed a notice of appeal. His counsel has moved to withdraw under <em>Anders, </em>explaining that she cannot find a non-frivolous issue. Jiles has not taken the opportunity to respond extended under Circuit Rule 51(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">We agree with counsel\u2019s assessment. Procedures under the retroactive guideline amendment are designed to be summary; the prisoner does not have a right to a full resentencing and does not have any entitlement to a reduction greater than the Sentencing Commission has authorized. See <em>United States v. Cunningham, </em>554 F.3d 703 (7th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Forman, </em>553 F.3d 585 (7th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Poole, </em>550 F.3d 676 (7th Cir.2008) (all discussing the amended crack guidelines). And because the district judge gave Jiles the full benefit of the lower range, it is impossible to perceive any non-frivolous appellate issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">Counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is granted, and the appeal is dismissed as frivolous.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
