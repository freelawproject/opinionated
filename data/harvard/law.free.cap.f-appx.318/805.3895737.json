Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 785 (11th Cir.2005). In conducting this review, we apply a deferential abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. -,-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). A defendant challenging his sentence bears the burden of establishing that it is unreasonable. <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-16\">We first review whether the district court committed a procedural error, such as incorrectly calculating the Guidelines, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, imposing a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at -, 128 S.Ct. at 597. Procedurally, a district court is not required to give notice that it intends to impose an above guideline range sentence. <em>Irizarry v. Unites States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-,-, 128 S.Ct. 2198, 2202-03, 171 L.Ed.2d 28 (2008). Further, a court may consider conduct that supported enhancement of a defendant\u2019s guideline offense level to vary upward from the recommended guideline range. <em>United States v. Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d 823, 833-34 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 671, 169 L.Ed.2d 526 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b830-23\">If there are no procedural errors in the sentence, we \u201cthen consider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at-, 128 S.Ct. at 597. The review involves inquiring into whether the \u00a7 3353(a) factors support the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>sentence. <em>Id. </em>at-, 128 S.Ct. at 600. The factors presented in \u00a7 3553(a) include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ABi\">(1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care; (6) the kinds of sentences available; (7) the Sentencing Guideline range; (8) pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to victims.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b831-6\"><em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 786; <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). After considering these factors, the court \u201cmust make an individualized assessment based on the facts presented.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at-, 128 S.Ct. at 597. However, the sentencing court is not required to discuss each individual factor when determining a sentence. <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329-30 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b831-8\">We have acknowledged that the Supreme Court in <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007), has upheld other circuits\u2019 decisions recognizing a presumption of reasonableness for within-range sentences, but we do not \u201cpresume reasonable a sentence within the properly calculated Guideline range.\u201d <em>United States v. Campbell, </em>491 F.3d 1306, 1313-14 (11th Cir.2007). We have recognized that \u201cthere is a range of reasonable sentences from which the district court may choose.\u201d <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-11\">Having reviewed the record and the briefs of the parties, we discern no error. Pinero\u2019s sentence is procedurally reasonable because the district court correctly calculated the Guidelines, treated the Guidelines as advisory, considered \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s factors, and explained its chosen sentence. The district court was not required to give advance notice that it intended to upwardly vary from the Guidelines. <em>See Irizarry, </em>\u2014 U.S. at-, 128 S.Ct. at 2202-03. Further, the district court was not prohibited from considering aspects of Pinero\u2019s conduct that enhanced his guideline offense level. <em>See Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d at 833-34. Likewise, Pinero\u2019s sentence is substantively reasonable. In light of the life-ending injuries sustained by one of the aliens during Pinero\u2019s <em>Vh </em>hour attempt to evade Coast Guard officials and Pinero\u2019s criminal history, the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the advisory guideline range was inadequate and determining that a substantially higher sentence was appropriate and reasonable. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b830-11\">. On appeal, Pinero does not challenge: (1) his convictions; (2) his 60-month sentence for failure to obey a United States Coast Guard (\"USCG\u201d) order to heave to, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2237(a)(1), (2) (Count 14); or (3) the district court's calculation of the Guidelines. Therefore, he abandoned any arguments with respect to those issues. <em>United States v. Blasco, </em>702 F.2d 1315, 1332 n. 28 (11th Cir.1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
