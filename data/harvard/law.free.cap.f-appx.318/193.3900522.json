R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A). A district court may extend the time to file a notice of appeal if a party moves for an extension within thirty days after expiration of the original appeal period and the party has shown excusable neglect or good cause warranting an extension. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5)(A); <em>Washington v. Bumgarner, </em>882 F.2d 899, 900-01 (4th Cir.1989). A bare notice of appeal does not constitute a motion for an extension of time, however, if \u201cno request for additional time is manifest.\u201d <em>Shah v. Hutto, </em>722 F.2d 1167, 1168-69 (4th Cir.1983) (en banc). The time period within which to file a notice of appeal is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Dir., Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">The district court\u2019s order denying Smith\u2019s motion was entered on the docket on December 2, 2008. The notice of appeal was filed on January 6, 2009. Smith did not move for an extension of time nor did his notice of appeal include a request for additional time. Because Smith failed to file a timely notice of appeal or to obtain an extension or reopening of the appeal period,, we dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-11\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b218-6\"> Although Smith did not specify whether his post-judgment \u201cReply in Support of Venue Opposing Court Decision\u201d was filed pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e) or 60(b), because it was filed within the ten-day time limit for Rule 59(e) motions, it is treated as such. <em>See Dove v. CODESCO, </em>569 F.2d 807, 809 (4th Cir. 1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
