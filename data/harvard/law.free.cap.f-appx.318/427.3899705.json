The district court denied the petition and Thomas appeals. We affirm the judgment.<footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b452-10\">Thomas is serving an <em>aggregate </em>sentence of 20 years to life on his convictions in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia for two violent assaults. He first became eligible for parole in 2004, but by then Congress had tasked the United States Parole Commission with the authority to grant or deny parole to former D.C. prisoners, <em>see </em>D.C.Code \u00a7 24-131, all of whom Congress had transferred to federal custody, <em>see </em>D.C.Code \u00a7 24-101. The Commission issued parole guidelines applicable to D.C. prisoners whose initial parole hearing occurred on or after August 5,1998, including Thomas. <em>See </em>28 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.80(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-13\">At Thomas\u2019s initial parole hearing, the Parole Commission applied its guidelines and denied parole. Three years later, in August 2006, the Commission again denied parole and scheduled another review for 2009. Thomas then filed his \u00a7 2241 petition claiming that the Commission had violated the ex post facto clause by applying its own guidelines, rather than the D.C. guidelines in effect when he was sentenced in 1990. Thomas also claimed that the Commission had violated the due process clause by failing to adhere to the guidelines that it did apply. If not for these alleged errors, Thomas argued, he would now be on parole. He demanded that the Commission be directed to set a parole date.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-14\">On appeal Thomas repeats his due process and ex post facto clause arguments, which, as questions of law, we review de novo. <em>See Rodriguez v. United States, </em>286 F.3d 972, 978 (7th Cir.2002). His due process argument fails because the District of Columbia\u2019s parole statute is discretionary, D.C.Code \u00a7 24-404(a) (1987); <em>Ellis v. District of Columbia, </em>84 F.3d 1413, 1420 (D.C.Cir.1996), and does not create a liberty interest in parole, <em>Thompson v. Veach, </em>501 F.3d 832, 836-37 (7th Cir.2007). With no liberty interest at stake, there can be no due process violation. <em>Id. </em>at 837.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-15\">Thomas\u2019s ex post facto clause argument also falls short. To succeed, Thomas would need to show either that the Parole Commission\u2019s guidelines are harsher than the D.C. guidelines they replaced or that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>application of the Commission\u2019s guidelines \u201ccreated a significant risk of increasing\u201d his punishment. <em>See Garner v. Jones, </em>529 U.S. 244, 255, 120 S.Ct. 1362, 146 L.Ed.2d 236 (2000); <em>Glascoe v. Bezy, </em>421 F.3d 543, 547-48 (7th Cir.2005). Because each set of guidelines incorporates very similar factors, <em>see, e.g., </em>28 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.80(e)-(g); 28 D.C. Mun. Regs. \u00a7 204.18 (1987), the Commission\u2019s guidelines are not harsher. <em>See Glascoe, </em>421 F.3d at 547. Moreover, the factors that the Commission weighed in denying parole to Thomas-his minimum sentence, his disciplinary infractions, his history of violence, and his programming achievement-would have been considered under the D.C. guidelines. <em>See </em>28 D.C. Mun. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 204.4, 204.18, 204.22 (1987); D.C.Code \u00a7 24-203. Likewise, under either set of guidelines the Commission could have granted or denied parole notwithstanding the guidelines\u2019 recommendation. <em>See </em>28 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.80(n); 28 D.C. Mun. Regs. \u00a7 204.22. Given these similarities, Thomas cannot show that the Commission\u2019s use of its own guidelines subjected him to a significant risk of increased punishment. <em>See Glascoe, </em>421 F.3d at 548-49.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">We therefore AFFIRM the district court\u2019s denial of Thomas\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b452-11\"> Thomas's motion to file a supplemental appendix is granted.
