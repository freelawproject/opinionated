No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-21\">Petitioner was convicted of armed robbery, false imprisonment, and possession of a weapon during the commission of a crime on 29 February 2000. Petitioner\u2019s convictions and sentence were affirmed on appeal. Petitioner filed a state habeas petition challenging his convictions and sentence and was denied relief after an evidentiary hearing. The Georgia Supreme Court denied Petitioner a certificate of probable cause to appeal the denial of state habeas relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-22\">On 14 December 2004, Petitioner filed this federal habeas corpus petition. Petitioner argued that his defense counsel rendered constitutionally deficient assistance at trial and on appeal. Petitioner claimed counsel was ineffective because she failed (1) to move for a mistrial after the judge expressed his opinion on the evidence; (2) to cross-examine the victim about his drug dealing and to introduce evidence that vie-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>tim\u2019s drug involvement motivated him to lie; (3) to argue on appeal that the trial judge abused his discretion by limiting cross-examination of the victim about the victim\u2019s drug activity; and (4) cumulatively to preserve issues and provide effective counsel at both the trial and appellate stages. The district court denied Petitioner\u2019s claims and dismissed his petition: Petitioner failed to show that the state habe-as court\u2019s decision was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, Supreme Court precedent. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\">Our review of a final state habeas judgment is highly deferential to the state court under section 2254. Section 2254 provides expressly that \u201ca determination of a factual issue made by a State court shall be presumed to be correct,\u201d and \u201c[t]he applicant shall have the burden of rebutting the presumption of correctness by clear and convincing evidence.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1). Unless a state court\u2019s adjudication \u201c(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States; or (2) resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d), a federal court may grant no relief. <em>See Crowe v. Hall, </em>490 F.3d 840, 844 (11th Cir.2007).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b870-7\">The Georgia court looked correctly to <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), to test Petitioner\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Under the two-part <em>Strickland </em>test, the habeas petitioner must show (1) objectively unreasonable performance: \u201cthat counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the \u2018counsel\u2019 guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment,\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>104 S.Ct. at 2064; and (2) actual prejudice: \u201ca reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2068. As we have said, the test for reasonable assistance of counsel \u201chas nothing to do with what the best lawyers would have done. Nor is the test even what most good lawyers would have done. We ask only whether some reasonable lawyer\u201d could have acted, in the circumstances, as Petitioner\u2019s counsel acted. <em>See White v. Singletary, </em>972 F.2d 1218, 1220-21 (11th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b870-9\">Both parts of the <em>Strickland </em>test must be established for the petitioner to carry his burden on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. <em>Strickland, </em>104 S.Ct. at 2064. The Georgia court concluded that Petitioner failed to overcome the presump7 tion of effective performance accorded to counsel,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>see Strickland, </em>104 S.Ct. at 2066 (\u201ccounsel is strongly presumed to have rendered adequate assistance and made all significant decisions in the exercise of rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>sonable professional judgment\u201d); and failed also to show the requisite prejudice. To prevail on his ineffective assistance claim, Petitioner must establish that the state court decision was objectively unreasonable. <em>See Bell v. Cone, </em>535 U.S. 685, 122 S.Ct. 1843, 1852, 152 L.Ed.2d 914 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">We cannot say the Georgia court decision on trial counsel\u2019s performance was objectively unreasonable. The Georgia court concluded that valid reasons supported trial counsel\u2019s acts.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Based on our review of the record, Petitioner has shown neither that the state habeas court\u2019s decision contravened <em>Strickland </em>nor that it was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b871-6\">About Petitioner\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim based on appellate counsel\u2019s failure to raise properly on appeal Petitioner\u2019s claim that the trial court abused its discretion by limiting cross-examination of the victim, the Georgia court stated that Petitioner failed to overcome the presumption of reasonable professional assistance. <em>See Strickland, </em>104 S.Ct. at 2065. That counsel failed to raise properly a claim on appeal can serve\u2014if at all\u2014as a predicate for a constitutionally deficient counsel charge only if the forfeited claim was meritorious. As explained in the federal magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation, additional cross-examination would have been cumulative; the limitation constituted no abuse of discretion<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and supports no ineffective assistance of counsel claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-8\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b870-5\">. We reject Petitioner's claim that the deference due the Georgia habeas decision is undermined by the Georgia Supreme Court's decision in <em>Edwards v. Lewis, </em>283 Ga. 345, 658 S.E.2d 116 (2008). In <em>Edwards </em>the petitioner was allowed no meaningful opportunity to respond to the state\u2019s allegations contained in an order drafted by the state and issued by the habeas court. <em>Edwards </em>does not speak to the deference required by federal statute, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d) and factually is too different. The order at issue here was prepared by the Attorney General's office after an evidentiary hearing and after the state habeas judge orally denied relief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b870-11\">. Petitioner's counsel was experienced; she had over twenty years of practice experience at the time of her appointment to Petitioner's case, including experience as a juvenile court prosecutor. \"When courts are examining the performance of an experienced trial counsel, the presumption that his conduct was reasonable is even stronger.\u201d <em>Chandler v. United States, </em>218 F.3d 1305, 1316 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b871-19\">. About counsel\u2019s failure to move for a mistrial when the judge commented on the evidence, the Georgia court noted that counsel decided that the demeanor of the witness\u2014 visibly high on drugs\u2014worked much to the defense's advantage; Petitioner and his counsel wanted the jury which had witnessed this behavior\u2014which was consistent with the defense's position on the victim\u2019s involvement with drugs\u2014to be the jury that decided the charges against Petitioner.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b871-20\">. Also without merit is Petitioner's claim that counsel's failure to argue on appeal her own trial court ineffectiveness constituted ineffective assistance of appellate counsel. Although the Georgia court mistakenly said that counsel believed she could not raise an ineffective assistance claim against herself\u2014she testified to the contrary\u2014Petitioner proffered no evidence at the evidentiary hearing before the Georgia habeas court that a failure to raise an ineffective assistance of counsel claim against oneself is unreasonable \u201cunder prevailing professional norms.\u201d <em>See Strickland, </em>104 S.Ct. at 2064-65. In any event, because Petitioner fails to show his counsel was ineffective at trial, he can make no showing that her failure to raise an ineffective assistance claim on appeal worked to his prejudice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b871-24\">. Petitioner\u2019s cumulative-error claim based on counsel\u2019s failure to preserve issues and to provide adequate counsel is without merit. <em>See United States v. Waldon, </em>363 F.3d 1103, 1110 (11th Cir.2004) (where there is no error or only a single error, there can be no cumulative error).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
