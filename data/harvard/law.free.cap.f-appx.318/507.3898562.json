Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 926 (9th Cir.2005); <em>Torres-Aguilar v. INS, </em>246 F.3d 1267, 1271 (9th Cir.2001). Accordingly, respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss this petition for review for lack of jurisdiction with respect to petitioner Abel Vazquez Martinez is granted. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i); <em>Romero-Torres v. Ashcroft, </em>327 F.3d 887, 892 (9th Cir.2003); <em>Montero-Martinez v. Ashcroft, </em>277 F.3d 1137, 1144 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-12\">A review of the response to the order to show cause and the administrative record demonstrates that there is substantial evidence to support the BIA\u2019s decision that petitioner Silvina Vazquez failed to establish continuous physical presence in the United States for a period of not less than ten years as required for cancellation of removal. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(A); <em>Lopez-Alvarado v. Ashcroft, </em>381 F.3d 847, 850-51 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-13\">Accordingly, respondent\u2019s motion for summary disposition is granted with respect to petitioner Silvina Vazquez because the questions raised by this petition for review are so insubstantial as not to require further argument. <em>See United States v. Hooton, </em>693 F.2d 857, 858 (9th Cir.1982) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-14\">All other pending motions are denied as moot. The temporary stay of removal and voluntary departure confirmed by Ninth Circuit General Order 6.4(c) and <em>Desta v. Ashcroft, </em>365 F.3d 741 (9th Cir.2004), shall continue in effect until issuance of the mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-15\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part; DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b532-9\"><em> </em>This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
