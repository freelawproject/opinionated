In particular, Plaintiff claims she was wrongfully terminated based on her gender and wrongfully not hired back for the same discriminatory reason, in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (\u201cTitle VII\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e <em>et seq., </em>and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. She also claims she was retaliated against, in violation of Title VII, for refusing to administer medications, for complaining about pay practices, and for filing two charges of discrimination with the Tennessee Human Rights Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">After carefully reviewing the record, the parties\u2019 briefs, and the applicable law,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> this Court determines that no jurisprudential purpose would be served by a panel opinion. We therefore AFFIRM the district court\u2019s judgment for the reasons stated in that court\u2019s well-reasoned memorandum and order granting Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment dated August 7, 2007, and as supplemented by the district court\u2019s memorandum and order granting in part and denying in part Plaintiffs motion for reconsideration dated March 4, 2008.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"aai-dedup-1\">.
