Lane, </em>489 U.S. 288, 109 S.Ct. 1060, 103 L.Ed.2d 334 (1989). For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-29\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-30\">Sanchez filed a <em>pro se </em>\u00a7 2255 motion, alleging two instances of ineffective assis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>tance of trial counsel. Several months later, she filed a <em>pro se </em>supplement to her \u00a7 2255 motion, claiming that Blakely,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is- . sued in the interim, required recalculation of her guideline imprisonment range, as it was based on judge-found facts. The government responded that Sanchez\u2019s <em>Blakely </em>claim was time-barred because the supplement was filed more than one year after her convictions became final<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and barred because <em>Blakely </em>did not apply retroactively, pursuant to <em>Teague. </em>The government also responded that any claim that Sanchez\u2019s trial or appellate counsel were ineffective for failing to raise a Blakely-type claim failed on the merits because counsel could not be held responsible for failing to anticipate a change in the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\">A magistrate judge recommended denying Sanchez\u2019s <em>Blakely </em>claim,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> reasoning that the claim was time-barred because the supplement was filed more than one year after her convictions became final, and barred because <em>Blakely </em>and its progeny did not apply retroactively on collateral review, pursuant to <em>Varela v. United States, </em>400 F.3d 864, 867 (11th Cir.2005). The magistrate also recommended denying any claim that Sanchez\u2019s trial and appellate counsel were ineffective for failing to raise a Blakely-type claim, reasoning that <em>Blakely </em>had yet to be decided. Sanchez objected that her <em>Blakely </em>claim was timely under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(f)(4) because she filed her supplement within one year of <em>Blakely\u2019s </em>issuance, the date on which she discovered that her counsel was ineffective for failing to argue that her sentence was unconstitutionally based on judge-found facts. Sanchez also objected that her <em>Blakely </em>claim was not barred by <em>Teague </em>because (1) <em>Blakely </em>was not a new rule of law announced after her convictions became final but, rather, an application of the rule of law announced in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), before her convictions became final; and (2) <em>Varela </em>was inappo-site because that defendant\u2019s conviction became final before <em>Apprendi, </em>while hers became final after <em>Apprendi.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b826-9\">The district court adopted the magistrate\u2019s report. On Sanchez\u2019s motion, the district court granted a COA concerning <em>Blakely\u2019s </em>and Booker\u2019s<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> retroactivity and the supplement\u2019s timeliness.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-11\">In reviewing the denial of a \u00a7 2255 motion, we review questions of law <em>de novo </em>and findings of fact for clear error. <em>Lynn v. United States, </em>365 F.3d 1225, 1232 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b826-12\">A. Retroactivity</p>\n<p id=\"b826-13\">In <em>Teague, </em>the Supreme Court held that \u201cnew constitutional rules of criminal proce<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>dure will not be applicable to those cases which have become final before the new rules are announced.\u201d 489 U.S. at 310,109 S.Ct. at 1075. In <em>Varela, </em>in which the defendant\u2019s conviction became final before <em>Apprendi, </em>we applied <em>Teague </em>to <em>Blakely </em>and <em>Booker </em>and held that the \u201cconstitutional rule [announced in <em>Blakely </em>and <em>Booker </em>] falls squarely under the category of new rules of criminal procedure that do not apply retroactively to \u00a7 2255 cases on collateral review.\u201d 400 F.3d at 866-68. In <em>United States v. Morris, </em>429 F.3d 65, 70-71 (4th Cir.2005), in which the defendant\u2019s conviction became final after <em>Apprendi, </em>the Fourth Circuit applied Teague and similarly held that <em>Booker </em>did not apply retroactively. In so holding, the Fourth Circuit specifically rejected an argument that <em>Booker </em>was not a new rule of law but merely a clarification of <em>Apprendi. </em>The Fourth Circuit reasoned in part that the Supreme Court itself viewed <em>Booker </em>as announcing a new rule of law, as (1) in holding that the rule must apply to all cases on direct review, the Supreme Court reasoned that \u201ca new rule for the conduct of criminal prosecutions is to be applied retroactively to all cases ... pending on direct review or not yet final\u201d; and (2) the rule was not \u201capparent to all reasonable jurists,\u201d since four dissenting Supreme Court justices undertook to explain why the holding in <em>Blakely </em>was not compelled by <em>Apprendi. Id. </em>at 70-72 (citing <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 268, 329-33, 125 S.Ct. at 769, 805-07).</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">The district court did not err in concluding that Sanchez\u2019s <em>Blakely </em>claim was barred by <em>Teague. See Lynn, </em>365 F.3d at 1232. We previously have held that <em>Blakely </em>and <em>Booker </em>are not retroactively applicable on collateral review. <em>See Varela, </em>400 F.3d at 866-68. Our holding applies equally to cases in which the defendant\u2019s conviction became final before <em>Ap-prendi, </em>as in <em>Varela, </em>and cases in which the defendant\u2019s convictions became final after <em>Apprendi, </em>as here. <em>See also Morris, </em>429 F.3d at 70-72 (holding that <em>Booker </em>did not apply retroactively in a case in which the defendant\u2019s conviction became final after <em>Apprendi). </em>Likewise, our sister Circuit previously has rejected an argument, such as that made by Sanchez on appeal, that <em>Booker </em>was not a new rule of law for <em>Teague </em>purposes. <em>See id. </em>We agree with the Fourth Circuit. Accordingly, we affirm as to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-7\">B. Timeliness</p>\n<p id=\"b827-8\">The AEDPA imposes a one-year statute of limitations for filing a \u00a7 2255 motion. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(f). This limitations period runs from the latest of</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b827-9\">(1) the date on which the judgment of conviction becomes final;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b827-10\">(2) the date on which [an unconstitutional government-imposed] impediment to making a motion ... is removed ...;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b827-11\">(3) the date on which the right asserted was initially recognized by the Supreme Court, if that right has been newly recognized by the Supreme Court and made retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b827-12\">(4) the date on which the facts supporting the claim or claims presented could have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b827-13\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b827-14\">As stated above, we have held that <em>Blakely </em>and <em>Booker </em>are not retroactively applicable on collateral review. <em>See Varela, </em>400 F.3d at 866-68. Thus, these decisions do not trigger a later starting date under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(f)(3). We have yet to consider, however, whether the issuance of <em>Blakely </em>and <em>Booker </em>and/or the alleged prejudice resulting from counsel\u2019s failure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>to preserve a Blakely/Booker-type claim<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> constitute \u201cfacts\u201d for the purposes of \u00a7 2255(f)(4).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b828-4\">The district court did not err in concluding that Sanchez\u2019s <em>Blakely </em>claim was time-barred. <em>See Lynn, </em>365 F.3d at 1232. We have foreclosed reliance on \u00a7 2255(f)(3) for claims raising <em>Blakely/Booker </em>issues. <em>See Varela, </em>400 F.3d at 866-68. Were a defendant allowed to skirt the principle that <em>Blakely </em>and <em>Booker </em>are not retroactive for \u00a7 2255(f)(3) purposes and argue instead that she just discovered, when <em>Blakely </em>was issued, that her counsel was ineffective for failing to preserve a Blakely-type claim, the principle would have no teeth. <em>See United States v. Brown, </em>526 F.3d 691, 713 (11th Cir.2008) (\u201c[This Court] construe[s] statutory language as to avoid absurd results\u201d). Thus, logic mandates that Sanchez\u2019s theory is meritless. Accordingly, we affirm as to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b826-5\">. <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b826-6\">. The parties do not dispute that Sanchez's supplement was filed more than one year after her convictions became final or that her <em>Blakely </em>claim did not \"relate back\u201d to the claims raised in her initial motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b826-7\">. The report referenced here actually was the second prepared by the magistrate. Initially, the magistrate recommended denying the two claims raised in the initial motion, but failed to address the Blakely-claim raised in the supplement. Over Sanchez's objection to the oversight, the district court adopted the magistrate's report. On Sanchez's motion, the district court granted a certificate of appeala-bility (\u201cCOA\u201d) concerning the oversight. In an unpublished opinion, we vacated and remanded with instructions to consider the <em>Blakely </em>claim. <em>Sanchez v. United States, </em>247 Fed.Appx. 194, 196-97 (11th Cir.2007). The report referenced here was prepared on remand.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b826-15\">. <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b828-7\">. On appeal, the government argues that Sanchez did not raise an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim in her supplement, but merely argued that her sentence was ineffective under <em>Blakely. </em>We agree. However, both the government, in its response to the supplement, and magistrate judge, in his report, treated the supplement as raising such an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim. Accordingly, we will do the same.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b828-8\">. On appeal, Sanchez argues that the Supreme Court held in <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 295, 125 S.Ct. 1571, 161 L.Ed.2d 542 (2005), that \"facts\" for \u00a7 2255(f)(4) purposes may include \"court rulings.\" In <em>Johnson, </em>the Supreme Court held that a state-court vacatur of a federal prisoner's prior state conviction, which was used to enhance his federal- sentence, is \"a matter of fact\u201d for \u00a7 2255(f)(4) purposes and concluded that the limitation period begins to run on the date that the prisoner receives notice of the order vacating the predicate conviction. 544 U.S. 295, 302, 304-07, 308, 125 S.Ct. at 1577-80. The Supreme Court did not address whether court opinions also constitute matters of fact. <em>See generally id. </em>Thus, the \"court ruling\u201d to which Sanchez referred was not the sort of court ruling at issue here, and <em>Johnson </em>is irrelevant.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
