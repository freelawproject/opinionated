We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-16\">Because we write exclusively for the parties, we recount only those facts necessary to our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-17\">Miller pleaded guilty in 1996 to conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute more than 50 grams of crack cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846. Under the Sentencing Guidelines in effect at that time, the probation office calculated a base offense level of 34. USSG \u00a7 2D1.1. However, because Miller was over the age of 18 at the time and had at least two prior convictions for controlled substance offenses, he qualified as a career offender, which increased his offense level to 37 and put him in Criminal History Category VI. USSG \u00a7 4B1.1. After a three-level deduction for acceptance of responsibility pursuant to USSG \u00a7 3E1.1, Miller\u2019s offense level became 34, which yielded a Guidelines range of 262 to 327 months. In light of Miller\u2019s substantial assistance to the Government, the District Court granted a downward departure pursuant to USSG \u00a7 5K1.1, yielding a final Guidelines range of 188 to 235 months. The District Court sentenced Miller to 216 months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>On November 1, 2007, the Sentencing Commission promulgated Amendment 706, which amended the Drug Quantity Table in USSG \u00a7 201.1(c). The effect of Amendment 706 is to provide a two-level reduction in base offense levels for certain crack-cocaine offenses. The Commission made this amendment retroactively applicable, effective March 3, 2008. <em>See </em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual app. C, amend. 713 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">After Amendment 706 was made retroactive, Miller moved <em>pro se </em>for a reduced sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The District Court found that a reduction in sentence was not authorized by \u00a7 3582(c)(2) because Miller had been sentenced as a career offender and Amendment 706 did not lower his applicable Guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s interpretation of statutory requirements, including the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>344 F.3d 365, 377 (3d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">Section 3582(c) authorizes district courts to grant a sentence reduction \u201cin the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission ... if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The Sentencing Commission issued a policy statement, USSG \u00a7 1B1.10, which states that, \u201c[i]n a case in which a defendant is serving a term of imprisonment, and the guideline range applicable to that defendant has subsequently been lowered as a result of an amendment to the Guidelines Manual ... the court may reduce the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment as provided by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d USSG \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(1). Sentence reductions are prohibited, however, where the amendment \u201cdoes not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d USSG \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B). Furthermore, the Application Note to USSG \u00a7 1B1.10 states, in relevant part: \u201ca reduction ... is not authorized under 18 U.S.C. 3582(c)(2) and is not consistent with this policy statement if ... the amendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range because of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision.\u201d USSG \u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. n. 1(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-11\">Thus, Miller is eligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582 only if his Guidelines range is changed by an amendment enacted by the Sentencing Commission. In this case, however, Miller\u2019s Guidelines range was dictated by his career offender status. Although Amendment 706 would reduce Miller\u2019s base offense level from 34 to 32, the Amendment did not affect Miller\u2019s Guidelines range because he was sentenced as a career offender under USSG \u00a7 4B1.1. Therefore, \u00a7 3582 and USSG \u00a7 1B1.10 render Amendment 706 unavailing to Miller.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b107-12\">Furthermore, the fact that Miller has obtained a downward departure pursuant to USSG \u00a7 5K1.1 does not change our analysis. The District Court granted a three-level departure, yielding a final of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>fense level of 31 and a Guidelines range of 188 to 235 months. The starting point for that departure, however, was the offense level of 37, as determined by Miller\u2019s career offender status. Amendment 706 does not alter this Guidelines range calculation and therefore the District Court did not have authority to modify Miller\u2019s sentence thereunder.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">Given the applicability of the career offender provision, Miller has failed to establish the threshold requirement of \u00a7 3582(c)(2) because he cannot show that Amendment 706 had the effect of lowering his Guidelines range. Accordingly, the District Court lacked authority to modify the sentence. We will affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b107-9\">. Our sister courts of appeals have held that district courts are not authorized to reduce the sentences of defendants sentenced as career offenders because Amendment 706 does not alter their Guidelines ranges. <em>See United States v.
