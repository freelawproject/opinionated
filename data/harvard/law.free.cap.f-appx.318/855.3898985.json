Hudson\u2019s motion was based on Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines, which lowered the base offense levels associated with crack-cocaine offenses. This appeal presents the following factual situation: the district court granted Hudson\u2019s \u00a7 3582(e)(2) motion, reduced his offense level by two levels, and sentenced him at the lowest point in his amended Guidelines range. In so doing, the court declined Hudson\u2019s request to impose a variance below the amended Guidelines range in the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding, indicating that, even if it had the authority to impose a variance below the amended Guidelines range under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), it would impose the same sentence. On appeal, Hudson generally argues that the district court erred in denying his request to reduce his sentence below the low-end of the amended Guidelines range, finding it lacked authority under <em>Booker </em>to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-4\">We recently addressed whether <em>Booker </em>and <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), prohibit Congress or the Sentencing Commission from limiting the discretion of a district court in reducing a sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1190-91 (11th Cir.2009). Concluding <em>Booker </em>and <em>Kim-brough </em>do not apply to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings, we held a district court is bound by the limitations on its discretion imposed by \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and the applicable policy statements by the Sentencing Commission. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">Based upon our holding in <em>Melvin, </em>Hudson\u2019s argument that the district court should have sentenced him below the amended Guidelines range is without merit. The applicable policy statement here, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(2), and its commentary preclude a district court from reducing a defendant\u2019s sentence below the amended Guidelines range if the defendant\u2019s original sentence fell within the then-applicable Guidelines range. Accordingly, we affirm Hudson\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
