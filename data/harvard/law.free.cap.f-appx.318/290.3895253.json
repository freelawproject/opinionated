He contends that the district court did not provide an adequate explanation for his sentence and that his within-guideline sentence was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-15\">Romero-Facio did not object to the district court\u2019s explanation of the sentence. We review his contention for plain error. <em>See United States v. Lopez-Velasquez, </em>526 F.3d 804, 806 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 625, 172 L.Ed.2d 617 (2008). To preserve the argument for further review, Romero-Facio argues that the plain error standard should not apply; he concedes the argument is foreclosed by <em>Lopez-Velasquez.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b315-18\">The district court listened to RomeroFacio\u2019s arguments for a variance from the guideline sentencing range, rejected them, and stated that a within-range sentence was appropriate. In light of the facts of Romero-Facio\u2019s case and the arguments he presented for a variance, the court provided a sufficient explanation. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2468-69, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-19\">A discretionary sentence imposed within a properly calculated guidelines range is entitled to a rebuttable presumption of reasonableness. <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006); <em>see Rita, </em>127 S.Ct. at 2462. The 41-month sentence is within the 41-51-month guideline range and is presumptively reasonable. <em>See Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d at 554. Romero-Facio has not shown that the sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>was unreasonable under the abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">First, Romero-Facio\u2019s economic situation and his health, while unfortunate, do not make him stand out from a garden-variety drug mule. Second, he has not shown that he would not have been charged with using a minor in a drug operation had he not told the authorities that Roberto Ramirez directed him to use his son to facilitate his crossing. Third, Romero-Facio has not demonstrated any logical connection between his sentence and his potential to make a living after he completes his prison term and is removed to Mexico. Fourth, Romero-Facio\u2019s criminal history score of 3 does not overstate the seriousness of his criminal history of one assault conviction and two convictions of driving while intoxicated to an extent that a within-range sentence was an abuse of discretion. <em>Cf. </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(b) (addressing downward departures). Fifth, even if Romero-Facio is correct that nothing in the record suggests that a 41-month term is necessary for correctional treatment or medical care, he does not indicate how this shows that his sentence reflects a clear error of judgment. <em>See United States v. Nolen, </em>472 F.3d 362, 376 n. 29 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b315-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
