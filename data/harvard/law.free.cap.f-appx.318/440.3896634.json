Gonzales, </em>400 F.3d 610, 612 (8th Cir.2005); <em>Palomino v. Ashcroft, </em>354 F.3d 942, 944-45 (8th Cir.2004). Mendoza\u2019s lawful reentry in July 1992 allowed her to begin accruing a new period of continuous physical presence, <em>see Okeke v. Gonzales, </em>407 F.3d 585, 589-90 (3d Cir.2005), which ended with service of the notice to appear in February 2002, before she had accrued the requisite ten years continuous physical presence. Accordingly, we deny the petition.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b465-10\">. Mendoza\u2019s application for a waiver of inadmissibility was also denied, but she does not appeal the issue. <em>See Averianova v. Mukasey, </em>509 F.3d 890, 892 n. 1 (8th Cir.2007) (alien waived claim by failing to present argument in brief).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
