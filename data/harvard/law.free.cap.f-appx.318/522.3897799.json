We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>See Perez v. Mukasey, </em>516 F.3d 770, 773 (9th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-11\">Petitioner\u2019s claim for protection under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d) failed to present evidence of changed country conditions in Mexico that is particular to petitioner and his circumstances. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii). Because petitioner has failed to meet his burden of establishing a prima facie CAT claim to support reopening, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-12\">Accordingly, the court sua sponte summarily denies in part this petition for review because the questions raised by this petition are so insubstantial as not to require further argument. <em>See United States v. Hooton, </em>693 F.2d 857, 858 (9th Cir.1982) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-15\">Further, we have reviewed the response to the court\u2019s September 18, 2008 order to show cause, and we conclude that petitioner has failed to raise a colorable constitutional or legal claim to invoke our jurisdiction over this petition for review. <em>See Martinez-Rosas v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 926 (9th Cir.2005); <em>Torres-Aguilar v. INS, </em>246 F.3d 1267, 1271 (9th Cir.2001). Accordingly, the court dismisses in part this petition for review for lack of jurisdiction. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i); <em>Fernandez v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 592, 601 (9th Cir.2006) (concluding that the court lacks jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s denial of motion to reopen for failure to establish a prima facie case if a prior adverse discretionary decision was made by the agency).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-16\">The temporary stay of removal confirmed by Ninth Circuit General Order 6.4(c) shall continue in effect until issuance of the mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-17\">All other pending motions are denied as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-18\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b547-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
