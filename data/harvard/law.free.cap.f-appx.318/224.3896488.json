Linniman appeals his conviction and 168-month departure sentence after pleading guilty pursuant to a plea agreement to unlawful transfer of a fire<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>arm, in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5812, 5861, 5871 (2006), and unlawful possession of firearms with altered serial numbers, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(k), 924 (2006). Linniman asserts that the district court erred when it imposed a departure sentence: (i) without first affording him adequate notice that it planned to depart upward; (ii) that was too extensive for the crimes to which he pled guilty; and (iii) without sufficient analysis to support the departure sentence. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">Because Linniman did not object to the lack of Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(h) notice in the district court, this court reviews this issue for plain error. <em>United States v. Muhammad, </em>478 F.3d 247, 249 (4th Cir.2007). Rule 32(h) requires the sentencing court to give the parties reasonable notice when it is considering a departure on a ground not identified as a possible basis for departure either in the presentence report or in a party\u2019s prehearing submission. Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(h). Because the district court imposed a departure sentence based on the same grounds identified by the Government in its upward departure motion, the district court was not required to provide Rule 32 notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">Although Linniman does not dispute the legal or factual correctness of the district court\u2019s findings at sentencing and does not claim that the district court was unjustified in departing under the relevant Guidelines provisions, Linniman does assert that his sentence is \u201cclose to the maximum\u201d and that the district court did not provide \u201ca rigorous analysis\u201d before imposing the sentence.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We conclude that the district court provided ample analysis of the reasons it believed Linniman\u2019s departure sentence was warranted, not only during Linniman\u2019s sentencing hearing, but also in a detailed sentencing memorandum. Given the significant risk associated with the particular conduct for which Linniman was convicted, the district court\u2019s meaningful articulation of its consideration of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2006) factors, and its careful consideration of reasons warranting a departure from the Guidelines range, we also find that the extent of Linniman\u2019s departure sentence was reasonable. <em>See United States v. Hernandez-Villanueva, </em>473 F.3d 118, 123 (4th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-9\">Based on the foregoing, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b249-7\"> Although Linniman also asserts that the district court erred by relying on conduct of which he was acquitted in a state court jury trial, this argument is meritless. <em>See United States v. Watts, </em>519 U.S. 148, 155-56, 117 S.Ct. 633, 136 L.Ed.2d 554 (1997) (holding that sentencing courts may take acquitted conduct into account when determining the appropriate sentence because a lower standard of proof applies at the sentencing stage).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
