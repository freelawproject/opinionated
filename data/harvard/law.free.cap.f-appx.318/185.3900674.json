He argues the district court erred in failing to find that he was acting within the scope of his employment and that the court erred in denying his discovery request. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">This court reviews de novo a district court\u2019s scope of employment determination, but reviews for clear error \u201cany factual findings upon which the legal scope-of-employment determination rests.\u201d <em>Gutierrez de Martinez v. Drug Enforcement Admin., 1</em>11 F.3d 1148, 1152 n. 3 (4th Cir.1997). Barker does not dispute Mokhtare\u2019s contention that the law of the District of Columbia applies to resolve the scope of Mokhtare\u2019s employment. <em>See id. </em>at 1156 n. 6 (applying state law to scope of employment determination based solely on the parties\u2019 stipulation). In the District of Columbia, an employee\u2019s conduct is within the scope of employment if:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-9\">(a) it is of the kind he is employed to perform;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-10\">(b) it occurs substantially within the authorized time and space limits;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-11\">(c) it is actuated, at least in part, by a purpose to serve the master,-and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-12\">(d) if force is intentionally used by the servant against another, the use of force is not unexpectable by the master.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-13\"><em>Wilson v. Libby, </em>535 F.3d 697, 711 (D.C.Cir.2008) (quoting Restatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7 228(1) (1958)).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-14\">Our review of the record in light of these standards leads us to conclude that the district court did not err in denying Mokhtare\u2019s petition for certification and his request for discovery. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order denying Mokhtare\u2019s petition for certification. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-15\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
