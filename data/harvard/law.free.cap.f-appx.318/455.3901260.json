The district court\u2014purporting to apply the standard of review required by the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA)\u2014concluded that Walker\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights were violated when the trial court failed to re-arraign him on an amended criminal complaint and re-advise him of his right to counsel, at his preliminary hearing. The district court further concluded that the error required automatic reversal. We respectfully disagree with the district court, and accordingly reverse its grant of habeas relief.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b480-16\">We review the district court\u2019s decision <em>de novo. Sanders v. Ratelle, </em>21 F.3d 1446, 1451 (9th Cir.1994). The merits of this petition are viewed in light of the AEDPA. <em>See Lindh v. Murphy, </em>521 U.S. 320, 336, 117 S.Ct. 2059, 138 L.Ed.2d 481 (1997). Under the AEDPA, a habeas petition cannot be granted unless the state court decision: (1) \u201cwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,\u201d or (2) \u201cwas based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d 28 U.S.C. 2254 \u00a7 (d)(l)-(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>Even if we were to agree that established Supreme Court precedent dictates the conclusion that Walker\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights were violated during his pretrial proceedings, the state court\u2019s ultimate determination that any such error was harmless under <em>Chapman v. California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967), was neither \u201ccontrary to\u201d nor an \u201cunreasonable application\u201d of clearly established federal law. <em>See Coleman v. Alabama, </em>399 U.S. 1, 9-11, 90 S.Ct. 1999, 26 L.Ed.2d 387 (1970) (stating that violation of right to counsel at preliminary hearing stage is to be reviewed for prejudice under <em>Chapman </em>standard); <em>Arizona v. Fulminante, </em>499 U.S. 279, 306-307, 111 S.Ct. 1246, 113 L.Ed.2d 302 (1991) (citing <em>Coleman </em>as one of several cases in which Court has found constitutional error amenable to harmless error review).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">To the extent the state court\u2019s harmless error determination would not be entitled to AEDPA deference because the court initially\u2014and primarily\u2014decided the issue under the state law harmless error standard, relief would nevertheless be precluded, as the outcome would be the same under a <em>de novo </em>review. <em>See Frantz v. Hazey, </em>533 F.3d 724, 735 (9th Cir.2008) (en banc) (explaining that if a state court decision is not entitled to deference under the AEDPA, then standard of review defaults to <em>de novo </em>review); <em>Bains v. Cambra, </em>204 F.3d 964, 971 n. 2 (9th Cir.2000) (explaining that prejudice determination for federal habeas review announced in <em>Brecht v. Abrahamson, </em>507 U.S. 619, 637-38, 113 S.Ct. 1710, 123 L.Ed.2d 353 (1993) is the \u201cequivalent\u201d of California state law error prejudice standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">REVERSED and REMANDED with instructions to enter judgment in favor of respondents.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b480-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
