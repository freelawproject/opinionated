Mukasey, </em>516 F.3d 770, 773 (9th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">The regulations state that a motion to reopen proceedings must be filed no later than ninety days after the date on which the final administrative decision was rendered in the proceeding sought to be reopened. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(A), (C)(i); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). A review of the administrative record demonstrates that the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying petitioner\u2019s motion to reopen as untimely. Petitioner\u2019s final administrative order of removal was entered on April 19, 2005. Petitioner\u2019s motion to reopen was filed on June 27, 2008, more than ninety days after the date on which the final order of removal was entered. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">Further, the regulations state that a party may file only one motion to reopen. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R.' \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). Therefore, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying petitioner\u2019s second motion to reopen as also barred by numerical limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">The time and number limitations for motions to reopen do not apply to a motion to reopen proceedings to apply or reapply for asylum or withholding of removal based on changed country conditions, if such evidence is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii); <em>Malty v. Ashcroft, </em>381 F.3d 942, 945 (9th Cm. 2004). The BIA did not abuse its discretion in finding that petitioner\u2019s claim for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d) does not fall within the exception to the time and number restrictions for motions to reopen because petitioner failed to present evidence of changed country conditions in Mexico that are material to him and his circumstances. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-11\">Accordingly, respondent\u2019s motion for summary denial of the petition for review is granted because the questions raised by this petition are so insubstantial as not to require further argument. <em>See United States v. Hooton, </em>693 F.2d 857, 858 (9th Cir.1982) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-12\">All other pending motions are denied as moot. The temporary stay of removal confirmed by Ninth Circuit General Order 6.4(c) shall continue in effect until issuance of the mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-13\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b524-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
