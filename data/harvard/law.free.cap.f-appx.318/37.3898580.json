Crotty, United States District Judge for the Southern District of New York, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b62-6\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">Mohammad Riaz appeals from a sentence of 24 months, entered pursuant to his plea of guilty to one count of conspiring to commit access device fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1029(a)(5) and (b)(2). The district court, in calculating the applicable Guidelines range, applied a 14 level sentencing enhancement based on its finding of a loss amount greater than $400,000. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(1)(H). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and procedural history of this case, and the issues presented on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-8\">We review a district court\u2019s calculation of loss amount for clear error. <em>United States v. Brennan, </em>395 F.3d 59, 74 (2d Cir.2005). \u201c[A] finding is \u2018clearly erroneous\u2019 when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>Anderson v. City of Bessemer, </em>470 U.S. 564, 573, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-9\">First, Riaz argues that the district court committed clear error by failing to find a specific loss amount and by failing to explain how it arrived at the loss amount it did find. We think there was no such clear error. The district court said that its loss finding was \u201cbased [in part] on the testimony of Mr. Mekawy who identified something in excess of $400,000 of fraudulent credit card charges relating to the actions of the defendant.\u201d In light of the likelihood that, in saying that, the district court was referring to Mr. Mekawy\u2019s testimony at the <em>Fatico </em>hearing that fraudulent charges totaling $413,838.02 were attributable to Riaz, and was thereby indicating that it had arrived at a loss estimate of approximately $413,000 by crediting that testimony, we are not left with the \u201cdefinite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In any event, the finding that the loss amount was more than $400,000 was supported by the evidence to which the court referred. We have never required that a district court find a loss amount to the penny, so long as the amount it estimates based on the record is not clearly erroneous. \u201cThe court need only make a reasonable estimate of the loss.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1 cmt. 3(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-13\">Riaz also argues that the district court committed clear error by crediting Mr. Mekawy\u2019s testimony. We think that Riaz has not met the high threshold for finding clear error in a credibility determination. Mekawy\u2019s testimony was \u201ccoherent and facially plausible,\u201d not \u201ccontradicted by extrinsic evidence,\u201d and not \u201cinternally inconsistent.\u201d <em>Anderson, </em>470 U.S. at 575, 105 S.Ct. 1504; <em>see also </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-14\">In light of the foregoing conclusions, which are a sufficient basis upon which to affirm the judgment, we need not address the government\u2019s additional argument that the full amount of loss caused by the conspiracy is attributable to Riaz. And we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>have considered Riaz\u2019s remaining arguments and find them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
