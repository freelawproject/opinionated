The plea agreement stipulated that the drug quantity was between 100 and 150 grams of cocaine base and that the statutory mandatory minimum sentence was 120 months\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). At the change of plea hearing, the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> reminded Harris that he faced a sentence of not less than 120 months\u2019 imprisonment and not more than life. On July 25, 2008, the district court sentenced Harris to the statutory mandatory minimum of 120 months\u2019 imprisonment and five years\u2019 supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-20\">Harris argues that the sentence is improper because he should have been sentenced below the statutory mandatory minimum based on Amendment 706 to the United States Sentencing Guidelines and <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>because he should have been given credit for time served while he was under pretrial house arrest; and because the statutory mandatory minimum does not apply where the Government did not provide evidence of the purity of the crack cocaine. Each of these arguments fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">In reviewing a sentence, we review legal conclusions de novo. <em>United States v. Mashek, </em>406 F.3d 1012, 1016-17 (8th Cir.2005). We reject Harris\u2019s first argument because neither Amendment 706 nor <em>Kimbrough </em>provides authority for a .sentence below the statutory mandatory minimum. Amendment 706 reduced the base offense level for crack cocaine offenses in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c). Harris argues that the district court should have retroactively applied Amendment 706 to reduce his sentence. However, Harris\u2019s sentence of 120 months\u2019 imprisonment was at the statutory mandatory minimum, which was not affected by Amendment 706. <em>See United States v. Jones, </em>523 F.3d 881, 882 (8th Cir.2008) (per curiam). Although <em>Kimbrough </em>allows a district court to vary from the advisory guidelines range based on its disagreement with the guidelines\u2019 eraek/powder cocaine ratio, <em>Kimbrough </em>does not authorize a sentencing court to impose a sentence below the statutory mandatory minimum. <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>517 F.3d 1020, 1024 (8th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">We reject Harris\u2019s second argument because the Bureau of Prisons, not the district court, determines the credit for time served, so the district court properly left that issue to the discretion of the Bureau of Prisons. <em>See United States v. Pardue, </em>363 F.3d 695, 699 (8th Cir.2004) (citing <em>United States v. Iversen, </em>90 F.3d 1340, 1344-45 (8th Cir.1996)). In any event, house arrest imposed as a condition of pre-trial release is not \u201c \u2018official detention\u2019 within the meaning of [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3585(b).\u201d <em>United States v. Wickman, </em>955 F.2d 592, 593 (8th Cir.1992) (en banc) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">Finally, we reject Harris\u2019s third argument because the Government need not provide evidence of the purity of the crack .cocaine for a sentence pursuant to the statutory mandatory minimum. <em>See Chapman v. United States, </em>500 U.S. 453, 459-68, 111 S.Ct. 1919, 114 L.Ed.2d 524 (1991) (holding that, unless otherwise specified, the purity of a controlled substance is not a factor for sentencing under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">Accordingly, we affirm Harris\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b469-15\">.
