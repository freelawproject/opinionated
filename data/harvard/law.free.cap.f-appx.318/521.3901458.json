INS, </em>293 F.3d 1089, 1093-94 (9th Cir.2002). The BIA therefore correctly concluded that, as a matter of law, petitioner was ineligible for cancellation of removal. Accordingly, respondent\u2019s motion for summary disposition is granted because the questions raised by this petition for review are so insubstantial as not to require further argument. <em>See United States v. Hooton, </em>693 F.2d 857, 858 (9th Cir.1982) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">All other pending motions are denied as moot. The temporary stay of removal and voluntary departure confirmed by Ninth Circuit General Order 6.4(c) and <em>Desta v. Ashcroft, </em>365 F.3d 741 (9th Cir.2004), shall continue in effect until issuance of the mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b546-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
