Background</p>\n<p id=\"b156-12\">This case has a long history, but the facts relevant to this appeal are few. In June 1991, the District Court entered judgment for Appellee Robert Savitsky against Mazzella for $90,000. Mazzella failed to pay the judgment, so interest accrued and was compounded. In October 2005, Savitsky received a check for $207,000 toward satisfaction of his judgment against Mazzella. After the payment, however, Mazzella still owed Savitsky at least $11,129.79<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> under the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-16\">Mazzella moved to have the judgment marked as partially satisfied, noting that Savitsky had not filed an acknowledgment with the Court that he had received payment on the judgment. In addition, he argued that, because he had paid off the original principal of $90,000, no additional interest should accrue on the amount still owed under the judgment. In a one-sentence order, the District Court denied Mazzella\u2019s motion. Mazzella filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-17\">II. Discussion<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b156-18\">Mazzella raises two issues. First, he contends that the District Court abused its discretion by refusing to mark the judgment as partially satisfied. Second, he asserts that the District Court erred by declining to order that no further interest will accrue on the remaining amount due under the judgment. Savitsky did not file an answering brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-19\">Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(5) grants district courts discretion to \u201creheve <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>a party ... from a final judgment, order, or proceeding ... [when] the judgment has been satisfied.\u201d The rule has been interpreted to allow district courts to mark judgments as partially satisfied. <em>See, e.g., BUC Intern. Corp. v. International Yacht Council Ltd., </em>517 F.3d 1271, 1274-75 (11th Cir.2008) (citing Rule 60(b)(5) as \u201can appropriate vehicle through which to seek credit against all or part of a judgment\u201d); <em>Kassman v. American University, </em>546 F.2d 1029, 1033 (D.C.Cir.1976) (\u201cA motion for a credit on a judgment should be treated as a Rule 60(b)(5) motion\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">Mazzella argues that he is entitled to have the judgment marked partially satisfied and that the District Court abused its discretion by committing an error of law when it denied his motion. But Rule 60(b) does not obligate district courts to mark judgments as satisfied; rather it gives them the discretion to do so. <em>See </em>F.R. Civ. P. 60(b) (\u201cthe court <em>may </em>relieve a party....\u201d) (emphasis added). The District Court, therefore, did not commit an error of law by denying Mazzella\u2019s motion. As Mazzella has not asserted any other grounds for his claim that the District Court abused its discretion, we hold that it was not an abuse of discretion to deny Mazzella\u2019s motion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">In addition, the District Court was correct to refrain from ordering that no further post-judgment interest would accrue. How interest accrues on money judgments recovered in district courts is governed by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961. Under \u00a7 1961, interest on judgments is \u201ccomputed daily to the date of payment.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961(b). Because the judgment has not been paid in full, under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961, interest will continue to accrue.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b157-10\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b157-11\">Because the District Court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to mark the judgment as partially satisfied and was correct to refrain from ordering that no further post-judgment interest would accrue, we will affirm its order.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b156-13\">. In his brief, Mazzella claims that the October 2005 payment reduced the amount due to Savitsky under the judgment to $11,129.72. (Appellant\u2019s Brief at 5.) Savitsky, however, in his Answer to Mazzella's Motion to Mark Judgment Partially Satisfied, claims that Maz-zella still owes him \"approximately $13,000\u201d under the judgment. (App. at 23.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b156-14\">. The District Court had jurisdiction over this matter under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332. We have jurisdiction to review the District Court\u2019s denial of Mazzella's F.R. Civ. P. 60(b) motion pursuant to U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. <em>See Binker v. Com. of Pa., </em>977 F.2d 738, 744 (3d Cir.1992) (stating that a district court\u2019s denial of a Rule 60(b) motion is a final order over which we have appellate jurisdiction); 11 Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller, &amp; Mary Kay Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 2871 (2d ed. 1995) (\"An order denying a motion under Rule 60(b) is final and appealable....\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b157-7\">. To the extent that Mazzella's appeal is based on a concern that Savitsky has not acknowledged receiving payment, the concern is ill-founded. In Savitsky\u2019s Answer to Mazzella\u2019s Motion to Mark the Judgment Partially Satisfied, filed with the District Court and included in the Appendix prepared for this appeal, Savitsky admits to receiving a payment of principle and interest in the amount of $207,000. (App. at 22.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b157-22\">. Whether it accrues on the basis of the amount still owing or on some other basis is an issue that has not been presented to us and as to which we do not now opine. It is sufficient to observe that Mezzella\u2019s claim that no interest should accrue is unfounded.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
