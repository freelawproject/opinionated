Produce Company, Inc. (\u201cASA\u201d) appeals the district court\u2019s summary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>judgment in favor of Everest National Insurance Company (\u201cEverest\u201d) in ASA\u2019s diversity action seeking contractual and punitive damages for Everest\u2019s alleged bad faith settlement of an ASA employee\u2019s claim. Everest sold a Workers\u2019 Compensation and Employers\u2019 Liability Policy to ASA. A former ASA employee filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim, and ASA requested that Everest defend and indemnify ASA with respect to the claim. The employee and Everest reached a settlement that ASA objected to several months later.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">ASA brought claims alleging breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fear dealing, and both parties filed motions for summary judgment. We review de novo the summary judgment in favor of Everest. <em>Valdez v. Rosenbaum, </em>302 F.3d 1039, 1043 (9th Cir.2002). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">ASA argues that summary judgment on the breach of contract claim was in error because Everest failed to challenge that claim in its motions. Everest\u2019s Notice of Motion and Motion for Summary Judgment expressly notified ASA that Everest was moving for summary judgment on \u201ceach cause of action set forth in plaintiffs complaint,\u201d including the contract claim, because \u201cthere are no triable issues of material fact.\u201d Thus, ASA had a \u201cfull and fair opportunity to ventilate the issues involved.\u201d <em>Cunningham v. Rothery (In re Rothery), </em>143 F.3d 546, 549 (9th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">\u201c[W]hen parties submit cross-motions for summary judgment, \u2018[e]ach motion must be considered on its own merits.\u2019\u201d <em>Fair Hous. Council of Riverside County, Inc. v. Riverside Two, </em>249 F.3d 1132, 1136 (9th Cir.2001) (quoting William W. Schwar-zer, et al., <em>The Analysis and Decision of Summary Judgment Motions, </em>139 F.R.D. 441, 499 (Feb.1992)). A district court \u201cmust consider the appropriate evidentiary material identified and submitted in support of both motions, and in opposition to both motions, before ruling on each of them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1134. Although the focus of Everest\u2019s argument was the bad faith claim, Everest\u2019s motion and memoranda informed the district court of the relevant contract language, the investigation, the settlement process, and why \u201cEverest acted within its rights under the policy.\u201d ASA\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment also provided the court with undisputed material facts highlighting the absence of a breach. In this context, summary judgment on the contract claim was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-8\">In California, where there is a \u201cgenuine dispute\u201d between an insurer and its insured \u201cas to the existence of coverage liability or the amount of the insured\u2019s coverage claim,\u201d the insurer \u201cis not liable in bad faith even though it might be liable for breach of contract.\u201d <em>Wilson v. 21st Century Ins. Co., </em>42 Cal.4th 713, 723, 68 Cal.Rptr.3d 746, 171 P.3d 1082 (Cal.2007) (quoting <em>Chateau Chamberay Homeowners Ass\u2019n v. Associated Int\u2019l Ins. Co., </em>90 Cal.App.4th 335, 347, 108 Cal.Rptr.2d 776 (2001)). \u201cThe genuine issue rule in the context of bad faith claims allows a [trial] court to grant summary judgment when it is undisputed or indisputable that the basis for the insurer\u2019s denial of benefits was reasonable....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 724, 68 Cal.Rptr.3d 746 (quoting <em>Amadeo v. Principal Mut. Life Ins. Co., </em>290 F.3d 1152, 1161 (9th Cir.2002)). Here, ASA argues that there was no \u201cgenuine dispute\u201d over the merits of the employee\u2019s claim because several doctors reported that there was no evidence that the employee was injured as a result of his employment at ASA. Howev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>er, three other physicians reported that the employee was in fact disabled due to his work. In addition, an MRI confirmed that the employee had a back injury, and an attorney determined that the employee would make a good witness. These facts support the existence of a \u201cgenuine dispute\u201d and thus the reasonableness of Everest\u2019s decision to seek a settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">Finally, ASA argues that there was a genuine issue of material fact concerning whether Everest investigated and defended the employee\u2019s claim as required under the policy. The record fails to show that Everest breached its \u201cduty to defend\u201d or disregarded its \u201cright to investigate and settle\u201d the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b613-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>by 9lh Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
