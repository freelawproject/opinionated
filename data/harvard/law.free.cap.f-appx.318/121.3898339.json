We exercise plenary review on this appeal. <em>See Dilworth v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., </em>418 F.3d 345, 349 (3d Cir.2005). Consequently, we can affirm only if we find that there is no dispute as to any material fact and appellees are entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">Exercising plenary review, we are in full accord with the District Court\u2019s reasoning and result as set forth in its memorandum opinion of February 10, 2006, 2006 WL 328369, and, therefore, we will affirm its order entered February 13, 2006, substantially for the reasons that the District Court set forth in its comprehensive opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
