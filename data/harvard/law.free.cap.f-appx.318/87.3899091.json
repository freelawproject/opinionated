I.C.E. agents identified Morehouse as a subscriber, searched the hard drive of his computer and found more than 250 images of child pornography.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">Morehouse was charged and agreed to plead guilty to a violation of \u00a7 2252A(a)(5)(B). The plea agreement referred to the possibility of an enhanced sentence under subsection (b)(2) of \u00a7 2252A<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-6\">Whoever violates ... subsection (a)(5) shall be ... imprisoned not more than 10 years, ..., but, if such person has a prior conviction ... under the laws of any State relating to aggravated sexual abuse, sexual abuse, or abusive sexual conduct involving a minor or ward ... such person shall be ... imprisoned for not less than 10 years nor more than 20 years.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">At sentencing, the Government submitted evidence that, in 1977, Morehouse had been convicted of sexual assault on a child in violation of a Colorado statute that then<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-8\">Any actor who subjects another not his or her spouse to any sexual contact commits sexual assault on a child if the victim is less than 15 years of age and the actor is at least four years older than the victim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b113-9\">Colo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 18-3-405(1) (1973 &amp; 1976 Cum.Supp.).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-10\">The sentencing judge held that the conviction rendered Morehouse subject to an enhanced sentence under subsection (b)(2) and imposed the mandatory minimum 120-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-14\">On appeal, Morehouse contends, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-15\">1. The Colorado offense was not a predicate offense under subsection (b)(2).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-16\">2. The sentencing judge should have made an inquiry beyond an examination of the text of the Colorado statute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-17\">3. Judicial fact finding of a prior conviction violated his Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b113-18\">In <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990), the Supreme Court held that the determination of whether a prior conviction qualifies as a predicate offense for purposes of the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d), \u00a7 924(e), requires a \u201cformal categorical approach,\u201d meaning that sentencing courts must look \u201conly to the statutory definitions of the prior offenses, and not to the particular facts underlying those convictions.\u201d 495 U.S. at 600, 110 S.Ct. 2143. However, in a narrow range of cases, such as those in which there has been a conviction under a statute that could criminalize conduct broader than that subject to enhancement, courts may look beyond the statutory definition to the \u201cindictment or information and jury instructions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 602, 110 S.Ct. 2143.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-19\">In <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005), the Supreme Court addressed the question of what a sentencing judge should consider when determining whether a prior conviction for burglary qualified as a predicate offense under ACCA, a determination that could not be made solely based upon the statutory text. The Supreme Court held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>that, in such an inquiry, the sentencing court is limited to reviewing \u201cthe terms of the charging document, the terms of a plea agreement or transcript of colloquy between judge and defendant in which the factual basis for the plea was confirmed by the defendant, or to some comparable judicial record of this information.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 26, 125 S.Ct. 1254.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">Although <em>Taylor </em>and <em>Shepard </em>arose under the ACCA, we have applied the <em>Taylor/Shepard </em>framework in other contexts. <em>See United States v. Siegel, </em>477 F.3d 87, 90-93 (3d Cir.2007) (determining whether a prior offense qualifies as a crime of violence under USSG \u00a7 4B1.2) and <em>United States v. Galo, </em>239 F.3d 572, 578-79, 581-83 (3d Cir.2001) (determining under \u00a7 2251(d) whether a prior conviction was one \u201crelating to the sexual exploitation of children\u201d). Therefore, the <em>Taylor/Shepard </em>framework should be applied in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">Morehouse argues that, because subsection (b)(2) defines its predicate offenses by using the words \u201caggravated sexual abuse, sexual abuse, or abusive sexual conduct involving a minor or ward,\u201d there is a requirement that the prior conviction be for a crime that includes the elements of analogous federal offenses, <em>i.e. </em>\u00a7 2241 (aggravated sexual abuse), \u00a7 2242 (sexual abuse), and \u00a7 2243 (sexual abuse of a minor or ward). Each of these federal sex crimes could be committed only if the ' defendant acted \u201cknowingly.\u201d The Colorado statute under which Morehouse had been convicted did not include an element that the offense be committed knowingly. Thus, Morehouse argues, the Colorado statute could have been violated by actions that would not constitute a predicate offense under subsection (b)(2). Hence, the sentencing judge should have undertaken a <em>Shepard </em>inquiry looked outside the text of the Colorado statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">This Court agrees with the other circuits that have rejected the notion that the terms in subsection (b)(2) must be defined by reference to federal sex crimes. <em>See United States v. Sinerius, </em>504 F.3d 737, 742 (9th Cir.2007) (considering \u00a7 2252A(b)(l), a provision materially indistinguishable from \u00a7 2252A(b)(2)); <em>United States v. Hubbard, </em>480 F.3d 341, 348 (5th Cir.2007) (considering the same provision).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">This Court holds that the sentencing judge was not required to find that the specific conduct for which Morehouse was convicted would constitute a violation of specific federal statutes. Rather, to apply the enhancement under subsection (b)(2), the sentencing judge need only have concluded that the Colorado statute <em>relates to </em>\u201caggravated sexual abuse, sexual abuse, or abusive sexual conduct involving a minor or ward.\u201d <em>Galo, </em>239 F.3d at 581.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-8\">The Supreme Court has defined the phrase \u201crelating to\u201d as meaning \u201cto stand in some relation; to have bearing or concern; to pertain; refer; to bring into association with or connection with.\u201d <em>Morales v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., </em>504 U.S. 374, 383-84, 112 S.Ct. 2031, 119 L.Ed.2d 157 (1992) (citing Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1158 (5th ed.1979)). This Court has also given a broad interpretation to the term \u201crelating to.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Yong Wong Park v. Attorney General, </em>472 F.3d 66, 72 (3d Cir.2006) (interpreting 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(R)).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-9\">In the instant case, it was appropriate for the sentencing judge to apply a \u201cformal categorical approach,\u201d and look \u201conly to the statutory definition[] of the prior offense[ ]; and not to the particular facts underlying th[at] convietion[ ].\u201d <em>Taylor, </em>495 U.S. at 600, 110 S.Ct. 2143. The Colorado statute under which Morehouse was convicted defined a crime that was related to \u201caggravated sexual abuse, sexu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>al abuse, or abusive sexual conduct involving a minor or ward.\u201d. Thus, the sentencing judge properly concluded that Morehouse was subject to an enhanced sentence under \u00a7 2252A(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">Morehouse, hoping that there will be a change in the current state of the law, contends that the sentencing judge violated his Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury by finding the fact of his prior conviction. In light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998) and our decision in <em>United States v. Vargas, </em>477 F.3d 94 (3d Cir.2007), we must reject this claim. Although the Supreme Court has questioned its decision in <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>it has yet to be overruled. <em>See, e.g., Shepard, </em>544 U.S. at 27, 125 S.Ct. 1254 (Thomas, J., concurring) (arguing \u201ca majority of the Court now recognizes that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was wrongly decided\u201d); <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000) (explaining \u201cit is arguable that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided\u201d). Thus, <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>continues to bind our decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b112-23\">.
