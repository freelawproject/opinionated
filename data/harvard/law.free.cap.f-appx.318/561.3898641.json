We have jurisdiction over a final order of removal pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1). We grant the petition for review and remand for an exercise of the Attorney General\u2019s discretion with regard to cancellation of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">We review the BIA\u2019s legal determinations de novo. <em>See Aguiluz-Arellano v. Gonzales, </em>446 F.3d 980, 983 (9th Cir.2006). When, as here, the BIA adopts a portion of the Id\u2019s decision, we review that portion of the Id\u2019s decision as if it were the BIA\u2019s. <em>See Molina-Estrada v. INS, </em>293 F.3d 1089, 1093 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-8\">In finding Valle ineligible for cancellation of removal, the IJ did not properly consider how the state court treated the wobbler offense. <em>See Garcia-Lopez v. Ashcroft, </em>334 F.3d 840, 845 (9th Cir.2003) (holding that a wobbler offense qualified for the petty offense exception when the state court\u2019s post-probation actions made the offense a misdemeanor). Valle\u2019s sentence of six months in county jail, three years probation, and no future deprivation of rights after post-probationary expungement of the offense falls squarely within the misdemeanor portion of California Penal Code section 245(a)(1). <em>See </em>CaLPenal Code \u00a7 17. Because the maximum sentence under the misdemeanor portion of this statute is one year and Valle was sentenced to six months in county jail, his conviction satisfies the petty offense exception to the crime involving moral turpitude bar to admissibility. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(ii)(II).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-12\">Valle is eligible for cancellation of removal because the IJ has already concluded that he met all other eligibility requirements. However, because the statute providing for cancellation of removal is permissive rather than mandatory, we remand for an exercise of the Attorney General\u2019s discretion with regard to cancellation of removal. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-13\">PETITION GRANTED; REMANDED for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b586-21\"> jjjjj disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
