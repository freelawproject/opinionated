We review Orujyan\u2019s adverse credibility argument under the substantial evidence standard. <em>Rivera v. Mukasey, </em>508 F.3d 1271, 1274 (9th Cir.2007). The IJ primarily based her adverse credibility finding on her determination that several inconsistencies existed between Orujyan\u2019s testimony before the IJ and his asylum application and written declaration submitted with his application. We find that the inconsistencies do not provide substantial evidence to support an adverse credibility determination, because the discrepancies were most likely due to problems Orujyan had with his translator in creating both his asylum application and declaration. Furthermore, Orujyan\u2019s attorney admittedly did not review the application (written in English) with Orujyan in the Armenian language prior to Orujyan\u2019s hearing before the IJ. The IJ unfortunately never considered or addressed these reasons for the discrepancies. <em>See Singh v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 1100, 1105-06 (9th Cir.2006) (holding that \u201can adverse credibility finding is improper when an IJ fails to address a petitioner\u2019s explanation for a discrepancy or inconsistency\u201d) (quoting <em>Kaur v. Ashcroft, </em>379 F.3d 876, 887 (9th Cir.2004)). Additionally, some of the discrepancies were minor, and did not relate to the basis of Orujyan\u2019s fear of persecution. <em>See Mendoza Manimbao v. Ashcroft, </em>329 F.3d 655, 660 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-17\">The IJ also based her adverse credibility finding on personal speculation, an inappropriate basis for an adverse credibility <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>finding. <em>See Shah v. INS, </em>220 F.3d 1062, 1071 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">2. We review the IJ\u2019s determination that Orujyan \u201cfailed to sustain his burden of proof in regard to any of the elements of the [asylum and withholding of removal] claims\u201d under a substantial evidence standard. <em>See Sangha v. INS, </em>103 F.3d 1482, 1487 (9th Cir.1997); <em>Ahmed v. Keisler, </em>504 F.3d 1183, 1200 (9th Cir.2007). Because the IJ did not point to <em>any </em>factual evidence to support this finding, we reverse this holding. <em>See Al-Harbi v. INS, </em>242 F.3d 882, 888 (9th Cir.2001) (holding that an IJ\u2019s findings on the merits of claims of asylum and withholding of removal must be substantiated with \u201creasonable, substantial and probative evidence in the record\u201d). We remand for proceedings consistent with this disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">PETITION GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b584-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b584-18\">. The IJ also denied Orujyan's petition for protection under the Convention Against Torture, but Orujyan did not appeal this determination.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
