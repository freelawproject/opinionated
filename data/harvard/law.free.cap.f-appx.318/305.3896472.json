(\u201cBiomet\u201d). For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-16\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b330-17\">In June 2004, Reed fractured his hip in an automobile accident. The orthopedic surgeon at the hospital where he was treated implanted a Vari-Angle Hip Screw (\u201cVHS\u201d) device allegedly manufactured by Biomet to repair his hip. Approximately eight months after the surgery, an x-ray showed that the VHS device had fractured; as a result, Reed underwent a second hip operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-18\">Reed filed suit against Biomet under the Louisiana Products Liability Act (\u201cLPLA\u201d), claiming that the VHS device implanted in his hip was \u201cunreasonably dangerous in construction or composition\u201d and/or \u201cdid not conform to an express warranty\u201d made by Biomet. Biomet filed \u00e1 motion for summary judgment. The district court granted the motion, holding that Reed had provided no evidence of a defect in the VHS device\u2019s \u201cconstruction or composition\u201d or of any \u201cexpress warranty\u201d made by Biomet. Reed appeals.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b330-19\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b330-20\">\u201cWe review a grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>applying the same standard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>as the district court.\u201d <em>Broussard v. Procter &amp; Gamble Co., </em>517 F.3d 767, 769 (5th Cir.2008). Summary judgment is appropriate \u201cif the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). \u201cWe review all evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.\u201d <em>Broussard, </em>517 F.3d at 769.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">To maintain a claim that a product is \u201cunreasonably dangerous\u201d in its \u201cconstruction or composition\u201d under the LPLA, a plaintiff must show that, \u201cat the time the product left its manufacturer\u2019s control, the product deviated in a material way from the manufacturer\u2019s specifications or performance standards for the product or from otherwise identical products manufactured by the same manufacturer.\u201d La. Rev.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 9:2800.55; <em>see also Stahl v. Novartis Pharm. Corp., </em>283 F.3d 254, 261 (5th Cir.2002). The \u201cconstruction or composition\u201d provision of the LPLA thus \u201cprovides a remedy for damages caused by a product that is defective due to a mistake in the manufacturing process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 263.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">In support of its motion for summary judgment, Biomet submitted affidavits and reports of two expert witnesses who examined the VHS device explanted from Reed and concluded that there was no manufacturing defect. Biomet also submitted portions of the deposition of Reed\u2019s orthopedic surgeon. She testified that the VHS device most likely broke due to Reed\u2019s failure to comply with her instructions to limit the weight placed on his hip and on the implant. Therefore, Biomet met its initial evidentiary burden on summary judgment; the burden then \u201cshift[ed]\u201d to Reed \u201cto produce evidence or designate specific facts showing the existence of a genuine issue for trial.\u201d <em>Fordoche, Inc. v. Texaco, Inc., </em>463 F.3d 388, 392 (5th Cir.2006) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-9\">Reed\u2019s opposition to summary judgment only challenged Biomet\u2019s contention that he did not follow his doctor\u2019s instructions. On appeal, Reed still maintains that summary judgment was improperly granted because there are \u201cdisputed issues of fact\u201d as to whether or not Reed\u2019s physician instructed him on the proper use of the VHS device and whether or not Reed followed those instructions. However, in the absence of any evidence of a defect in the VHS device itself, these are not issues of \u201cmaterial fact\u201d because they would not \u201caffect the outcome of the suit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Regardless of the instructions given to Reed and his compliance with those instructions, Reed has not presented any evidence of a \u201cconstruction or composition\u201d defect in the VHS device, that would suggest a material deviation from Biomet\u2019s production standards or identical products. <em>See Stahl, </em>283 F.3d at 263.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-10\">Accordingly, Reed has failed to set forth specific facts showing the existence of a genuine issue of material fact, and the district court properly granted summary judgment. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b331-11\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b331-12\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b330-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Ciu R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b330-13\">. Reed does not challenge the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on his claim that the device failed to conform to Biomet's express warranty; he has thus waived that issue on appeal. <em>See Leasehold Expense Recovery, Inc. v. Mothers Work, Inc., </em>331 F.3d 452, 462 n. 4 (5th Cir.2003). Therefore, we review only the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on Reed\u2019s \"construction or composition\" claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
