Huskins received a term of seventy-eight months imprisonment for the drug offense and a consecutive five-year sentence for the \u00a7 924(c) conviction. She appeals her sentence, contending that the government\u2019s decision not to move for a substantial assistance departure under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 5K1.1 (2006) amounted to prosecutorial misconduct. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-24\">Huskins claims that the government was guilty of prosecutorial misconduct because (1) a substitute attorney appeared at sentencing instead of the attorney who was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>most familiar with her cooperation and (2) her cooperation was deemed not substantial because it did not result in high-value prosecutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">With respect to the first claim, the government was not obligated to have a particular attorney appear at sentencing. The attorney who appeared had been informed about the extent of Huskins\u2019 cooperation by the attorney with primary responsibility for her case, and was able to advise the court that Huskins had apparently done her best to cooperate, and the lack of substantial results was mainly because her information was not sufficiently current to be useful.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">Huskins\u2019 second claim is groundless because the plea agreement gave the government full discretion to decide whether Huskins\u2019 assistance was substantial and warranted a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion. The filing of a motion for sentence reduction based on substantial assistance provided by a defendant is within the government\u2019s sole discretion. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(b); USSG \u00a7 5K1.1. A court may remedy the government\u2019s refusal to move for a reduction of sentence if: (1) the government has obligated itself to move for a reduction under the terms of the plea agreement, <em>United States v. Conner, </em>930 F.2d 1073, 1076 (4th Cir.1991), or (2) the government\u2019s refusal to move for a reduction was based on an unconstitutional motive. <em>Wade v. United States, </em>504 U.S. 181, 185-86, 112 S.Ct. 1840, 118 L.Ed.2d 524 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">If the defendant cannot show a breach of her plea agreement or an unconstitutional motive, \u201ca claim that a defendant merely provided substantial assistance will not entitle a defendant to a remedy or even to discovery or an evidentiary hearing; Nor would additional but generalized allegations of improper motive.\u201d <em>Wade, </em>504 U.S. at 186, 112 S.Ct. 1840. Huskins asserts that <em>Wade </em>does not apply in her case because she had a plea agreement, while the defendant in <em>Wade </em>did not. As explained above, <em>Wade </em>provides that a defendant is entitled to a hearing when she makes a threshold showing that the government\u2019s refusal to make a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion was based on \u201csuspect reasons such as race or religion.\u201d <em>Wade, </em>504 U.S. at 185-86, 112 S.Ct. 1840. Huskins has not made such a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">Relying principally on <em>United States v. Dixon, </em>998 F.2d 228 (4th Cir.1993), Huskins contends that the government may not withhold a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion on the ground that a defendant\u2019s cooperation failed to yield a prosecution. <em>Dixon </em>is distinguishable. In that case, the government agreed to move for a \u00a7 5K1.1 departure if it deemed the defendant\u2019s cooperation \u201cin the investigation or prosecution of another person\u201d to be substantial. <em>Dixon, </em>998 F.2d at 229. The government later moved for a \u00a7 5K1.1 departure, and then moved to withdraw the motion to keep the defendant under pressure to testify at an upcoming trial. <em>Id. </em>at 229-30. We held that Dixon was \u201centitled to specific performance of the government\u2019s promise to move for a substantial assistance departure\u201d because the government had \u201cconsistently deemed Dixon\u2019s assistance in investigating others substantial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 231. In contrast, Huskins\u2019 plea agreement accorded the government unfettered discretion to determine whether Huskins\u2019 \u201cassistance has been substantial\u201d and provided that, if the government decided that her assistance was substantial, the government \u201cmay make a motion pursuant to \u00a7 5K1.1 for imposition of a sentence below the applicable Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d The government did not obligate itself to move for a departure or breach the agreement by finding Huskins\u2019 assistance less than substantial.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>In her reply brief, Huskins asserts for the first time that \u201cit appears that the majority, if not all, of the information Appellant possessed was provided to the government before she signed the plea agreement.\u201d Huskins concedes that she is not certain of this fact. A guilty plea induced with a promise that the government knew at the time it would not keep may be grounds for a rescission of the agreement. <em>United States v. Snow, </em>234 F.3d 187, 191 (4th Cir.2000). However, because Huskins did not raise the issue in her opening brief, it is not properly before this court. <em>United States v. Lewis, </em>235 F.3d 215, 218 n. 3 (4th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">We therefore affirm the sentence imposed by the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
