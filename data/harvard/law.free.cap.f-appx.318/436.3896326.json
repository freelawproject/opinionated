Mr. Cunningham raises only one issue on appeal, namely, whether the district court erred in denying him safety-valve relief under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-21\">Mr. Cunningham\u2019s sentence was the minimum permitted by the applicable statute, unless he could demonstrate that the district court was authorized to sentence him to a lesser term based on \u00a7 3553(f), <em>see United States v. Sanchez, </em>475 F.3d 978, 980 (8th Cir.2007). Among the things that Mr. Cunningham had to Show to entitle him to this dispensation was that he had \u201ctruthfully provided to the Government all information and evidence [he] has concerning the offense or offenses that were part of the same course of conduct.\u201d <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f)(5); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2(5). The district court gave Mr. Cunningham a chance at his public sentencing hearing and <em>in camera </em>to carry this burden; the court listened to his testimony but concluded that Mr. Cunningham had not been completely forthcoming and so denied him relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-22\">We have carefully read the transcripts of the proceedings below and conclude that the district court did not err in holding that Mr. Cunningham did not carry his burden. We note particularly that the court was unconvinced that Mr. Cunningham, after having dealt in drugs \u201cover a long period of time,\u201d could not \u201crecall with better specificity at least some of the customers he had.\u201d We detect no error in this logic and in the district court\u2019s conclusion that Mr. Cunningham had not been entirely forthright about matters that were material and relevant to his offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-23\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b460-19\">. The Honorable James M. Moody, United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Arkansas.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
