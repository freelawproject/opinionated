Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-23\">Hay received a sentence of eighteen months, at the lowest end of the 18 to 24 month Sentencing Guidelines range, after he was found to have sold narcotics to a confidential informant. Hay argues that the court gave an insufficient statement of reasons for the sentence and should have imposed a sentence below the Guidelines range. This court will affirm a sentence imposed following revocation of supervised release if it is within the prescribed statutory range and is not plainly unreasonable. <em>United States v. Crudup, </em>461 F.3d 433, 437-39 (4th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-24\">The court correctly calculated the Guidelines range. Upon a finding of a Grade A violation, and criminal history category of II, the range was 18-24 months. Implicit from the record is the district court\u2019s consideration of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2006) factors. <em>See United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 339, 345 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>(4th Cir.2006) (court need not \u201crobotically tick through \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s every subsection.\u201d). Both parties argued for the sentence they deemed appropriate. Because there was no procedural or substantive error, Hay\u2019s sentence, which was at the bottom of the calculated range was not plainly unreasonable. Therefore the district court did not abuse its discretion in imposing the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment. We deny Hay\u2019s counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw as counsel and to substitute counsel. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
