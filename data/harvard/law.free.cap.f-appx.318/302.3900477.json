Herrera contends that his sentence was greater than necessary to accomplish the goals of sentencing listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2) because his motive for committing the offense and his personal history and characteristics made his \u201csituation unique, despite his regrettable criminal history.\u201d Herrera concedes that this court ordinarily applies a presumption of reasonableness to within-guidelines sentences. <em>See United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006); <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462-68, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). Herrera argues for the first time on appeal, however, that his sentence is not entitled to the presumption because the guideline for illegal reentry, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, is not empirically supported as required by <em>Kim-brough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 574-75, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-21\">In reviewing a sentence, we \u201cconsider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Herrera did not challenge \u00a7 2L1.2 in the district court on the basis that the guideline was not supported by empirical data. We therefore review this argument for plain error. <em>See United, States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 339 (5th Cir.), cert. <em>denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 328, 172 L.Ed.2d 236 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">The question in <em>Kimbrough </em>was whether \u201ca sentence ... outside the guidelines range is per se unreasonable when it is based on a disagreement with the sentencing disparity for crack and powder cocaine offenses.\u201d 128 S.Ct. at 564 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). <em>Kimbrough </em>does not address the applicability of the presumption of reasonableness. Moreover, <em>Campos-Maldonado </em>supports the continued applicability of the appellate presumption to \u00a7 2L1.2 sentences. <em>See Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d at 338-39. The district court considered Herrera\u2019s sentencing arguments and imposed a sentence at the top of the advisory guidelines range based on his extensive criminal history. Herrera\u2019s sentence is entitled to a rebuttable presumption of reasonableness. <em>See Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d at 338; <em>United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 624, 172 L.Ed.2d 617 (2008). Because Herrera has not shown that his sentence is unreasonable, he has not shown error, plain or otherwise. The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b326-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
