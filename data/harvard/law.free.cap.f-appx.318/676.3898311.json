Ill R. Doc. 120, 136. Our jurisdiction arises under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">Beginning in 2006, Ms. Mitchell filed several actions against a total of sixteen defendants alleging that the defendants defamed Ms. Mitchell by announcing over the radio that Ms. Mitchell had and was intentionally spreading the AIDS virus. I R. Doc. 3, 4, 5; II R. Doc. 95. The separate actions were consolidated on November 16, 2006, and the consolidated action was dismissed without prejudice on September 6, 2007 for failure to comply with Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a). <em>See </em>II R. Doc. 95. The district court granted Ms. Mitchell leave to file a Second Amended Complaint, and provided specific requirements for the second complaint. <em>Id. </em>at 20-21. Ms. Mitchell was warned that failure to comply with the court\u2019s guidelines could result in dismissal with prejudice. <em>Id. </em>at 21. On September 21, 2007, Ms. Mitchell filed four separate amended complaints. II R. Doc. 96; III R. Doc. 97, 99; Doc. 98. Upon a finding that Ms. Mitchell\u2019s amended complaints were non-compliant, magistrate judge Boyd N. Boland recommended that the actions be dismissed with prejudice. III R. Doc. 122. The district court agreed, and dismissed Ms. Mitchell\u2019s action with prejudice on September 25, 2008. III R. Doc. 136.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-10\">On appeal, Ms. Mitchell raises twenty-seven issues, inclusive of a challenge to the dismissal. \u201cUnder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(b), a district court may dismiss an action with prejudice if the plaintiff fails \u2018to comply with [the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure] or any order of court.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cosby v. Meadors, </em>351 F.3d 1324, 1333 (10th Cir.2003) (quoting Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(b)). A district court may dismiss an action under Rule 41(b) after consideration of the following factors: \u201c(1) the degree of actual prejudice to the defendant; (2) the amount of interference with the judicial process; (3) the culpability of the litigant; (4) whether the court warned the party in advance that dismissal of the action would be a likely sanction for noncompliance; and (5) the efficacy of lesser sanctions.\u201d <em>Olsen v. Mapes, </em>333 F.3d 1199, 1204 (10th Cir.2003) (quoting <em>Mobley v. McCormick, </em>40 F.3d 337, 340 (10th Cir.1994)); <em>see Eh-renhaus v. Reynolds, </em>965 F.2d 916, 921 (10th Cir.1992). We review such a dismissal for an abuse of discretion. <em>Olsen, </em>333 F.3d at 1204.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-12\">Upon a complete review of the record, and for substantially the same reasons set forth by the magistrate judge and district court, we find that the dismissal was well within the district court\u2019s discretion, and we therefore affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b701-9\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
