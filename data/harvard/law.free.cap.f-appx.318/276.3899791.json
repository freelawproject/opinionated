Padilla argues for the first time on appeal that the district court erred by imposing a 16-level crime of violence enhancement to his offense level because the presentence report (PSR) incorrectly cited U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(l), rather than \u00a7 2L1.2, as the basis for the enhancement. Padilla does not contend that the prior conviction that resulted in the 16-level increase was not a crime of violence, nor does he challenge the existence of the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-21\">We review for plain error. <em>See United, States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 272 (5th Cir.2005). To show plain error, the appellant must show an error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights. <em>United States v. Baker, </em>538 F.3d 324, 332 (5th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 962, 173 L.Ed.2d 153 (2009). If the appellant makes such a showing, this court has the discretion to correct the error, but only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b300-24\">It is evident that the PSR\u2019.s reference to Section 2Ll.l(b)(l) was merely a typographical or clerical error. The remedy for such an error is, at best, remand for correction of the error. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Crim.P. 36. However, because he has not shown that the error affected his substantial rights, remand is not warranted. <em>See Baker, </em>538 F.3d at 332; <em>United States v. Acuna-Chavez, </em>77 Fed-Appx. 262, 264 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-25\">In light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>(2000), Padilla challenges the constitutionality of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury. This argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). <em>United States v. Pineda-Arrellano, </em>492 F.3d 624, 625 (5th Cir.2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 872, 169 L.Ed.2d 737 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b300-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
