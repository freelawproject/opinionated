In the related case at Docket No. 07-2753, the parents appeal from an order entered by the District Court on June 5, 2007, in which the District Court denied their motion for prevailing party attorney\u2019s fees in that case. For the reasons that follow, we will affirm the District Court in both instances.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">We write exclusively for the parties, who are familiar with the factual context and legal history of this ease. Therefore, we will set forth only those facts necessary to our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">A. No. 07-2440</p>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">In late 2003, when the dispute underlying the appeal at No. 07-2440 arose, J.R. was a fifth-grade student at Adams Elementary School in the Mars Area School District. J.R. had previously been identified by the School District as a student with a \u201cspecific learning disability\u201d and, as such, the School District was required under the IDEA to develop an individualized education program (IEP) for him and to review it once a year. <em>See </em>20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1414(d)(2), (4); <em>Schaffer v. Weast, </em>546 U.S. 49, 53, 126 S.Ct. 528, 163 L.Ed.2d 387 (2005) (discussing 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1414(d)). In May 2001 the School District and J.R.\u2019s parents agreed upon an IEP to govern J.R.\u2019s education during the 2001-2002 school year, his third-grade year. Under that IEP, J.R. spent most of his school day in a regular classroom but also received learning support for approximately one hour a day in a resource room. The 2001-2002 IEP was not intended to serve J.R. beyond his third-grade year, but it was the last IEP to which J.R.\u2019s parents and the School District were able to agree, despite having met numerous times to discuss various program proposals for the subsequent 2002-2003 and 2003-2004 school years.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-11\">On August 6, 2003, the School District presented yet another proposed IEP to J.R.\u2019s parents, which it detailed in a Notice of Recommended Educational Placement (NOREP). That proposed IEP was intended for J.R.\u2019s 2003-2004 school year, and among its many provisions was a recommendation that, going forward, he receive \u201citinerant\u201d learning support, i.e., learning support provided primarily in the regular classroom, in place of the daily hour of resource room support specified in his 2001-2002 IEP.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A few days later, on August 11, 2003, the School District sent a form letter to J.R.\u2019s parents informing them that it would offer inclusion classes to all of its elementary students, including J.R., starting in the 2003-2004 school year. After receiving both of these documents, J.R.\u2019s parents, apparently displeased with the prospect that J.R.\u2019s learning support services would be provided in an inclusion classroom instead of in a resource room, decided not to approve the NOREP, returning it unsigned to the School District. Instead, they requested a due process hearing to assess two related issues: (1) whether the School District had denied J.R. a free appropriate public education <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>(FAPE) by failing to implement a mutually agreed upon IEP for the 2003-2004 school year and (2) whether the School District\u2019s decision to provide learning support services to J.R. in an inclusion classroom instead of in a resource room amounted to a change in his educational placement.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">At the due process hearing, the hearing officer heard the testimony of three witnesses for the School District\u2014J.R.\u2019s fifth-grade teacher, his special education teacher, and the district-wide director of special education\u2014and one witness for J.R.\u2014his mother. The School District\u2019s witnesses testified that J.R. continued to receive in the inclusion classroom all the services specified in his 2001-2002 IEP, that he was making academic progress in the inclusion classroom, and that he was passing all of his subjects. J.R.\u2019s mother, for her part, testified that she did not know, nor had she been informed of, the amount of time J.R. was spending with a special education teacher each day in the inclusion classroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">After considering this testimony and the other evidence presented by the parties, the hearing officer held that the School District had neither deprived J.R. of a FAPE nor unilaterally changed his educational placement, concluding that \u201c[t]here was no evidence presented or testimony that stated [J.R.] was not receiving the needed special education services.\u201d J.R.\u2019s parents administratively appealed<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and the state appeals panel reversed the hearing officer\u2019s decision in part, holding that \u201cthe [School] District\u2019s automatic decision to educate [J.R.] in an inclusion classroom ... constituted a unilateral placement\u201d and ordering the School District to provide J.R. with one hour of compensatory education in learning services for each school day he attended during the 2003-2004 school year.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-9\">The School District then brought this action challenging the appeals panel\u2019s decision. After reviewing the administrative record, the District Court entered judgment in favor of the School District on May 4, 2007, concluding that J.R.\u2019s parents had not demonstrated that the School District\u2019s unilateral relocation of J.R. to an inclusion classroom constituted a change in his educational placement.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On May 10, 2007, J.R.\u2019s parents filed a notice of appeal from that judgment, which the Clerk of the Court docketed at No. 07-2440.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-10\">B. No. 07-2753</p>\n<p id=\"b140-11\">The appeal at No. 07-2753 arises from an earlier due process proceeding initiated by J.R.\u2019s parents to determine whether the School District had denied J.R. a FAPE during his third- and fourth-grade years. The hearing officer in that proceeding held that the School District had denied J.R. a FAPE during those school years and or<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>dered it to provide J.R. with 283.5 hours of compensatory education, which an appeals panel subsequently increased to 306.5 hours. The parties eventually settled the matter during a pretrial conference before the District Court and, although the School District agreed in the settlement to provide J.R. with nothing more than the 306.5 hours of compensatory education ordered by the appeals panel, J.R.\u2019s parents filed a motion seeking prevailing party attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">In an order dated May 4, 2007, the District Court determined \u201ccategorically\u201d that J.R.\u2019s parents could not be considered prevailing parties for purposes of the federal action because they \u201coccupied] precisely the same legal position [as a result of the settlement] which they were in immediately following the decision of the Appeals Panel in 2003,\u201d having \u201cachieved absolutely nothing more than had been awarded by the Appeals Panel.\u201d They could, however, be considered prevailing parties at the state administrative level, the District Court concluded, because of their success with respect to certain issues raised in that forum, and thus were eligible to recover reasonable attorney\u2019s fees \u201cspecifically related to that success throughout the administrative proceedings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">But the District Court, that conclusion notwithstanding, was unable to determine the amount of attorney\u2019s fees to which J.R.\u2019s parents were entitled because the \u201cextremely generic and vague\u201d supporting documentation submitted by their attorney, Eugene A. Lincoln, Esq., fell \u201cfar short of providing sufficient detail to permit the Court to determine whether each claimed legal activity was related to the specific issues on which [the parents] prevailed.\u201d Rather than simply deny altogether the parents\u2019 motion for fees, however, the District Court \u201cheld in abeyance\u201d the question of their right to attorney\u2019s fees \u201cincurred in the administrative process\u201d and instead directed Mr. Lincoln \u201cto submit a revised fee petition [containing] sufficient detail to enable the Court to evaluate the relationship between counsel\u2019s legal actions and the issue(s) on which [J.R.\u2019s parents] prevailed at the administrative level.\u201d Mr. Lincoln did not submit a revised petition, however, and the District Court ultimately denied the parents\u2019 petition in full in an order dated June 5, 2007, concluding that they had not met their burden to submit sufficient evidence \u201cto demonstrate which legal services are compensable for the ... issues on which they prevailed\u201d at the administrative level. The parents filed a notice of appeal from that order on June 11, 2007, which the Clerk docketed at No. 07-2753 and consolidated with No. 07-2440.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">II. JURISDICTION AND STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b141-9\">The District Court had jurisdiction under 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(i)(3) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331. We have appellate jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-10\">A district court must review an IDEA decision by a state administrative agency under a modified de novo standard. <em>L.E. v. Ramsey Bd. of Educ., </em>435 F.3d 384, 389 (3d Cir.2006). Under this unusual standard, a district court must afford \u201cdue weight\u201d to the factual findings from the administrative proceedings, considering those findings to be \u201cprima facie correct.\u201d <em>See id.; Shore Reg\u2019l High Sch. Bd. of Educ. v. P.S., </em>381 F.3d 194, 199 (3d Cir.2004); <em>see also Bd. of Educ. of Hendrick Hudson Cent. Sch. Dist. v. Rowley, </em>458 U.S. 176, 206, 102 S.Ct. 3034, 73 L.Ed.2d 690 (1982); <em>Carlisle Area Sch. v. Scott P., </em>62 F.3d 520, 524 (3d Cir.1995) (\u201cThe district court may reach an independent decision, except that it must accord the deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>sion of the state agency \u2018due weight\u2019 in its consideration.\u201d). At the same time, the district court must \u201chear additional evidence at the request of a party,\u201d 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(i)(2)(C)(ii), and must also \u201cmake its own findings by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>Shore Reg\u2019l, </em>381 F.3d at 199; <em>see </em>20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(i)(2)(C)(iii). But \u201cwhere the District Court does not hear additional evidence it must find support for any factual conclusions contrary to [those of the administrative agency] in the record before it.\u201d <em>S.H. v. State-Operated Sch. Dist. of Newark, </em>336 F.3d 260, 270 (3d Cir.2003). In contrast, the \u201cdue weight\u201d to be afforded to the administrative proceedings is \u201cnot implicated with respect to issues of law, such as the proper interpretation of the [IDEA] and its requirements\u201d; that is, the district court owes no deference to conclusions of law drawn by a state or local educational agency. <em>Lillbask ex rel. Mauclaire v. Conn. Dep\u2019t of Educ., </em>397 F.3d 77, 82 (2d Cir.2005); <em>see Alex R. v. Forrestville Valley Cmty. Unit Sch. Dist. # 221, </em>375 F.3d 603, 611 (7th Cir.2004); <em>cf. Carlisle Area Sch., </em>62 F.3d at 528 n. 3 (\u201cObviously, conclusions of law receive plenary review.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">We, in turn, \u201c\u2018exercise plenary review with respect to the question whether the District Court applied the correct legal standards under the IDEA, but we review the District Court\u2019s factual findings for clear error.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ramsey Bd. of Educ., </em>435 F.3d at 389 (quoting <em>Shore Reg\u2019l, </em>381 F.3d at 199); <em>see Lauren W. v. DeFlaminis, </em>480 F.3d 259, 266 (3d Cir.2007); <em>Carlisle Area Sch., </em>62 F.3d at 526. \u201c \u2018A finding of fact is clearly erroneous when, after reviewing the evidence, the court of appeals is left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Shore Reg\u2019l, </em>381 F.3d at 199 (quoting <em>Oberti v. Bd. of Educ. of Clementon Sch. Dist., </em>995 F.2d 1204, 1220 (3d Cir.1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of attorney\u2019s fees under the IDEA\u2019S fee-shifting provision, 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(i)(3)(B), under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Pardini v. Allegheny Intermediate Unit, </em>524 F.3d 419, 422 (3d Cir.2008) <em>(Pardini </em>II); <em>P.N. v. Clementon Bd. of Educ., </em>442 F.3d 848, 852 (3d Cir.2006). A district court abuses its discretion when it rests its decision \u201c \u2018upon a clearly erroneous finding of fact, an errant conclusion of law or an improper application of law to fact.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pardini II, </em>524 F.3d at 422 (quoting <em>Clementon Bd. of Educ., </em>442 F.3d at 852); <em>see Rode v. Dellarciprete, </em>892 F.2d 1177, 1182-83 (3d Cir.1990) (\u201cAn abuse of discretion can occur when no reasonable person would adopt the district court\u2019s view. Whether the district court applied the proper standards or procedures is a question of law subject to plenary review. The district court\u2019s factual findings are reviewed under a clearly erroneous standard.\u201d) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">A. Change in Educational Placement</p>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">The principal question in the appeal at No. 07-2440 is whether the District Court erred in concluding that the School District\u2019s unilateral relocation of J.R. out of the resource room and into an inclusion classroom during the pendency of proceedings amounts to a change in his educational placement within the meaning of the IDEA\u2019S \u201cstay-put\u201d provision, 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(j). Section 1415(j) provides, in relevant part, that \u201cduring the pendency of any proceedings conducted pursuant to this section, unless the State or local educational agency and the parents otherwise agree, the child shall remain in the then-current educational placement of the child ... until all such proceedings have been completed.\u201d The Supreme Court has explained that the main purpose of the stay-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>put provision is \u201cto strip schools of the <em>unilateral </em>authority they had traditionally employed to exclude disabled students ... from school.\u201d <em>Honig v. Doe, </em>484 U.S. 305, 323, 108 S.Ct. 592, 98 L.Ed.2d 686 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">The IDEA does not define the term \u201ceducational placement\u201d and thus \u201cidentifying a change in this placement is something of an inexact science.\u201d <em>Bd. of Educ. of Cmty. High Sch. Dist. No. 218 v. Ill. State Bd. of Educ., </em>103 F.3d 545, 548 (7th Cir.1996). Nonetheless, our precedent provides some guidance in this regard. In <em>DeLeon v. Susquehanna Community School District, </em>747 F.2d 149 (3d Cir.1984), a case relied on heavily by the District Court, we discussed our understanding of what constitutes a \u201cchange in educational placement\u201d in the context of a predecessor statute to the IDEA. As we explained in that case, \u201c[t]he question of what constitutes a change in educational placement is, necessarily, fact specific\u201d and thus, \u201cin determining whether a given modification in a child\u2019s school day should be considered a \u2018change in educational placement,\u2019 \u201d the \u201ctouchstone\u201d is whether the modification \u201cis likely to affect in some significant way the child\u2019s learning experience.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 153.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">Here, the District Court properly focused its inquiry on whether the move to an inclusion classroom was likely to significantly affect J.R.\u2019s ability to learn. Reviewing the administrative record, the District Court found that it contained \u201cno evidence that the move to an inclusion classroom was likely to affect [J.R.\u2019s] learning experience in any \u2018significant way.\u2019 ... The School District provided the same educational services to [J.R.] on a daily basis, with the same special education teacher, but in a different room.\u201d The District Court also accepted the sparse findings made during the administrative proceedings. Having reviewed the record, we conclude that the District Court\u2019s findings were not clearly erroneous and that it did not err in concluding that J.R.\u2019s relocation did not amount to a change in his educational placement within the meaning of the stay-put provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">J.R.\u2019s parents assert that the District Court, in reaching its decision, misapplied the modified de novo standard of review by according due weight to the hearing officer\u2019s decision instead of the appeals panel\u2019s decision. We disagree. It is not at all clear that the District Court deferred to the hearing officer\u2019s findings to the exclusion of those of the appeals panel. The District Court explicitly stated that it had considered the decisions of both the hearing officer and the appeals panel and that it was accepting the \u201cfactual findings made during the state administrative proceedings,\u201d not simply those of the hearing officer. Indeed, the District Court clearly viewed the appeals panel\u2019s findings, insofar as it made any, as compatible with those of the hearing officer, and we concur: Nothing in the record indicates that the appeals panel had a view of the underlying facts, or of the credibility of any witness, that differed in a significant way from that of the hearing officer. To the contrary, as the District Court noted, the appeals panel apparently accepted the hearing officer\u2019s findings but reached a different legal conclusion based on those findings. Nor is there any indication that the District Court took a significantly different view of the underlying facts. Inasmuch as the issue before the District Court was one of law, it did not misapply the modified de novo standard of review. <em>Cf. Pardini v. Allegheny Intermediate Unit, </em>420 F.3d 181, 192 n. 13 (3d Cir.2005) <em>(Pardini I) </em>(noting that \u201cthe interpretation of \u00a7 1415(j) ... is a purely legal one\u201d); <em>Drinker v. Colonial Sch. Dist., </em>78 F.3d 859, 865 (3d Cir.1996) (holding that the question of what consti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>tutes a student\u2019s \u201ccurrent educational placement\u201d is one of law).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">B. Attorney\u2019s Fees</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">We turn next to the appeal at No. 07-2753, where J.R.\u2019s parents challenge the District Coui't\u2019s decision denying their request for attorney\u2019s fees in that case. Specifically, the parents contend that the settlement they reached with the School District was sufficient to confer \u201cprevailing party\u201d status on them and that the District Court abused its discretion in finding to the contrary. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">The IDEA\u2019S fee-shifting provision, 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(i)(3)(B), provides in relevant part that \u201cthe court, in its discretion, may award reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees as part of the costs ... to a prevailing party who is the parent of a child with a disability.\u201d For purposes of the fee-shifting provision, \u201ca plaintiff \u2018prevails\u2019 when actual relief on the merits of his claim materially alters the legal relationship between the parties by modifying the defendant\u2019s behavior in a way that directly benefits the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Clementon Bd. of Educ., </em>442 F.3d at 855 (quoting <em>Farrar v. Hobby, </em>506 U.S. 103, 111-12, 113 S.Ct. 566, 121 L.Ed.2d 494 (1992)) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see Hensley v. Eckerhart, </em>461 U.S. 424, 433, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 76 L.Ed.2d 40 (1983) (\u201c[P]laintiffs may be considered \u2018prevailing parties\u2019 for attorney\u2019s fees purposes if they succeed on any significant issue in litigation which achieves some of the benefit the parties sought in bringing suit.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">J.R.\u2019s parents cannot be considered prevailing parties at the district court level. After four years of federal litigation, they agreed to a settlement that did not provide them with any relief beyond that which they had already achieved in the administrative proceedings, abandoning \u201call other claims\u201d raised in their complaint in doing so. As the District Court noted, J.R.\u2019s parents \u201coccup[ied] precisely the same legal position [after the settlement] they were in when the case started.\u201d On these facts, we cannot say that the settlement materially altered the legal relationship between the parties, either in a way that directly benefits J.R.\u2019s parents or otherwise, and we see no reason to disagree with the District Court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-10\">Moreover, the parents seemingly restrict their argument on appeal to the prevailing party issue and do not acknowledge, much less attempt to justify or explain, Mr. Lincoln\u2019s failure to comply with the District Court\u2019s order that he submit a revised fee petition. To the extent they nonetheless intend to challenge the District Court\u2019s ruling that they failed to meet their burden to submit sufficient evidence \u201cto demonstrate which legal services are compensable for the ... issues on which they prevailed\u201d at the administrative level, we find no abuse of discretion. <em>See Hensley, </em>461 U.S. at 433, 103 S.Ct. 1933 (\u201cWhere the documentation of hours is inadequate, the district court may reduce the award accordingly.\u201d); <em>Loughner v. Univ. of Pittsburgh, </em>260 F.3d 173, 178 (3d Cir.2001) (holding that a district court \u201cshould reduce the hours claimed by the number of hours ... for which the fee petition inadequately documents the hours claimed\u201d); <em>Rode, </em>892 F.2d at 1190 (\u201cA fee petition is required to be specific enough to allow the district court to determine if the hours claimed are unreasonable for the work performed.\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>IV.

During the time period relevant to this case, Pennsylvania had a two-tiered administrative system of review in IDEA cases, in which the initial hearing took place before a hearing officer at the local educational agency level followed by an independent review of the hearing officer's decision by an appeals panel at the state educational agency level. <em>See 22 </em>Pa.Code \u00a7 14.162(d), (o) (2003); <em>cf. Carlisle Area Sch. v. Scott P., </em>62 F.3d 520, 526-27 (3d Cir.1995) (discussing Pennsylvania's two-tiered system). Pennsylvania subsequently amended its administrative procedures to allow a hearing officer\u2019s decision to be appealed directly to a court of competent jurisdiction. <em>See 22 </em>Pa.Code \u00a7 14.162(o) (2008). That amendment took effect on July 1, 2008, and does not apply to this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b140-13\">. Although the appeals panel affirmed the hearing officer's decision that the School District had not denied J.R. a FAPE by failing to implement a mutually agreed upon IEP for the 2003-2004 school year, J.R.'s parents abandoned their challenge to this aspect of the administrative decision in the District Court, and we do not address it here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b144-8\">. The parents raise two additional issues in this appeal, neither of which has any merit. First, their contention that the District Court was required to obtain their consent before referring nondispositive pretrial matters to a Magistrate Judge is contradicted by, inter alia, our precedent interpreting the Federal Magistrates Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636. <em>See, e.g., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number><em>Beazer E., Inc. v. Mead Corp., </em>412 F.3d 429, 438 (3d Cir.2005) (\"The Magistrates Act authorizes district courts to appoint magistrate judges to consider pretrial matters without regard to the parties' consent.\u201d); <em>In re U.S. Healthcare, </em>159 F.3d 142, 145 (3d Cir.1998) (\u201cIn general, a magistrate judge, without the consent of the parties, has the power to enter orders which do not dispose of the case.\u201d). Second, we reject the notion that the District Court somehow \"abused\u201d Mr. Lincoln by ostensibly making certain negative remarks about him or otherwise. We note that Mr. Lincoln apparently makes these spurious (and somewhat incoherent) allegations on his own behalf; he does not argue any prejudice to his client, only an affront to his personal sensibilities. In any event, on the record before us Mr. Lincoln's accusations provide no basis for appellate intervention. <em>Cf. Logue v. Dore, </em>103 F.3d 1040, 1047 (1st Cir.1997) (\"[A]ppellate courts review orders and judgments, not judge[s'] statements.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
