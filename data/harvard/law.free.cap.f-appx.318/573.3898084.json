United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). We review sentences for reasonableness; only a procedurally erroneous or substantively unreasonable sentence' will be set aside. <em>United States v. Carty, </em>520 F.3d 984, 993 (9th Cir.2008) (en banc), <em>cert. de</em>nied; - U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 2491, 171 L.Ed.2d 780 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-19\">Defendant asserts that the district court made two procedural errors. First, he argues that the court endorsed improper policy arguments made by the prosecutor regarding a state court proceeding concerning custody of Defendant\u2019s child. The record does not support this assertion, as the court stated that it did not know \u201cwhat\u2019s going to happen in any state proceeding.\u201d The court did not express a view on the merits of the state proceeding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>and did not, as Defendant alleges, impose the sentence in reliance on the government\u2019s assertions about how the state law matter should be decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">Second, Defendant argues that the district court did not adequately explain the sentence. Once a district court settles on an appropriate sentence, it must \u201cadequately explain the chosen sentence to allow for meaningful appellate review.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597. \u201cThe sentencing judge should set forth enough to satisfy the appellate court that he has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising his own legal decision-making authority.\u201d <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2468, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">Here, the district court considered all of the relevant 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors and explained its reasons for imposing the 27-month sentence, rather than the 46-month sentence suggested by the government. It decided ultimately to depart downward five levels because it \u201cwas so impressed with the bonding of this father with a child\u201d and because Defendant had \u201cdemonstrated much more than usual in the concern of a father for a son.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">Finally, Defendant argues that the 27-month sentence is substantively unreasonable. Substantive reasonableness is reviewed \u201cin light of all the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, including the applicable Guidelines range.\u201d <em>United States v. Daniels, </em>541 F.3d 915, 922-23 (9th Cir.2008) (alteration and internal quotation marks omitted). The court took into account that the Guidelines range was 46-57 months, that Defendant had committed criminal acts both before being removed from the United States and after returning to the country, and that Defendant had a very close relationship with his son, who was put up for adoption by the child\u2019s mother after Defendant was arrested. The district court was not required to align the sentence with a fast-track sentence that Defendant had rejected. Because the court reasonably evaluated the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the resulting sentence of 27 months was not unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b598-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
