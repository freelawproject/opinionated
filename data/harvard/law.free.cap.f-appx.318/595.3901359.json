She also argues that there was insufficient evidence to support her conviction and that the sentence imposed by the district court is unreasonable. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">1. The district court\u2019s finding that Holt had voluntarily consented to having her blood drawn as part of the investigation of a fatal vehicle-pedestrian collision involving her Dodge Caravan was not clearly erroneous, and the district court did not err in denying Holt\u2019s motion to suppress that evidence. <em>See United States v. Chischilly, </em>30 F.3d 1144, 1151 (9th Cir.1994); <em>Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, </em>412 U.S. 218, 219, 93 S.Ct. 2041, 36 L.Ed.2d 854 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">2. Nor did the district court abuse its discretion in- admitting the results of the blood draw <em>(viz., </em>that approximately two-and-a-half hours after the collision, Holt\u2019s blood alcohol level was 0.15 mg/100 cc); this evidence tended to show that Holt was under the influence of alcohol at the time of the collision, and was corroborative of other evidence of her intoxication at that time. <em>See United States v. Loera, </em>923 F.2d 725, 727 (9th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-8\">3. Likewise, the district court did not abuse its discretion in excluding expert opinion evidence offered by Holt to show that because of drug and alcohol abuse, the decedent may have been delusional or suicidal at the time of the collision, and thus may have been the proximate cause of his own death. Very little evidence presented at trial corroborated this theory; testimony as to the decedent\u2019s mental state during the evening before his death indicated that he was neither depressed nor suicidal, and as Holt concedes, there were no illegal controlled substances found in the decedent\u2019s bloodstream at the time of the collision.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-11\">4. Holt also attacks the sufficiency of the evidence to prove each of the elements of the offense. Viewing the evidence in this case \u201cin the light most favorable to the prosecution,\u201d we conclude that \u201c \u2018any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the offense[ ] charged beyond a reasonable doubt,\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Rosales, </em>516 F.3d 749, 751-52 (9th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>United States v. Hinton, </em>222 F.3d 664, 669 (9th Cir.2000)), and that Holt\u2019s involuntary manslaughter conviction \u201cdoes not rise to the level of plain error or manifest injustice.\u201d <em>United States v. Singh, </em>532 F.3d 1053, 1061 (9th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-12\">5. Finally, Holt\u2019s assertion that the district court failed to consider all of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors and impose a sentence \u201cthat is sufficient but not greater than necessary to meet the goals of sentencing\u201d lacks merit. The district court explicitly addressed several statutory factors in imposing Holt\u2019s sentence, including \u201cthe nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant\u201d (\u00a7 3553(a)(1)); \u201cthe need for the sentence imposed ... to reflect the seriousness of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense\u201d (\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A)); the need for the sentence \u201cto afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct\u201d (\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(B)); and the kinds of sentence and the sentencing range established for \u201cthe applicable category of offense committed by the applicable category of defendant as set forth\u201d in the federal Sentencing Guidelines (\u00a7 3553(a)(4)(A)). The district court also imposed a term of community service in lieu of a fine, implicitly taking into account \u201cthe kinds of sentences available\u201d (\u00a7 3553(a)(3)), and imposed a $3,000 restitution obligation, reflecting its consideration of \u201cthe need to provide restitution to any victims of the offense\u201d (\u00a7 3553(a)(7)). Of course,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-4\">The district court need not tick off each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors to show that it has considered them. We assume that district judges know the law and understand their obligation to consider all of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, not just the Guidelines. <em>See Walton v. Arizona, </em>497 U.S. 639, 653, 110 S.Ct. 3047, 111 L.Ed.2d 511 (1990) (\u201cTrial judges are presumed to know the law and to apply it in making their decisions.\u201d), <em>overruled on other grounds by Ring v. Arizona, </em>536 U.S. 584, 609, 122 S.Ct. 2428, 153 L.Ed.2d 556 (2002). Nor need the district court articulate in a vacuum how each \u00a7 3553(a) factor influences its determination of an appropriate sentence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-5\"><em>United States v. Carty, </em>520 F.3d 984, 992 (9th Cir.2008) (en banc), cert. denied, \u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 2491, 171 L.Ed.2d 780 (2008). Recalling that \u201conly a procedurally erroneous or substantively unreasonable sentence will be set aside,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 993, on this record we can identify no procedural error or substantive basis for concluding that the sentence imposed was unreasonable under all of the circumstances of this case. We thus conclude that Holt\u2019s sentence is reasonable, and we affirm it in all respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-11\">RAWLINSON, Circuit Judge, concurring:</p>\n<p id=\"b622-12\">I concur in the result.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b621-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
